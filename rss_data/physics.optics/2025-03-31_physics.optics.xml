      <title>Epitaxial growth of KTiOAsO4 by pulsed laser deposition for nonlinear frequency conversion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.22859</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.22859v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Twin photons and triple photons generations require pump laser intensities of several hundred Mega Watts per square centimeter. Micrometer sized crystalline waveguides allow such interactions to be achieved at relatively low energies by taking advantage of the confinement of light. The materials selected to achieve these phenomena in the present work are from the titanyl phosphate family. The chosen architecture is a micrometric layer of KTA grown on a KTP substrate forming a planar waveguide in a first step. These two isostructural materials have a low lattice parameter mismatch, making it possible to achieve high quality epitaxial growth. The refractive index of KTA being higher than that of KTP, this couple of materials could allow light to be guided in the deposited layer. To grow the KTA film, the chosen technique is pulsed laser deposition (PLD) that allows nonlinear complex oxides layer of optical quality to be grown. In this study, we show that the growth is well oriented for layers with a thickness up to 200 nm after deposition. Then, after annealing, the crystal state is improved as well as the surface. In this study we demonstrate the feasibility of KTA epitaxy over KTP by PLD with good epitaxial quality, good orientation and theoretical phase-matching conditions for a planar KTA waveguide.</description>

      <title>Plasmon-Assisted Random Lasing of Perovskite Materials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.22868</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.22868v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Random lasing occurs as the result of coherent optical feedback from random scattering centers. Plasmonic nanostructures, such as silver or gold nanoparticles, efficiently scatter light due to the formation of hot spots and optical confinement at the nanoscale. In this work, using silver nanocubes as highly efficient light scattering centers, a broad band plasmon assisted lasing action of halide perovskite materials is demonstrated. By embedding silver nanocubes in CH3NH3PbBr3 and CH3NH3PbI3 solutions, narrow bandwidth lasing modes with a full width at half-maximum of approximately 1 nm are supported. It is observed that the lasing thresholds of perovskites are different for glass and gold substrates, and for different nanocube concentrations. Results of time-resolved measurements indicate a significant shortening in the decay time of the emission at above the lasing threshold, implying a stimulated emission process. The results of this work thus provide a pathway to generate coherent light sources from widely studied perovskite materials.</description>

      <title>Bound states in the continuum in a chain of coupled Mie resonators with structural disorder: theory and experiment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.23080</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.23080v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the impact of structural disorder on a radiative lifetime of symmetry-protected bound state in the continuum (BIC) and a bright mode in a one-dimensional periodic chain of coupled Mie resonators. Through experimental, simulation, and theoretical approach, we reveal an unusual linear decay in the radiative quality factor of the BIC with the increase of the disorder amplitude, contrasting with the quadratic decay observed in recent studies. We also investigate modes with different symmetries and show that the behavior of the quality factor in a strongly disordered system depends on the mode's multipolar origin. Our findings are pivotal for the practical application of BICs, particularly in natural and self-assembled photonic structures where structural disorder plays a crucial role.</description>

      <title>Reducing Artifacts in Grating Interferometry Using Multiple Harmonics and Phase Step Corrections</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.23148</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.23148v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: X-ray interferometry is an emerging imaging modality with a wide variety of potential clinical applications, including lung and breast imaging, as well as in non-destructive testing, such as additive manufacturing and porosimetry. A grating interferometer uses a diffraction grating to produce a periodic interference pattern and measures how a patient or sample perturbs the pattern, producing three unique images that highlight X-ray absorption, refraction, and small angle scattering, known as the transmission, differential-phase, and dark-field images, respectively. Image artifacts that are unique to X-ray interferometry are introduced when assuming the fringe pattern is perfectly sinusoidal and the phase steps are evenly spaced. Inaccuracies in grating position, coupled with multi-harmonic fringes, lead to remnant oscillations and phase wraparound artifacts. We have developed an image recovery algorithm that uses additional harmonics, direct relative phase fitting, and phase step corrections to prevent them. The direct relative phase fitting removes the phase wraparound artifact. Correcting the phase step positions and introducing the additional harmonic removes the grating remnant artifact present in the transmission, differential-phase, and dark-field images. By modifying existing algorithms, the fit to the fringe pattern is greatly improved and artifacts are minimized, as we demonstrate with the imaging of several samples, including PMMA microspheres, ex vivo formalin fixed mouse lungs, and porous alumina.</description>

      <title>Nonreciprocity and unidirectional invisibility in three optical modes with non-Markovian effects</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.23169</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.23169v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, we construct three coupled optical modes systems to obtain effective Hamiltonian mediated by coherent dissipative coupling during adiabatic elimination of large dissipation mode. We investigate the cooperative effect of coherent and dissipative photon-photon couplings in an open cavity system, which leads to nonreciprocity with a considerably large isolation ratio and flexible controllability. We discover unidirectional invisibility for electromagnetic wave propagation, which appears at the zero-damping condition (ZDC) for hybrid photon-photon modes and obtain transmission spectrum on the ZDC. We study the influences of the parameters on the nonreciprocal transmission of the system to capture the generic physics of the interference between coherent and dissipative couplings, which accurately reproduces the results of numerical simulation over a broad range of parameters. Moreover, we extend the study of nonreciprocal transmission with the Markovian approximation to the non-Markovian environments, which consist of a collection of oscillators (bosonic photonic modes) and give the adiabatic elimination method with non-Markovian effects. We illustrate that nonreciprocal transmission on ZDC exhibits a crossover from the non-Markovian to the Markovian regimes by controlling the environmental spectral width. This indicates a promising way to enhance or steer quantum nonreciprocal devices in optical cavities and provides potential applications for precision measurements and optical communications with non-Markovian effects.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.23195</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.23195v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, the paraxial version of Maxwell equations is derived with the use of two Riemann-Silberstein vectors. Exact solutions of these equations are then obtained representing the paraxial electromagnetic fields. These fields satisfy the full Maxwell equations up to the order of $(\lambda/w_0)^2$. The solutions contain some additional terms, which turn out to be relevant for polarization, especially in the case of beams endowed with orbital angular momentum.</description>

      <title>Momentum, spin, and orbital angular momentum of electromagnetic, acoustic, and water waves</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.23235</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.23235v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Waves of various types carry momentum, which is associated with their propagation direction, i.e., the phase gradient. The circulation of the wave momentum density gives rise to orbital angular momentum (AM). Additionally, for waves described by vector fields, local rotation of the wavefield produces spin AM (or simply, spin). These dynamical wave properties become particularly significant in structured (i.e., inhomogeneous) wavefields. Here we provide an introduction and overview of the momentum and AM properties for a variety of classical waves: electromagnetic, sound, elastic, plasma waves, and water surface waves. A unified field-theory approach, based on Noether's theorem, offers a general framework to describe these diverse physical systems, encompassing longitudinal, transverse, and mixed waves with different dispersion characteristics. We also discuss observable manifestations of the wave momentum and AM providing clear physical interpretations of the derived quantities.</description>

      <title>Single Ultrabright Fluorescent Silica Nanoparticles Can Be Used as Individual Fast Real-Time Nanothermometers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.23264</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.23264v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Optical-based nanothermometry represents a transformative approach for precise temperature measurements at the nanoscale, which finds versatile applications across biology, medicine, and electronics. The assembly of ratiometric fluorescent 40 nm nanoparticles designed to serve as individual nanothermometers is introduced here. These nanoparticles exhibit unprecedented sensitivity (11% /K) and temperature resolution 128 \, \mathrm{K} \cdot \mathrm{Hz}^{-1/2} \cdot \mathrm{W} \cdot \mathrm{cm}^{-2}, outperforming existing optical nanothermometers by factors of 2-6 and 455, respectively. The enhanced performance is attributed to the encapsulation of fluorescent molecules with high density inside the mesoporous matrix. It becomes possible after incorporating hydrophobic groups into the silica matrix, which effectively prevents water ingress and dye leaking. A practical application of these nanothermometers is demonstrated using confocal microscopy, showcasing their ability to map temperature distributions accurately. This methodology is compatible with any fluorescent microscope capable of recording dual fluorescent channels in any transparent medium or on a sample surface. This work not only sets a new benchmark for optical nano-thermometry but also provides a relatively simple yet powerful tool for exploring thermal phenomena at the nanoscale across various scientific domains.</description>

Abstract: Facing the physical limitations and energy consumption bottlenecks of traditional electronic devices, we propose an innovative design framework integrating evolutionary algorithms and metasurface technology, aiming to achieve intelligent inverse design of photonic devices. Based on a constructed high-dimensional evolutionary algorithm framework, a four-layer metasurface cascade regulation system was developed to realize the full optical physical expression of half-adder logic functions. This algorithm enables global optimization of 10000 unit parameters and can be extended to the design of more complex functional devices,thereby promoting goal-oriented and functional customization development</description>

      <title>Observation of doubly-degenerate topological flatbands of edge states in strained graphene</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.23347</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.23347v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Flat bands are of significant interest due to their potential for energy confinement and their ability to enable strongly correlated physics. Incorporating topology into flatband systems further enhances flatband mode robustness against perturbations. Here, we present the first realization of doubly degenerate topological flatbands of edge states in chiral-symmetric strained graphene. The flatband degeneracy stems from Dirac point merging, achieved by tuning the coupling ratios in a honeycomb lattice with twig boundary conditions. The nontrivial topology of these modes is characterized by the winding of the Berry connection, which ensures their robustness against disorder. Experimentally, two types of topological edge states are observed in a strained photonic graphene lattice, consistent with numerical simulations. Moreover, the degeneracy of the topological flatbands doubles the density of states for zero-energy modes, facilitating the formation of compact edge states and enhancing control over edge states and light confinement. Our findings underscore the interplay among lattice geometry, symmetry, and topology in shaping doubly degenerate topological flatbands. This opens new possibilities for advancements in correlated effects, nonlinear optical phenomena, and efficient energy transfer in materials science, photonic crystals, and quantum devices.</description>

      <title>Solving the inverse problem for the design of omnidirectional lenses with an ultimately high numerical aperture</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.23392</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.23392v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce a new type of lens that focuses a plane wave into a spherical one, where light comes from all directions. Our method also suggests the design of ideal optical tweezers or, in the reverse direction, photo-detection of nearly all of the light emitted from an omnidirectional source. Our design trades off simple isotropic non-magnetic materials for requiring a high refractive index. Despite many challenges, we believe that our proposed lens can evolve, with optimization and some help from conventional lenses, to fabricable lenses that will help in boosting collection efficiency of photons in ion-photon quantum experiments.</description>

      <title>Comparative analysis of optical rectification-based multicycle terahertz pulse generation techniques</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.23411</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.23411v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Numerical investigations of multicycle terahertz pulse generation based on wafer stack and tilted pulse front pumped lithium niobate setups concerning the conversion efficiency and the resulting temporal shape and spectrum were performed. Pumping by Fourier-limited-, chirped-, and intensity-modulated pulses, as well as pulse sequences was considered. Wafer stacks give a maximum efficiency when the pump pulse duration is 0.243 times the temporal period of the generated THz pulse. In wafer stacks, increasing the number of pulses in a sequence drastically increases the efficiency. A five-period wafer stack tailored for a 0.15 THz frequency achieves a maximum efficiency of almost 0.1% when pumped by a single, 1.5 ps pulse with an intensity of 100 GW$^2$/cm$^2$, and 0.3% when pumped by a sequence of five pulses. In a similar wafer stack of 10 periods, the efficiency with the same pulse sequence reaches 0.7%. For a large pump pulse number, the efficiency increase approaches a factor equal to the number of wafer pairs. For a given number of THz cycles, the highest efficiency is obtained when the number of wafer stack periods and pump pulses are equal to half the number of cycles. For relatively small cycle numbers, tilted-pump-front setups were found to yield the highest conversion efficiencies.</description>

      <title>Controlling Competing Feedback Mechanisms for Programmable Patterns via Nonlinear Laser Lithography</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.23474</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.23474v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Controlling laser-induced pattern formation remains a long-standing challenge. A key advance was recognising the pivotal role of intrinsic feedback mechanisms in self-organisation, which enabled self-similar patterns with long-range order through nonlinear laser lithography. This concept was recently leveraged to surpass the diffraction limit. However, the demonstrated structures are relatively simple and material-specific, as they rely on a single assumed formation mechanism for each material. Here, we reveal the previously unknown coexistence of competing feedback mechanisms that drive distinct chemical and ablative processes, resulting in patterns with different symmetries. We show that one mechanism can be selectively activated, while completely suppressing the other, by tuning the laser parameters independently of the material. The competing mechanisms break surface symmetries in distinct lateral and vertical directions, and the selection can be dynamically inverted in situ, leading to rich surface chemistries and morphologies. We demonstrate the potential for applications through the maskless and ambient-air fabrication of complex composite patterns on diverse materials and substrates. These include seamlessly stitched superhydrophilic and superhydrophobic domains, structural colour, and a holographic temperature sensor. Combining programmable mechanism selection with recent demonstrations of sub-10 nm features could enable the maskless fabrication of composite structures that rival the capabilities of top-down nanofabrication techniques.</description>

      <title>Strongly coupled photonic molecules as doubly-coupled oscillators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.23546</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.23546v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, we present a first-principles theoretical model of strongly coupled photonic molecules composed of interacting dielectric cavities. We demonstrate the predictive power of this model, illustrating the ability to compute supermode eigenfrequencies, field profiles, and mode volumes, given only knowledge of the individual cavity mode profiles and dielectric background, without expensive electromagnetic simulations on the composite structure or numerical fitting. While our model affirms the phenomenological approach of modeling coupled cavity modes as simple coordinate-coupled oscillators in the weak coupling regime, we show that this intuition remarkably breaks down for strong coupling. Instead, we demonstrate that strongly coupled cavity modes are analogous to harmonic oscillators we term as doubly coupled, with interactions via electric and magnetic fields appearing as independent coordinate-coordinate and momentum-momentum couplings, respectively. We show that this distinction is not merely cosmetic, but gives rise to observable properties while providing deep insights into the physical mechanism behind previously observed phenomena, such as coupling induced frequency shifts. Finally, we illustrate that the complex interplay of these dual couplings suggests the possibility to realize exotic phenomena that typically only occur in the ultrastrong coupling regime, here predicted to emerge for comparably modest mode splittings within a regime we term pseudo-ultrastrong coupling.</description>

      <title>Tuning Coherent Light Generation in 2D Semiconductors with Strong Laser Fields</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.23613</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.23613v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Light generation through optical harmonics plays a pivotal role in photonics, driving innovations in coherent light sources, biological imaging, and spectroscopy. Traditional methods for tuning optical harmonics, including electrostatic gating, are inherently slow, presenting a bottleneck for the performance of integrated photonic devices. While all-optical schemes offer faster tuning, they often rely on resonant excitation, limiting tunability to the relatively long lifetimes of excited electronic states. Here, we demonstrate a novel approach for all-optical control of harmonic generation in two-dimensional semiconductors by using strong, non-resonant laser pulses, with electric field amplitudes approaching 109 V/m. By harnessing the quantum-mechanical coupling of virtual excitons (electron-hole pairs) with photons below resonance, we achieve precise spectral and amplitude control of second- and third-harmonic generation. Additionally, the spectral tunability reaches Terahertz rates, limited by the control beam's pulse duration and multiphoton absorption. These results open new avenues for the development of tunable, compact coherent light sources and ultrafast information processing.</description>

      <title>Simultaneously generating Brillouin microlaser and second harmonic within a lithium niobate microdisk</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.23706</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.23706v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We report the simultaneous generation of second-harmonic generation (SHG) and Brillouin microlaser in a high-quality thin-film lithium niobate (TFLN) microdisk resonator. The microdisk is fabricated with ultrahigh-Q factor of 4X10(6) by photolithography-assisted chemo-mechanical etching, enabling significant cavity-enhancement effect for boosting nonlinear frequency conversion. Under 1559.632 nm pumping, Brillouin microlaser is demonstrated in the microdisk with Stokes Brillouin shift of 10 GHz, a low threshold of 1.81 mW, and a fundamental linewidth of 254.365 Hz. Meanwhile, efficient SHG is observed at 779.816 nm with an absolute conversion efficiency of 3.8% at pump level of 3.028 mW. The coexistence of these two nonlinear processes is enabled by the simultaneous confinement of the light and acoustic fileds for effect coupling in the microdisk, which enhances both optomechanical and second-order nonlinear interactions. This research provides new possibilities for integrated multi-frequency laser sources and multifunctional nonlinear photonic devices.</description>

      <title>Compact orbital-angular-momentum multiplexing via laser-written glass chips</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.23719</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.23719v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Orbital angular momentum (OAM) modes have emerged as a promising solution for enhancing the capacity of optical multiplexing systems, leveraging their theoretically unbounded set of orthogonal spatial modes. However, the generation and detection of OAM multiplexing signals are predominantly reliant on bulky optical components within complex optical setups. We introduce a compact solution for OAM information processing using laser-written glass chips, facilitating efficient multiplexing and demultiplexing of multiple OAM information channels. During the multiplexing process, OAM channels are managed via laser-scribed single-mode waveguides within a glass chip, with their modes converted using laser-written holograms on the side wall of the glass chip. The reverse optical process is employed for OAM demultiplexing. Our chips seamlessly interface with commercial optical fibers, ensuring compatibility with existing fiber-optic communication infrastructure. This work not only establishes a novel approach for OAM optical multiplexing but also underscores the potential of laser-writing technology in advancing photonics and its practical applications in optical communications.</description>

      <title>Realization of a non-Hermitian Haldane model in circuits</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.23737</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.23737v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Haldane model is the simplest yet most powerful topological lattice model exhibiting various phases, including the Dirac semimetal phase and the anomalous quantum Hall phase (also known as the Chern insulator). Although considered unlikely to be physically directly realizable in condensed matter systems, it has been experimentally demonstrated in other physical settings such as cold atoms, where Hermiticity is usually preserved. Extending this model to the non-Hermitian regime with energy non-conservation can significantly enrich topological phases that lack Hermitian counterparts; however, such exploration remains experimentally challenging due to the lack of suitable physical platforms. Here, based on electric circuits, we report the experimental realization of a genuine non-Hermitian Haldane model with asymmetric next-nearest-neighbor hopping. We observe two previously uncovered phases: a non-Hermitian Chern insulator and a non-Hermitian semimetal phase, both exhibiting boundary-dependent amplifying or dissipative chiral edge states. Our work paves the way for exploring non-Hermiticity-induced unconventional topological phases in the Haldane model.</description>

      <title>Light-Driven Skyrmion Crystal Generation in Plasmonic Metasurfaces Through the Inverse Faraday Effect</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.23800</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.23800v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Skyrmions are topological structures defined by a winding vector configuration that yields a quantized topological charge. In magnetic materials, skyrmions manifest as stable, mobile spin textures, positioning them at the forefront of spintronics research. Meanwhile, their optical counterparts unlock new possibilities for manipulating and directing light at the nanoscale. Exploring the territories where magnetism and optics meet therefore holds immense promise for ultrafast control over magnetic processes. Here, we report the generation of a skyrmion-topological lattice through the inverse Faraday effect in a plasmonic metasurface. Specifically, a hexagonal array of gold nanodisks induces unidirectional drift photocurrents in each nanodisk, while counterpropagating phantom currents arise in the hexagonal interstices. This interplay creates a lattice of skyrmionic magnetic textures. Crucially, the all optical, large scale formation of skyrmions potentially at ultrafast timescales offers a pathway for integrating these topological spin textures into magnetic materials, laying the groundwork for next-generation data storage and processing technologies.</description>

      <title>Deterministic Bottom-Up Fabrication of Plasmonic Nanostructures on Optical Nanofibers via Blurred Electron Beam Deposition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.23916</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.23916v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study introduces a novel method for the deterministic fabrication of metallic nanostructures with controlled geometry and composition on suspended, single mode tapered optical nanofibers (TNFs) using a tailored Blurred Electron Beam Induced Deposition (BEBID) technique. TNFs, owing to their subwavelength diameters and intense evanescent fields, offer a unique platform for enhanced light matter interactions at the nanoscale. However, their mechanical fragility has thus far hindered the integration of plasmonic structures using conventional high energy deposition methods. BEBID addresses this limitation by deliberately defocusing the electron beam to reduce local mechanical stress, minimize vibration, and prevent fiber damage during deposition, thereby enabling the one-step growth of platinum nanopillars with sub 20 nm spatial precision and high structural fidelity directly on suspended TNFs. The fabricated structures were characterized using SEM, EDX, and their optical properties were investigated through broadband scattering spectra and polarization resolved measurements, showing strong agreement with Finite Difference Time Domain (FDTD) simulations. Numerical modeling further reveals that ordered arrays of nanopillars can shape and direct the scattered field along the fiber axis, enabling directional emission. This work establishes BEBID as a versatile bottom up nanofabrication approach for functional photonic architectures on fragile substrates, with direct applications in quantum photonics, nano optics, and on fiber plasmonic sensing.</description>

      <title>Beijing Normal University 12 meter Interferometric kHz GW Detector Prototype</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.24178v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Gravitational wave (GW) astronomy has opened a new window into the universe, enabling the study of extreme astrophysical phenomena that are otherwise obscured in traditional electromagnetic observations. While global efforts have predominantly focused on low- and mid-frequency GW detection, the high-frequency regime, particularly in the kilohertz (kHz) range, remains underexplored despite its potential to reveal critical insights into compact binary mergers, neutron star physics, and other exotic astrophysical sources. In this context, the Beijing Normal University (BNU) prototype represents a pioneering effort to develop a dedicated kHz GW detector. Featuring a 12-meter L-shaped resonator within a two-arm vacuum system, the BNU prototype is designed to test innovative configurations and address key technical challenges for kHz GW detection. Beyond its primary focus on being a technology testbed and demonstrator for kHz detection, the prototype is also being evaluated for its own sensitivity in the megahertz (MHz) range, offering the potential to explore even higher-frequency signals from e.g., primordial black holes and geontropic fluctuations. This paper provides a comprehensive overview of the BNU prototype, detailing its design, key components, and scientific objectives.</description>

      <title>Visible optical vortices measured with bulk lateral shearing interferometry</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.24218v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Ultrafast pulse optical vortices are spatiotemporal structures with a diverse range of applications. There are different ways to generate them, often restricted to a wavelength range. Likewise, characterization techniques frequently possess similar limitations. In this work, we first generate ultrashort optical vortices in the near infrared from Ti:sapphire laser pulses by means of structured waveplates and beam manipulation. Then, we produce the visible vortices through up-conversion using a second-harmonic generation crystal. The resulting beams require spatiotemporal characterization, which are performed by bulk lateral shearing interferometry. The reference pulse is temporally characterized with the amplitude swing technique. In this manner, we present the generation of these pulses in the visible range, which are experimentally validated, and demonstrate that bulk lateral shearing interferometry can be used for pulsed beams across widely different spectral regions with the same setup. This finding is significant for future applications of the technique with various sources.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.24356v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The ever-increasing data demand craves advancements in high-speed and energy-efficient computing hardware. Analog optical neural network (ONN) processors have emerged as a promising solution, offering benefits in bandwidth and energy consumption. However, existing ONN processors exhibit limited computational parallelism, and while certain architectures achieve high parallelism, they encounter serious scaling roadblocks for large-scale implementation. This restricts the throughput, latency, and energy efficiency advantages of ONN processors. Here, we introduce a spatial-wavelength-temporal hyper-multiplexed ONN processor that supports high data dimensionality, high computing parallelism and is feasible for large-scale implementation, and in a single time step, a three-dimensional matrix-matrix multiplication (MMM) optical tensor processor is demonstrated. Our hardware accelerates convolutional neural networks (CNNs) and deep neural networks (DNNs) through parallel matrix multiplication. We demonstrate benchmark image recognition using a CNN and a subsequently fully connected DNN in the optical domain. The network works with 292,616 weight parameters under ultra-low optical energy of 20 attojoules (aJ) per multiply and accumulate (MAC) at 96.4% classification accuracy. The system supports broad spectral and spatial bandwidths and is capable for large-scale demonstration, paving the way for highly efficient large-scale optical computing for next-generation deep learning.</description>

      <title>Topological Phase Transition and Geometrical Frustration in Fourier Photonic Simulator</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.24363</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.24363v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: XY models with continuous spin orientation play a pivotal role in understanding topological phase transitions and emergent frustration phenomena, such as superconducting and superfluid phase transitions. However, the complex energy landscapes arising from frustrated lattice geometries and competing spin interactions make these models computationally intractable. To address this challenge, we design a programmable photonic spin simulator capable of emulating XY models with tunable lattice geometries and spin couplings, allowing systematic exploration of their statistical behavior. We experimentally observe the Berezinskii-Kosterlitz-Thouless (BKT) transition in a square-lattice XY model with nearest-neighbor interactions, accurately determining its critical temperature. Expanding to frustrated systems, we implement the approach in triangular and honeycomb lattices, uncovering sophisticated phase transitions and frustration effects, which are consistent with theoretical predictions. This versatile platform opens avenues for probing unexplored XY model phenomena across diverse geometries and interaction schemes, with potential applications in solving complex optimization and machine learning problems.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.24375v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The nature of the transverse orbital angular momentum (tOAM) associated with spatiotemporal optical vortex (STOV) pulses has been the subject of recent debate. We demonstrate that the approaches to tOAM presented in several recent papers are incorrect and lead to unphysical results, including erroneous claims of zero total tOAM. We emphasize the importance of calculating the OAM of any extended physical object at a common instant of time, and reemphasize the special status of the centre of energy as a reference point for all OAM calculations. The theory presented in [Phys. Rev. Lett. 127, 193901 (2021)] is the only correct classical field-based framework that both agrees with experiments and provides a self consistent understanding of transverse OAM in spatiotemporal light fields.</description>

We are interested in the ``scaling'' properties of such potentials, namely, the growth rate of their closed level lines near the percolation threshold. Estimates of the corresponding scaling indices allow, in particular, to carry out some comparison of such potentials with various models of random potentials on the plane.</description>

      <title>The Chirality of Phonons: Definitions, Symmetry Constraints, and Experimental Observation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.22794v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Circularly polarized phonons with nonzero angular momentum (AM), also referred to as chiral phonons, have garnered increasing attention in recent studies. Many existing experimental/theoretical works identify chiral phonons based on pseudo-angular momentum (PAM) or the flipping of the polarization of the circularly polarized light (CPL) in the Raman scattering process. However, the accuracy and universality of these assumptions remain to be verified. Moreover, in condensed matter physics, symmetry strongly governs the scattering and interactions of phonons, quasi-particles, and external fields, profoundly affecting correlated physical phenomena. In this study, we first conduct an in-depth examination of the distinctions and interconnections among AM, PAM, helicity, and atomic motion--key characteristics inherent to chiral phonons--and then undertake a comprehensive study of phonon chirality, as well as their associated physical quantities, and experimental benchmarks under various magnetic point groups. By developing the symmetry-based framework for phonon chirality across magnetic point groups, we demonstrate that identifying chiral phonons solely through nonzero PAM or CPL polarization inversion is inadequate, challenging prior findings. This framework clarifies the relationship between symmetry and phonon chirality, revealing that phonon modes governed by different symmetries exhibit distinct experimental signatures, thereby advancing our understanding of these phenomena. Finally, experiments on five materials with distinct symmetries are conducted to validate our theoretical results. Supported by both theoretical rigor and experimental validation, our study represents a significant step forward in advancing research on symmetry-constrained phonons.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.22817v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: From the nonclassicality of photon superbunching to the basic property of intensity, we characterize light with correlation and coherence functions. The correlation functions for nonstationary sources, such as short pulses, depend deterministically on the time dependent shape of the field and change the probability of the ensemble in time. We start from the fundamental principles of detection and show how nonstationary fields result in a coherence function that depends not only on the statistics of the field but also on the field shape. This means that observations of bunching and superbunching with ultrafast sources are not indicative of the quantum state of the field.</description>

Abstract: The scanning electron microscope (SEM) delivers high resolution, high depth of focus and an image quality as if microscopic objects are seen by the naked eye. This makes it not only a powerful scientific instrument, but a tool inherently applicable to nearly all fields of study and curiosity involving the small scale. However, SEMs have remained complex, expensive, and beyond the reach of many. To broaden access, we demonstrate an SEM using simple, low-cost, off-the-shelf components, and hobby-level electromechanics; this has been enabled by a unique thermionic electron source based on a carbon nanotube array excited by low optical power. The instrument offers sub-micrometer resolution, a depth of focus of several hundred micrometers, and an image quality comparable to commercial SEMs; it also tolerates poor vacuum and moist specimens, making it broadly applicable. It has a flexible design that lends itself to easy customization for different use scenarios. We provide the conceptual approach and high-level design in this paper; the detailed blueprints of our specific implementation will be provided separately online. We hope that specialists and non-specialists alike will build variations that fit their own needs and interests, helping electron microscopy expand into diverse new sectors of society and industry.</description>

      <title>Boosting classical and quantum nonlinear processes in ultrathin van der Waals materials</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.23075v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Understanding and controlling nonlinear processes is crucial for engineering light-matter interaction and generating non-classical light. A significant challenge in ultra-thin nonlinear materials is the marked diminution of the nonlinear conversion efficiency due to the reduced light-matter interaction length and, in many cases, the centrosymmetric crystalline structures. Here we relax these limitations and report a giant boost of classical and quantum nonlinear processes in ultrathin van der Waals materials. Specifically, with a metal-nonlinear material heterostructure we enhance classical second-harmonic generation in h-BN flakes by two-orders of magnitude. Moreover, we have engineered a metal-SiO2-nonlinear material heterostructure resulting in a remarkable two orders of magnitude augmentation of the quantum spontaneous parametric down-conversion (SPDC) in NbOCl2 flakes. Notably, we demonstrate SPDC in a 16 nm-thick NbOCl2 flake integrated into the proposed structure. These findings simplify on-chip quantum state engineering and accelerate the use of van der Waals materials in nonlinear optoelectronics.</description>

      <title>Symmetric and Asymmetric Quantum Rabi Model</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.23160v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce a modified Jaynes-Cummings model with single-photon cavity radiation field but with the atomic system instead of exchanging a single photon as in the Jaynes-Cummings model, it exchanges instead a squeezed photon. After a unitary transformation and requiring the decoupling of the spin up from the spin down, we diagonalize the resulting Hamiltonian via a Bogoliubov transformation. This allows to determine the energy eigenvalues for the quantum Rabi model. We obtain the energy eigenvalues albeit for the asymmetric Rabi model in the limit of large coupling strength, where it approaches the symmetric Rabi model energy eigenvalues.</description>

      <title>Complex Berry phase and steady-state geometric amplification in non-Hermitian systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.23197</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.23197v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Understanding and controlling the dynamics of coupled oscillators is important for a wide range of scientific and technological endeavors. Two concepts that have generated new insights into this topic are Berry phase (oscillators' memory of how they have been tuned) and non-Hermiticity (damping and its often counter-intuitive consequences). Here we describe measurements of the interplay between these two phenomena that highlight the qualitative changes they induce in each other. In particular, non-Hermiticity changes the Berry phase from a real to a complex number, opening new avenues for controlling the flow of energy in oscillators. We illustrate this by demonstrating a broadly applicable means for converting a system's intrinsic damping into a novel form of amplification.</description>

      <title>Non-classical optimization through complex media</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.24283v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Optimization approaches are ubiquitous in physics. In optics, they are key to manipulating light through complex media, enabling applications ranging from imaging to photonic simulators. In most demonstrations, however, the optimization process is implemented using classical coherent light, leading to a purely classical solution. Here we introduce the concept of optical non-classical optimization in complex media. We experimentally demonstrate the control and refocusing of non-classical light -- namely, entangled photon pairs -- through a scattering medium by directly optimizing the output coincidence rate. The optimal solutions found with this approach differ from those obtained using classical optimization, a result of entanglement in the input state. Beyond imaging, this genuinely non-classical optimization method has potential to tackle complex problems, as we show by simulating a spin-glass model with multi-spin interactions.</description>

      <title>All-optical modulation with single-photons using electron avalanche</title>

      <description>arXiv:2312.11686v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The distinctive characteristics of light, such as high-speed and low-loss propagation, low cross-talk and low power consumption, along with photons unique quantum properties, make it most suitable for various applications in communication, high-resolution imaging, optical computing, and emerging quantum information technologies. One limiting factor, though, is the weak optical nonlinearity of conventional media that poses challenges for the control of light with ultra-low intensities. In this work, we demonstrate all-optical modulation enabled by electron avalanche process in silicon, using a control beam with single-photon light intensities. The observed process corresponds to a record-high nonlinear refractive index of $n_{2}$~$1.3*10^{-2} m^2/W$, which is several orders of magnitude higher than the best known nonlinear optical materials. Our approach opens the possibility of gigahertz-speed, and potentially even faster, optical switching at the single-photon level, which could enable a family of novel on-chip photonic and quantum devices operating at room temperature.</description>

      <title>Diffusion-driven lensless fiber endomicroscopic quantitative phase imaging towards digital pathology</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.18456</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.18456v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Lensless fiber endomicroscope is an emerging tool for in-vivo microscopic imaging, where quantitative phase imaging (QPI) can be utilized as a label-free method to enhance image contrast. However, existing single-shot phase reconstruction methods through lensless fiber endomicroscope typically perform well on simple images but struggle with complex microscopic structures. Here, we propose a speckle-conditioned diffusion model (SpecDiffusion), which reconstructs phase images directly from speckles captured at the detection side of a multi-core fiber (MCF). Unlike conventional neural networks, SpecDiffusion employs iterative phase denoising steps for speckle-driven phase reconstruction. The iteration scheme allows SpecDiffusion to break down the phase reconstruction process into multiple steps, gradually building up to the final phase image. This attribute alleviates the computation challenge at each step and enables the reconstruction of rich details in complex microscopic images. To validate its efficacy, we build an optical system to capture speckles from MCF and construct a dataset consisting of 100,000 paired images. SpecDiffusion provides high-fidelity phase reconstruction results and shows powerful generalization capacity for unseen objects, such as test charts and biological tissues, reducing the average mean absolute error of the reconstructed tissue images by 7 times. Furthermore, the reconstructed tissue images using SpecDiffusion shows higher accuracy in zero-shot cell segmentation tasks compared to the conventional method, demonstrating the potential for further cell morphology analysis through the learning-based lensless fiber endomicroscope. SpecDiffusion offers a precise and generalized method to phase reconstruction through scattering media, including MCFs, opening new perspective in lensless fiber endomicroscopic imaging.</description>

      <title>Understanding multi-layered transmission matrices</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.23864v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Transmission matrices, mapping the propagation of light from one end of the tissue to the other, form an important mathematical tool in the analysis of tissue scattering and the design of wavefront shaping systems. To understand the relationship between their content and the volumetric structure of the tissue, we wish to fit them with multi-slice models, composed of a set of planar aberrations spaced throughout the volume. The number of layers used in such a model would largely affect the amount of information compression and the ease in which we can use such layered models in a wavefront-shaping system. This work offers a theoretical study of such multi-layered models. We attempt to understand how many layers are required for a good fit, and how does the approximation degrade when a smaller number of such layers is used. We show analytically that transmission matrices can be well fitted with very sparse layers. This leads to optimistic predictions on our ability to use them to design future wavefront shaping systems which can correct tissue aberration over a wide field-of-view.</description>

Abstract: Attosecond science and frequency metrology rely on the precise measurement and control of the laser pulse waveform, a feat traditionally achieved using optoelectronic techniques. In this study, we conducted a laser-induced acoustic experiment in air ionized by carrier-envelope phase (CEP)-stabilized sub-4 femtosecond pulses. Our results reveal that the acoustic signal exhibits CEP dependence in few-cycle pulses, primarily through amplitude modulation from laser-driven ionization. This novel optoacoustic phenomenon enables not only the measurement of the carrier-envelope offset frequency but also the direct characterization of the waveform of optical pulses through a microphone. Our study highlights the potential of laser-induced acoustic waves for advancing frequency metrology and ultrafast science.</description>

      <title>Inverse Design of 3D Nanophotonic Devices with Structural Integrity Using Auxiliary Thermal Solvers</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.05900v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: 3D additive manufacturing enables the fabrication of nanophotonic structures with subwavelength features that control light across macroscopic scales. Gradient-based optimization offers an efficient approach to design these complex and non-intuitive structures. However, expanding this methodology from 2D to 3D introduces complexities, such as the need for structural integrity and connectivity. This work introduces a multi-objective optimization method to address these challenges in 3D nanophotonic designs. Our method combines electromagnetic simulations with an auxiliary heat-diffusion solver to ensure continuous material and void connectivity. By modeling material regions as heat sources and boundaries as heat sinks, we optimize the structure to minimize the total temperature, thereby penalizing disconnected regions that cannot dissipate thermal loads. Alongside the optical response, this heat metric becomes part of our objective function. We demonstrate the utility of our algorithm by designing two 3D nanophotonic devices. The first is a focusing element. The second is a waveguide junction, which connects two incoming waveguides for two different wavelengths into two outgoing waveguides, which are rotated by 90{\deg} to the incoming waveguides. Our approach offers a design pipeline that generates digital blueprints for fabricable nanophotonic materials, paving the way for practical 3D nanoprinting applications.</description>

      <title>Scalable freeform optimization of wide-aperture 3D metalenses by zoned discrete axisymmetry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.07979</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.07979v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We introduce a novel framework for design and optimization of 3D freeform metalenses that attains nearly linear scaling of computational cost with diameter, by breaking the lens into a sequence of radial "zones" with $n$-fold discrete axisymmetry, where $n$ increases with radius. This allows vastly more design freedom than imposing continuous axisymmetry, while avoiding the compromises of the locally periodic approximation (LPA) or scalar diffraction theory. Using a GPU-accelerated finite-difference time-domain (FDTD) solver in cylindrical coordinates, we perform full-wave simulation and topology optimization within each supra-wavelength zone. We validate our approach by designing millimeter and centimeter-scale, poly-achromatic, 3D freeform metalenses which outperform the state of the art. By demonstrating the scalability and resulting optical performance enabled by our "zoned discrete axisymmetry" (ZDA) and supra-wavelength domain decomposition, we highlight the potential of our framework to advance large-scale meta-optics and next-generation photonic technologies.</description>

      <title>Simultaneous active and diffusive behaviour of asymmetric microclusters in a photophoretic trap</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.16059v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Active and diffusive motion in Brownian particles are regularly observed in fluidic environments, albeit at different time scales. Here, we experimentally study the dynamics of highly asymmetric microclusters trapped in air employing photophoretic forces generated from a loosely focused laser beam, where the trapped particles display active and diffusive dynamics simultaneously in orthogonal spatial directions. Thus, particle motion in the longitudinal direction ($z$) is enslaved to irregular kicks that naturally arise from an interplay of gravitational and photophoretic forces. This leads to a bimodal nature of the probability distribution function with a near-ballistic scaling of mean-squared displacement in the $z$ direction demonstrating active like dynamics, while the dynamics along the transverse ($x$) direction displays diffusive behaviour with a strong dependence on the motion along $z$. To explain these unique characteristics, we developed a 2D-Langevin model of a confined elliptic particle experiencing an additional stochastic force along $z$ to account for the arbitrary jumps. The numerical results show excellent qualitative agreement with the experimental observations. Our findings should pave the way for the design of high-efficiency Brownian engines in air, besides stimulating new research in the emerging field of photophoretic trapping.</description>

      <title>Leveraging partial coherence in interferometric microscopy to enhance nanoparticle detection sensitivity and throughput</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.22565v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Interferometric-based microscopies stand as powerful label-free approaches for monitoring and characterising chemical reactions and heterogeneous nanoparticle systems in real time with single particle sensitivity. Nevertheless, coherent artifacts, such as speckle and parasitic interferences, together with limited photon fluxes from spatially incoherent sources, pose an ongoing challenge in achieving both high sensitivity and throughput. In this study, we systematically characterise how partial coherence affects both the signal contrast and the background noise level; thus, it offers a route to improve the signal-to-noise ratio from single nanoparticles (NPs), irrespective of their size and composition; or the light source used. We first validate that lasers can be modified into partially coherent sources with performance matching that of spatially incoherent ones; while providing higher photon fluxes. Secondly, we demonstrate that tuning the degree of partial coherence not only enhances the detection sensitivity of both synthetic and biological NPs, but also affects how signal contrasts vary as a function of the focus position. Finally, we apply our findings to single-protein detection, confirming that these principles extend to differential imaging modalities, which deliver the highest sensitivity. Our results address a critical milestone in the detection of weakly scattering NPs in complex matrices, with wide-ranging applications in biotechnology, nanotechnology, chemical synthesis, and biosensing; ushering a new generation of microscopes that push both the sensitivity and throughput boundaries without requiring beam scanning.</description>

      <title>Optically-biased Rydberg microwave receiver enabled by hybrid nonlinear interferometry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.05310</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.05310v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The coupling of Rydberg vapors medium both to microwave and optical fields allows harnessing the merits of all-optical detection, e.g. weak disruption of the measured field and invulnerability to extremely strong fields, owing to the lack of conventional RF antenna in the detector. The trouble with this approach arises, as the greatest sensitivity is exhibited with the use of additional microwave field acting as a local oscillator, and the measurement can no longer be all-optical. Here we propose a different solution, optical-bias detection, that allows truly all-optical operation, while retaining exceptional sensitivity. We tackle the issue of laser phase noise, emerging in this type of detection, via a simultaneous measurement of the phase spectrum in a nonlinear process and real-time data processing, which overall yields an improvement of $35\ \mathrm{dB}$ in terms of signal-to-noise ratio compared with the basic approach. We report the sensitivity of $176\ \mathrm{nV/cm/\sqrt{Hz}}$ and reliable operation up to $3.5\ \mathrm{mV/cm}$ of $13.9\ \mathrm{GHz}$ electric field. This approach is directly comparable to the state of the art superheterodyne, while retaining the merits of all-optical detection.</description>

      <title>Configurable Holography: Towards Display and Scene Adaptation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.01558v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Emerging learned holography approaches have enabled faster and high-quality hologram synthesis, setting a new milestone toward practical holographic displays. However, these learned models require training a dedicated model for each set of display-scene parameters. To address this shortcoming, our work introduces a highly configurable learned model structure, synthesizing 3D holograms interactively while supporting diverse display-scene parameters. Our family of models relying on this structure can be conditioned continuously for varying novel scene parameters, including input images, propagation distances, volume depths, peak brightnesses, and novel display parameters of pixel pitches and wavelengths. Uniquely, our findings unearth a correlation between depth estimation and hologram synthesis tasks in the learning domain, leading to a learned model that unlocks accurate 3D hologram generation from 2D images across varied display-scene parameters. We validate our models by synthesizing high-quality 3D holograms in simulations and also verify our findings with two different holographic display prototypes. Moreover, our family of models can synthesize holograms with a 2x speed-up compared to the state-of-the-art learned holography approaches in the literature.</description>

      <title>What is the spectral density of the reservoir for a lossy quantized cavity?</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.01855v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: By considering a two-level system weakly coupled to a single lossy three-dimensional cavity mode, and using a quasinormal mode expansion for the photonic medium, we show that the frequency-dependence of the quantum coupling interaction between the cavity and its photonic reservoir can not be simply constructed to be independent of the cavity contents. For the single quantum dipole case, we identify the correct form of the local spectral density, revealing a surprising gauge-dependent $\sim \omega^{\pm 1} prefactor scaling, as well as a spatially-dependent correction. We thus establish the correct quantum form for the cavity-reservoir interaction, which so far has only been worked out rigorously for simple 1D geometries, and show its significant impact on broadband strong coupling.</description>

      <title>Bi-self-trapping of excitons via the long-living phonon mode and their superfluorescent markers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.16874</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.16874v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A dynamic approach based on the multiconfiguration Haqrtree method to description of exciton self-trapping is proposed. Primarily motivated by the phenomenon of room-temperature superfluorescence recently observed in hybrid perovskites at high excitation concentrations we offer the two-step mechanism: formation of two self-trapped excitons entangled via the same long-living phonon mode, and their rearrangement into a superradiating mirror symmetric configuration. In particular, based on the semiclassical equations of motion we examine the criteria for the high-temperature self-trapping and bi-self trapping of excitons. Our findings indicate that the self-trapped excitons are described by the stable phase-locked steady-state solution of the equations of motion, and at elevated exciton concentrations, they compete with the bi-self-trapped excitons. The bi-self-trapped exciton in the mirror-symmetric configuration can be described by the Dicke Hamiltonian and is responsible for superfluorescence. The obtained theoretical spectra are in good agreement with the experimental observation.</description>
