      <title>Performance-Complexity-Latency Trade-offs of Concatenated RS-SDBCH Codes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.08895</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.08895v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Concatenated bit-interleaved and multilevel coded modulation with outer Reed--Solomon codes, inner Chase-algorithm-based soft-decision-decoded Bose--Ray-Chaudhuri--Hocquenghem codes, and four-level pulse amplitude modulation is considered. A semi-analytical formula is derived for estimating the decoded frame error rate (FER) at the output the additive white Gaussian noise channel, obviating the need for time-consuming Monte Carlo simulations. The formula is used to search a large space of codes (including the KP4 code) to find those achieving good trade-offs among performance (measured by the gap to the constrained Shannon limit at $10^{-13}$ FER), complexity (measured by the number of elementary decoder operations), and latency (measured by overall block length).</description>

      <title>Enhanced Secure Transmission of Medical Images through OFDM using Hyperchaotic Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.08916</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.08916v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Orthogonal Frequency Division Multiplexing (OFDM) is a popular modulation technique for transmitting digital data over wireless radio channels, including medical images due to its high transmission capacity, low interference, bandwidth efficiency, and scalability. However, the security of medical images is a major concern, and combining OFDM with encryption techniques such as chaos-based image encryption can enhance security measures. This study proposes a secure medical image transmission system that combines OFDM, 6D hyperchaotic system, and Fibonacci Q-matrix and analyzes its impact on image transmission quality using simulation results obtained through MATLAB. The study examines the Q-PSK constellation diagram, fast Fourier transform (IFFT) signal, cyclic prefix (CP) techniques, NIST, signal noise ratio (SNR), and bit error rate (BER). The results provide insights into the effectiveness of OFDM in securely transmitting high-quality medical images.</description>

      <title>Wireless Federated Learning over UAV-enabled Integrated Sensing and Communication</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.08918</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.08918v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper studies a new latency optimization problem in unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs)-enabled federated learning (FL) with integrated sensing and communication. In this setup, distributed UAVs participate in model training using sensed data and collaborate with a base station (BS) serving as FL aggregator to build a global model. The objective is to minimize the FL system latency over UAV networks by jointly optimizing UAVs' trajectory and resource allocation of both UAVs and the BS. The formulated optimization problem is troublesome to solve due to its non-convexity. Hence, we develop a simple yet efficient iterative algorithm to find a high-quality approximate solution, by leveraging block coordinate descent and successive convex approximation techniques. Simulation results demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed joint optimization strategy under practical parameter settings, saving the system latency up to 68.54\% compared to benchmark schemes.</description>

      <title>The Geometry of Codes for Random Access in DNA Storage</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.08924</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.08924v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Effective and reliable data retrieval is critical for the feasibility of DNA storage, and the development of random access efficiency plays a key role in its practicality and reliability. In this paper, we study the Random Access Problem, which asks to compute the expected number of samples one needs in order to recover an information strand. Unlike previous work, we took a geometric approach to the problem, aiming to understand which geometric structures lead to codes that perform well in terms of reducing the random access expectation (Balanced Quasi-Arcs). As a consequence, two main results are obtained. The first is a construction for $k=3$ that outperforms previous constructions aiming to reduce the random access expectation. The second, exploiting a result from [1], is the proof of a conjecture from [2] for rate $1/2$ codes in any dimension.</description>

      <title>Performance Analysis of uRLLC in scalable Cell-free RAN System</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.09128</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.09128v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: As an essential part of mobile communication systems that beyond the fifth generation (B5G) and sixth generation (6G), ultra reliable low latency communication (uRLLC) places strict requirements on latency and reliability. In recent years, with the improvement of mobile communication network performance, centralized and distributed processing of cell-free mMIMO has been widely studied, and wireless access networks (RAN) have also become a widely studied topic in academia. This paper analyzes the performance of a novel scalable cell-free RAN (CF-RAN) architecture with multiple edge distributed units (EDUs) in the scenario of finite block length. The upper and lower bounds on its spectral efficiency (SE) performance are derived, and the complete set's formula and distributed processing can be used as their two exceptional cases, respectively. Secondly, the paper further considers the distribution of users and large-scale fading models and studies the position distribution of remote radio units (RRUs). It is found that a uniform distribution of RRUs is beneficial for improving the SE of finite block length under specific error rate performance, and RRUs need to be interwoven as much as possible under multiple EDUs. This is different from traditional multi-node clustering centralized collaborative processing. The paper compares the performance of Monte Carlo simulation and multi-RRU clustering group collaborative processing. At the same time, this article verifies the accuracy of the space-time exchange theory in the CF-RAN scenario. Through scalable EDU deployment, a trade-off between latency and reliability can be achieved in practical systems and exchanged with spatial degrees of freedom. This implementation can be seen as a distributed and scalable implementation of the space-time exchange theory.</description>

      <title>Secrecy Energy Efficiency Maximization in IRS-Assisted VLC MISO Networks with RSMA: A DS-PPO approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.09146</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.09146v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper investigates intelligent reflecting surface (IRS)-assisted multiple-input single-output (MISO) visible light communication (VLC) networks utilizing the rate-splitting multiple access (RSMA) scheme. {In these networks,} an eavesdropper (Eve) attempts to eavesdrop on communications intended for legitimate users (LUs). To enhance information security and energy efficiency simultaneously, we formulate a secrecy energy efficiency (SEE) maximization problem. In the formulated problem, beamforming vectors, RSMA common rates, direct current (DC) bias, and IRS alignment matrices are jointly optimized subject to constraints on total power budget, quality of service (QoS) requirements, linear operating region of light emitting diodes (LEDs), and common information rate allocation. Due to the non-convex and NP-hard nature of the formulated problem, we propose a deep reinforcement learning (DRL)-based dual-sampling proximal policy optimization (DS-PPO) approach. {The approach leverages} dual sample strategies and generalized advantage estimation (GAE). In addition, to further simplify the design, we adopt the maximum ratio transmission (MRT) and zero-forcing (ZF) as beamforming vectors in the action space. Simulation results show that the proposed DS-PPO approach outperforms traditional baseline approaches in terms of achievable SEE and significantly improves convergence speed compared to the original PPO approach. Moreover, implementing the RSMA scheme and IRS contributes to overall system performance, {achieving approximately $19.67\%$ improvement over traditional multiple access schemes and $25.74\%$ improvement over networks without IRS deployment.</description>

      <title>STAR-RIS Enabled ISAC Systems: Joint Rate Splitting and Beamforming Optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.09154</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.09154v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper delves into an integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) system bolstered by a simultaneously transmitting and reflecting reconfigurable intelligent surface (STAR-RIS). Within this system, a base station (BS) is equipped with communication and radar capabilities, enabling it to communicate with ground terminals (GTs) and concurrently probe for echo signals from a target of interest. Moreover, to manage interference and improve communication quality, the rate splitting multiple access (RSMA) scheme is incorporated into the system. The signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio (SINR) of the received sensing echo signals is a measure of sensing performance. We formulate a joint optimization problem of common rates, transmit beamforming at the BS, and passive beamforming vectors of the STAR-RIS. The objective is to maximize sensing SINR while guaranteeing the communication rate requirements for each GT. We present an iterative algorithm to address the non-convex problem by invoking Dinkelbach's transform, semidefinite relaxation (SDR), majorization-minimization, and sequential rank-one constraint relaxation (SROCR) theories. Simulation results manifest that the performance of the studied ISAC network enhanced by the STAR-RIS and RSMA surpasses other benchmarks considerably. The results evidently indicate the superior performance improvement of the ISAC system with the proposed RSMA-based transmission strategy design and the dynamic optimization of both transmission and reflection beamforming at STAR-RIS.</description>

      <title>Evaluation of RIS-Enabled B5G/6G Indoor Positioning and Mapping using Ray Tracing Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.09440</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.09440v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A Reconfigurable Intelligent Surface (RIS) can significantly enhance network positioning and mapping, acting as an additional anchor point in the reference system and improving signal strength and measurement diversity through the generation of favorable scattering conditions and virtual line-of-sight paths. In this paper, we present a comprehensive framework aimed at user localization and scatterer position estimation in an indoor environment with multipath effects. Our approach leverages beam sweeping through codebook-based beamforming at an 1-bit RIS to scan the environment, applies signal component extraction mechanisms, and utilizes a super-resolution algorithm for angle-based positioning of both connected users and scatterers. To validate the system's effectiveness, accurate 3D ray tracing models are employed, ensuring the robustness and effectiveness of the proposed approach in practical scenarios.</description>

      <title>Analysis Methodology for Age of Information under Sequence Based Scheduling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.09460</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.09460v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We focus on the Age of Information (AoI) performance in a system where each user generates packets periodically to send to a common access point (AP) for status updating. To avoid heavy overhead, we assume that channel sensing, feedback information from the AP, and time synchronization are not available in the system. We adopt a multi-access scheme called the sequence scheme, where each user is assigned a periodic binary sequence to schedule their transmissions. In our previous work [18], we have thoroughly studied the AoI performance under sequence scheme when the period of schedule sequences, $L$, is equal to the status generating period, $T$. The results can be extended to the case where $T&gt;L$. However, the case of $T&lt;L$ is not covered by [18]. Therefore, in this paper, we concentrate on analyzing the AoI performance in the case of $T&lt;L$, which is more challenging and requires different approaches. We conduct in-depth analysis on this case and develop a mathematical tool based on integer partitions to facilitate the analysis. We derive low-complexity closed-form expressions for two scenarios under $T&lt;L$. Based on the obtained analytical results, we propose an algorithm to optimize the construction parameters of the sequence scheme. Finally, we compare our proposed sequence scheme with two commonly used baselines, and show that our proposed scheme outperforms the baselines in terms of AoI performance while consuming less energy.</description>

      <title>ISAC Super-Resolution Receiver via Lifted Atomic Norm Minimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.09495</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.09495v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper introduces an off-the-grid estimator for integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) systems, utilizing lifted atomic norm minimization (LANM). The key challenge in this scenario is that neither the transmit signals nor the radar-and-communication channels are known. We prove that LANM can simultaneously achieve localization of radar targets and decoding of communication symbols, when the number of observations is proportional to the degrees of freedom in the ISAC systems. Despite the inherent ill-posed nature of the problem, we employ the lifting technique to initially encode the transmit signals. Then, we leverage the atomic norm to promote the structured low-rankness for the ISAC channel. We utilize a dual technique to transform the LANM into an infinite-dimensional search over the signal domain. Subsequently, we use semidefinite relaxation (SDR) to implement the dual problem.
  We extend our approach to practical scenarios where received signals are contaminated by additive white Gaussian noise (AWGN) and jamming signals. Furthermore, we derive the computational complexity of the proposed estimator and demonstrate that it is equivalent to the conventional pilot-aided ANM for estimating the channel parameters. Our simulation experiments demonstrate the ability of the proposed LANM approach to estimate both communication data and target parameters with a performance comparable to traditional radar-only super-resolution techniques.</description>

      <title>Latency Optimization in LEO Satellite Communications with Hybrid Beam Pattern and Interference Control</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.09600</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.09600v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The rapid advancement of low Earth orbit (LEO) satellite communication systems has significantly enhanced global connectivity, offering high-capacity, low-latency services crucial for next-generation applications. However, the dense configuration of LEO constellations poses challenges in resource allocation optimization and interference management, complicating coexistence with other communication systems. To address these limitations, this paper proposes a novel framework for optimizing the beam scheduling and resource allocation in multi-beam LEO systems. To satisfy the uneven terrestrial traffic demand, a hybrid beam pattern is employed to enhance the downlink quality of service and minimize the transmission latency from LEO satellites to ground user terminals. Additionally, a dynamic co-channel interference (CCI) control mechanism is developed to mitigate inter-beam interference within the LEO constellation and limit cross-system interference affecting protected users from other networks. The problem of user-beam-frequency allocation with power optimization is formulated as a mixed-integer dynamic programming model and solved using a low-complexity neural network-based graph generation algorithm. Simulation results show that the proposed approach outperforms the baseline methods of full frequency reuse and single-channel transmission, and highlights the potential for further performance improvement with multi-user transmissions.</description>

      <title>Evaluating 5G Networks for U-Space Applications: Insights from Dense Urban Measurement Campaign</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.09666</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.09666v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper examines the communication performance of unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) in dense urban environments, specifically in Benidorm, Spain. Through a comprehensive measurement campaign, we assessed key performance indicators (KPIs) relating to received signal strength and quality as well as rate across various locations, altitudes, operators, technologies, and frequencies, using different measurement equipment. The results highlight significant challenges, primarily due to the lack of planning for aerial coverage and interference, revealing that current cellular networks may fall short in supporting U-space communication needs. The paper calls for network upgrades to ensure reliable UAV operations in urban airspace, contributing to the integration of UAVS in urban logistics and mobility.</description>

      <title>A Machine Learning based Hybrid Receiver for 5G NR PRACH</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.08919</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.08919v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Random Access is a critical procedure using which a User Equipment (UE) identifies itself to a Base Station (BS). Random Access starts with the UE transmitting a random preamble on the Physical Random Access Channel (PRACH). In a conventional BS receiver, the UE's specific preamble is identified by correlation with all the possible preambles. The PRACH signal is also used to estimate the timing advance which is induced by propagation delay. Correlation-based receivers suffer from false peaks and missed detection in scenarios dominated by high fading and low signal-to-noise ratio. This paper describes the design of a hybrid receiver that consists of an AI/ML model for preamble detection followed by conventional peak detection for the Timing Advance estimation. The proposed receiver combines the Power Delay Profiles of correlation windows across multiple antennas and uses the combination as input to a Neural Network model. The model predicts the presence or absence of a user in a particular preamble window, after which the timing advance is estimated by peak detection. Results show superior performance of the hybrid receiver compared to conventional receivers both for simulated and real hardware-captured datasets.</description>

      <title>Correction of circuit faults in a stacked quantum memory using rank-metric codes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.09173</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.09173v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce a model for a stacked quantum memory made with multi-qubit cells, inspired by multi-level flash cells in classical solid-state drive, and we design quantum error correction codes for this model by generalizing rank-metric codes to the quantum setting. Rank-metric codes are used to correct faulty links in classical communication networks. We propose a quantum generalization of Gabidulin codes, which is one of the most popular family of rank-metric codes, and we design a protocol to correct faults in Clifford circuits applied to a stacked quantum memory based on these codes. We envision potential applications to the optimization of stabilizer states and magic states factories, and to variational quantum algorithms. Further work is needed to make this protocol practical. It requires a hardware platform capable of hosting multi-qubit cells with low crosstalk between cells, a fault-tolerant syndrome extraction circuit for rank-metric codes and an associated efficient decoder.</description>

      <title>Outsourcing Control requires Control Complexity</title>

Abstract: An embodied agent constantly influences its environment and is influenced by it. We use the sensorimotor loop to model these interactions and thereby we can quantify different information flows in the system by various information theoretic measures. This includes a measure for the interaction among the agent's body and its environment, called Morphological Computation. Additionally, we examine the controller complexity by two measures, one of which can be seen in the context of the Integrated Information Theory of consciousness. Applying this framework to an experimental setting with simulated agents allows us to analyze the interaction between an agent and its environment, as well as the complexity of its controller, the brain of the agent. Previous research reveals an antagonistic relationship between the controller complexity and Morphological Computation. A morphology adapted well to a task can reduce the necessary complexity of the controller significantly. This creates the problem that embodied intelligence is correlated with a reduced necessity of a controller, a brain. However, in order to interact well with their surroundings, the agents first have to understand the relevant dynamics of the environment. By analyzing learning agents we observe that an increased controller complexity can facilitate a better interaction between an agent's body and its environment. Hence, learning requires an increased controller complexity and the controller complexity and Morphological Computation influence each other.</description>

      <title>Joint Beamforming Optimization for Active STAR-RIS-Assisted ISAC Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.06064</link>
      <description>arXiv:2308.06064v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we investigate an active simultaneously transmitting and reflecting reconfigurable intelligent surface (STAR-RIS) assisted integrated sensing and communications (ISAC) system, where the dual-function base station (DFBS) operates in full-duplex (FD) mode to provide communication services and performs targets sensing simultaneously. Meanwhile, we consider multiple targets and multiple users scenario as well as the self-interference at the FD DFBS. Through jointly optimizing the DFBS and active STAR-RIS beamforming under different work modes, our purpose is to achieve the maximum communication sum-rate, while satisfying the minimum radar signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio (SINR) constraint, the active STAR-RIS hardware constraints and the total power constraint of DFBS and active STAR-RIS. To tackle the complex non-convex optimization problem formulated, an efficient alternating optimization algorithm is proposed. Specifically, the fractional programming method is first leveraged to turn the original problem into a more tractable one, and subsequently the transformed problem is decomposed into several sub-problems. Next, we develop a derivation method to obtain the closed-form expression of the radar receiving beamforming, and then the DFBS transmit beamforming is optimized under the radar SINR requirement and total power constraints. After that, the active STAR-RIS reflection and transmission beamforming are optimized by majorization minimization, complex circle manifold and convex optimization techniques. Finally, the proposed schemes are conducted through numerical simulations to show their benefits and efficiency.</description>

      <title>Finite-Precision Arithmetic Transceiver for Massive MIMO Systems</title>

      <description>arXiv:2401.13442v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Efficient implementation of massive multiple-input-multiple-output (MIMO) transceivers is essential for the next-generation wireless networks. To reduce the high computational complexity of the massive MIMO transceiver, in this paper, we propose a new massive MIMO architecture using finite-precision arithmetic. First, we conduct the rounding error analysis and derive the lower bound of the achievable rate for single-input-multiple-output (SIMO) using maximal ratio combining (MRC) and multiple-input-single-output (MISO) systems using maximal ratio transmission (MRT) with finite-precision arithmetic. Then, considering the multi-user scenario, the rounding error analysis of zero-forcing (ZF) detection and precoding is derived by using the normal equations (NE) method. The corresponding lower bounds of the achievable sum rate are also derived and asymptotic analyses are presented. Built upon insights from these analyses and lower bounds, we propose a mixed-precision architecture for massive MIMO systems to offset performance gaps due to finite-precision arithmetic. The corresponding analysis of rounding errors and computational costs is obtained. Simulation results validate the derived bounds and underscore the superiority of the proposed mixed-precision architecture to the conventional structure.</description>

      <title>CSI Transfer From Sub-6G to mmWave: Reduced-Overhead Multi-User Hybrid Beamforming</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.10873</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.10873v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Hybrid beamforming is vital in modern wireless systems, especially for massive MIMO and millimeter-wave (mmWave) deployments, offering efficient directional transmission with reduced hardware complexity. However, effective beamforming in multi-user scenarios relies heavily on accurate channel state information, the acquisition of which often requires significant pilot overhead, degrading system performance. To address this and inspired by the spatial congruence between sub-6GHz (sub-6G) and mmWave channels, we propose a Sub-6G information Aided Multi-User Hybrid Beamforming (SA-MUHBF) framework, avoiding excessive use of pilots at mmWave. SA-MUHBF employs a convolutional neural network to predict mmWave beamspace from sub-6G channel estimate, followed by a novel multi-layer graph neural network for analog beam selection and a linear minimum mean-square error algorithm for digital beamforming. Numerical results demonstrate that SA-MUHBF efficiently predicts the mmWave beamspace representation and achieves superior spectrum efficiency over state-of-the-art benchmarks. Moreover, SA-MUHBF demonstrates robust performance across varied sub-6G system configurations and exhibits strong generalization to unseen scenarios.</description>

      <title>Analytical Characterization of the Operational Diversity Order in Fading Channels</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.09336v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We introduce and characterize the operational diversity order (ODO) in fading channels, as a proxy to the classical notion of diversity order at any arbitrary operational signal-to-noise ratio (SNR). Thanks to this definition, relevant insights are brought up in a number of cases: (i) We quantify that in dominant line-of-sight scenarios an increased diversity order is attainable compared to that achieved asymptotically, even in the single-antenna case; (ii) this effect is attenuated, but still visible, in the presence of an additional dominant specular component; (iii) the decay slope in Rayleigh product channels increases very slowly, never fully achieving unitary slope for a finite SNR.</description>

      <title>Stacked Intelligent Metasurfaces for Task-Oriented Semantic Communications</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.15053v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Semantic communication (SemCom) leveraging advanced deep learning (DL) technologies enhances the efficiency and reliability of information transmission. Emerging stacked intelligent metasurface (SIM) with an electromagnetic neural network (EMNN) architecture enables complex computations at the speed of light. In this letter, we introduce an innovative SIM-aided SemCom system for image recognition tasks, where a SIM is positioned in front of the transmitting antenna. In contrast to conventional communication systems that transmit modulated signals carrying the image information or compressed semantic information, the carrier EM wave is directly transmitted from the source. The input layer of the SIM performs source encoding, while the remaining multi-layer architecture constitutes an EMNN for semantic encoding, transforming signals into a unique beam towards a receiving antenna corresponding to the image class. Remarkably, both the source and semantic encoding occur naturally as the EM waves propagate through the SIM. At the receiver, the image is recognized by probing the received signal magnitude across the receiving array. To this end, we utilize an efficient mini-batch gradient descent algorithm to train the transmission coefficients of SIM's meta-atoms to learn the semantic representation of the image. Extensive numerical results verify the effectiveness of utilizing the SIM-based EMNN for image recognition task-oriented SemComs, achieving more than 90\% recognition accuracy.</description>

      <title>RSRP Measurement Based Channel Autocorrelation Estimation for IRS-Aided Wideband Communication</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.00374v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The passive and frequency-flat reflection of IRS, as well as the high-dimensional IRS-reflected channels, have posed significant challenges for efficient IRS channel estimation, especially in wideband communication systems with significant multi-path channel delay spread. To address these challenges, we propose a novel neural network (NN)-empowered framework for IRS channel autocorrelation matrix estimation in wideband orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM) systems. This framework relies only on the easily accessible reference signal received power (RSRP) measurements at users in existing wideband communication systems, without requiring additional pilot transmission. Based on the estimates of channel autocorrelation matrix, the passive reflection of IRS is optimized to maximize the average user received signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) over all subcarriers in the OFDM system. Numerical results verify that the proposed algorithm significantly outperforms existing powermeasurement-based IRS reflection designs in wideband channels.</description>

      <title>Modeling and Optimization for Rotatable Antenna Enabled Wireless Communication</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.08411v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Fluid antenna system (FAS)/movable antenna (MA) has emerged as a promising technology to fully exploit the spatial degrees of freedom (DoFs). In this paper, we propose a new rotatable antenna (RA) model, as a simplified implementation of six-dimensional movable antenna (6DMA), to improve the performance of wireless communication systems. Different from conventional fixed-position antenna (FPA), the proposed RA system can independently and flexibly change the three-dimensional (3D) orientation of each antenna by adjusting its declination angles to achieve desired channel realizations. Specifically, we study an RA-enabled uplink communication system, where the receive beamforming and the declination angles of all RAs are jointly optimized to maximize the minimum signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio (SINR) among all the users. In the special single-user and free-space propagation setup, the optimal declination angles are derived in closed form with the maximum-ratio combining (MRC) beamformer applied at the base station (BS). In the general multi-user and multi-path setup, we propose an alternating optimization (AO) algorithm to alternately optimize the receive beamforming and the declination angles in an iterative manner. Simulation results are provided to demonstrate that the proposed RA-enabled system can significantly outperform other benchmark schemes.</description>

      <title>Sum Rate Maximization for Movable Antenna-Aided Downlink RSMA Systems</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.08509v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Rate splitting multiple access (RSMA) is regarded as a crucial and powerful physical layer (PHY) paradigm for next-generation communication systems. Particularly, users employ successive interference cancellation (SIC) to decode part of the interference while treating the remainder as noise. However, conventional RSMA systems rely on fixed-position antenna arrays, limiting their ability to fully exploit spatial diversity. This constraint reduces beamforming gain and significantly impairs RSMA performance. To address this problem, we propose a movable antenna (MA)-aided RSMA scheme that allows the antennas at the base station (BS) to dynamically adjust their positions. Our objective is to maximize the system sum rate of common and private messages by jointly optimizing the MA positions, beamforming matrix, and common rate allocation. To tackle the formulated non-convex problem, we apply fractional programming (FP) and develop an efficient two-stage, coarse-to-fine-grained searching (CFGS) algorithm to obtain high-quality solutions. Numerical results demonstrate that, with optimized antenna adjustments, the MA-enabled system achieves substantial performance and reliability improvements in RSMA over fixed-position antenna setups.</description>

Abstract: A colloquial interpretation of entropy is that it is the knowledge gained upon learning the outcome of a random experiment. Conditional entropy is then interpreted as the knowledge gained upon learning the outcome of one random experiment after learning the outcome of another, possibly statistically dependent, random experiment. In the classical world, entropy and conditional entropy take only non-negative values, consistent with the intuition that one has regarding the aforementioned interpretations. However, for certain entangled states, one obtains negative values when evaluating commonly accepted and information-theoretically justified formulas for the quantum conditional entropy, leading to the confounding conclusion that one can know less than nothing in the quantum world. Here, we introduce a physically motivated framework for defining quantum conditional entropy, based on two simple postulates inspired by the second law of thermodynamics (non-decrease of entropy) and extensivity of entropy, and we argue that all plausible definitions of quantum conditional entropy should respect these two postulates. We then prove that all plausible quantum conditional entropies take on negative values for certain entangled states, so that it is inevitable that one can know less than nothing in the quantum world. All of our arguments are based on constructions of physical processes that respect the first postulate, the one inspired by the second law of thermodynamics.</description>

      <title>Age of Information Diffusion on Social Networks</title>

      <description>arXiv:2308.13303v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: To promote viral marketing, major social platforms (e.g., Facebook Marketplace and Pinduoduo) repeatedly select and invite different users (as seeds) in online social networks to share fresh information about a product or service with their friends. Thereby, we are motivated to optimize a multi-stage seeding process of viral marketing in social networks, and adopt the recent notions of the peak and the average age of information (AoI) to measure the timeliness of promotion information received by network users. Our problem is different from the literature on information diffusion in social networks, which limits to one-time seeding and overlooks AoI dynamics or information replacement over time. As a critical step, we manage to develop closed-form expressions that characterize and trace AoI dynamics over any social network. For the peak AoI problem, we first prove the NP-hardness of our multi-stage seeding problem by a highly non-straightforward reduction from the dominating set problem, and then present a new polynomial-time algorithm that achieves good approximation guarantees (e.g., less than 2 for linear network topology). To minimize the average AoI, we also prove that our problem is NP-hard by properly reducing it from the set cover problem. Benefiting from our two-sided bound analysis on the average AoI objective, we build up a new framework for approximation analysis and link our problem to a much simplified sum-distance minimization problem. This intriguing connection inspires us to develop another polynomial-time algorithm that achieves a good approximation guarantee. Additionally, our theoretical results are well corroborated by experiments on a real social network.</description>

      <title>Learning Properties of Quantum States Without the I.I.D. Assumption</title>

      <description>arXiv:2401.16922v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We develop a framework for learning properties of quantum states beyond the assumption of independent and identically distributed (i.i.d.) input states. We prove that, given any learning problem (under reasonable assumptions), an algorithm designed for i.i.d. input states can be adapted to handle input states of any nature, albeit at the expense of a polynomial increase in training data size (aka sample complexity). Importantly, this polynomial increase in sample complexity can be substantially improved to polylogarithmic if the learning algorithm in question only requires non-adaptive, single-copy measurements. Among other applications, this allows us to generalize the classical shadow framework to the non-i.i.d. setting while only incurring a comparatively small loss in sample efficiency. We use rigorous quantum information theory to prove our main results. In particular, we leverage permutation invariance and randomized single-copy measurements to derive a new quantum de Finetti theorem that mainly addresses measurement outcome statistics and, in turn, scales much more favorably in Hilbert space dimension.</description>

Abstract: Most modern imaging systems process the data they capture algorithmically before-or instead of-human viewing. As a result, performance depends not on how interpretable the measurements appear, but how effectively they encode details for algorithmic processing. Information theory provides mathematical tools to analyze this, but developing methods that can handle the complexity of real-world measurements yet remain practical enough for widespread use has proven challenging. We introduce a data-driven approach for estimating the information content of imaging system measurements. Our framework requires only experimental measurements and noise characterization, with no need for ground truth data. We demonstrate that these information estimates reliably predict system performance across diverse imaging modalities, including color photography, radio astronomy, lensless imaging, and label-free microscopy. To automate the process of designing imaging systems that maximize information capture we introduce an optimization technique called Information-Driven Encoder Analysis Learning (IDEAL). The tools we develop in this work unlock information theory as a powerful, practical tool for analyzing and designing imaging systems across a broad range of applications.

Abstract: In group testing, the task is to identify defective items by testing groups of them together using as few tests as possible. We consider the setting where each item is defective with a constant probability $\alpha$, independent of all other items. In the (over-)idealized noiseless setting, tests are positive exactly if any of the tested items are defective. We study a more realistic model in which observed test results are subject to noise, i.e., tests can display false positive or false negative results with constant positive probabilities. We determine precise constants $c$ such that $cn\log n$ tests are required to recover the infection status of every individual for both adaptive and non-adaptive group testing: in the former, the selection of groups to test can depend on previously observed test results, whereas it cannot in the latter. Additionally, for both settings, we provide efficient algorithms that identify all defective items with the optimal amount of tests with high probability. Thus, we completely solve the problem of binary noisy group testing in the studied setting.</description>
