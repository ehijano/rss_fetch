      <title>Impact of Hill coefficient and time delay on a perceptual decision-making model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.19853</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.19853v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, a neural mass perceptual decision making model introduced by Piska{\l}a et al. is analyzed. The model describes activity of two neuron populations influenced by each other and external inputs. The groups' activities correspond to the process of making a perceptual binary decision. Existing results are generalized by investigating the impact of both a delay in self-inhibition and a generic Hill coefficient on solutions to the system of differential equations. Several versions of the model with various assumptions are compared using analytical and numerical methods.</description>

      <title>Do psychic cells generate consciousness?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.20164</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.20164v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Technological advances in the past decades have begun to enable neuroscientists to address fundamental questions about consciousness in an unprecedented way. Here we review remarkable recent progress in our understanding of cellular-level mechanisms of conscious processing in the brain. Of particular interest are the cortical pyramidal neurons -- or "psychic cells" called by Ram\'on y Cajal more than 100 years ago -- which have an intriguing cellular mechanism that accounts for selective disruption of feedback signaling in the brain upon anesthetic-induced loss of consciousness. Importantly, a particular class of metabotropic receptors distributed over the dendrites of pyramidal cells are highlighted as the key cellular mechanism. After all, Cajal's instinct over a century ago may turn out to be correct -- we may have just begun to understand whether and how psychic cells indeed generate and control our consciousness.</description>

      <title>Identifying multi-compartment Hodgkin-Huxley models with high-density extracellular voltage recordings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.20233</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.20233v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Multi-compartment Hodgkin-Huxley models are biophysical models of how electrical signals propagate throughout a neuron, and they form the basis of our knowledge of neural computation at the cellular level. However, these models have many free parameters that must be estimated for each cell, and existing fitting methods rely on intracellular voltage measurements that are highly challenging to obtain in vivo. Recent advances in neural recording technology with high-density probes and arrays enable dense sampling of extracellular voltage from many sites surrounding a neuron, allowing indirect measurement of many compartments of a cell simultaneously. Here, we propose a method for inferring the underlying membrane voltage, biophysical parameters, and the neuron's position relative to the probe, using extracellular measurements alone. We use an Extended Kalman Filter to infer membrane voltage and channel states using efficient, differentiable simulators. Then, we learn the model parameters by maximizing the marginal likelihood using gradient-based methods. We demonstrate the performance of this approach using simulated data and real neuron morphologies.</description>

      <title>Brains and language models converge on a shared conceptual space across different languages</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.20489</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.20489v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Human languages differ widely in their forms, each having distinct sounds, scripts, and syntax. Yet, they can all convey similar meaning. Do different languages converge on a shared neural substrate for conceptual meaning? We used language models (LMs) and naturalistic fMRI to identify neural representations of the shared conceptual meaning of the same story as heard by native speakers of three languages: English, Chinese, and French. We found that LMs trained on entirely different languages converge onto a similar embedding space, especially in the middle layers. We then aimed to find if a similar shared space exists in the brains of different native speakers of the three languages. We trained voxelwise encoding models that align the LM embeddings with neural responses from one group of subjects speaking a single language. We then used the encoding models trained on one language to predict the neural activity in listeners of other languages. We found that models trained to predict neural activity for one language generalize to different subjects listening to the same content in a different language, across high-level language and default-mode regions. Our results suggest that the neural representations of meaning underlying different languages are shared across speakers of various languages, and that LMs trained on different languages converge on this shared meaning. These findings suggest that, despite the diversity of languages, shared meaning emerges from our interactions with one another and our shared world.</description>

      <title>Engineering Sentience</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.20504</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.20504v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We spell out a definition of sentience that may be useful for designing and building it in machines. We propose that for sentience to be meaningful for AI, it must be fleshed out in functional, computational terms, in enough detail to allow for implementation. Yet, this notion of sentience must also reflect something essentially 'subjective', beyond just having the general capacity to encode perceptual content. For this specific functional notion of sentience to occur, we propose that certain sensory signals need to be both assertoric (persistent) and qualitative. To illustrate the definition in more concrete terms, we sketch out some ways for potential implementation, given current technology. Understanding what it takes for artificial agents to be functionally sentient can also help us avoid creating them inadvertently, or at least, realize that we have created them in a timely manner.</description>

      <title>In silico discovery of representational relationships across visual cortex</title>

Abstract: Now published in Nature Human Behavior doi: https://doi.org/10.1038/s41562-025-02252-z
  Human vision is mediated by a complex interconnected network of cortical brain areas that jointly represent visual information. While these areas are increasingly understood in isolation, their representational relationships remain elusive. Here we developed relational neural control (RNC), and used it to investigate the representational relationships for univariate and multivariate fMRI responses of areas across visual cortex. Through RNC we generated and explored in silico fMRI responses for large amounts of images, discovering controlling images that align or disentangle responses across areas, thus indicating their shared or unique representational content. This revealed a typical network-level configuration of representational relationships in which shared or unique representational content varied based on cortical distance, categorical selectivity, and position within the visual hierarchy. Closing the empirical cycle, we validated the in silico discoveries on in vivo fMRI responses from independent subjects. Together, this reveals how visual areas jointly represent the world as an interconnected network.</description>

      <title>The cognitive triple-slit experiment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.05497</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.05497v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Quantum cognition has made it possible to model human cognitive processes very effectively, revealing numerous parallels between the properties of conceptual entities tested by the human mind and those of microscopic entities tested by measurement apparatuses. The success of quantum cognition has also made it possible to formulate an interpretation of quantum mechanics, called the conceptuality interpretation, which ascribes to quantum entities a conceptual nature similar to that of human concepts. The present work fits into these lines of research by analyzing a cognitive version of single, double, and triple-slit experiments. The data clearly show the formation of the typical interference fringes between the slits as well as the embryos of secondary fringes. Our analysis also shows that while quantum entities and human concepts may share a same conceptual nature, the way they manifest it in specific contexts can be quite different. This is also evident from the significant deviation from zero observed for the Sorkin parameter, indicating the presence of strong irreducible third-order interference contributions in human decision.</description>

      <title>Effective Stimulus Propagation in Neural Circuits: Driver Node Selection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.13615</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.13615v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Precise control of signal propagation in modular neural networks represents a fundamental challenge in computational neuroscience. We establish a framework for identifying optimal control nodes that maximize stimulus transmission between weakly coupled neural populations. Using spiking stochastic block model networks, we systematically compare driver node selection strategies - including random sampling and topology-based centrality measures (degree, betweenness, closeness, eigenvector, harmonic, and percolation centrality) - to determine minimal control inputs for achieving inter-population synchronization. Targeted stimulation of just 10-20% of the most central neurons in the source population significantly enhances spiking propagation fidelity compared to random selection. This approach yields a 64-fold increase in signal transfer efficiency at critical inter-module connection densities. These findings establish a theoretical foundation for precision neuromodulation in biological neural systems and neurotechnology applications.</description>
