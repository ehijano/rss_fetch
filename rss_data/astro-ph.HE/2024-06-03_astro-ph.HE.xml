      <title>Breaking into the window of primordial black hole dark matter with x-ray microlensing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.20365</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.20365v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Primordial black holes (PBHs) in the mass range $10^{-16}-10^{-11}~M_\odot$ may constitute all the dark matter. We show that gravitational microlensing of bright x-ray pulsars provide the most robust and immediately implementable opportunity to uncover PBH dark matter in this mass window. As proofs of concept, we show that the currently operational NICER telescope can probe this window near $10^{-14}~M_\odot$ with just two months of exposure on the x-ray pulsar SMC-X1, and that the forthcoming STROBE-X telescope can probe complementary regions in only a few weeks. These times are much shorter than the year-long exposures obtained by NICER on some individual sources. We take into account the effects of wave optics and the finite extent of the source, which become important for the mass range of our PBHs. We also provide a spectral diagnostic to distinguish microlensing from transient background events and to broadly mark the PBH mass if true microlensing events are observed. In light of the powerful science case, i.e., the imminent discovery of dark matter searchable over multiple decades of PBH masses with achievable exposures, we strongly urge the commission of a dedicated large broadband telescope for x-ray microlensing. We derive the microlensing reach of such a telescope by assuming sensitivities of detector components of proposed missions, and find that with hard x-ray pulsar sources PBH masses down to a few $10^{-17}~M_\odot$ can be probed.</description>

      <title>The Effects of Cooling on Boundary Layer Accretion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.20367</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.20367v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In many cases accretion proceeds from disks onto planets, stars, white dwarfs, and neutron stars via a boundary layer, a region of intense shear where gas transitions from a near-Keplerian speed to that of the surface. These regions are \textit{not} susceptible to the common magnetorotational and Kelvin-Helmholtz instabilities, and instead global modes generated by supersonic shear instabilities are a leading candidate to govern transport in these regions. This work investigates the dynamics of these systems under a range of thermodynamic conditions, surveying both disk sound speeds and cooling rates. Very fast or very slow cooling has little effect on wave dynamics: in the fast-cooling limit, waves propagate in an effectively isothermal manner, and in the slow limit wave propagation is effectively adiabatic. However, when the cooling timescale is comparable to the wave period, wave damping becomes extreme. In cases with intermediate cooling rates, mass and angular momentum transport can be suppressed by orders of magnitude compared to isothermal and uncooled cases. Cooling in accretion disks leads to a preference for wavenumbers near and below the Mach number of the disk; the corresponding lower frequencies can (in non-isothermal systems) couple to gravity modes within the star, potentially causing low-frequency variability such as dwarf nova and quasi-periodic oscillations in accreting systems.</description>

      <title>Using the COSMIC Population Synthesis Code to Investigate How Metallicity Affects the Rates of Interacting Binaries</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.20396</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.20396v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We use COSMIC, a galaxy population synthesis code, to investigate how metallicity affects the rate of formation of massive stars with a closely orbiting compact object companion, the suggested progenitors of radio loud long gamma-ray bursts. We present the evolution time of these systems at different metallicities, and how the formation rates of these systems are anti-correlated with metallicity. In particular, these systems occur about 10 times more frequently in at metallicities between $Z = 2\times 10^{-4}$ and $2 \times 10^{-3}$, compared to those between $Z = 2\times 10^{-3}$ and $2 \times 10^{-2}$. This work serves as a prerequisite to predicting the global rates of these systems as a function of redshift, ultimately giving crucial insight into our understanding of the progenitors of long gamma-ray bursts and their evolution over cosmic time.</description>

      <title>Towards accelerated nuclear-physics parameter estimation from binary neutron star mergers: Emulators for the Tolman-Oppenheimer-Volkoff equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.20558</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.20558v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Gravitational-wave observations of binary neutron-star (BNS) mergers have the potential to revolutionize our understanding of the nuclear equation of state (EOS) and the fundamental interactions that determine its properties. However, Bayesian parameter estimation frameworks do not typically sample over microscopic nuclear-physics parameters that determine the EOS. One of the major hurdles in doing so is the computational cost involved in solving the neutron-star structure equations, known as the Tolman-Oppenheimer-Volkoff (TOV) equations. In this paper, we explore approaches to emulating solutions for the TOV equations: Multilayer Perceptrons (MLP), Gaussian Processes (GP), and a data-driven variant of the reduced basis method (RBM). We implement these emulators for three different parameterizations of the nuclear EOS, each with a different degree of complexity represented by the number of model parameters. We find that our MLP-based emulators are generally more accurate than the other two algorithms whereas the RBM results in the largest speedup with respect to the full, high-fidelity TOV solver. We employ these emulators for a simple parameter inference using a potentially loud BNS observation, and show that the posteriors predicted by our emulators are in excellent agreement with those obtained from the full TOV solver.</description>

      <title>Decoding the nature of Coherent radio emission in Pulsars I: Observational constraints</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.20634</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.20634v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Radio observations from normal pulsars indicate that the coherent radio emission is excited by curvature radiation from charge bunches. In this review we provide a systematic description of the various observational constraints on the radio emission mechanism. We have discussed the presence of highly polarized time samples where the polarization position angle follow two orthogonal well defined tracks across the profile, that closely match the rotating vector model in an identical manner. The observations also show the presence of circular polarization, with both the right and left handed circular polarization seen across the profile. Other constraints on the emission mechanism is provided by the detailed measurements of the spectral index variation across the profile window, where the central part of the profile, corresponding to the core component, has a steeper spectrum than the surrounding cones. Finally, the detailed measurements of the subpulse drifting behaviour can be explained by considering the presence of non-dipolar field on the stellar surface and the formation of the Partially screened Gap (PSG) above the polar cap region. The PSG gives rise to a non-stationary plasma flow, that has a multi-component nature, consisting of highly energetic primary particles, secondary pair plasma and iron ions discharged from the surface, with large fragmentation resulting is dense plasma clouds and lower density inter-cloud regions. The physical properties of the outflowing plasma and the observational constraints lead us to consider coherent curvature radiation as the most viable explanation for the emission mechanism in normal pulsars, where propagation effects due to adiabatic walking and refraction are largely inconsequential.</description>

      <title>A Needle in a Cosmic Haystack: A Review of FRB Search Techniques</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.20716</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.20716v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Ephemeral Fast Radio Bursts (FRBs) must be powered by some of the most energetic processes in the Universe. That makes them highly interesting in their own right and as precise probes for estimating cosmological parameters. This field thus poses a unique challenge: FRBs must be detected promptly and immediately localised and studied based only on that single millisecond-duration flash. The problem is that the burst occurrence is highly unpredictable and that their distance strongly suppresses their brightness. Since the discovery of FRBs in single-dish archival data in 2007, detection software has evolved tremendously. Pipelines now detect bursts in real-time within a matter of seconds, operate on interferometers, buffer high-time and frequency resolution data, and issue real-time alerts to other observatories for rapid multi-wavelength follow-up. In this paper, we review the components that comprise a FRB search software pipeline, we discuss the proven techniques that were adopted from pulsar searches, we highlight newer, more efficient techniques for detecting FRBs, and we conclude by discussing the proposed novel future methodologies that may power the search for FRBs in the era of big data astronomy.</description>

      <title>The giant outburst of EXO 2030+375 I: Spectral and pulse profile evolution</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.20734</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.20734v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Be X-ray binary EXO 2030+375 went through its third recorded giant outburst from June 2021 to early 2022. We present the results of both spectral and timing analysis based on NICER monitoring, covering the 2-10 keV flux range from 20 to 310 mCrab. Dense monitoring with observations carried out about every second day and a total exposure time of 160 ks allowed us to closely track the source evolution over the outburst. Changes in spectral shape and pulse profiles showed a stable luminosity dependence during the rise and decline. The same type of dependence has been seen in past outbursts. The pulse profile is characterized by several distinct peaks and dips. The profiles show a clear dependence on luminosity with a stark transition at a luminosity of 2x10^36 erg/s, indicating a change in the emission pattern. Using relativistic ray-tracing, we demonstrate how anisotropic beaming of emission from an accretion channel with constant geometrical configuration can give rise to the observed pulse profiles over a range of luminosities.</description>

      <title>Progenitor Constraint Incorporating Shell Merger: The Case of Supernova Remnant G359.0-0.9</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.20736</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.20736v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: It is generally hard to put robust constraints on progenitor masses of supernovae (SNe) and remnants (SNRs) observationally, while they offer tantalizing clues to understanding explosion mechanisms and mass distribution. Our recent study suggests that ``shell merger'', which is theoretically expected for stellar evolution, can appreciably affect final yields of inter-mediate mass elements (IMEs; such as Ne, Mg, and Si). In light of this, here we report results of X-ray spectral analysis of a Galactic SNR G359.0-0.9, whose abundance pattern may possibly be anomalous according to a previous study. Our spectroscopy using all the available data taken with XMM-Newton reveals that this remnant is classified as Mg-rich SNRs because of its high Mg-to-Ne ratio (Z_Mg/Z_Ne=1.90+0.27-0.19; mass ratio 0.66+0.09-0.07) and conclude that the result cannot be explained without the shell merger. By comparing the observation with theoretical calculations, we prefer the so-called Ne-burning shell intrusion and in this case the progenitor mass M_ZAMS is likely &lt;15M_sun. We confirm the result also by our new molecular line observations with the NRO-45 m telescope: G359.0-0.9 is located in the Scutum-Centaurus arm (2.66--2.94 kpc) and in this case the resultant total ejecta mass ~6.8M_sun is indeed consistent with the above estimate. Our method using mass ratios of IMEs presented in this paper will become useful to distinguish the type of the shell merger, the Ne-burning shell intrusion and the O-burning shell merger, for future SNR studies.</description>

      <title>Can the symmetric Fermi and eROSITA bubbles be produced by tilted jets?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.20816</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.20816v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Fermi Gamma-Ray Space Telescope reveals two large bubbles in the Galaxy, extending nearly symmetrically $\sim50^{\circ}$ above and below the Galactic center (GC). Previous simulations of bubble formation invoking active galactic nucleus (AGN) jets have assumed that the jets are vertical to the Galactic disk; however, in general, the jet orientation does not necessarily correlate with the rotational axis of the Galactic disk. Using three-dimensional special relativistic hydrodynamic simulations including cosmic rays (CRs) and thermal gas, we show that the dense clumpy gas within the Galactic disk disrupts jet collimation ("failed jets" hereafter), which causes the failed jets to form hot bubbles. Subsequent buoyancy in the stratified atmosphere renders them vertical to form the symmetric Fermi and eROSITA bubbles (collectively, Galactic bubbles). We find that (1) despite the relativistic jets emanated from the GC are at various angles $\le45^{\circ}$ with respect to the rotational axis of the Galaxy, the Galactic bubbles nonetheless appear aligned with the axis; (2) the edge of the eROSITA bubbles corresponds to a forward shock driven by the hot bubbles; (3) followed by the forward shock is a tangling contact discontinuity corresponding to the edge of the Fermi bubbles; (4) assuming a leptonic model we find that the observed gamma-ray bubbles and microwave haze can be reproduced with a best-fit CR power-law spectral index of 2.4; The agreements between the simulated and the observed multi-wavelength features suggest that forming the Galactic bubbles by oblique AGN failed jets is a plausible scenario.</description>

      <title>Poynting flux transport channels formed in polar cap regions of neutron star magnetospheres</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.20866</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.20866v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Pair cascades in polar cap regions of neutron stars are considered to be an essential process in various models of coherent radio emissions of pulsars. The cascades produce pair plasma bunch discharges in quasi-periodic spark events. The cascade properties, and therefore also the coherent radiation, depend strongly on the magnetospheric plasma properties and vary significantly across and along the polar cap. It is furthermore still uncertain from where the radio emission emanates in polar cap region.
  We investigate the generation of electromagnetic waves by pair cascades and their propagation in the polar cap for three representative inclination angles of a magnetic dipole, $0^\circ$, $45^\circ$, and $90^\circ$.
  2D particle-in-cell simulations that include quantum-electrodynamic pair cascades are used in a charge limited flow from the star surface.
  We found that the discharge properties are strongly dependent on the magnetospheric current profile in the polar cap and that transport channels for high intensity Poynting flux are formed along magnetic field lines where the magnetospheric currents approach zero and where the plasma cannot carry the magnetospheric currents. There, the parallel Poynting flux component is efficiently transported away from the star and may eventually escape the magnetosphere as coherent radio waves. The Poynting flux decreases faster with the distance from the star in regions of high magnetospheric currents.
  Our model shows that no process of energy conversion from particles to waves is necessary for the coherent radio wave emission. Moreover, the pulsar radio beam does not have a cone structure, but rather the radiation generated by the oscillating electric gap fields directly escapes along open magnetic field lines in which no pair creation occurs.</description>

      <title>Search of extended emission from HESS J1702-420 with eROSITA</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.20927</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.20927v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: HESS J1702-420 is a peculiar TeV complex with a morphology changing from a diffuse (HESS J1702-420B source) at $\lesssim 2$ TeV to point-like (HESS J1702-420A) at $\gtrsim 10$ TeV energies. The morphology and the spectral properties of HESS J1702-420 could be understood in terms of a (diffusive) hadronic or leptonic models in which the observed TeV emission arises correpondingly from proton-proton or IC-radiation of relativistic particles present in the region. In this work we perform searches of the X-ray counterpart of HESS J1702-420B source originated from the synchrotron emission of the primary or secondary relativistic electrons produced within leptonic or hadronic models. Such an emission can be largely extent and remain beyond the detection capabilities of a narrow-FoV instruments such as XMM-Newton. We utilise the publicly available first 6-months eROSITA dataset (DR1) fully covering selected for the analysis region of $&gt; 5^\circ$-radius around HESS J1702-420. We discuss biases connected to variable plasma temperature/neutral hydrogen column density in the region and present results based on background modelling approach. The performed analysis does not allow us to detect the extended X-ray counterpart of HESS J1702-420 of $0.07^\circ - 3^\circ$-radii sizes. The derived upper limits are significantly higher than the expected hadronic model flux of the X-ray counterpart. For the leptonic model the derived limits indicate the magnetic field in the region $B\lesssim 2\mu$G. We argue, that the further advances in the diffuse X-ray counterpart searches could be achieved either with next generation missions or Msec-long observational campaigns with currently operating instruments.</description>

      <title>Unravelling the asphericities in the explosion and multi-faceted circumstellar matter of SN 2023ixf</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.20989</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.20989v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a detailed investigation of photometric, spectroscopic, and polarimetric observations of the Type II SN 2023ixf. The early detection of highly-ionized flash features, rapid ascent in ultraviolet flux coupled with the blueward shift in near-ultraviolet colors and temperature provides compelling evidence for a delayed shock breakout from a confined dense circumstellar matter (CSM) enveloping the progenitor star. The temporal evolution of polarization in the SN 2023ixf phase revealed three distinct peaks in polarization evolution at 1.4 d, 6.4 d, and 79.2 d, indicating an asymmetric dense CSM, an aspherical shock front and clumpiness in the low-density extended CSM, and an aspherical inner ejecta/He-core. SN 2023ixf displayed two dominant axes, one along the CSM-outer ejecta and the other along the inner ejecta/He-core, showcasing the independent origin of asymmetry in the early and late evolution. The argument for an aspherical shock front is further strengthened by the presence of a high-velocity broad absorption feature in the blue wing of the Balmer features in addition to the P-Cygni absorption post 16 d. Hydrodynamical light curve modeling indicated a progenitor mass of 10 solar mass with a radius of 470 solar radius, explosion energy of 2e51 erg, and 0.06 solar mass of 56Ni. The modeling also indicated a two-zone CSM: a confined dense CSM extending up to 5e14 cm, with a mass-loss rate of 1e-2 solar mass per year, and an extended CSM spanning from 5e14 cm to 1e16 cm with a mass-loss rate of 1e-4 solar mass per year. The early nebular phase observations display an axisymmetric line profile of [OI] and red-ward attenuation of the emission of Halpha post 125 days, marking the onset of dust formation.</description>

      <title>Brightening and Fading in the Youngest Galactic Supernova Remnant G1.9+0.3: 13 years of monitoring with the Chandra X-ray Observatory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.21067</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.21067v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We report results from 13 years of Chandra monitoring of nonthermal X-ray emission from the youngest Galactic supernova remnant G1.9+0.3, the only remnant known to be increasing in brightness. We confirm the spatially-integrated flux increase rate of $(1.2 \pm 0.2)$% yr$^{-1}$ between 1 and 7 keV, but find large spatial variations, from decreases of $-3$% yr$^{-1}$ to increases of 7% yr$^{-1}$, over length scales as small as $10''$ or smaller. We observe relatively little change in spectral slope, though one region shows significant hardening (photon index $\Delta \Gamma \sim 0.4$) as it brightens by 1% yr$^{-1}$. Such rates of change can be accommodated by any of several explanations, including steady evolution of the blast wave, expansion or compression of discrete plasma blobs, strong magnetic turbulence, or variations in magnetic-field aspect angle. Our results do not constrain the mean magnetic-field strength, but a self-consistent picture of the spatially averaged rate of increase can be produced in which the maximum energies of accelerated particles are limited by the remnant age (applying both to electrons and to ions) to about 20 TeV, and the remnant-averaged magnetic field strength is about 30 $\mu$G. The deceleration parameter $m$ (average shock radius varying as $t^m$) is about 0.7, consistent with estimates from overall expansion dynamics, and confirming an explosion date of about 1900 CE. Shock-efficiency factors $\epsilon_e$ and $\epsilon_B$ (fractions of shock energy in relativistic electrons and magnetic field) are 0.003 and 0.0002 in this picture. However, the large range of rates of brightness change indicates that such a global model is oversimplified. Temporal variations of photon index, expected to be small but measurable with longer time baselines, can discriminate among possible models.</description>

      <title>Boil-off of red supergiants: mass loss and type II-P supernovae</title>

Abstract: The mass loss mechanism of red supergiant stars is not well understood, even though it has crucial consequences for their stellar evolution and the appearance of supernovae that occur upon core-collapse. We argue that outgoing shock waves launched near the photosphere can support a dense chromosphere between the star's surface and the dust formation radius at several stellar radii. We derive analytic expressions for the time-averaged density profile of the chromosphere, and we use these to estimate mass loss rates due to winds launched by radiation pressure at the dust formation radius. These mass loss rates are similar to recent observations, possibly explaining the upward kink in mass loss rates of luminous red supergiants. Our models predict that low-mass red supergiants lose less mass than commonly assumed, while high-mass red supergiants lose more. The chromospheric mass of our models is $\sim$0.01 solar masses, most of which lies within a few stellar radii. This may explain the early light curves and spectra of type-II P supernovae without requiring extreme pre-supernova mass loss. We discuss implications for stellar evolution, type II-P supernovae, SN 2023ixf, and Betelgeuse.</description>

      <title>Log-Normal Waiting Time Widths Characterize Dynamics</title>

Abstract: Many astronomical phenomena, including Fast Radio Bursts and Soft Gamma Repeaters, consist of brief, separated, seemingly aperiodic events. The intervals between these events vary randomly, but there are epochs of greater activity, with shorter mean intervals, and of lesser activity, with longer mean intervals. This variability can be quantified by a single dimensionless parameter, the width of a log-normal fit to the distribution of waiting times between events. If the distribution of event strengths is a power law, as is often the case, this parameter is independent of the detection threshold and is a robust measure of the intrinsic variability of the waiting times and of the underlying dynamics.</description>

      <title>Hard X-ray emission from blazars associated with high-energy neutrinos</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.00960</link>
      <description>arXiv:2306.00960v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Bright blazars were found to be prominent neutrino sources, and a number of IceCube events were associated with them. Evaluating high-energy photon emission of such blazars is crucial for better understanding of the processes and regions where neutrinos are produced. Here, we focus on hard X-ray emission observed by the SRG/ART-XC telescope, by the Swift/BAT imager, and by the INTEGRAL/IBIS telescope. Their energy range ~10 keV is well-suited for probing photons that potentially participate in neutrino production by interacting with ultrarelativistic protons. We find that neutrino-associated blazars tend to demonstrate remarkably strong X-ray emission compared to other VLBI blazars in the sky. Both neutrinos and hard X-rays are found to come from blazars at cosmological distances z ~ 1, and are boosted by relativistic beaming that makes it possible to detect them on Earth. Our results suggest that neutrinos are produced within compact blazar jets, with target X-ray photons emitted from accelerated jet regions.</description>

      <title>The flavor composition of ultra-high-energy cosmic neutrinos: measurement forecasts for in-ice radio-based EeV neutrino telescopes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.02432</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.02432v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In-ice radio-detection is a promising technique to discover and characterize ultra-high-energy (UHE) neutrinos, with energies above 100 PeV, adopted by present - ARA, ARIANNA, and RNO-G - and planned - IceCube-Gen2. So far, their ability to measure neutrino flavor has remained unexplored. We show and quantify how the neutrino flavor can be measured with in-ice radio detectors using two complementary detection channels. The first channel, sensitive to $\nu_e$, identifies them via their charged-current interactions, whose radio emission is elongated in time due to the Landau-Pomeranchuk-Migdal effect. The second channel, sensitive to $\nu_\mu$ and $\nu_\tau$, identifies events made up of multiple showers generated by the muons and taus they generate. We show this in state-of-the-art forecasts geared at IceCube-Gen2, for representative choices of the UHE neutrino flux. This newfound sensitivity could allow us to infer the UHE neutrino flavor composition at their sources - and thus the neutrino production mechanism - and to probe UHE neutrino physics.</description>
