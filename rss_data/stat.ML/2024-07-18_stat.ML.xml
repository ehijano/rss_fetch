      <title>Information-Theoretic Foundations for Machine Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.12288</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.12288v2 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The staggering progress of machine learning in the past decade has been a sight to behold. In retrospect, it is both remarkable and unsettling that these milestones were achievable with little to no rigorous theory to guide experimentation. Despite this fact, practitioners have been able to guide their future experimentation via observations from previous large-scale empirical investigations. However, alluding to Plato's Allegory of the cave, it is likely that the observations which form the field's notion of reality are but shadows representing fragments of that reality. In this work, we propose a theoretical framework which attempts to answer what exists outside of the cave. To the theorist, we provide a framework which is mathematically rigorous and leaves open many interesting ideas for future exploration. To the practitioner, we provide a framework whose results are very intuitive, general, and which will help form principles to guide future investigations. Concretely, we provide a theoretical framework rooted in Bayesian statistics and Shannon's information theory which is general enough to unify the analysis of many phenomena in machine learning. Our framework characterizes the performance of an optimal Bayesian learner, which considers the fundamental limits of information. Throughout this work, we derive very general theoretical results and apply them to derive insights specific to settings ranging from data which is independently and identically distributed under an unknown distribution, to data which is sequential, to data which exhibits hierarchical structure amenable to meta-learning. We conclude with a section dedicated to characterizing the performance of misspecified algorithms. These results are exciting and particularly relevant as we strive to overcome increasingly difficult machine learning challenges in this endlessly complex world.</description>

      <title>Scalable Monte Carlo for Bayesian Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.12751</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.12751v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This book aims to provide a graduate-level introduction to advanced topics in Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) algorithms, as applied broadly in the Bayesian computational context. Most, if not all of these topics (stochastic gradient MCMC, non-reversible MCMC, continuous time MCMC, and new techniques for convergence assessment) have emerged as recently as the last decade, and have driven substantial recent practical and theoretical advances in the field. A particular focus is on methods that are scalable with respect to either the amount of data, or the data dimension, motivated by the emerging high-priority application areas in machine learning and AI.</description>

      <title>Specific language impairment (SLI) detection pipeline from transcriptions of spontaneous narratives</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.12012</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.12012v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Specific Language Impairment (SLI) is a disorder that affects communication and can affect both comprehension and expression. This study focuses on effectively detecting SLI in children using transcripts of spontaneous narratives from 1063 interviews. A three-stage cascading pipeline was proposed f. In the first stage, feature extraction and dimensionality reduction of the data are performed using the Random Forest (RF) and Spearman correlation methods. In the second stage, the most predictive variables from the first stage are estimated using logistic regression, which is used in the last stage to detect SLI in children from transcripts of spontaneous narratives using a nearest neighbor classifier. The results revealed an accuracy of 97.13% in identifying SLI, highlighting aspects such as the length of the responses, the quality of their utterances, and the complexity of the language. This new approach, framed in natural language processing, offers significant benefits to the field of SLI detection by avoiding complex subjective variables and focusing on quantitative metrics directly related to the child's performance.</description>

      <title>Are Linear Regression Models White Box and Interpretable?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.12177</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.12177v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Explainable artificial intelligence (XAI) is a set of tools and algorithms that applied or embedded to machine learning models to understand and interpret the models. They are recommended especially for complex or advanced models including deep neural network because they are not interpretable from human point of view. On the other hand, simple models including linear regression are easy to implement, has less computational complexity and easy to visualize the output. The common notion in the literature that simple models including linear regression are considered as "white box" because they are more interpretable and easier to understand. This is based on the idea that linear regression models have several favorable outcomes including the effect of the features in the model and whether they affect positively or negatively toward model output. Moreover, uncertainty of the model can be measured or estimated using the confidence interval. However, we argue that this perception is not accurate and linear regression models are not easy to interpret neither easy to understand considering common XAI metrics and possible challenges might face. This includes linearity, local explanation, multicollinearity, covariates, normalization, uncertainty, features contribution and fairness. Consequently, we recommend the so-called simple models should be treated equally to complex models when it comes to explainability and interpretability.</description>

      <title>Base Models for Parabolic Partial Differential Equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.12234</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.12234v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Parabolic partial differential equations (PDEs) appear in many disciplines to model the evolution of various mathematical objects, such as probability flows, value functions in control theory, and derivative prices in finance. It is often necessary to compute the solutions or a function of the solutions to a parametric PDE in multiple scenarios corresponding to different parameters of this PDE. This process often requires resolving the PDEs from scratch, which is time-consuming. To better employ existing simulations for the PDEs, we propose a framework for finding solutions to parabolic PDEs across different scenarios by meta-learning an underlying base distribution. We build upon this base distribution to propose a method for computing solutions to parametric PDEs under different parameter settings. Finally, we illustrate the application of the proposed methods through extensive experiments in generative modeling, stochastic control, and finance. The empirical results suggest that the proposed approach improves generalization to solving PDEs under new parameter regimes.</description>

      <title>Why Do You Grok? A Theoretical Analysis of Grokking Modular Addition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.12332</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.12332v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a theoretical explanation of the ``grokking'' phenomenon, where a model generalizes long after overfitting,for the originally-studied problem of modular addition. First, we show that early in gradient descent, when the ``kernel regime'' approximately holds, no permutation-equivariant model can achieve small population error on modular addition unless it sees at least a constant fraction of all possible data points. Eventually, however, models escape the kernel regime. We show that two-layer quadratic networks that achieve zero training loss with bounded $\ell_{\infty}$ norm generalize well with substantially fewer training points, and further show such networks exist and can be found by gradient descent with small $\ell_{\infty}$ regularization. We further provide empirical evidence that these networks as well as simple Transformers, leave the kernel regime only after initially overfitting. Taken together, our results strongly support the case for grokking as a consequence of the transition from kernel-like behavior to limiting behavior of gradient descent on deep networks.</description>

      <title>Test-Time Adaptation with State-Space Models</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.12492v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Distribution shifts between training and test data are all but inevitable over the lifecycle of a deployed model and lead to performance decay. Adapting the model can hopefully mitigate this drop in performance. Yet, adaptation is challenging since it must be unsupervised: we usually do not have access to any labeled data at test time. In this paper, we propose a probabilistic state-space model that can adapt a deployed model subjected to distribution drift. Our model learns the dynamics induced by distribution shifts on the last set of hidden features. Without requiring labels, we infer time-evolving class prototypes that serve as a dynamic classification head. Moreover, our approach is lightweight, modifying only the model's last linear layer. In experiments on real-world distribution shifts and synthetic corruptions, we demonstrate that our approach performs competitively with methods that require back-propagation and access to the model backbone. Our model especially excels in the case of small test batches - the most difficult setting.</description>

      <title>A Methodology Establishing Linear Convergence of Adaptive Gradient Methods under PL Inequality</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.12629</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.12629v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Adaptive gradient-descent optimizers are the standard choice for training neural network models. Despite their faster convergence than gradient-descent and remarkable performance in practice, the adaptive optimizers are not as well understood as vanilla gradient-descent. A reason is that the dynamic update of the learning rate that helps in faster convergence of these methods also makes their analysis intricate. Particularly, the simple gradient-descent method converges at a linear rate for a class of optimization problems, whereas the practically faster adaptive gradient methods lack such a theoretical guarantee. The Polyak-{\L}ojasiewicz (PL) inequality is the weakest known class, for which linear convergence of gradient-descent and its momentum variants has been proved. Therefore, in this paper, we prove that AdaGrad and Adam, two well-known adaptive gradient methods, converge linearly when the cost function is smooth and satisfies the PL inequality. Our theoretical framework follows a simple and unified approach, applicable to both batch and stochastic gradients, which can potentially be utilized in analyzing linear convergence of other variants of Adam.</description>

      <title>Distributed Gradient Descent for Functional Learning</title>

      <description>arXiv:2305.07408v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In recent years, different types of distributed and parallel learning schemes have received increasing attention for their strong advantages in handling large-scale data information. In the information era, to face the big data challenges {that} stem from functional data analysis very recently, we propose a novel distributed gradient descent functional learning (DGDFL) algorithm to tackle functional data across numerous local machines (processors) in the framework of reproducing kernel Hilbert space. Based on integral operator approaches, we provide the first theoretical understanding of the DGDFL algorithm in many different aspects of the literature. On the way of understanding DGDFL, firstly, a data-based gradient descent functional learning (GDFL) algorithm associated with a single-machine model is proposed and comprehensively studied. Under mild conditions, confidence-based optimal learning rates of DGDFL are obtained without the saturation boundary on the regularity index suffered in previous works in functional regression. We further provide a semi-supervised DGDFL approach to weaken the restriction on the maximal number of local machines to ensure optimal rates. To our best knowledge, the DGDFL provides the first divide-and-conquer iterative training approach to functional learning based on data samples of intrinsically infinite-dimensional random functions (functional covariates) and enriches the methodologies for functional data analysis.</description>

      <title>Non-Vacuous Generalization Bounds for Large Language Models</title>

      <description>arXiv:2312.17173v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Modern language models can contain billions of parameters, raising the question of whether they can generalize beyond the training data or simply parrot their training corpora. We provide the first non-vacuous generalization bounds for pretrained large language models (LLMs), indicating that language models are capable of discovering regularities that generalize to unseen data. In particular, we derive a compression bound that is valid for the unbounded log-likelihood loss using prediction smoothing, and we extend the bound to handle subsampling, accelerating bound computation by orders of magnitude on massive datasets. To achieve the extreme level of compression required for non-vacuous bounds, we devise SubLoRA, a simple low-dimensional nonlinear parameterization that leads to non-vacuous generalization bounds for models with nearly a billion parameters. Finally, we use our bounds to understand LLM generalization and find that larger models have better generalization bounds and are more compressible than smaller models.</description>

      <title>On Stronger Computational Separations Between Multimodal and Unimodal Machine Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.02254</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.02254v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Recently, multimodal machine learning has enjoyed huge empirical success (e.g. GPT-4). Motivated to develop theoretical justification for this empirical success, Lu (NeurIPS '23, ALT '24) introduces a theory of multimodal learning, and considers possible \textit{separations} between theoretical models of multimodal and unimodal learning. In particular, Lu (ALT '24) shows a computational separation, which is relevant to \textit{worst-case} instances of the learning task. In this paper, we give a stronger \textit{average-case} computational separation, where for ``typical'' instances of the learning task, unimodal learning is computationally hard, but multimodal learning is easy. We then question how ``natural'' the average-case separation is. Would it be encountered in practice? To this end, we prove that under basic conditions, any given computational separation between average-case unimodal and multimodal learning tasks implies a corresponding cryptographic key agreement protocol. We suggest to interpret this as evidence that very strong \textit{computational} advantages of multimodal learning may arise \textit{infrequently} in practice, since they exist only for the ``pathological'' case of inherently cryptographic distributions. However, this does not apply to possible (super-polynomial) \textit{statistical} advantages.</description>

      <title>Rate-Preserving Reductions for Blackwell Approachability</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.07585</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.07585v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Abernethy et al. (2011) showed that Blackwell approachability and no-regret learning are equivalent, in the sense that any algorithm that solves a specific Blackwell approachability instance can be converted to a sublinear regret algorithm for a specific no-regret learning instance, and vice versa. In this paper, we study a more fine-grained form of such reductions, and ask when this translation between problems preserves not only a sublinear rate of convergence, but also preserves the optimal rate of convergence. That is, in which cases does it suffice to find the optimal regret bound for a no-regret learning instance in order to find the optimal rate of convergence for a corresponding approachability instance?
  We show that the reduction of Abernethy et al. (2011) does not preserve rates: their reduction may reduce a $d$-dimensional approachability instance $I_1$ with optimal convergence rate $R_1$ to a no-regret learning instance $I_2$ with optimal regret-per-round of $R_2$, with $R_{2}/R_{1}$ arbitrarily large (in particular, it is possible that $R_1 = 0$ and $R_{2} &gt; 0$). On the other hand, we show that it is possible to tightly reduce any approachability instance to an instance of a generalized form of regret minimization we call improper $\phi$-regret minimization (a variant of the $\phi$-regret minimization of Gordon et al. (2008) where the transformation functions may map actions outside of the action set).
  Finally, we characterize when linear transformations suffice to reduce improper $\phi$-regret minimization problems to standard classes of regret minimization problems in a rate preserving manner. We prove that some improper $\phi$-regret minimization instances cannot be reduced to either subclass of instance in this way, suggesting that approachability can capture some problems that cannot be phrased in the language of online learning.</description>

      <title>Split Conformal Prediction under Data Contamination</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.07700v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Conformal prediction is a non-parametric technique for constructing prediction intervals or sets from arbitrary predictive models under the assumption that the data is exchangeable. It is popular as it comes with theoretical guarantees on the marginal coverage of the prediction sets and the split conformal prediction variant has a very low computational cost compared to model training. We study the robustness of split conformal prediction in a data contamination setting, where we assume a small fraction of the calibration scores are drawn from a different distribution than the bulk. We quantify the impact of the corrupted data on the coverage and efficiency of the constructed sets when evaluated on "clean" test points, and verify our results with numerical experiments. Moreover, we propose an adjustment in the classification setting which we call Contamination Robust Conformal Prediction, and verify the efficacy of our approach using both synthetic and real datasets.</description>

      <title>Representation of Context-Specific Causal Models with Observational and Interventional Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2101.09271</link>
      <description>arXiv:2101.09271v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We address the problem of representing context-specific causal models based on both observational and experimental data collected under general (e.g. hard or soft) interventions by introducing a new family of context-specific conditional independence models called CStrees. This family is defined via a novel factorization criterion that allows for a generalization of the factorization property defining general interventional DAG models. We derive a graphical characterization of model equivalence for observational CStrees that extends the Verma and Pearl criterion for DAGs. This characterization is then extended to CStree models under general, context-specific interventions. To obtain these results, we formalize a notion of context-specific intervention that can be incorporated into concise graphical representations of CStree models. We relate CStrees to other context-specific models, showing that the families of DAGs, CStrees, labeled DAGs and staged trees form a strict chain of inclusions. We end with an application of interventional CStree models to a real data set, revealing the context-specific nature of the data dependence structure and the soft, interventional perturbations.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2102.06635v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper studies the expressive power of artificial neural networks with rectified linear units. In order to study them as a model of real-valued computation, we introduce the concept of Max-Affine Arithmetic Programs and show equivalence between them and neural networks concerning natural complexity measures. We then use this result to show that two fundamental combinatorial optimization problems can be solved with polynomial-size neural networks. First, we show that for any undirected graph with $n$ nodes, there is a neural network (with fixed weights and biases) of size $\mathcal{O}(n^3)$ that takes the edge weights as input and computes the value of a minimum spanning tree of the graph. Second, we show that for any directed graph with $n$ nodes and $m$ arcs, there is a neural network of size $\mathcal{O}(m^2n^2)$ that takes the arc capacities as input and computes a maximum flow. Our results imply that these two problems can be solved with strongly polynomial time algorithms that solely use affine transformations and maxima computations, but no comparison-based branchings.</description>

      <title>Towards Lower Bounds on the Depth of ReLU Neural Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2105.14835</link>
      <description>arXiv:2105.14835v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We contribute to a better understanding of the class of functions that can be represented by a neural network with ReLU activations and a given architecture. Using techniques from mixed-integer optimization, polyhedral theory, and tropical geometry, we provide a mathematical counterbalance to the universal approximation theorems which suggest that a single hidden layer is sufficient for learning any function. In particular, we investigate whether the class of exactly representable functions strictly increases by adding more layers (with no restrictions on size). As a by-product of our investigations, we settle an old conjecture about piecewise linear functions by Wang and Sun (2005) in the affirmative. We also present upper bounds on the sizes of neural networks required to represent functions with logarithmic depth.</description>

      <title>Chaotic Hedging with Iterated Integrals and Neural Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2209.10166</link>
      <description>arXiv:2209.10166v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we extend the Wiener-Ito chaos decomposition to the class of continuous semimartingales that are exponentially integrable, which includes in particular affine and some polynomial diffusion processes. By omitting the orthogonality in the expansion, we are able to show that every $p$-integrable functional of the semimartingale, for $p \in [1,\infty)$, can be represented as a sum of iterated integrals thereof. Using finitely many terms of this expansion and (possibly random) neural networks for the integrands, whose parameters are learned in a machine learning setting, we show that every financial derivative can be approximated arbitrarily well in the $L^p$-sense. In particular, for $p = 2$, we recover the optimal hedging strategy in the sense of quadratic hedging. Moreover, since the hedging strategy of the approximating option can be computed in closed form, we obtain an efficient algorithm to approximately replicate any sufficiently integrable financial derivative within short runtime.</description>

      <title>Lightning Fast Video Anomaly Detection via Adversarial Knowledge Distillation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2211.15597</link>
      <description>arXiv:2211.15597v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We propose a very fast frame-level model for anomaly detection in video, which learns to detect anomalies by distilling knowledge from multiple highly accurate object-level teacher models. To improve the fidelity of our student, we distill the low-resolution anomaly maps of the teachers by jointly applying standard and adversarial distillation, introducing an adversarial discriminator for each teacher to distinguish between target and generated anomaly maps. We conduct experiments on three benchmarks (Avenue, ShanghaiTech, UCSD Ped2), showing that our method is over 7 times faster than the fastest competing method, and between 28 and 62 times faster than object-centric models, while obtaining comparable results to recent methods. Our evaluation also indicates that our model achieves the best trade-off between speed and accuracy, due to its previously unheard-of speed of 1480 FPS. In addition, we carry out a comprehensive ablation study to justify our architectural design choices. Our code is freely available at: https://github.com/ristea/fast-aed.</description>

      <title>Position: Considerations for Differentially Private Learning with Large-Scale Public Pretraining</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2212.06470</link>
      <description>arXiv:2212.06470v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The performance of differentially private machine learning can be boosted significantly by leveraging the transfer learning capabilities of non-private models pretrained on large public datasets. We critically review this approach.
  We primarily question whether the use of large Web-scraped datasets should be viewed as differential-privacy-preserving. We caution that publicizing these models pretrained on Web data as "private" could lead to harm and erode the public's trust in differential privacy as a meaningful definition of privacy.
  Beyond the privacy considerations of using public data, we further question the utility of this paradigm. We scrutinize whether existing machine learning benchmarks are appropriate for measuring the ability of pretrained models to generalize to sensitive domains, which may be poorly represented in public Web data. Finally, we notice that pretraining has been especially impactful for the largest available models -- models sufficiently large to prohibit end users running them on their own devices. Thus, deploying such models today could be a net loss for privacy, as it would require (private) data to be outsourced to a more compute-powerful third party.
  We conclude by discussing potential paths forward for the field of private learning, as public pretraining becomes more popular and powerful.</description>

      <title>Mode Connectivity in Auction Design</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.11005</link>
      <description>arXiv:2305.11005v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Optimal auction design is a fundamental problem in algorithmic game theory. This problem is notoriously difficult already in very simple settings. Recent work in differentiable economics showed that neural networks can efficiently learn known optimal auction mechanisms and discover interesting new ones. In an attempt to theoretically justify their empirical success, we focus on one of the first such networks, RochetNet, and a generalized version for affine maximizer auctions. We prove that they satisfy mode connectivity, i.e., locally optimal solutions are connected by a simple, piecewise linear path such that every solution on the path is almost as good as one of the two local optima. Mode connectivity has been recently investigated as an intriguing empirical and theoretically justifiable property of neural networks used for prediction problems. Our results give the first such analysis in the context of differentiable economics, where neural networks are used directly for solving non-convex optimization problems.</description>

      <title>Investigating Adversarial Vulnerability and Implicit Bias through Frequency Analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.15203</link>
      <description>arXiv:2305.15203v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Despite their impressive performance in classification tasks, neural networks are known to be vulnerable to adversarial attacks, subtle perturbations of the input data designed to deceive the model. In this work, we investigate the relation between these perturbations and the implicit bias of neural networks trained with gradient-based algorithms. To this end, we analyse the network's implicit bias through the lens of the Fourier transform. Specifically, we identify the minimal and most critical frequencies necessary for accurate classification or misclassification respectively for each input image and its adversarially perturbed version, and uncover the correlation among those. To this end, among other methods, we use a newly introduced technique capable of detecting non-linear correlations between high-dimensional datasets. Our results provide empirical evidence that the network bias in Fourier space and the target frequencies of adversarial attacks are highly correlated and suggest new potential strategies for adversarial defence.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2310.10611v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Distribution shifts pose significant challenges for model calibration and model selection tasks in the unsupervised domain adaptation problem -- a scenario where the goal is to perform well in a distribution shifted domain without labels. In this work, we tackle difficulties coming from distribution shifts by developing a novel importance weighted group accuracy estimator. Specifically, we present a new perspective of addressing the model calibration and model selection tasks by estimating the group accuracy. Then, we formulate an optimization problem for finding an importance weight that leads to an accurate group accuracy estimation with theoretical analyses. Our extensive experiments show that our approach improves state-of-the-art performances by 22% in the model calibration task and 14% in the model selection task.</description>

      <title>Learning in Deep Factor Graphs with Gaussian Belief Propagation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2311.14649v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We propose an approach to do learning in Gaussian factor graphs. We treat all relevant quantities (inputs, outputs, parameters, latents) as random variables in a graphical model, and view both training and prediction as inference problems with different observed nodes. Our experiments show that these problems can be efficiently solved with belief propagation (BP), whose updates are inherently local, presenting exciting opportunities for distributed and asynchronous training. Our approach can be scaled to deep networks and provides a natural means to do continual learning: use the BP-estimated parameter marginals of the current task as parameter priors for the next. On a video denoising task we demonstrate the benefit of learnable parameters over a classical factor graph approach and we show encouraging performance of deep factor graphs for continual image classification.</description>

      <title>Enhancing Gaussian Process Surrogates for Optimization and Posterior Approximation via Random Exploration</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.17037</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.17037v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper proposes novel noise-free Bayesian optimization strategies that rely on a random exploration step to enhance the accuracy of Gaussian process surrogate models. The new algorithms retain the ease of implementation of the classical GP-UCB algorithm, but the additional random exploration step accelerates their convergence, nearly achieving the optimal convergence rate. Furthermore, to facilitate Bayesian inference with an intractable likelihood, we propose to utilize optimization iterates for maximum a posteriori estimation to build a Gaussian process surrogate model for the unnormalized log-posterior density. We provide bounds for the Hellinger distance between the true and the approximate posterior distributions in terms of the number of design points. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our Bayesian optimization algorithms in non-convex benchmark objective functions, in a machine learning hyperparameter tuning problem, and in a black-box engineering design problem. The effectiveness of our posterior approximation approach is demonstrated in two Bayesian inference problems for parameters of dynamical systems.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2402.08018v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Score function estimation is the cornerstone of both training and sampling from diffusion generative models. Despite this fact, the most commonly used estimators are either biased neural network approximations or high variance Monte Carlo estimators based on the conditional score. We introduce a novel nearest neighbour score function estimator which utilizes multiple samples from the training set to dramatically decrease estimator variance. We leverage our low variance estimator in two compelling applications. Training consistency models with our estimator, we report a significant increase in both convergence speed and sample quality. In diffusion models, we show that our estimator can replace a learned network for probability-flow ODE integration, opening promising new avenues of future research.</description>

      <title>Universal Lower Bounds and Optimal Rates: Achieving Minimax Clustering Error in Sub-Exponential Mixture Models</title>

      <description>arXiv:2402.15432v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Clustering is a pivotal challenge in unsupervised machine learning and is often investigated through the lens of mixture models. The optimal error rate for recovering cluster labels in Gaussian and sub-Gaussian mixture models involves ad hoc signal-to-noise ratios. Simple iterative algorithms, such as Lloyd's algorithm, attain this optimal error rate. In this paper, we first establish a universal lower bound for the error rate in clustering any mixture model, expressed through a Chernoff divergence, a more versatile measure of model information than signal-to-noise ratios. We then demonstrate that iterative algorithms attain this lower bound in mixture models with sub-exponential tails, notably emphasizing location-scale mixtures featuring Laplace-distributed errors. Additionally, for datasets better modelled by Poisson or Negative Binomial mixtures, we study mixture models whose distributions belong to an exponential family. In such mixtures, we establish that Bregman hard clustering, a variant of Lloyd's algorithm employing a Bregman divergence, is rate optimal.</description>

      <title>Minimum-Norm Interpolation Under Covariate Shift</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.00522v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Transfer learning is a critical part of real-world machine learning deployments and has been extensively studied in experimental works with overparameterized neural networks. However, even in the simplest setting of linear regression a notable gap still exists in the theoretical understanding of transfer learning. In-distribution research on high-dimensional linear regression has led to the identification of a phenomenon known as \textit{benign overfitting}, in which linear interpolators overfit to noisy training labels and yet still generalize well. This behavior occurs under specific conditions on the source covariance matrix and input data dimension. Therefore, it is natural to wonder how such high-dimensional linear models behave under transfer learning. We prove the first non-asymptotic excess risk bounds for benignly-overfit linear interpolators in the transfer learning setting. From our analysis, we propose a taxonomy of \textit{beneficial} and \textit{malignant} covariate shifts based on the degree of overparameterization. We follow our analysis with empirical studies that show these beneficial and malignant covariate shifts for linear interpolators on real image data, and for fully-connected neural networks in settings where the input data dimension is larger than the training sample size.</description>

      <title>Towards Scalable Automated Alignment of LLMs: A Survey</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.01252v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Alignment is the most critical step in building large language models (LLMs) that meet human needs. With the rapid development of LLMs gradually surpassing human capabilities, traditional alignment methods based on human-annotation are increasingly unable to meet the scalability demands. Therefore, there is an urgent need to explore new sources of automated alignment signals and technical approaches. In this paper, we systematically review the recently emerging methods of automated alignment, attempting to explore how to achieve effective, scalable, automated alignment once the capabilities of LLMs exceed those of humans. Specifically, we categorize existing automated alignment methods into 4 major categories based on the sources of alignment signals and discuss the current status and potential development of each category. Additionally, we explore the underlying mechanisms that enable automated alignment and discuss the essential factors that make automated alignment technologies feasible and effective from the fundamental role of alignment.</description>

      <title>Positive and Unlabeled Data: Model, Estimation, Inference, and Classification</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.09735</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.09735v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This study introduces a new approach to addressing positive and unlabeled (PU) data through the double exponential tilting model (DETM). Traditional methods often fall short because they only apply to selected completely at random (SCAR) PU data, where the labeled positive and unlabeled positive data are assumed to be from the same distribution. In contrast, our DETM's dual structure effectively accommodates the more complex and underexplored selected at random PU data, where the labeled and unlabeled positive data can be from different distributions. We rigorously establish the theoretical foundations of DETM, including identifiability, parameter estimation, and asymptotic properties. Additionally, we move forward to statistical inference by developing a goodness-of-fit test for the SCAR condition and constructing confidence intervals for the proportion of positive instances in the target domain. We leverage an approximated Bayes classifier for classification tasks, demonstrating DETM's robust performance in prediction. Through theoretical insights and practical applications, this study highlights DETM as a comprehensive framework for addressing the challenges of PU data.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.11069v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This survey provides an overview of combining Federated Learning (FL) and control to enhance adaptability, scalability, generalization, and privacy in (nonlinear) control applications. Traditional control methods rely on controller design models, but real-world scenarios often require online model retuning or learning. FL offers a distributed approach to model training, enabling collaborative learning across distributed devices while preserving data privacy. By keeping data localized, FL mitigates concerns regarding privacy and security while reducing network bandwidth requirements for communication. This survey summarizes the state-of-the-art concepts and ideas of combining FL and control. The methodical benefits are further discussed, culminating in a detailed overview of expected applications, from dynamical system modeling over controller design, focusing on adaptive control, to knowledge transfer in multi-agent decision-making systems.</description>
