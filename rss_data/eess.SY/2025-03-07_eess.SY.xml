      <title>Vibration Analysis and Mitigation in Semiconductor Motion Stages Using DMAIC Methodology- A Case Study</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.04019</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.04019v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Motion stages are critical in semiconductor manufacturing equipment for processes like die bonding, wafer loading, and chip packaging, as their performance must meet the industry's stringent precision requirements. Vibration, a significant yet often overlooked adversary to precision motion stages, is challenging to identify and mitigate due to its subtle nature. This study, conducted at a motion stage manufacturer facing frequent vibration-related complaints, proposes a novel approach to resolving vibration issues. By leveraging the DMAIC methodology, it introduces VIBGUARD, an active vibration monitoring and mitigation solution, instead of solely focusing on traditional hardware vibration control. This comprehensive strategy enhances value and competitiveness, increasing UPH (units per hour) by 15.3% from 8,500 to 9,800 and reducing downtime by 68.2% from 2.2 to 0.7 occurrences per month. This case study and the DMAIC methodology offer valuable resources for quality control and problem analysis in the semiconductor industry.</description>

      <title>Formally Verified Neural Network Controllers for Incremental Input-to-State Stability of Unknown Discrete-Time Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.04129</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.04129v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This work aims to synthesize a controller that ensures that an unknown discrete-time system is incrementally input-to-state stable ($\delta$-ISS). In this work, we introduce the notion of $\delta$-ISS control Lyapunov function ($\delta$-ISS-CLF), which, in conjunction with the controller, ensures that the closed-loop system is incrementally ISS. To address the unknown dynamics of the system, we parameterize the controller as well as the $\delta$-ISS-CLF as neural networks and learn them by utilizing the sampled data from the state space of the unknown system. To formally verify the obtained $\delta$-ISS-CLF, we develop a validity condition and incorporate the condition into the training framework to ensure a provable correctness guarantee at the end of the training process. Finally, the usefulness of the proposed approach is proved using multiple case studies - the first one is a scalar system with a non-affine non-polynomial structure, the second example is a one-link manipulator system, the third system is a nonlinear Moore-Grietzer model of the jet engine and the final one is a rotating rigid spacecraft model.</description>

      <title>Personalized Emotion Detection from Floor Vibrations Induced by Footsteps</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.04190</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.04190v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Emotion recognition is critical for various applications such as early detection of mental health disorders and emotion based smart home systems. Previous studies used various sensing methods for emotion recognition, such as wearable sensors, cameras, and microphones. However, these methods have limitations in long term domestic, including intrusiveness and privacy concerns. To overcome these limitations, this paper introduces a nonintrusive and privacy friendly personalized emotion recognition system, EmotionVibe, which leverages footstep induced floor vibrations for emotion recognition. The main idea of EmotionVibe is that individuals' emotional states influence their gait patterns, subsequently affecting the floor vibrations induced by their footsteps. However, there are two main research challenges: 1) the complex and indirect relationship between human emotions and footstep induced floor vibrations and 2) the large between person variations within the relationship between emotions and gait patterns. To address these challenges, we first empirically characterize this complex relationship and develop an emotion sensitive feature set including gait related and vibration related features from footstep induced floor vibrations. Furthermore, we personalize the emotion recognition system for each user by calculating gait similarities between the target person (i.e., the person whose emotions we aim to recognize) and those in the training dataset and assigning greater weights to training people with similar gait patterns in the loss function. We evaluated our system in a real-world walking experiment with 20 participants, summing up to 37,001 footstep samples. EmotionVibe achieved the mean absolute error (MAE) of 1.11 and 1.07 for valence and arousal score estimations, respectively, reflecting 19.0% and 25.7% error reduction compared to the baseline method.</description>

      <title>Digital twin with automatic disturbance detection for an expert-controlled SAG mill</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.04225</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.04225v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study presents the development and validation of a digital twin for a semi-autogenous grinding (SAG) mill controlled by an expert system. The digital twin integrates three key components of the closed-loop operation: (1) fuzzy logic for expert control, (2) a state-space model for regulatory control, and (3) a recurrent neural network to simulate the SAG mill process. The digital twin is combined with a statistical framework for automatically detecting process disturbances (or critical operations), which triggers model retraining only when deviations from expected behaviour are identified, ensuring continuous updates with new data to enhance the SAG supervision. The model was trained with 68 hours of operational industrial data and validated with an additional 8 hours, allowing it to predict mill behaviour within a 2.5-minute horizon at 30-second intervals with errors smaller than 5%.</description>

      <title>Performance Analysis of Multirate Systems: A Direct Frequency-Domain Identification Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.04248</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.04248v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Frequency-domain performance analysis of intersample behavior in sampled-data and multirate systems is challenging due to the lack of a frequency-separation principle, and systematic identification techniques are lacking. The aim of this \manuscript is to develop an efficient technique for identifying the full intersample performance in the frequency-domain for closed-loop multirate systems, in particular the Performance Frequency Gain (PFG). Through local modeling techniques, aliased frequency components are effectively disentangled when identifying the PFG, which is directly facilitated by frequency-lifting the multirate system to a multivariable time-invariant representation. The developed method accurately and directly identifies the PFG in a single identification experiment. Finally, the developed method is experimentally validated on a prototype motion system, showing accurate identification of frequency-domain representations for the multirate system, including the PFG.</description>

      <title>Stability analysis for nonlinear compressor system and active adaptive controller against surge with antisurge valve</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.04337</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.04337v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, a compressor system is analyzed in order to show its characteristics and design a control scheme to improve its efficiency. A mathematical technique has been created to forecast the onset of surge and instability in a compressor chart, drawing from the nonlinear Greitzer and Moore model. This approach employs the phase plane and Jacobian matrix to identify both stable and unstable regions within the compressor, as well as to capture the limit cycle within the unstable region. A predictive analytical approach for anticipating compressor surge and instability is of great importance in system instrumentation and control. State space model is built up by nonlinear Greitzer equations. Validation from previous study about especial compressor will be considered for evaluation of mathematic method. Upstream flow acts as a disturbance to control loop and controller cannot satisfy desired requirements with flow variances, ergo it is essential that controller is adapted to new conditions. Since control signal is linearly related to system output, a PD controller is used to control compressor system. An adaptive PD controller is designed with MRAS method based on a reference model. Adaptive controller can stabilize compressor and increase its efficiency in the presence of any disturbances. Simulation results shows that an adaptive controller can provide good performance and convergence in case of speed changes by adapting gain parameters, and adaptive will be compared with normal PID. Finally, controller stability is investigated.</description>

      <title>Proactive Robust Hardening of Resilient Power Distribution Network: Decision-Dependent Uncertainty Modeling and Fast Solution Strategy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.04375</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.04375v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: To address the power system hardening problem, traditional approaches often adopt robust optimization (RO) that considers a fixed set of concerned contingencies, regardless of the fact that hardening some components actually renders relevant contingencies impractical. In this paper, we directly adopt a dynamic uncertainty set that explicitly incorporates the impact of hardening decisions on the worst-case contingencies, which leads to a decision-dependent uncertainty (DDU) set. Then, a DDU-based robust-stochastic optimization (DDU-RSO) model is proposed to support the hardening decisions on distribution lines and distributed generators (DGs). Also, the randomness of load variations and available storage levels is considered through stochastic programming (SP) in the innermost level problem. Various corrective measures (e.g., the joint scheduling of DGs and energy storage) are included, coupling with a finite support of stochastic scenarios, for resilience enhancement. To relieve the computation burden of this new hardening formulation, an enhanced customization of parametric column-and-constraint generation (P-C&amp;CG) algorithm is developed. By leveraging the network structural information, the enhancement strategies based on resilience importance indices are designed to improve the convergence performance. Numerical results on 33-bus and 118-bus test distribution networks have demonstrated the effectiveness of DDU-RSO aided hardening scheme. Furthermore, in comparison to existing solution methods, the enhanced P-C&amp;CG has achieved a superior performance by reducing the solution time by a few orders of magnitudes.</description>

      <title>AOLO: Analysis and Optimization For Low-Carbon Oriented Wireless Large Language Model Services</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.04418</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.04418v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent advancements in large language models (LLMs) have led to their widespread adoption and large-scale deployment across various domains. However, their environmental impact, particularly during inference, has become a growing concern due to their substantial energy consumption and carbon footprint. Existing research has focused on inference computation alone, overlooking the analysis and optimization of carbon footprint in network-aided LLM service systems. To address this gap, we propose AOLO, a framework for analysis and optimization for low-carbon oriented wireless LLM services. AOLO introduces a comprehensive carbon footprint model that quantifies greenhouse gas emissions across the entire LLM service chain, including computational inference and wireless communication. Furthermore, we formulate an optimization problem aimed at minimizing the overall carbon footprint, which is solved through joint optimization of inference outputs and transmit power under quality-of-experience and system performance constraints. To achieve this joint optimization, we leverage the energy efficiency of spiking neural networks (SNNs) by adopting SNN as the actor network and propose a low-carbon-oriented optimization algorithm, i.e., SNN-based deep reinforcement learning (SDRL). Comprehensive simulations demonstrate that SDRL algorithm significantly reduces overall carbon footprint, achieving an 18.77% reduction compared to the benchmark soft actor-critic, highlighting its potential for enabling more sustainable LLM inference services.</description>

      <title>Structural Damping Identification Sensitivity in Flutter Speed Estimation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.04433</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.04433v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Predicting flutter remains a key challenge in aeroelastic research, with certain models relying on modal parameters, such as natural frequencies and damping ratios. These models are particularly useful in early design stages or for the development of small UAVs (maximum take-off mass below 7 kg). This study evaluates two frequency-domain system identification methods, Fast Relaxed Vector Fitting (FRVF) and the Loewner Framework (LF), for predicting the flutter onset speed of a flexible wing model. Both methods are applied to extract modal parameters from Ground Vibration Testing data, which are subsequently used to develop a reduced-order model with two degrees of freedom. Results indicate that FRVF and LFinformed models provide reliable flutter speed, with predictions deviating by no more than 3% (FRVF) and 5% (LF) from the N4SID-informed benchmark. The findings highlight the sensitivity of flutter speed predictions to damping ratio identification accuracy and demonstrate the potential of these methods as computationally efficient alternatives for preliminary aeroelastic assessments.</description>

      <title>Grid-Aware Islanding and Resynchronisation of AC/DC Microgrids</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.04597</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.04597v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper proposes an optimal, grid-aware control framework for the islanding, island-operation and resynchronisation of hybrid AC/DC microgrids. The optimal control framework is based on a formally derived linearized load-flow model for multiterminal hybrid AC/DC networks. The load flow model integrates the AC grid, DC grid, and interfacing converters (IC) into a unified representation. This work extends an existing load flow model to include the ICs' grid-forming operation.
  In traditional islanding control frameworks, the grid-forming converter is typically interfaced with an energy storage system that can provide bidirectional power to maintain the power balance. The proposed framework, however, allows the ICs to operate as the grid-forming unit while being connected to a DC grid rather than a single resource. This configuration allows for a wider operating range and, thus, a more flexible control. Furthermore, the optimal grid-aware control framework can steer the system to ensure a feasible operation without any grid constraint violations before, during, and after the islanding manoeuvre. The framework also guarantees smooth transitions, i.e., without any significant transient behaviour, when transitioning between grid-connected and islanding operations. The optimal control framework is experimentally validated on a 27-bus hybrid AC/DC network consisting of 3 ICs that interface the AC and DC networks. The hybrid grid hosts various controllable and stochastic resources.</description>

      <title>Multistage Economic MPC for Systems with a Cyclic Steady State: A Gas Network Case Study</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.04622</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.04622v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Multistage model predictive control (MPC) provides a robust control strategy for dynamic systems with uncertainties and a setpoint tracking objective. Moreover, extending MPC to minimize an economic cost instead of tracking a pre-calculated optimal setpoint improves controller performance. In this paper, we develop a formulation for multistage economic MPC which directly minimizes an economic objective function. The multistage economic MPC framework is extended for systems with a cyclic steady state (CSS) and stability is guaranteed by employing a Lyapunov-based stability constraint. The multistage economic MPC framework is validated on two natural gas network case studies to minimize the net energy consumption during gas transmission. In both instances, the multistage economic MPC effectively manages uncertain demands by preventing constraint violations and guides the network to its optimal cyclic operating conditions. The Lyapunov function remains bounded in both instances, validating the robust stability of the controller.</description>

      <title>An Extended State Space Model of Aggregated Electric Vehicles for Flexibility Estimation and Power Control</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.04714</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.04714v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The increasing penetration of electric vehicles (EVs) can provide substantial electricity to the grid, supporting the grids' stability. The state space model (SSM) has been proposed as an effective modeling method for power prediction and centralized control of aggregated EVs, offering low communication requirements and computational complexity. However, the SSM may overlook specific scenarios, leading to significant prediction and control inaccuracies. This paper proposes an extended state space model (eSSM) for aggregated EVs and develops associated control strategies. By accounting for the limited flexibility of fully charged and discharged EVs, the eSSM more accurately captures the state transition dynamics of EVs in various states of charge (SOC). Comprehensive simulations show that the eSSM will provide more accurate predictions of the flexibility and power trajectories of aggregated EVs, and more effectively tracks real-time power references compared to the conventional SSM method.</description>

      <title>Fair Play in the Fast Lane: Integrating Sportsmanship into Autonomous Racing Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.03774</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.03774v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Autonomous racing has gained significant attention as a platform for high-speed decision-making and motion control. While existing methods primarily focus on trajectory planning and overtaking strategies, the role of sportsmanship in ensuring fair competition remains largely unexplored. In human racing, rules such as the one-motion rule and the enough-space rule prevent dangerous and unsportsmanlike behavior. However, autonomous racing systems often lack mechanisms to enforce these principles, potentially leading to unsafe maneuvers. This paper introduces a bi-level game-theoretic framework to integrate sportsmanship (SPS) into versus racing. At the high level, we model racing intentions using a Stackelberg game, where Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) is employed to derive optimal strategies. At the low level, vehicle interactions are formulated as a Generalized Nash Equilibrium Problem (GNEP), ensuring that all agents follow sportsmanship constraints while optimizing their trajectories. Simulation results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach in enforcing sportsmanship rules while maintaining competitive performance. We analyze different scenarios where attackers and defenders adhere to or disregard sportsmanship rules and show how knowledge of these constraints influences strategic decision-making. This work highlights the importance of balancing competition and fairness in autonomous racing and provides a foundation for developing ethical and safe AI-driven racing systems.</description>

      <title>Pretrained LLMs as Real-Time Controllers for Robot Operated Serial Production Line</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.03889</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.03889v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The manufacturing industry is undergoing a transformative shift, driven by cutting-edge technologies like 5G, AI, and cloud computing. Despite these advancements, effective system control, which is crucial for optimizing production efficiency, remains a complex challenge due to the intricate, knowledge-dependent nature of manufacturing processes and the reliance on domain-specific expertise. Conventional control methods often demand heavy customization, considerable computational resources, and lack transparency in decision-making. In this work, we investigate the feasibility of using Large Language Models (LLMs), particularly GPT-4, as a straightforward, adaptable solution for controlling manufacturing systems, specifically, mobile robot scheduling. We introduce an LLM-based control framework to assign mobile robots to different machines in robot assisted serial production lines, evaluating its performance in terms of system throughput. Our proposed framework outperforms traditional scheduling approaches such as First-Come-First-Served (FCFS), Shortest Processing Time (SPT), and Longest Processing Time (LPT). While it achieves performance that is on par with state-of-the-art methods like Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning (MARL), it offers a distinct advantage by delivering comparable throughput without the need for extensive retraining. These results suggest that the proposed LLM-based solution is well-suited for scenarios where technical expertise, computational resources, and financial investment are limited, while decision transparency and system scalability are critical concerns.</description>

      <title>Safe LLM-Controlled Robots with Formal Guarantees via Reachability Analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.03911</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.03911v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The deployment of Large Language Models (LLMs) in robotic systems presents unique safety challenges, particularly in unpredictable environments. Although LLMs, leveraging zero-shot learning, enhance human-robot interaction and decision-making capabilities, their inherent probabilistic nature and lack of formal guarantees raise significant concerns for safety-critical applications. Traditional model-based verification approaches often rely on precise system models, which are difficult to obtain for real-world robotic systems and may not be fully trusted due to modeling inaccuracies, unmodeled dynamics, or environmental uncertainties. To address these challenges, this paper introduces a safety assurance framework for LLM-controlled robots based on data-driven reachability analysis, a formal verification technique that ensures all possible system trajectories remain within safe operational limits. Our framework specifically investigates the problem of instructing an LLM to navigate the robot to a specified goal and assesses its ability to generate low-level control actions that successfully guide the robot safely toward that goal. By leveraging historical data to construct reachable sets of states for the robot-LLM system, our approach provides rigorous safety guarantees against unsafe behaviors without relying on explicit analytical models. We validate the framework through experimental case studies in autonomous navigation and task planning, demonstrating its effectiveness in mitigating risks associated with LLM-generated commands. This work advances the integration of formal methods into LLM-based robotics, offering a principled and practical approach to ensuring safety in next-generation autonomous systems.</description>

      <title>Equivariant Filter Design for Range-only SLAM</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.03973</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.03973v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Range-only Simultaneous Localisation and Mapping (RO-SLAM) is of interest due to its practical applications in ultra-wideband (UWB) and Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) localisation in terrestrial and aerial applications and acoustic beacon localisation in submarine applications. In this work, we consider a mobile robot equipped with an inertial measurement unit (IMU) and a range sensor that measures distances to a collection of fixed landmarks. We derive an equivariant filter (EqF) for the RO-SLAM problem based on a symmetry Lie group that is compatible with the range measurements. The proposed filter does not require bootstrapping or initialisation of landmark positions, and demonstrates robustness to the no-prior situation. The filter is demonstrated on a real-world dataset, and it is shown to significantly outperform a state-of-the-art EKF alternative in terms of both accuracy and robustness.</description>

      <title>Autonomous Robotic Bone Micro-Milling System with Automatic Calibration and 3D Surface Fitting</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.04038</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.04038v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Automating bone micro-milling using a robotic system presents challenges due to the uncertainties in both the external and internal features of bone tissue. For example, during a mouse cranial window creation, a circular path with a radius of 2 to 4 mm needs to be milled on the mouse skull using a microdrill. The uneven surface and non-uniform thickness of the mouse skull make it difficult to fully automate this process, requiring the system to possess advanced perceptual and adaptive capabilities. In this study, we propose an automatic calibration and 3D surface fitting method and integrate it into an autonomous robotic bone micro-milling system, enabling it to quickly, in real-time, and accurately perceive and adapt to the uneven surface and non-uniform thickness of the target without human assistance. Validation experiments on euthanized mice demonstrate that the improved system achieves a success rate of 85.7 % and an average milling time of 2.1 minutes, showing not only significant performance improvements over the previous system but also exceptional accuracy, speed, and stability compared to human operators.</description>

      <title>Object State Estimation Through Robotic Active Interaction for Biological Autonomous Drilling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.04043</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.04043v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Estimating the state of biological specimens is challenging due to limited observation through microscopic vision. For instance, during mouse skull drilling, the appearance alters little when thinning bone tissue because of its semi-transparent property and the high-magnification microscopic vision. To obtain the object's state, we introduce an object state estimation method for biological specimens through active interaction based on the deflection. The method is integrated to enhance the autonomous drilling system developed in our previous work. The method and integrated system were evaluated through 12 autonomous eggshell drilling experiment trials. The results show that the system achieved a 91.7% successful ratio and 75% detachable ratio, showcasing its potential applicability in more complex surgical procedures such as mouse skull craniotomy. This research paves the way for further development of autonomous robotic systems capable of estimating the object's state through active interaction.</description>

      <title>Quantitative Flow Approximation Properties of Narrow Neural ODEs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.04068</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.04068v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this note, we revisit the problem of flow approximation properties of neural ordinary differential equations (NODEs). The approximation properties have been considered as a flow controllability problem in recent literature. The neural ODE is considered {\it narrow} when the parameters have dimension equal to the input of the neural network, and hence have limited width. We derive the relation of narrow NODEs in approximating flows of shallow but wide NODEs. Due to existing results on approximation properties of shallow neural networks, this facilitates understanding which kind of flows of dynamical systems can be approximated using narrow neural ODEs. While approximation properties of narrow NODEs have been established in literature, the proofs often involve extensive constructions or require invoking deep controllability theorems from control theory. In this paper, we provide a simpler proof technique that involves only ideas from ODEs and Gr{\"o}nwall's lemma. Moreover, we provide an estimate on the number of switches needed for the time dependent weights of the narrow NODE to mimic the behavior of a NODE with a single layer wide neural network as the velocity field.</description>

      <title>Simulation-based Analysis Of Highway Trajectory Planning Using High-Order Polynomial For Highly Automated Driving Function</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.04159</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.04159v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: One of the fundamental tasks of autonomous driving is safe trajectory planning, the task of deciding where the vehicle needs to drive, while avoiding obstacles, obeying safety rules, and respecting the fundamental limits of road. Real-world application of such a method involves consideration of surrounding environment conditions and movements such as Lane Change, collision avoidance, and lane merge. The focus of the paper is to develop and implement safe collision free highway Lane Change trajectory using high order polynomial for Highly Automated Driving Function (HADF). Planning is often considered as a higher-level process than control. Behavior Planning Module (BPM) is designed that plans the high-level driving actions like Lane Change maneuver to safely achieve the functionality of transverse guidance ensuring safety of the vehicle using motion planning in a scenario including environmental situation. Based on the recommendation received from the (BPM), the function will generate a desire corresponding trajectory. The proposed planning system is situation specific with polynomial based algorithm for same direction two lane highway scenario. To support the trajectory system polynomial curve can be used to reduces overall complexity and thereby allows rapid computation. The proposed Lane Change scenario is modeled, and results has been analyzed (verified and validate) through the MATLAB simulation environment. The method proposed in this paper has achieved a significant improvement in safety and stability of Lane Changing maneuver.</description>

Abstract: This work considers a large class of systems composed of multiple quadrotors manipulating deformable and extensible cables. The cable is described via a discretized representation, which decomposes it into linear springs interconnected through lumped-mass passive spherical joints. Sets of flat outputs are found for the systems. Numerical simulations support the findings by showing cable manipulation relying on flatness-based trajectories. Eventually, we present an experimental validation of the effectiveness of the proposed discretized cable model for a two-robot example. Moreover, a closed-loop controller based on the identified model and using cable-output feedback is experimentally tested.</description>

      <title>Energy Consumption of Robotic Arm with the Local Reduction Method</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.04340</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.04340v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Energy consumption in robotic arms is a significant concern in industrial automation due to rising operational costs and environmental impact. This study investigates the use of a local reduction method to optimize energy efficiency in robotic systems without compromising performance. The approach refines movement parameters, minimizing energy use while maintaining precision and operational reliability. A three-joint robotic arm model was tested using simulation over a 30-second period for various tasks, including pick-and-place and trajectory-following operations. The results revealed that the local reduction method reduced energy consumption by up to 25% compared to traditional techniques such as Model Predictive Control (MPC) and Genetic Algorithms (GA). Unlike MPC, which requires significant computational resources, and GA, which has slow convergence rates, the local reduction method demonstrated superior adaptability and computational efficiency in real-time applications. The study highlights the scalability and simplicity of the local reduction approach, making it an attractive option for industries seeking sustainable and cost-effective solutions. Additionally, this method can integrate seamlessly with emerging technologies like Artificial Intelligence (AI), further enhancing its application in dynamic and complex environments. This research underscores the potential of the local reduction method as a practical tool for optimizing robotic arm operations, reducing energy demands, and contributing to sustainability in industrial automation. Future work will focus on extending the approach to real-world scenarios and incorporating AI-driven adjustments for more dynamic adaptability.</description>

      <title>On the Analysis of Stability, Sensitivity and Transparency in Variable Admittance Control for pHRI Enhanced by Virtual Fixtures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.04414</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.04414v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The interest in Physical Human-Robot Interaction (pHRI) has significantly increased over the last two decades thanks to the availability of collaborative robots that guarantee user safety during force exchanges. For this reason, stability concerns have been addressed extensively in the literature while proposing new control schemes for pHRI applications. Because of the nonlinear nature of robots, stability analyses generally leverage passivity concepts. On the other hand, the proposed algorithms generally consider ideal models of robot manipulators. For this reason, the primary objective of this paper is to conduct a detailed analysis of the sources of instability for a class of pHRI control schemes, namely proxy-based constrained admittance controllers, by considering parasitic effects such as transmission elasticity, motor velocity saturation, and actuation delay. Next, a sensitivity analysis supported by experimental results is carried out, in order to identify how the control parameters affect the stability of the overall system. Finally, an adaptation technique for the proxy parameters is proposed with the goal of maximizing transparency in pHRI. The proposed adaptation method is validated through both simulations and experimental tests.</description>

      <title>Occlusion-Aware Consistent Model Predictive Control for Robot Navigation in Occluded Obstacle-Dense Environments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.04563</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.04563v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Ensuring safety and motion consistency for robot navigation in occluded, obstacle-dense environments is a critical challenge. In this context, this study presents an occlusion-aware Consistent Model Predictive Control (CMPC) strategy. To account for the occluded obstacles, it incorporates adjustable risk regions that represent their potential future locations. Subsequently, dynamic risk boundary constraints are developed online to ensure safety. The CMPC then constructs multiple locally optimal trajectory branches (each tailored to different risk regions) to balance between exploitation and exploration. A shared consensus trunk is generated to ensure smooth transitions between branches without significant velocity fluctuations, further preserving motion consistency. To facilitate high computational efficiency and ensure coordination across local trajectories, we use the alternating direction method of multipliers (ADMM) to decompose the CMPC into manageable sub-problems for parallel solving. The proposed strategy is validated through simulation and real-world experiments on an Ackermann-steering robot platform. The results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed CMPC strategy through comparisons with baseline approaches in occluded, obstacle-dense environments.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.04581v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Most Wearable Ultrasound (WUS) devices lack the computational power to process signals at the edge, instead relying on remote offload, which introduces latency, high power consumption, and privacy concerns. We present Maestro, a RISC-V SoC with unified Vector-Tensor Unit (VTU) and memory-coupled Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) accelerators targeting edge processing for wearable ultrasound devices, fabricated using low-cost TSMC 65nm CMOS technology. The VTU achieves peak 302GFLOPS/W and 19.8GFLOPS at FP16, while the multi-precision 16/32-bit floating-point FFT accelerator delivers peak 60.6GFLOPS/W and 3.6GFLOPS at FP16, We evaluate Maestro on a US-based gesture recognition task, achieving 1.62GFLOPS in signal processing at 26.68GFLOPS/W, and 19.52GFLOPS in Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) workloads at 298.03GFLOPS/W. Compared to a state-of-the-art SoC with a similar mission profile, Maestro achieves a 5x speedup while consuming only 12mW, with an energy consumption of 2.5mJ in a wearable US channel preprocessing and ML-based postprocessing pipeline.</description>

      <title>Whole-Body Model-Predictive Control of Legged Robots with MuJoCo</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.04613v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We demonstrate the surprising real-world effectiveness of a very simple approach to whole-body model-predictive control (MPC) of quadruped and humanoid robots: the iterative LQR (iLQR) algorithm with MuJoCo dynamics and finite-difference approximated derivatives. Building upon the previous success of model-based behavior synthesis and control of locomotion and manipulation tasks with MuJoCo in simulation, we show that these policies can easily generalize to the real world with few sim-to-real considerations. Our baseline method achieves real-time whole-body MPC on a variety of hardware experiments, including dynamic quadruped locomotion, quadruped walking on two legs, and full-sized humanoid bipedal locomotion. We hope this easy-to-reproduce hardware baseline lowers the barrier to entry for real-world whole-body MPC research and contributes to accelerating research velocity in the community.

      <title>When Next-Gen Sensing Meets Legacy Wi-Fi: Performance Analyses of IEEE 802.11bf and IEEE 802.11ax Coexistence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.04637</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.04637v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Sensing is emerging as a vital future service in next-generation wireless networks, enabling applications such as object localization and activity recognition. The IEEE 802.11bf standard extends Wi-Fi capabilities to incorporate these sensing functionalities. However, coexistence with legacy Wi-Fi in densely populated networks poses challenges, as contention for channels can impair both sensing and communication quality. This paper develops an analytical framework and a system-level simulation in ns-3 to evaluate the coexistence of IEEE 802.11bf and legacy 802.11ax in terms of sensing delay and communication throughput. Forthis purpose, we have developed a dedicated ns-3 module forIEEE 802.11bf, which is made publicly available as open-source. We provide the first coexistence analysis between IEEE 802.11bfand IEEE 802.11ax, supported by link-level simulation in ns-3to assess the impact on sensing delay and network performance. Key parameters, including sensing intervals, access categories, network densities, and antenna configurations, are systematically analyzed to understand their influence on the sensing delay and aggregated network throughput. The evaluation is further extended to a realistic indoor office environment modeled after the 3GPP TR 38.901 standard. Our findings reveal key trade-offs between sensing intervals and throughput and the need for balanced sensing parameters to ensure effective coexistence in Wi-Fi networks.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.04668v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we propose a novel distributed data-driven optimization scheme. In particular, we focus on the so-called aggregative framework, namely, the scenario in which a set of agents aim to cooperatively minimize the sum of local costs, each depending on both local decision variables and an aggregation of all of them. We consider a data-driven setup in which each objective function is unknown and can be only sampled at a single point per iteration (thanks to, e.g., feedback from human users or physical sensors). We address this scenario through a distributed algorithm that combines three key components: (i) a learning part that leverages neural networks to learn the local cost functions descent direction, (ii) an optimization routine that steers the estimates according to the learned direction to minimize the global cost, and (iii) a tracking mechanism that locally reconstructs the unavailable global quantities. By using tools from system theory, i.e., timescale separation and averaging theory, we formally prove that, in strongly convex setups, the overall distributed strategy linearly converges in a neighborhood of the optimal solution whose radius depends on the given accuracy capabilities of the neural networks. Finally, we corroborate the theoretical results with numerical simulations.</description>

      <title>Controller Synthesis of Collaborative Signal Temporal Logic Tasks for Multi-Agent Systems via Assume-Guarantee Contracts</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.13499</link>
      <description>arXiv:2309.13499v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper considers the problem of controller synthesis of signal temporal logic (STL) specifications for large-scale multi-agent systems, where the agents are dynamically coupled and subject to collaborative tasks. A compositional framework based on continuous-time assume-guarantee contracts is developed to break the complex and large synthesis problem into subproblems of manageable sizes. We first show how to formulate the collaborative STL tasks as assume-guarantee contracts by leveraging the idea of funnel-based control. The concept of contracts is used to establish our compositionality result, which allows us to guarantee the satisfaction of a global contract by the multi-agent system when all agents satisfy their local contracts. Then, a closed-form continuous-time feedback controller is designed to enforce local contracts over the agents in a distributed manner, which further guarantees the global task satisfaction based on the compositionality result. Finally, the effectiveness of our results is demonstrated by two numerical examples.</description>

      <title>Dynamic Scheduling of a Multiclass Queue in the Halfin-Whitt Regime: A Computational Approach for High-Dimensional Problems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.18128</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.18128v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider a multi-class queueing model of a telephone call center, in which a system manager dynamically allocates available servers to customer calls. Calls can terminate through either service completion or customer abandonment, and the manager strives to minimize the expected total of holding costs plus abandonment costs over a finite horizon. Focusing on the Halfin-Whitt heavy traffic regime, we derive an approximating diffusion control problem, and building on earlier work by Beck et al. (2021), develop a simulation-based computational method for solution of such problems, one that relies heavily on deep neural network technology. Using this computational method, we propose a policy for the original (pre-limit) call center scheduling problem. Finally, the performance of this policy is assessed using test problems based on publicly available call center data. For the test problems considered so far, our policy does as well as or better than the best benchmark we could find. Moreover, our method is computationally feasible at least up to dimension 500, that is, for call centers with 500 or more distinct customer classes.</description>

      <title>Learning Li-ion battery health and degradation modes from data with aging-aware circuit models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.06639</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.06639v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Non-invasive estimation of Li-ion battery state-of-health from operational data is valuable for battery applications, but remains challenging. Pure model-based methods may suffer from inaccuracy and long-term instability of parameter estimates, whereas pure data-driven methods rely heavily on training data quality and quantity, causing lack of generality when extrapolating to unseen cases. We apply an aging-aware equivalent circuit model for health estimation, combining the flexibility of data-driven techniques within a model-based approach. A simplified electrical model with voltage source and resistor incorporates Gaussian process regression to learn capacity fade over time and also the dependence of resistance on operating conditions and time. The approach was validated against two datasets and shown to give accurate performance with less than 1% relative root mean square error (RMSE) in capacity and less than 2% mean absolute percentage error (MAPE). Critically, we show that the open circuit voltage versus state-of-charge function must be accurately known, and any inaccuracies or changes in this over time strongly influence the inferred resistance. However, this feature (or bug) may also be used to estimate in operando differential voltage curves from operational data.</description>

      <title>From Data to Predictive Control: A Framework for Stochastic Linear Systems with Output Measurements</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.17277</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.17277v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We introduce data to predictive control, D2PC, a framework to facilitate the design of robust and predictive controllers from data. The proposed framework is designed for discrete-time stochastic linear systems with output measurements and provides a principled design of a predictive controller based on data. The framework starts with a parameter identification method based on the Expectation-Maximization algorithm, which incorporates pre-defined structural constraints. Additionally, we provide an asymptotically correct method to quantify uncertainty in parameter estimates. Next, we develop a strategy to synthesize robust dynamic output-feedback controllers tailored to the derived uncertainty characterization. Finally, we introduce a predictive control scheme that guarantees recursive feasibility and satisfaction of chance constraints. This framework marks a significant advancement in integrating data into robust and predictive control schemes. We demonstrate the efficacy of D2PC through a numerical example involving a 10-dimensional spring-mass-damper system.</description>

      <title>Eavesdropping on Goal-Oriented Communication: Timing Attacks and Countermeasures</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.07088v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Goal-oriented communication is a new paradigm that considers the meaning of transmitted information to optimize communication. One possible application is the remote monitoring of a process under communication costs: scheduling updates based on goal-oriented considerations can significantly reduce transmission frequency while maintaining high-quality tracking performance. However, goal-oriented scheduling also opens a timing-based side-channel that an eavesdropper may exploit to obtain information about the state of the remote process, even if the content of updates is perfectly secure. In this work, we study an eavesdropping attack against pull-based goal-oriented scheduling for the tracking of remote Markov processes. We provide a theoretical framework for defining the effectiveness of the attack and of possible countermeasures, as well as a practical heuristic that can provide a balance between the performance gains offered by goal-oriented communication and the information leakage.</description>

      <title>Pitch Plane Trajectory Tracking Control for Sounding Rockets via Adaptive Feedback Linearization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.05285</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.05285v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper proposes a pitch plane trajectory tacking control solution for suborbital launch vehicles relying on adaptive feedback linearization. Initially, the 2D dynamics and kinematics for a single-engine, thrust-vector-controlled sounding rocket are obtained for control design purposes. Then, an inner-outer control strategy, which simultaneously tackles attitude and position control, is adopted, with the inner-loop comprising the altitude and pitch control and the outer-loop addressing the horizontal (downrange) position control. Feedback linearization is used to cancel out the non-linearities in both the inner and outer dynamics. Making use of Lyapunov stability theory, an adaptation law, which provides online estimates on the inner-loop aerodynamic uncertainty, is jointly designed with the output tracking controller via adaptive backstepping, ensuring global reference tracking in the region where the feedback linearization is well-defined. The zero dynamics of the inner-stabilized system are then exploited to obtain the outerloop dynamics and derive a Linear Quadratic Regulator (LQR) with integral action, which can stabilize them as well as reject external disturbances. In the outermost loop, the estimate on the correspondent aerodynamic uncertainty is indirectly obtained by using the inner loop estimates together with known aerodynamics relations. The resulting inner-outer position control solution is proven to be asymptotically stable in the region of interest. Using a single-stage sounding rocket, propelled by a liquid engine, as reference vehicle, different mission scenarios are tested in a simulation environment to verify the adaptability of the proposed control strategy. The system is able to track the requested trajectories while rejecting external wind disturbances. Furthermore, the need to re-tune the control gains in between different mission scenarios is minimal to none.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2502.15026v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper addresses the challenge of ensuring safety and feasibility in control systems using Control Barrier Functions (CBFs). Existing CBF-based Quadratic Programs (CBF-QPs) often encounter feasibility issues due to mixed relative degree constraints, input nullification problems, and the presence of tight or time-varying control bounds, which can lead to infeasible solutions and compromised safety. To address these challenges, we propose Auxiliary-Variable Adaptive Control Barrier Functions (AVCBFs), a novel framework that introduces auxiliary variables in auxiliary functions to dynamically adjust CBF constraints without the need of excessive additional constraints. The AVCBF method ensures that all components of the control input explicitly appear in the desired-order safety constraint, thereby improving feasibility while maintaining safety guarantees. Additionally, we introduce an automatic tuning method that iteratively adjusts AVCBF hyperparameters to ensure feasibility and safety with less conservatism. We demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach in adaptive cruise control and obstacle avoidance scenarios, showing that AVCBFs outperform existing CBF methods by reducing infeasibility and enhancing adaptive safety control under tight or time-varying control bounds.</description>

      <title>Tracking Control of Euler-Lagrangian Systems with Prescribed State, Input, and Temporal Constraints</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.01866</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.01866v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The synthesis of a smooth tracking control policy for Euler-Lagrangian (EL) systems with stringent regions of operation induced by state, input and temporal (SIT) constraints is a very challenging task. In contrast with existing methods that utilize prior knowledge of EL model parameters and uncertainty bounds, this study proposes an approximation-free adaptive barrier function-based control policy to ensure local prescribed time convergence of tracking error under state and input constraints. The proposed control policy accomplishes this by utilizing smooth time-based generator functions embedded in the filtered tracking error, which is combined with a saturation function that limits control action and confines states within the prescribed limits by enforcing the time-varying bounds on the filtered tracking error. Importantly, corresponding feasibility conditions pertaining to the minimum control authority, maximum disturbance rejection capability of the control policy, and the viable set of initial conditions are derived, illuminating the narrow operating domain of the EL systems arising from the interplay of SIT constraints. Numerical validation studies with three different robotic manipulators are employed to demonstrate the efficacy of the proposed scheme. A detailed performance comparison study with leading alternative designs is also undertaken to illustrate the superior performance of the proposed scheme.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2211.09619v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This text presents an introduction to an emerging paradigm in control of dynamical systems and differentiable reinforcement learning called online nonstochastic control. The new approach applies techniques from online convex optimization and convex relaxations to obtain new methods with provable guarantees for classical settings in optimal and robust control.
  The primary distinction between online nonstochastic control and other frameworks is the objective. In optimal control, robust control, and other control methodologies that assume stochastic noise, the goal is to perform comparably to an offline optimal strategy. In online nonstochastic control, both the cost functions as well as the perturbations from the assumed dynamical model are chosen by an adversary. Thus the optimal policy is not defined a priori. Rather, the target is to attain low regret against the best policy in hindsight from a benchmark class of policies.
  This objective suggests the use of the decision making framework of online convex optimization as an algorithmic methodology. The resulting methods are based on iterative mathematical optimization algorithms, and are accompanied by finite-time regret and computational complexity guarantees.</description>

      <title>Autonomous RISs and Oblivious Base Stations: The Observer Effect and its Mitigation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.10858</link>
      <description>arXiv:2304.10858v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Autonomous reconfigurable intelligent surfaces (RISs) offer the potential to simplify deployment by reducing the need for real-time remote control between a base station (BS) and an RIS. However, we highlight two major challenges posed by autonomy. The first is implementation complexity, as autonomy requires hybrid RISs (HRISs) equipped with additional onboard hardware to monitor the propagation environment and perform local channel estimation (CHEST), a process known as probing. The second challenge, termed probe distortion, reflects a form of the observer effect: during probing, an HRIS can inadvertently alter the propagation environment, potentially disrupting the operations of other communicating devices sharing the environment. Although implementation complexity has been extensively studied, probe distortion remains largely unexplored. To further assess the potential of autonomous RIS, this paper comprehensively and pragmatically studies the fundamental trade-offs posed by these challenges collectively. In particular, we examine the robustness of an HRIS-assisted massive multiple-input multiple-output (mMIMO) system by considering its critical components and stringent conditions. The latter include: (a) two extremes of implementation complexity, represented by minimalist operation designs of two distinct HRIS hardware architectures, and (b) an oblivious BS that fully embraces probe distortion. To make our analysis possible, we propose a physical-layer orchestration framework that aligns HRIS and mMIMO operations. We present empirical evidence that autonomous RISs remain promising under stringent conditions and outline research directions to deepen probe distortion understanding.</description>

      <title>Adapting Gait Frequency for Posture-regulating Humanoid Push-recovery via Hierarchical Model Predictive Control</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.14342v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Current humanoid push-recovery strategies often use whole-body motion, yet they tend to overlook posture regulation. For instance, in manipulation tasks, the upper body may need to stay upright and have minimal recovery displacement. This paper introduces a novel approach to enhancing humanoid push-recovery performance under unknown disturbances and regulating body posture by tailoring the recovery stepping strategy. We propose a hierarchical-MPC-based scheme that analyzes and detects instability in the prediction window and quickly recovers through adapting gait frequency. Our approach integrates a high-level nonlinear MPC, a posture-aware gait frequency adaptation planner, and a low-level convex locomotion MPC. The planners predict the center of mass (CoM) state trajectories that can be assessed for precursors of potential instability and posture deviation. In simulation, we demonstrate improved maximum recoverable impulse by 131% on average compared with baseline approaches. In hardware experiments, a 125 ms advancement in recovery stepping timing/reflex has been observed with the proposed approach. We also demonstrate improved push-recovery performance and minimized body attitude change under 0.2 rad.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.18361v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Humanoid robots, designed to operate in human-centric environments, serve as a fundamental platform for a broad range of tasks. Although humanoid robots have been extensively studied for decades, a majority of existing humanoid robots still heavily rely on complex modular frameworks, leading to inflexibility and potential compounded errors from independent sensing, planning, and acting components. In response, we propose an end-to-end humanoid sense-plan-act walking system, enabling vision-based obstacle avoidance and footstep planning for whole body balancing simultaneously. We designed two imperative learning (IL)-based bilevel optimizations for model-predictive step planning and whole body balancing, respectively, to achieve self-supervised learning for humanoid robot walking. This enables the robot to learn from arbitrary unlabeled data, improving its adaptability and generalization capabilities. We refer to our method as iWalker and demonstrate its effectiveness in both simulated and real-world environments, representing a significant advancement toward autonomous humanoid robots.</description>

      <title>A Data-Driven Aggressive Autonomous Racing Framework Utilizing Local Trajectory Planning with Velocity Prediction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.11570</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.11570v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The development of autonomous driving has boosted the research on autonomous racing. However, existing local trajectory planning methods have difficulty planning trajectories with optimal velocity profiles at racetracks with sharp corners, thus weakening the performance of autonomous racing. To address this problem, we propose a local trajectory planning method that integrates Velocity Prediction based on Model Predictive Contouring Control (VPMPCC). The optimal parameters of VPMPCC are learned through Bayesian Optimization (BO) based on a proposed novel Objective Function adapted to Racing (OFR). Specifically, VPMPCC achieves velocity prediction by encoding the racetrack as a reference velocity profile and incorporating it into the optimization problem. This method optimizes the velocity profile of local trajectories, especially at corners with significant curvature. The proposed OFR balances racing performance with vehicle safety, ensuring safe and efficient BO training. In the simulation, the number of training iterations for OFR-based BO is reduced by 42.86% compared to the state-of-the-art method. The optimal simulation-trained parameters are then applied to a real-world F1TENTH vehicle without retraining. During prolonged racing on a custom-built racetrack featuring significant sharp corners, the mean projected velocity of VPMPCC reaches 93.18% of the vehicle's handling limits. The released code is available at https://github.com/zhouhengli/VPMPCC.</description>

However, a series of dozens of motor units in typical multiple-joint snake robots results in a heavy body structure and hundreds of watts of high power consumption. This paper presents a joint-repositionable, inner-wireless snake robot that enables multi-joint-like locomotion using a low-powered underactuated mechanism. The snake robot, consisting of a series of flexible passive links, can dynamically change its joint coupling configuration by repositioning motor-driven joint units along rack gears inside the robot. Additionally, a soft robot skin wirelessly powers the internal joint units, avoiding the risk of wire tangling and disconnection caused by the movable joint units. The combination of the joint-repositionable mechanism and the wireless-charging-enabled soft skin achieves a high degree of bending, along with a lightweight structure of 1.3 kg and energy-efficient wireless power transmission of 7.6 watts.</description>

Abstract: Traffic simulation is essential for autonomous vehicle (AV) development, enabling comprehensive safety evaluation across diverse driving conditions. However, traditional rule-based simulators struggle to capture complex human interactions, while data-driven approaches often fail to maintain long-term behavioral realism or generate diverse safety-critical events. To address these challenges, we propose TeraSim, an open-source, high-fidelity traffic simulation platform designed to uncover unknown unsafe events and efficiently estimate AV statistical performance metrics, such as crash rates. TeraSim is designed for seamless integration with third-party physics simulators and standalone AV stacks, to construct a complete AV simulation system. Experimental results demonstrate its effectiveness in generating diverse safety-critical events involving both static and dynamic agents, identifying hidden deficiencies in AV systems, and enabling statistical performance evaluation. These findings highlight TeraSim's potential as a practical tool for AV safety assessment, benefiting researchers, developers, and policymakers.
