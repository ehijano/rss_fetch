      <title>Development of a Bi-solvent Liquid Scintillator with Slow Light Emission</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.01100</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.01100v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: One of the most promising approaches for the next generation of neutrino experiments is the realization of large hybrid Cherenkov/scintillation detectors made possible by recent innovations in photodetection technology and liquid scintillator chemistry. The development of a potentially suitable future detector liquid with particularly slow light emission is discussed in the present publication. This cocktail is compared with respect to its fundamental characteristics (scintillation efficiency, transparency, and time profile of light emission) with liquid scintillators currently used in large-scale neutrino detectors. In addition, the optimization of the admixture of wavelength shifters for a scintillator with particularly high light emission is presented. Furthermore, the pulse-shape discrimination capabilities of the novel medium was studied using a pulsed particle accelerator driven neutron source. Beyond that, purification methods based on column chromatography and fractional vacuum distillation for the co-solvent DIN (Diisopropylnaphthalene) are discussed.</description>

      <title>The science and technology of liquid argon detectors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.01153</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.01153v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Liquid argon detectors are ubiquitous in particle, astroparticle, and applied physics. They reached an unprecedented level of maturity thanks to more than 20 years of R&amp;D and the operation of large-scale facilities at CERN, Fermilab, and the Gran Sasso laboratories. This article reviews such an impressive advance - from the grounding of the experimental technique up to cutting-edge applications. We commence the review by describing the physical and chemical properties of liquid argon as an active and target medium for particle detection, together with advantages and limitations compared with other liquefied noble gases. We examine the opportunities and challenges of liquid argon detectors operated as calorimeters, scintillators, and time projection chambers. We then delve into the core applications of liquid argon detectors at colliders (ATLAS), accelerator neutrino beams (SBN, DUNE), and underground laboratories (DarkSide, DEAP, ICARUS) for the observation of rare events. We complete the review by looking at unconventional developments (pixelization, combined light-charge readout, Xe-doped devices, all-optical readout) and applications in medical and applied physics to extend this technology's scope toward novel research fields.</description>

      <title>Novel method for in-situ drift velocity measurement in large volume TPCs: the Geometry Reference Chamber of the NA61/SHINE experiment at CERN</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.01285</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.01285v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper presents a novel method for low maintenance, low ambiguity in-situ drift velocity monitoring in large volume Time Projection Chambers (TPCs). The method was developed and deployed for the 40m^3 TPC tracker system of the NA61/SHINE experiment at CERN, which has a one meter of drift length. The method relies on a low-cost multi-wire proportional chamber (MWPC) placed downstream of the TPCs to be monitored. The drift velocity is then determined by matching the reconstructed tracks in the TPC to the hits of the pertinent monitoring chamber, called Geometry Reference Chamber (GRC), which is then used as a differential length scale. An important design requirement on the GRC was minimal added complexity to the existing system, in particular, compatibility with Front-End Electronics (FEE) cards already used to read out the TPCs. Moreover, the GRC system was designed to operate both in large and small particle flux. The system is capable of monitoring the evolution of the in-situ drift velocity down to a one permil precision, with a few minutes of time sampling.</description>

      <title>Development of the strip LGAD detector with double-end readout for future colliders</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.01393</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.01393v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Low-Gain Avalanche Diode (LGAD) is a new silicon detector and holds wide application prospects in particle physics experiments due to its excellent timing resolution.
  The LGAD with a pixel size of 1.3 mm $\times$ 1.3 mm was used to construct a High Granularity Timing Detector (HGTD) in ATLAS experiments to solve the pile-up problem.
  Meanwhile, the Circular Electron Positron Collider (CEPC) also proposes detectors using the LGAD. However, pixel LGAD exhibits higher readout electronics density and cost, which somewhat limits the application of LGADs. To decrease the readout electronics density, the Institute of High Energy Physics (IHEP) of the Chinese Academy of Sciences has designed strip LGADs with larger areas. These strip LGADs are all 19 mm in length but with different widths of 1.0 mm, 0.5 mm, and 0.3 mm.
  This article provides a detailed introduction to the design parameters of these strip LGADs and tests their electrical characteristics, including leakage current, break-down voltage, depletion capacitance, etc.
  The timing resolution and signal-to-noise ratio of the three strip LGAD sensors were investigated using a beta source test system.
  The position resolution parallel to the strip direction was tested and analyzed for the first time using a pico-second laser test system.
  Tests have demonstrated that the timing resolution of strip LGADs can reach about 37.5 ps, and position resolution parallel to the strip direction is better than 1 mm.</description>

      <title>Characterization of Silicon Photomultiplier Photon Detection Efficiency at Liquid Nitrogen Temperature</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.01529</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.01529v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The detection of individual photons at cryogenic temperatures is of interest to many experiments searching for physics beyond the Standard Model. Silicon photomultipliers are often deployed in liquid argon or liquid xenon to detect scintillation light by either directly detecting the vacuum ultra-violet scintillation or by detecting light from fluorescent compounds that are used to shift the wavelength. Here we present results from an experimental setup that measures the photon detection efficiencies of silicon photomultipliers, sensitive to the visible spectrum, at liquid nitrogen temperature, 77 K. Results from a KETEK PM3325-WB-D0 and a Hamamatsu S13360-3050CS silicon photomultiplier exhibit a decrease in photon detection efficiency greater than 20% at liquid nitrogen temperature relative to room temperature for 562.5 nm light.</description>

      <title>Wave-induced biases in ADCP measurements from quasi Lagrangian platforms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.00763</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.00763v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Compact autonomous marine vehicles, both surface and submersible, are now commonly used to conduct observations of ocean velocities using Acoustic Doppler Current Profilers (ADCPs). However, in the inevitable presence of surface waves, ADCP measurements conducted by these platforms are susceptible to biases stemming from wave-coherent orbital motion and platform tilting. In typical ocean conditions, the magnitude of the bias can reach tens of centimeters per second. This paper presents analytical derivation of the depth-dependent bias formulas for a variety of scenarios, encompassing surface and subsurface platforms, upward- and downward-looking ADCPs, free-drifting and self-propelled vehicles. The bias is shown to be a function of the wave field properties, platform response dynamics, and the ADCP configuration (particularly, orientation and beam angle). In all cases, the wave-induced biases show parametric scaling similar to that of the Stokes drift, albeit with a number of critical nuances. Analytical derivations are validated with a semi-analytical model, which can also be used to estimate the biases for more complex measurement configurations. Further analysis reveals unexpected fundamental differences between the upward- and downward-looking ADCP configurations, offering insights for experimental design aimed at minimizing and mitigating wave-induced biases in autonomous oceanographic observations.</description>

      <title>Properties of Charge Recombination in Liquid Argon</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.00905</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.00905v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Liquid argon is an excellent medium for detecting particles, given its yields and transport properties of light and charge. The technology of liquid argon time projection chambers has reached its full maturity after four decades of continuous developments and is, or will be, used in world class experiments for neutrino and dark matter searches. The collection of ionization charge in these detectors allows to perform a complete tridimensional reconstruction of the tracks of charged particles, calorimetric measurements, particle identification. This work proposes a novel approach to the problem of charge recombination in liquid argon which moves from a microscopic model and is applied to the cases of low energy electrons, alpha particles and nuclear recoils. The model is able to describe precisely several sets of experimental data available in the literature, over wide ranges of electric field strengths and kinetic energies and can be easily extended to other particles.</description>

      <title>The Performance of AC-coupled Strip LGAD developed by IHEP</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.03894</link>
      <description>arXiv:2307.03894v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The AC-coupled Strip LGAD (Strip AC-LGAD) is a novel LGAD design that diminishes the density of readout electronics through the use of strip electrodes, enabling the simultaneous measurement of time and spatial information. The Institute of High Energy Physics has designed a long Strip AC-LGAD prototype with a strip electrode length of 5.7 mm and pitches of 150 $\mu m$, 200 $\mu m$, and 250 $\mu m$. Spatial and timing resolutions of the long Strip AC-LGAD are studied by pico-second laser test and beta source tests. The laser test demonstrates that spatial resolution improves as the pitch size decreases, with an optimal resolution achieved at 8.3 $\mu$m. Furthermore, the Beta source test yields a timing resolution of 37.6 ps.</description>
