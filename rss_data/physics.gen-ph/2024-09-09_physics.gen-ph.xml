      <title>Exploring quantum probability interpretations through artificial intelligence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.04690</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.04690v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The varying interpretations of quantum probability governing quantum measurements are significantly reflected in divergent opinions on the foundations of statistics, including ensemble-frequency theory, propensity theory, and subjective degrees of reasonable belief. Although it has been suggested that a series of progressively sophisticated tests using artificial intelligence could yield increasingly significant experimental data to constrain potential resolutions to the measurement problem, no feasible experimental designs have yet been proposed. In this work, we utilize advanced deep learning technology to develop a novel experimental framework that integrates neural network-based artificial intelligence into a Bell test. This framework challenges the implicit assumptions underlying Bell tests. We demonstrate our framework through a simulation and introduce three new metric-morphing polygons, averaged Shannon entropy, and probability density map-to analyze the results. This approach enables us to determine whether quantum probability aligns with any one of these three interpretations or a hybrid of them.</description>

      <title>$f(Q,T)$ gravity: From early to late-time cosmic acceleration</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.14912</link>
      <description>arXiv:2306.14912v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this article, we explore the comprehensive narrative of cosmic evolution within a cosmological framework by utilizing a novel form of gravity known as generalized symmetric teleparallel gravity, denoted as $f(Q,T)$ gravity. Here, $Q$ represents the non-metricity scalar, while $T$ denotes the trace of the energy-momentum tensor. We present and analyze two distinct $f(Q,T)$ cosmological models, each characterized by its unique Lagrangian. Our investigation delves into the cosmological parameters of these models, scrutinizing various energy conditions, examining the inflationary dynamics of the early universe through scalar field formulations, and probing the mysterious nature of dark energy using statefinder diagnostics and $(\omega-\omega')$ phase space analysis. Ultimately, our findings offer a comprehensive account of cosmic evolution, spanning from the early universe to its late-time evolution.</description>

      <title>Comment on the GHZ variant of Bell's theorem without inequalities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.10256</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.10256v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: I point out a sign mistake in the GHZ variant of Bell's theorem, invalidating its claim that the premisses of the EPR argument are inconsistent for systems of more than two particles in entangled quantum states.</description>
