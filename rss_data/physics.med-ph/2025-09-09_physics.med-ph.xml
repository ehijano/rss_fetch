      <title>Contrast-Free Ultrasound Microvascular Imaging via Radiality and Similarity Weighting</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.07128</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.07128v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Microvascular imaging has advanced significantly with ultrafast data acquisition and improved clutter filtering, enhancing the sensitivity of power Doppler imaging to small vessels. However, the image quality remains limited by spatial resolution and elevated background noise, both of which impede visualization and accurate quantification. To address these limitations, this study proposes a high-resolution cross-correlation Power Doppler (HR-XPD) method that integrates spatial radiality weighting with Doppler signal coherence analysis, thereby enhancing spatial resolution while suppressing artifacts and background noise. Quantitative evaluations in simulation and in vivo experiments on healthy human liver, transplanted human kidney, and pig kidney demonstrated that HR-XPD significantly improves microvascular resolvability and contrast compared to conventional PD. In vivo results showed up to a 2 to 3-fold enhancement in spatial resolution and an increase in contrast by up to 20 dB. High-resolution vascular details were clearly depicted within a short acquisition time of only 0.3 s-1.2 s without the use of contrast agents. These findings indicate that HR-XPD provides an effective, contrast-free, and high-resolution microvascular imaging approach with broad applicability in both preclinical and clinical research.</description>

      <title>From Diagnosis to Therapy: Progress in SPECT and PET Reconstruction for Theranostics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.07313</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.07313v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The theranostic paradigm enables personalization of treatment by selecting patients with a diagnostic radiopharmaceutical and monitoring therapy using a matched therapeutic isotope. This strategy relies on accurate image reconstruction of both pre-therapy and post-therapy images for patient selection and monitoring treatment. However, traditional reconstruction methods are hindered by challenges such as crosstalk in multi-isotope imaging and extremely low-count measurements when imaging of alpha- ({\alpha}-) emitting therapies. Additionally, to fully realize the benefits of new imaging systems being developed for theranostic applications, advanced reconstruction techniques are needed. These needs, alongside the growing clinical adoption of theranostics, have spurred the development of novel PET and SPECT reconstruction algorithms. This review highlights recent progress and addresses critical challenges and unmet needs in theranostic image reconstruction.</description>

      <title>Comparison of the propulsion of helical microrobots based on hard- and soft-magnetic elements under rotating external magnetic fieldsv</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.07959</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.07959v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study compares the propulsion of helical microrobots based on hard- and soft-magnetic elements under rotating magnetic fields. Results show that hard-magnetic microrobots achieved step-out frequencies and maximum propulsion speeds 4.5 times higher than soft-magnetic microrobots. Below saturation magnetization, soft-magnetic micro-robots demonstrated similar performance irrespective of magnetic susceptibility, high-lighting that torque generation in these materials is purely geometry-dependent. Employing a tapered ribbon design increased propulsion speed by a factor of 3.5 compared to regular helical designs. These results provide a quantitative basis for selecting materials and designs, enabling designers to weigh the propulsion benefits of hard magnets against the biocompatibility of soft-magnetic microrobots.</description>

      <title>Cardiac mechanics modeling: recent developments and current challenges</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.07971</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.07971v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Patient-specific computational models of the heart are powerful tools for cardiovascular research and medicine, with demonstrated applications in treatment planning, device evaluation, and surgical decision-making. Yet constructing such models is inherently difficult, reflecting the extraordinary complexity of the heart itself. Numerous considerations are required, including reconstructing the anatomy from medical images, representing myocardial mesostructure, capturing material behavior, defining model geometry and boundary conditions, coupling multiple physics, and selecting numerical methods. Many of these choices involve a tradeoff between physiological fidelity and modeling complexity. In this review, we summarize recent advances and unresolved questions in each of these areas, with particular emphasis on cardiac tissue mechanics. We argue that clarifying which complexities are essential, and which can be safely simplified, will be key to enabling clinical translation of these models.</description>

      <title>Real-Time Gradient Waveform Design for Arbitrary $k$-Space Trajectories</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.21625</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.21625v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: \textbf{Objective: }To develop a real-time method for designing gradient waveforms for arbitrary $k$-space trajectories that are time-optimal and hardware-compliant. \textbf{Methods: }The gradient waveform is solved recursively under both the slew-rate and the trajectory constraints. The gradient constraint is enforced by thresholding the $\ell_2$-norm of the next gradient vector. The constraints form a quadratic equation. To ensure the existence of the solution, a novel Discrete-Time Forward and Backward Sweep (DTFBS) strategy is proposed. To ensure the existence of the trajectory derivatives, the trajectory function is reparameterized as a piecewise cubic polynomial function with $C^2$ continuity. To ensure trajectory fidelity, the output gradient waveform is reparameterized by the finite difference of the trajectory samples. Simulation experiments across seven commonly adopted non-Cartesian trajectories were conducted to validate generality, time-optimality, real-time capability, slew-rate accuracy, and improvements over prior work. Imaging feasibility of the designed time-optimal gradient waveform was validated in phantom and in vivo experiments. \textbf{Results: }The proposed method achieves a $&gt;89\%$ reduction in computation time and simultaneously reduces slew-rate overshoot by $&gt;98\%$ compared to the prior method across all involved trajectories. The computation time of the proposed method is shorter than the gradient duration for all tested cases, validating the real-time capability of the proposed method. \textbf{Conclusions: }The proposed method enables real-time and hardware-compliant gradient waveform design, achieving significant reductions in computation time and slew-rate overshoot compared to the previous method. \textbf{Significance: }This is the first method achieving real-time gradient waveform design for arbitrary $k$-space trajectories.</description>
