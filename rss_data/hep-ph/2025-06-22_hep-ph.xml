      <title>Supernova-Boosted Dark Matter at Large-Volume Neutrino Detectors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.15765</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.15765v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Core-collapse supernovae, among the universe's most energetic events, offer a novel window into the dark sector by potentially producing a flux of boosted dark matter (BDM). We explore the potential to detect the BDM produced by supernovae with a focus on fermionic dark matter that interacts with the visible sector through a dark gauge boson. We consider the expected BDM flux at Earth, originating from both the diffuse background of all galactic supernovae and potentially strong signals from individual nearby events. Focusing on BDM-electron scattering, we project the sensitivity of major current and future large-volume neutrino detectors - DUNE, Hyper-Kamiokande, and JUNO - to this elusive signal. Our results indicate that these experiments can significantly constrain or discover BDM within compelling parameter spaces, with sensitivity notably enhanced during nearby supernova occurrences. We further emphasize the unique multi-messenger opportunity presented by a galactic supernova, where the characteristic time delay between the neutrino burst and the BDM signal arrival could provide powerful evidence and enable probes of dark matter properties.</description>

      <title>Observing Leptogenesis in Action with Gravitational Waves</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.15772</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.15772v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Leptogenesis is arguably the best motivated theory of baryogenesis given the discovery of finite neutrino masses, yet its experimental test is elusive given its high energy scale. We discuss gravitational waves (GWs) produced via graviton bremsstrahlung in right-handed neutrino decays during leptogenesis. The presence of right-handed neutrinos in the early universe can lead to a period of early matter domination. In this context, the resultant GW spectrum scales quadratically with the right-handed neutrino mass, while its peak frequency scales inversely with the Yukawa coupling. Detecting such a spectrum would provide strong evidence for leptogenesis and the existence of heavy right-handed neutrinos. We also discuss how the GW spectrum emitted from the thermal plasma is altered by an era of early matter domination. We show that it can mimic the effects of additional relativistic degrees of freedom and a higher reheating temperature, and that information from the graviton bremsstrahlung GW spectrum can break this degeneracy.</description>

      <title>Decoupling Neutrino Magnetic Moment from Mass with $SU(2)_L$ Invariance</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.15777</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.15777v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Standard Model extensions that yield observable neutrino magnetic moments typically also induce large neutrino masses, incompatible with experimental limits. This tension motivates the search for mechanisms that naturally decouple magnetic moments from mass generation without requiring fine-tuning. In this letter, we propose a novel mechanism for generating Dirac and Majorana neutrino magnetic moment, in which the associated mass contribution is forbidden by $SU(2)_L$ invariance. By carefully selecting the $SU(2)_L$ representations connecting the neutrino to the loop diagram, we ensure that only the effective dipole operator involving the non-Abelian part of the photon -- the neutral $SU(2)_L$ gauge boson -- is generated. Crucially, the corresponding mass diagram, obtained by removing the external gauge boson leg, vanishes. We provide explicit UV completions that implement this mechanism and yield neutrino magnetic moments within the sensitivity of current and future experiments.</description>

      <title>Flavor-Dependent Entanglement Entropy in the Veneziano Limit from Light-Front Holographic QCD</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.15878</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.15878v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce a novel application of light-front holographic QCD (LFHQCD) to compute the flavor-dependent entanglement entropy of QCD subsystems in the Veneziano limit ($N_c, N_f \to \infty$, $\lambda = N_f / N_c$ fixed), probing quantum correlations in confined and quark-gluon plasma (QGP) phases. Our model extends the soft-wall LFHQCD framework with a lattice-constrained, flavor-modified dilaton potential, $\phi(z) = \kappa^2 z^2 + \lambda \phi_f(z)$, and flavor-specific scalar fields to capture distinct light and heavy quark contributions. Using a Ryu-Takayanagi-like prescription adapted to light-front coordinates, we calculate the entanglement entropy $S_A$ for spatial and flavor subsystems as a function of $\lambda$, temperature $T$, and chemical potential $\mu$. The approach leverages LFHQCD's real-time dynamics to reveal flavor-driven entanglement asymmetries, particularly near confinement/deconfinement transitions. Results are benchmarked against lattice QCD data and linked to heavy-ion collision observables, such as multiplicity fluctuations and two-particle correlations at RHIC and LHC. This work pioneers the study of quantum information in LFHQCD, offering unique insights into QCD's quantum structure and testable predictions for QGP dynamics, distinct from existing holographic models.</description>

      <title>The quantum criticality of the Standard Model and the hierarchy problem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.15919</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.15919v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The naturalness principle has long guided efforts to understand what lies beyond the Standard Model of particle physics, with the hierarchy problem being a prominent example. In this work, we revisit the impact of quantum corrections on the fine-tuning of the low-energy effective theory and its phase structure. For this purpose, we employ the Wilsonian functional renormalization group which conveniently captures both, logarithmic and polynomial, scalings in dimensionful parameters along the flow and allows for an interpretation in terms of critical phenomena. Within this framework, we show that crucial and scheme-independent information about the infrared Higgs phases and the associated quantum phase transition can be directly extracted. We build on the connection between the hierarchy problem and the near-criticality of the Standard Model, identifying a particularly enhanced tuning, and perform a comprehensive and model-independent analysis of the sensitivity to heavy new physics. Finally, we illustrate the versatility of this framework by performing a simplified search for new physics coupled to the Higgs sector which can soften the sensitivity to high-energy scales, rediscovering also the large-anomalous-dimension solution to the hierarchy problem.</description>

      <title>Nucleon Tomography with 0-jettiness</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.15962</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.15962v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose a novel strategy to systematically isolate the nucleon's intrinsic non-perturbative three-dimensional structure by employing 0-jettiness to suppress initial-state radiation in transverse momentum-dependent (TMD) observables. Applying this method to transverse single spin asymmetries (SSAs) in W+/- and Z0 boson production at RHIC, we demonstrate a substantial enhancement of the asymmetry signal (e.g., by 83% for Z0 SSA at $q_\perp$=5 GeV), enabling a more definitive test of the predicted sign change of the Sivers function -- a key prediction of TMD factorization. We further explore its applicability to spin-dependent measurements at the Electron-Ion Collider. Our analysis is formulated within a joint resummation framework that systematically resums large logarithms associated with both the veto scale and the gauge boson's transverse momentum.</description>

      <title>Smooth hybrid inflation in light of ACT DR6 data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.15965</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.15965v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Smooth hybrid inflation is a hybrid inflation model which is free from topological defects and predicts the density perturbation with the spectral index of about $0.97$. We show that the prediction on the spectral index is robust regardless the power of nonrenormalizable terms and meets with the latest results reported by Atacama Cosmology Telescope. Viable scenarios for baryogenesis and dark matter are also discussed.</description>

      <title>Light-cone sum rules analysis of the semi-leptonic $D^+_s\to f_0(980)(\to\pi^+\pi^-)e^+\nu_e$ decay incorporating $f_0(980)$ mixing state twist-2 distribution amplitudes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.15967</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.15967v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The isospin-singlet scalar meson $f_0(980)$ is hypothesized to consist of two energy eigenstates, forming a mixture of $\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}(\bar{u}u + \bar{d}d)$ and $\bar{s}s$. Building on this framework, we apply the QCD sum rules approach in the background field theory to compute the $f_0(980)$ decay constant, yielding $f_{f_0}(\mu_0=1\,\text{GeV}) = 0.386\pm0.009 \, \text{GeV}$. Subsequently, we derive the first two $\xi$-moments of the leading-twist light-cone distribution amplitude $\phi_{2;f_0}$. Using QCD light-cone sum rules, we then calculate the $D^+_s \to f_0(980)$ transition form factor (TFF) $f_+(q^2)$, obtaining $f_+(0) = 0.516^{+0.027}_{-0.024}$ at the large-recoil point. We extend $f_+(q^2)$ to the full physical region via a simplified series expansion parameterization, enabling calculations of the differential decay widths and the branching fraction $\mathcal{B}(D^+_s \to f_0(980)(\to \pi^+\pi^-)e^+\nu_e) = (1.783^{+0.227}_{-0.189}) \times 10^{-3}$. Our theoretical predictions align well with the latest BESIII Collaboration measurements within reasonable errors.</description>

      <title>Bound Deuteron-Antideuteron System (Deuteronium): Leading Radiative and Internal-Structure Corrections to Bound-State Energies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.15974</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.15974v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We evaluate the energy levels of the deuteronium bound system, which consists of a deuteron and an antideuteron, with a special emphasis on states with nonvanishing orbital angular momenta. The excited atomic bound states of deuteronium constitute probes for the understanding of higher-order quantum electrodynamic corrections for spin-1 particles in a bound system where the typical field strength of the binding Coulomb field (at a distance of the generalized Bohr radius) exceeds Schwinger's critical field strength. For states with nonvanishing angular momenta, effects due to the internal structure of the deuteron and virtual annihilation contributions are highly suppressed. Relevant transitions are found to be in a frequency range accessible by standard laser spectroscopic techniques. We evaluate the leading and next-to-leading energy corrections of orders alpha^3 m_d and alpha^4 m_d , where alpha is the fine-structure constant and m_d is the deuteron mass, and also investigate internal-structure corrections: hadronic vacuum polarization, finite-size effects, and strong-interaction corrections.</description>

      <title>Extraction of jet-medium interaction details through jet substructure for inclusive and gamma-tagged jets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.15990</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.15990v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a comprehensive study of jet substructure modifications in high-energy heavy-ion collisions using both inclusive jets and $\gamma$-tagged jets, based on a multi-stage jet evolution model within the Monte Carlo framework JETSCAPE. To investigate hard parton splittings inside jets, we focus on Soft Drop observables. Our results for the groomed splitting radius and groomed jet mass distributions of inclusive jets show a slight narrowing compared to proton-proton baselines. We demonstrate that this apparent narrowing is primarily a selection bias from energy loss, rather than a direct modification of the splitting structure, by analyzing $\gamma$-tagged jets, where such bias is eliminated or significantly reduced. We also show that quark jets exhibit genuine modifications in their splitting structure, which is not seen in gluon jets. These effects are clearly visible in the substructure of $\gamma$-tagged jets, which are dominated by quark jets, but are not apparent for inclusive jets. This demonstrates that $\gamma$-tagged jets offer a powerful probe of medium-induced modifications to the hard splitting structure of jets.</description>

      <title>Pion Valence Structure at Intermediate x in the Residual Field Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.15995</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.15995v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We calculate the valence parton distribution function of the pion, for the range of $0.1 \le x \le 0.6$, based on the soft dynamics of the partons within the valence-residual field model. Within this model we assume that the soft partonic structure of the pion is defined by the valence current $q\bar q$ cluster embedded in the residual field of the pion. The parton distribution function is calculated using phenomenological wave functions for the $q\bar q$ cluster and residual field. Our result indicate that the peak position of x weighted valence parton distribution depends on the mass of the residual system and the parameters of the system are obtained by fitting the height and the peak position of this distribution to extracted PDFs. This comparison reveals that unlike for the case of nucleon PDF, very little residual mass is needed to describe existing pion PDFs at intermediate x.</description>

      <title>$b \to c$ semileptonic sum rule: Extension to angular observables</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.16027</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.16027v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Lepton flavor universality is a key prediction of the Standard Model of particle physics and any violation of it immediately indicates the existence of new physics. Given the recent more than $4\sigma$ discrepancy in charged current semileptonic B meson decays and the absence of evident signals at the large hadron collider, independent cross-checks become invaluable. In this context, $b \to c$ semileptonic sum rules based on heavy quark symmetry are interesting since they allow us to check the consistency of experimental results. In this paper, we report newly found sum rules among angular observables of mesonic and baryonic $b\to c l \overline{\nu}$ decays holding exactly in the large mass limit of heavy quarks. Moreover, we investigate corrections to the sum rule in realistic situations and discuss phenomenological implications.</description>

      <title>A Photon Cloud Induced from an Axion Cloud</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.16036</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.16036v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: It is known that the axion-photon coupling can lead to quantum stimulated emission of photons and classic exponential amplification of electromagnetic (EM) fields at half the axion mass frequency, when the axion density or the coupling constant is sufficiently large. In this work, we studied the EM photon cloud induced from an axion cloud around a Kerr black hole in the first order of the coupling constant classically. In the presence of a static EM background (like Wald extended solution) valid in realistic astrophysical environment, we found that an EM photon cloud emerges, oscillating at the same frequency as the axion cloud and growing exponentially in accordance with the axion cloud when the superradiant condition for the axion field is satisfied. Notably, the first-order study indicates that this photon cloud exists with no threshold for the coupling constant. The evolution of the EM photon cloud with time and azimuthal angle is obtained analytically while the cross-sectional distribution is solved numerically. Intriguingly, the induced EM field exhibits significantly different symmetries in contrast to the background EM field, which may serve as an indication of the existence of both an axion cloud and axion-photon coupling. Furthermore, in the near horizon region, the induced EM field has some overlap with the photon region as expected.</description>

      <title>Searching Quantum Entanglement in $p\ p\to Z\ Z$ process</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.16077</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.16077v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent studies have shown that observing entangled particle states at a particle collider like Large Hadron Collider (LHC) and testing violation of Bell inequality in them can open up new research area for high energy physics study. We examine the presence of quantum entanglement in the $pp\to ZZ\to 4\ell$ process at leading order. We apply generally recognized method, quantum state tomography, to reconstruct spin density matrix of the joint $ZZ$ system, through which all the relevant observables can be obtained. The angular distribution of the final leptons are obtained from simulated events using Monte-Carlo program, which is used to reconstruct spin density matrix. Non-zero value of the lower bound of the concurrence is measured with simulated data. The numerical analysis shows that with the luminosity corresponding to LHC Run 2+3, entanglement can be probed at $2 \sigma$ level and up to 3.75$\sigma$ level for High-Luminosity LHC data ($3 \rm{ab}^{-1}$), revealing the possibility of finding quantum entanglement in real collider experiment.</description>

      <title>Isolated photon cross section and resummation of the logarithms of the cone radius</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.16092</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.16092v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The cone isolation criterion used in large-pt photon experiments generates logarithms of the cone radius in the theoretical cross sections. When a small radius is used, unitarity is violated as the inclusive cross section is smaller than the isolated one. We show that unitarity is restored when these logarithms are resummed. We also study a criterion which offers a more precise description of the experimental procedure : no isolation is imposed in a very small cone inside the standard one. In this case as well unitarity is violated and the resummation of logarithms is required.</description>

      <title>Seesaw Portal to Super Heavy Dark Matter with $Z_3$ Symmetry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.16100</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.16100v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Right-handed neutrinos $N$ are introduced to explain the origin of the tiny neutrino masses via the seesaw mechanism. Required by relatively large Yukawa coupling and leptogenesis, masses of right-handed neutrinos are beyond $10^{9}$ GeV. Such heavy right-handed neutrino can mediate the production of super heavy dark matter $\chi$ via the freeze-in mechanism. In the minimal $Z_2$ symmetric model, the right-hand neutrino portal interaction is $y_N \phi \bar{\chi} N$ with the dark scalar $\phi$. One drawback of the $Z_2$ symmetric model is that the mass ordering $m_N&gt;m_\phi$ with long-lived $\phi$ is almost ruled out by Big Bang Nucleosynthesis. In this paper, we propose that by extending the dark symmetry to $Z_3$, one additional interaction $y_\chi \phi \bar{\chi}^c \chi$ is further allowed. In this way, the new decay mode $\phi\to \chi\chi$ would lead to the dark scalar $\phi$ being short-lived even with a feeble $y_\chi$, thus it is allowed by the cosmological constraints. The phenomenology of the $Z_3$ symmetric super heavy dark matter model is also studied in this paper.</description>

      <title>A simple model for nuclear modification of parton distribution functions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.16183</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.16183v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A model for nuclear medium modification of parton densities is presented. The approach is based on the global analysis of available deep inelastic scattering data for different nuclear targets within the rescaling model combined with taking into account the effects of Fermi motion. The scale dependence is implemented into the DGLAP-evolved quark and gluon densities in a proton derived analytically at the leading order of QCD coupling. By fitting the rescaling parameters to experimental data on the ratio $F_2^A(x,Q^2)/F_2^{A^\prime}(x,Q^2)$ for several nuclear targets $A$ and $A^\prime$, we obtain redictions for nuclear parton distributions, even for unmeasured nuclei. The effects of nuclear modifications are investigated with respect to the mass number $A$. Our results highlight distinct shadowing and antishadowing behaviors for gluons and quarks.</description>

      <title>Schwinger Effect in a Twice Anisotropic Holographic Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.16245</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.16245v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, we investigate the Schwinger effect in a twice anisotropic holographic QCD model that incorporates both spatial and magnetic anisotropies. Using the AdS/CFT correspondence, we calculate the total potential of a particle-antiparticle pair to evaluate how these anisotropies affect the holographic Schwinger effect. Our calculations reveal that the magnetic field, characterized by parameters $c_B$ and $q_3$, consistently enhances the Schwinger effect by lowering and narrowing the potential barrier. In contrast, increasing the spatial anisotropy, parameterized by $\nu$, raises and widens the barrier, thereby suppressing the process. This underscores the need to treat both anisotropies concurrently for a realistic description of particle production in HIC.</description>

      <title>Two loop QCD corrections to $e^+ e^- \to J/\psi + \eta_c$ in asymptotic expansion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.16317</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.16317v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Within the framework of NRQCD, the short-distance coefficients (SDCs) for the process $e^+e^-\to J/\psi+\eta_c$ have been obtained up to NNLO in asymptotic expansions over $r={16m_c^2}/{s}$ up to $r^{15}$. Although these asymptotic expressions are deviated from the full results near the threshold $r= 1$, they provide excellent approximations to the full results for $r&lt;0.8$, with deviations less than $3\%$. Therefore, these asymptotic expressions offer reliable applications for phenomenological predictions across a wide range of center-of-mass energies $\sqrt{s}$. Utilizing these asymptotic expressions, we present phenomenological predictions for the cross sections in both the on-shell mass scheme and the $\overline{\rm MS}$ mass scheme, with the uncertainty arising from the renormalization scale $\mu_R$ included. The $\mu_R$ uncertainty for predictions from the $\overline{\rm MS}$ mass scheme is slightly larger than that from the on-shell mass scheme, which is partly attributed to the helicity flip in the process $e^+e^-\to J/\psi+\eta_c$. We observe that both mass schemes yield quite similar predictions, and our theoretical results are consistent with the available experimental data.</description>

      <title>Possible Standard Model solution for Baryon Asymmetry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.16340</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.16340v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: If the discovered Higgs boson with $m_H$=125 GeV is interpreted as a $t\bar{t}$-boson where the $t$-quarks are bound by Higgs-exchange with binding energy 220 GeV, then the $2t$-baryons should have approximately the same mass as the Higgs-boson. As $m_H&lt;m_t$, the life time of $2t$-baryons must be much bigger then the life time of $1t$-baryons. If in the primordial Universe the number of $2\bar{t}$-antibaryons was bigger than the number of $2t$-baryons, then the excess should be compensated by nucleons. The relatively long living heavy $2\bar{t}$-antibaryons could in primordial Universe fast evolve to antimatter black halls and disappear in the world of matter under the Schwarzschild spheres.</description>

      <title>Effects of hadronic reinteraction on jet fragmentation from small to large systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.16344</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.16344v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the impact of the hadronic phase on jet quenching in nuclear collider experiments, an open question in heavy-ion physics. Previous studies in a simplified setup suggest that hadronic interactions could have significant effects, but a systematic analysis is needed. Using the X-SCAPE event generator with the SMASH afterburner, we study the role of hadronic rescattering on jet fragmentation hadrons. Applying this framework to $e^++e^-$ collisions, we demonstrate that even in small systems with limited particle production, hadronic interactions lead to measurable modifications in final-state hadronic and jet observables by comparing scenarios with and without afterburner rescattering.</description>

      <title>Primordial magnetogenesis from a supercooled dynamical electroweak phase transition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.16387</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.16387v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Observations of $\gamma$-ray from blazars suggest the presence of magnetic fields in the intergalactic medium, which may require a primordial origin. Intense enough primordial magnetic fields can arise from theories of dynamical electroweak symmetry breaking during the big bang, where supercooling is ended by a strongly first order phase transition. We consider theories involving new scalars and possibly vectors, including thermal particle dark matter candidates. Intense enough magnetic fields can arise if the reheating temperature after the phase transition is below a few TeV. The same dynamics also leaves testable primordial gravitational waves and possibly primordial black holes.</description>

      <title>Investigating DUNE oscillations sensitivity to Pseudo-Dirac Neutrinos</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.16390</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.16390v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We explore the sensitivity of the Deep Underground Neutrino Experiment (DUNE) to sterile neutrino oscillations within a $3+$(pseudo-Dirac pair) framework. We first consider a pair of two sterile neutrinos forming a pseudo-Dirac pair, then we consider a low-scale seesaw realization, that we name ``Linear-Inverse Seesaw" model. This scenario features two nearly degenerate sterile neutrino states at the keV scale, characterized by a small mass splitting arising from a small amount of lepton number violation. In this scenario, the oscillation behavior can be described in three distinct regimes depending on the sterile-sterile mass-squared difference : low ($&lt; 1\,\mathrm{eV}^2$), resonant ($1$--$100\,\mathrm{eV}^2$), and high ($&gt; 100\,\mathrm{eV}^2$) regimes, recovering in both low- and high-mass regimes an effective non-unitarity of the leptonic mixing matrix. A distinctive feature of this framework is that observable effects persist even in the low-mass limit, unlike the case of standard $3+1$ scenarios, due to rapid oscillation averaging from larger keV-scale splittings. We leverage the complementarity of both near and far detectors to explore the sensitivity for $\nu_e$ and $\nu_\mu$ disappearance and $\nu_e$ and $\nu_{\tau}$ appearance oscillation probabilities.Our analysis reveals that DUNE can achieve significant improvements over current experimental constraints, especially in neutrino appearance modes. Additionally, we show that new CP-violating phases associated with the sterile sector can dramatically alter the sensitivity, with destructive interference potentially suppressing signals by orders of magnitude.</description>

      <title>The impact of $\gamma N$ and $\gamma^* N$ interactions on our understanding of nucleon excitations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.16482</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.16482v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We review recent progress in our understanding of the nucleon excitation spectrum. Thanks to dedicated efforts at facilities such as ELSA, MAMI and Jefferson Lab, several new nucleon resonances have been discovered, and evidence for previously elusive states has been significantly improved. Numerous decay channels have been observed for the first time, and resonance properties are being extracted from these data by several groups through coupled-channel analyses of varying complexity. Electroproduction experiments have provided further insights into the internal structure of light baryon resonances -- for example, the long-debated Roper resonance $N(1440)$ is observed as a three-quark state with a significant meson-cloud component.While the non-relativistic quark model remains a valuable tool for organizing the spectrum of nucleon and $\Delta$ resonances, a variety of theoretical frameworks have emerged to offer deeper understanding, including phenomenological quark models, holographic QCD, functional methods, effective field theories, and lattice QCD. We examine the interplay between these approaches, highlight their respective strengths and explore how they complement each other in shaping our knowledge of light baryon resonances. We address several open questions in baryon spectroscopy, including the nature of the enigmatic $\Lambda(1405)$, ongoing searches for exotic states such as hybrid baryons and pentaquarks, and the dichotomy between microscopic descriptions of baryons in terms of quarks and gluons versus effective hadronic descriptions based on meson-baryon dynamics.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2506.16489v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce a perturbative model that accounts for the contribution of multi-partonic interactions to collider observables. A key feature of this multi-parton model is that cross sections are organised in terms of building blocks that are separately infrared-finite in virtue of the KLN theorem. We find compact expressions for these building blocks in terms of double discontinuities of Feynman-type integrals obtained by endowing a vacuum graph with additional topological information. The framework is applied to the computation of next-to-leading order structure functions in deep inelastic scattering. We comment on the scale dependence of these structure functions and discuss the possibility of relating them by a scheme change to those computed in the parton model. Finally we lay down next steps for analogous computations for deep inelastic scattering at NNLO and Drell-Yan at NLO.</description>

      <title>Bounds on PBH fraction in a stimulated axion/ALP decay scenario</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.16579</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.16579v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, we show that stimulated decay of axions or axion-like particles (ALP) in black hole superradiance is an efficient way to find and hunt primordial black holes (PBH). When de Broglie's wavelength of the axion/ ALP is comparable or larger than the black hole horizon radius, a large population of them accumulates in the surroundings of the black hole. When these axions or ALPs couple to photons, the bosonic cloud decays into radiation that contributes to the X-ray, visible light, and radio wave background flux that can exceed current observational limits measured at Earth. If the masses are in the interval of $10^{-3}\mathrm{eV}&lt;\mu &lt;1\mathrm{eV}$, to be consistent with current observations of microwave background light, we found that the fraction of primordial black holes should be smaller than $f_{PBH} &lt; 10^{-17}$ for primordial black holes with masses within $10^{-19} M_{\odot}&lt;M_{BH}&lt;10^{-7} M_\odot$.</description>

      <title>Sensitivity of Heavy Higgs Boson to the Precision Yukawa Coupling Measurements at Higgs Factories</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.16587</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.16587v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the potential of precision Higgs boson coupling measurements to discover heavy Higgs bosons by performing scans of the parameter space in Two-Higgs-Doublet Models (2HDM). Our study encompasses conventional Type I and Type II models, as well as models in which Higgs couplings differ between the third generation and lighter fermion generations. The scans reveal that precision measurements at the sensitivity levels projected for Higgs factories, such as Linear Collider Facility (LCF) and the FCC-ee at CERN and the CEPC in China, are capable of probing heavy Higgs boson masses in the multi-TeV range, with sensitivity extending beyond 5 TeV in certain scenarios. In particular, the precise determination of the charm quark Yukawa coupling at Higgs factories provides a powerful test of the hypothesis that the fermion mass hierarchy arises from an extended Higgs sector with different Higgs fields coupling to the different generations of fermions.</description>

      <title>Non-Universal Flipped Trinification Models with Arbitrary $\beta$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.16693</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.16693v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We explore the recently proposed gauge symmetry \( SU(3)_C \otimes SU(3)_L \otimes SU(3)_R \otimes U(1)_X \), which naturally embeds both the Left-Right symmetric model and the 3-3-1 model as subgroups. Within this unified framework, we propose four families of leptons and quarks. A detailed analysis of their contributions to gauge anomaly cancellation is carried out for a general value of the parameter $\beta$.
  From this analysis, eight non-universal anomaly-free three-family models and four non-universal two-family anomaly free sets were identified. The three-family models offer realistic extensions of the Standard Model, retaining several appealing features of the 3-3-1 models, while the two-family sets provide flexibility for constructing models with even numbers of families. We also report LHC bounds on the $Z'$ mass for the particular case $\beta = -1/\sqrt{3}$, considering all possible combinations of lepton and quark families. These limits exhibit a strong dependence on the mixing parameter $\theta$, which enters the couplings of Standard Model fermions to the $Z'$ boson.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.16706</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.16706v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose a radiative lepton seesaw model with the ${\mathbb Z}_3$ Tambara-Yamagami fusion rule and gauged $B-L$ symmetry. The heavier right-handed neutral fermions ($N_R$) simultaneously contribute to the masses of charged-leptons and neutrinos, and three families of $N_R$ are necessary in realizing realistic mass matrices. On the other hand, we introduce a gauged $B-L$ symmetry to preserve the lepton seesaw mechanism. As a result, this gauged symmetry not only assures the three families of $N_R$ from view point of chiral gauge anomaly cancellation, but also provides a dominant annihilation cross section via Higgs portal in order to explain the correct relic density of dark matter. Finally, we show several numerical results satisfying the neutrino oscillation data, lepton flavor violations, muon $g-2$, and relic density of dark matter.</description>

      <title>Photoproduction of doubly charmed tetraquark $T_{cc}$ via photon-gluon fusion at ILC and CLIC</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.16721</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.16721v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The photoproduction of doubly charmed tetraquark $T_{cc}$ is predicted through the resolved channel $\gamma+g\to \to \langle cc \rangle[n] + \bar{c}+\bar{c} \to T_{cc}+\bar{c}+\bar{c}$ at ILC and CLIC. At $e^{+}e^{-}$ colliders, the initial photons $\gamma$ can be produced from two primary sources, well-delineated within the $Weiz\ddot{a}cker$ Williams approximation (WWA) and the laser back-scattering (LBS). And the initial gluon can be emitted from the photon. The spin and color quantum number $[n]$ of the intermediate diquark configuration can be $\langle cc\rangle[^3S_1]_{\bar{3}}$. Then its nonperturbative hadronization to $T_{cc}$ was discussed in the phenomenological potential models. Finally, the differential distributions and theoretical uncertainty of the doubly charmed tetraquark $T_{cc}$ were analyzed. The conclusion is that it is promising to observe $T_{cc}$ via the resolved channel of photoproduction both at the ILC and CLIC, and the results have a strong dependence on the mass of constituent charm quark $m_c$ and the potential model.</description>

      <title>Inclusive quasielastic (anti-)neutrino nucleus scattering within the Standard Model and beyond</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.16774</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.16774v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We derive fully general expressions for the inclusive (anti-)neutrino-induced nuclear quasielastic production of a strange or charmed baryon $Y$, considering all dimension-six new physics operators relevant to the semileptonic $q\to q'\ell \nu_\ell$ transition with both left- and right-handed neutrino fields. We illustrate the formalism by applying it to the $\Lambda_c$ production in neutrino nucleus scattering. The nuclear response is computed using a state-of-the-art {\it ab initio} spectral function, based on realistic nuclear many-body wavefunctions obtained via coupled-cluster method and a nuclear Hamiltonian derived from chiral effective field theory. We also highlight the role played by the final state interactions between the produced $Y$ hyperon and the residual nuclear system, which can obscure potential new physics signals in this (anti-)neutrino nucleus reaction. Our results improve upon previous studies that neglected nuclear corrections and uncertainties -- effects we show to be comparable to, or even larger than, those expected from new physics.</description>

      <title>Low-Energy Supernova Constraints on Lepton Flavor Violating Axions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.16922</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.16922v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The extreme conditions within the supernova core, a high-temperature and high-density environment, create an ideal laboratory for the search for new physics beyond the Standard Model. Of particular interest are low-energy supernovae, characterized by their low explosion energies, which place strong constraints on the new-physics energy transfer from the core to the mantle. We compute low-energy supernova constraints on lepton-flavor-violating axions and axion-like particles that couple to both electrons and muons. For axion mass above the muon mass, the electron-muon coalescence and the axion decay are dominant production and reabsorption processes, respectively. We find that the low-energy supernovae provide the most stringent constraints on the axions in the mass range of $\sim (110,550)$ MeV, probing the coupling constant down to $g_{ae\mu} \simeq {\cal O}(10^{-11})$.</description>

      <title>Axion contribution to the mass-radius relation of neutron stars</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.16932</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.16932v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A phenomenological Lagrangian for the interaction between a pseudo-scalar (axion-like) field and massive fermions is considered. At high density and non-zero temperature axions can be produced thermally through bremsstrahlung. We compute the equation of state for a static spherical cold compact object and investigate the numerical solutions of the Tolman-Oppenheimer-Volkoff equations. Causality of the obtained solutions sets a strict limitation on the possible values for the interaction constant. This allows us to quantify the influence of the axions on the mass-radius dependence for static spherical stars. Our model predicts measurable effects in the properties of the neutron star and can be easily adapted for KSVZ or DFSZ axions.</description>

Abstract: A unified framework sheltering the type-I Dirac seesaw, based on the $\Delta(27) \times Z_7 \times Z_{5} \times Z_4 \times Z_3$ symmetry, is proposed, preserving the naturalness of Yukawa couplings. It helps to visualize mass matrices within the lepton and quark sectors in terms of \textit{three universal parameters}: $\Sigma_1$, $\Sigma_2$, and $\Sigma_3$, highlighting that the down-type quark and light neutrino mass matrices exhibit a \textit{Hermitian} texture.</description>

      <title>Theoretical modeling of QCD radiation in off-shell Higgs production through gluon fusion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.17022</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.17022v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The measurement of the Higgs boson width is a critical test of the Standard Model, with significant implications for understanding electroweak symmetry breaking. Direct measurements are limited by detector resolution, but it can be measured with greater precision through a combined analysis of on-shell and off-shell Higgs boson production. While results for on-shell production have been computed to a very high accuracy, theoretical predictions for off-shell Higgs boson production are not as well controlled due to the breakdown of the heavy-top approximation and the large interference with non-resonant amplitudes. Seeking to understand and improve the theoretical control, we compare leading-order and next-to-leading-order plus parton shower differential cross-sections for signal, background, and full physical processes in off-shell Higgs boson production at the Large Hadron Collider, using Powheg, MadGraph, and Sherpa. We analyze the impact of higher-order quantum chromodynamics effects and theoretical uncertainties, highlighting differences between predictions using jet merging with parton showers, and those from next-to-leading order computations matched to parton showers. The results provide insights for improving theoretical predictions and their application to experimental measurements in the future.</description>

      <title>Soft and semihard components of multiplicity distributions in the $k_T$ factorization approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.17127</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.17127v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Particle production in hadronic collisions can be studied in the low-momentum (soft) and high-momentum (hard) transfer regimes. While the latter can be well understood with in perturbative QCD the former contains non-perturbative effects which cannot be calculated from first principles. There is also an intermediate regime called semihard, in which the momentum transfer runs typically from $~1$ to $~10$ GeV. As the hadron-hadron collision energy increases, we expect to see a relative growth of the number of semihard events. It has been conjectured that this growth would be the cause of some changes observed in the multiplicity distributions measured in proton - proton collisions. In this note we revisit the separation between soft and semihard events using the formalism of $k_T$ factorization. The separation is implemented through the introduction of a scale that is the cutoff $\Lambda$ in the transverse momentum of the produced gluon and allows us to compute the average number of particles produced in each regime. These numbers are used as input in the double negative binomial fit of data, from which we can extract correlations between the fraction of semihard events and the violation of KNO scaling.</description>

      <title>How to Count States in Gravity</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.15767v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Gibbons and Hawking proposed that the Euclidean gravity path integral with periodic boundary conditions in time computes the thermal partition sum of gravity. As a corollary, they argued that a derivative of the associated free energy with respect to the Euclidean time period computes gravitational entropy. Why is this interpretation is correct? That is, why does this path integral compute a trace over the Hilbert space? Here, we show that the quantity computed by the Gibbons-Hawking path integral is equal to an {\it a priori} different object -- an explicit thermal trace over the Hilbert space spanned by states produced by the Euclidean gravity path integral. This follows in two ways: (a) if the Hilbert space with two boundaries factorizes into a product of two single boundary Hilbert spaces, as we have previously shown; and (b) via explicit resolution of the trace by a spanning basis of states. We similarly show how a replicated Euclidean gravity path integral with a single periodic boundary computes a Hilbert space trace of powers of the density matrix, explaining why this approach computes the entropy of states entangled between two universes.</description>

Abstract: We demonstrate that there are no scale-invariant one-loop corrections to the superhorizon tensor perturbations from small-scale (potentially enhanced) scalar perturbations, irrespective of the details of inflationary background time evolution. For this purpose we derive a soft tensor effective field theory at leading order in the gradient expansion by integrating out small-scale scalar fluctuations in a general time-dependent background over the Schwinger-Keldysh contour, i.e., we perform loop calculations in the soft limit of external momentum. The absence of scale-invariant corrections originates from the diffeomorphism invariance of general relativity and is therefore unavoidable.</description>

      <title>The Hidden Symmetries of Yang-Mills Theory in (3+1)-dimensions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.15832</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.15832v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We show that classical, non-supersymmetric Yang-Mills theories coupled to spin-1/2 and spin-0 elementary matter fields, in (3+1)-dimensional Minkowski space-time, possess an exact integrability structure with an infinite number of conserved charges in involution. Such an integrability lives on the space of non-abelian electric and magnetic charges, and is based on flat connections in generalized loop spaces, presenting an R-matrix, and Sklyanin relation. We present two novel symmetries of Yang-Mills theories. The first one corresponds to global transformations generated by the infinity of those conserved charges under the Poisson brackets. The gauge and matter fields, as well as Wilson lines and fluxes have interesting transformation laws under such a global symmetry. The second one corresponds to symmetries of the integral Yang-Mills equations, which lead to the conserved charges. They generate an infinite dimensional group, where the elements are holonomies of connections on the loop space of functions from the circle $S^1$ to the space-time. Our approach certainly applies to the Standard Model of the Fundamental Interactions. The conserved charges are gauge invariant, and so, in the case of QCD they are color singlets, and perhaps are not confined. Therefore, the hadrons may carry such charges. Our results open up the way for the construction of non-perturbative methods for Yang-Mills theories.</description>

      <title>Memory effects in a dynamical decoupling process by parity kicks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.15941</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.15941v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We establish a simple quantitative relationship between the environmental memory effects and the characteristics in a dynamical decoupling process. In contrast to previous works, our measures of non-Markovianity are tailored and extended to evaluate the strength of memory effects in dynamical decoupling. We find that if each kick commutes with the dynamical map of the uncontrolled system, then the change of the final dynamical map or the final state brought by the control (called the "effect of control") is upper (lower) bounded by the summation (difference) of the strengths of memory effects with and without control. Our finding is illustrated with a dissipative quantum Rabi model by numerical simulations where one or many cycles of parity kicks are implemented on the qubit. Besides, the results show that under certain conditions, the effect of control or the increase of performance by the control may be simply proportional to the strength of memory effects with or without control.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2506.16109v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: It is unclear whether an observable notion of time exists in quantum gravity even in principle because spacetime itself fluctuates. We propose a form of observable time in perturbative quantum gravity. First, we define an elapsed proper time in curved space using intersections of worldlines and future light cones. Here, time arises from causality via the dependence on light cones. We then propose that performing the gravitational path integral describes quantum gravity corrections to this notion of proper time at all orders in $G_N$. Using this prescription, we compute the leading quantum gravity corrections to two-point correlation functions of elapsed time. We find that the commutators can be nonzero, showing this notion of time is a quantum operator in quantum gravity.</description>

Abstract: We present a novel procedure for analyzing the lattice-QCD spectrum via the finite-volume formalism to obtain constraints on multi-hadron scattering amplitudes at both real and complex energies. This approach combines a Bayesian reconstruction of the scattering amplitude on the real axis with Nevanlinna interpolation for analytic continuation to complex-valued energies. The method is non-parametric, inherently accounting for parametrization dependence within the uncertainty. We demonstrate the applicability of this approach using both toy data and real lattice-QCD data in resonant systems from the HadSpec and BaSc collaborations.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2506.16169v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recent analyses from the Pierre Auger Collaboration suggest correlations between the arrival directions of Ultra-High-Energy Cosmic Rays (UHECRs) and catalogs of starburst galaxies (SGBs) and jetted active galactic nuclei (AGNs). We revisit these analyses using the same methodology as \auger , but explicitly incorporating UHECR deflections in turbulent extragalactic magnetic fields (EGMFs). We demonstrate that while for SBGs the same sources as for the generic \auger\ analysis dominate the catalog correlations, jetted AGNs are dominated by Centaurus~A when accounting for source distances and deflections. Using our framework, we derive 90\% confidence level upper limits on the local EGMF strength of 4.4~nG~Mpc$^{1/2}$ for SBGs and 6.7~nG~Mpc$^{1/2}$ for jetted AGNs. Assuming instead that the UHECR deflections predominantly arise from the Galactic magnetic field (GMF), we obtain a GMF upper limit of $1.4 \, \mu$G~kpc$^{1/2}$ for a Galactic halo size of 30~kpc.</description>

The baryons are described as charged D6-branes with a circular boundary on a flavor D8-brane in the Type IIA backgrounds dual to the confining and non-confining phases. The holographic description allows us to calculate precisely their properties, such as mass and size. We also consider other objects with baryonic charge, such as vortons, domain walls with holes, and "sandwich vortons", and discuss the relative (meta)stability of all these configurations.</description>

      <title>Renormalized quark masses using gradient flow</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.16327</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.16327v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose a new and simple method for determining the renormalized quark masses from lattice simulations. Renormalized quark masses are an important input to many phenomenological applications, including searching/modeling physics beyond the Standard Model. The non-perturbative renormalization is performed using gradient flow combined with the short-flow-time expansion that is improved by renormalization-group (RG) running to match to the $\overline{\text{MS}}$-scheme. RG running connects the lattice scale to higher energies thus improving the $\overline{\text{MS}}$-scheme matching. Implementing the RG running perturbatively, we demonstrate this method works reliably at least up to the charm-quark mass and is not exhibiting any signs of the usual ``window problem''. Using \abbrev{RBC/UKQCD}'s (2+1)-flavor Shamir domain-wall fermion ensembles with Iwasaki gauge action, we find $m_s^\overline{\text{MS}}(\mu=2 \text{ GeV}) = 90(3)$ MeV and $m_c^\overline{\text{MS}}(\mu=3 \text{ GeV}) = 975(10)$ MeV. These results predict the scale-independent ratio $m_c/m_s= 12.0(4)$. Generalization to other observables is possible, providing an efficient approach to determine non-perturbatively renormalized fermionic observables like form factors or bag parameters from lattice simulations.</description>

      <title>Dislocations and crystallization dynamics of chiral soliton lattices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.16354</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.16354v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Dislocations, as topological defects in crystal lattices, are fundamental to understanding plasticity in materials. Similar periodic structures also arise in continuum field theories, such as chiral soliton lattices (CSLs), which appear in condensed matter systems like chiral magnets and in high-energy contexts such as quantum chromodynamics in strong magnetic field or under rapid rotation. This work investigates whether dislocations can dynamically form within such emergent CSLs. The chiral sine-Gordon model, reduced from the aforementioned examples by certain truncations, is useful to determine the ground state but it cannot describe time evolution, lacks dynamical formation or leads to singular dislocations, because its equations of motion do not contain a topological term. We propose a field-theoretical model including the topological term coupled to external fields resolving these issues by modifying the topological term so it affects the dynamics. Using numerical simulations, we study the real-time formation of CSLs in two and three spatial dimensions. In 2D, edge dislocations emerge spontaneously, guiding soliton growth and later annihilating to leave a stable CSL. In 3D, both edge and screw dislocations form; the latter exhibits helical structure influenced by the external field. We find stable double helical screw dislocations looking like a double helix staircase or DNA. We then demonstrate the formation of helical dislocations and analyze how the external field strength affects CSL density and formation speed. Our results provide a novel theoretical framework for understanding dislocations in solitonic structures, connecting high-energy field theory with materials science phenomena.</description>

      <title>One Membrane to Love them all: Tidal deformations of compact objects from the membrane paradigm</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.16516</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.16516v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The tidal deformability is a key observable to test the nature of compact objects in a binary coalescence. Within vacuum General Relativity, the tidal Love numbers of a four-dimensional black hole are strictly zero, while they are non-zero and model-dependent for material objects, matter distributions around black holes, or in alternative theories of gravity. Here, we develop a model-agnostic framework based on the membrane paradigm, where the tidal properties of a spherically symmetric object are encoded in the response of a fictitious membrane in terms of viscosity coefficients. We show that both neutron stars and exotic compact objects (in particular, we provide an explicit example for thin-shell gravastars) are included in this framework, provided that the bulk and shear viscosity coefficients of the membrane have a nontrivial frequency dependence. We derive a general result for the electric and magnetic tidal Love numbers for non-rotating and spherically symmetric compact objects in terms of the viscosity coefficients, discussing their behavior with the compactness of the object, and identifying the conditions for the logarithmic behavior found in previous literature for various ultracompact objects. Finally, we show that the membrane shear viscosity coefficients associated with neutron star models feature novel quasi-universal relations, which depend only mildly on the neutron-star equation of state.</description>

      <title>Obtaining continuum physics from dynamical simulations of Hamiltonian lattice gauge theories</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.16559</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.16559v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Taking the continuum limit is essential for extracting physical observables from quantum simulations of lattice gauge theories. Achieving the correct continuum limit requires careful control of all systematic uncertainties, including those arising from approximate implementations of the time evolution operator. In this work, we review existing approaches based on renormalization techniques, and point out their limitations. To overcome these limitations, we introduce a new general framework -- the Statistically-Bounded Time Evolution (SBTE) protocol -- for rigorously controlling the impact of approximate time evolution on the continuum limit. The central insight is that, since exact time evolution introduces no UV divergences, errors from approximate evolution can be treated as a source of systematic uncertainty that can be neglected if reduced below the working statistical uncertainty. We show that, using the SBTE protocol, which prescribes driving the approximate time evolution error below the working statistical uncertainty, leads to a simplified renormalization procedure. Furthermore, we show that, due to the existence of rigorous error bounds, one can guarantee a priori that such errors are negligible and do not affect the continuum limit. Ultimately, our protocol lays the foundation for performing systematic and fair comparisons between different simulation algorithms for lattice gauge theory simulations.</description>

      <title>Chiral Invariant Mass Constraints from HESS J1731 347 in an Extended Parity Doublet Model with Isovector Scalar Meson</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.16684</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.16684v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The recent discovery of a central compact object (CCO) within the supernova remnant HESS J1731-347, with mass $0.77^{+0.20}_{-0.17} \ M_\odot $ and radius $10.4^{+0.86}_{-0.78}$ km is the lightest and smallest compact object ever observed. We identify it as an ultra-light Neutron star (NS) and constrain the chiral invariant mass of nucleon $m_0$ from the observational data of NS using an extended parity doublet model with including the isovector scalar meson $a_0(980)$. We study the higher order asymmertic matter properties such as the symmetry incompressibility $K_{sym}$ and the symmetry skewness $Q_{sym}$ in the presence of $a_0$ meson. We find that $K_{sym}$ and $Q_{sym}$ is sensitive to the chiral invariant mass of nucleon $m_0$ in the presence of $a_0$ meson. We show that the equation of state in the present model satisfies all observational constraints within $2\sigma$ credible region including the HESS J1731-347 observation, as well as the constraint from $K_{sym}$ when $740 \,\text{ MeV} \lesssim m_0 \lesssim 860 \,\text{ MeV}$ for $L_0 = $ 57.7 MeV. Yet, the $1\sigma$ constraint from neutron stars appears to be not fully compatible with the constraint from $K_{sym}$ from the present model.</description>

Abstract: Fermion zero modes of Bogomol'nyi-Prasad-Sommerfield monopole-string-domain wall composites in three spatial dimensions are studied. We analytically solve the Dirac equation and prove the existence of one fermion zero mode. Depending on mass parameters of bosons/fermions in the model, the zero modes are localized either on the monopoles, strings or domain walls, which we call monopole-string-domain wall fermions. We also show that in special cases, the zero modes can be confined within a finite vacuum region in the shape of an arbitrary convex polyhedron, which we call the polyhedral vacuum fermions. Furthermore, we show that fermionic superconducting currents do not generally flow on the host solitons except for the cases that the soliton network consists only of strings and domain walls and has translational symmetry about a spatial axis.</description>

      <title>Parton Distributions on a Quantum Computer</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.16829</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.16829v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We perform the first quantum computation of parton distribution function (PDF) with a real quantum device by calculating the PDF of the lightest positronium in the Schwinger model with IBM quantum computers. The calculation uses 10 qubits for staggered fermions at five spatial sites and one ancillary qubit. The most critical and challenging step is to reduce the number of two-qubit gate depths to around 500 so that sensible results start to emerge. The resulting lightcone correlators have excellent agreement with the classical simulator result in central values, although the error is still large. Compared with classical approaches, quantum computation has the advantage of not being limited in the accessible range of parton momentum fraction $x$ due to renormalon ambiguity, and the difficulty of accessing non-valence partons. A PDF calculation with 3+1 dimensional QCD near $x=0$ or $x=1$ will be a clear demonstration of the quantum advantage on a problem with great scientific impact.</description>

Abstract: We study a $U(1)\otimes U(1)$ system coupled to scalar fields. Initially the model is studied in a novel continuum formulation and study of the appropriate diagonalizations is performed. Three models are examined, in two of which the scalar field couples with both gauge fields while in the third one the scalar field couples only to the dark photon. The model is then treated on a space-time lattice. We determine the phase diagram for various values of the kinetic coupling parameter. Then there follows the determination of masses for the scalar fields and the massive gauge fields, as well as the fine structure constants for the massless gauge fields.</description>

      <title>Probing dynamical axion quasiparticles with two-photon correlations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.17013</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.17013v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Dynamical axion (quasi) particles are emergent collective excitations in topological magnetic insulators that break parity and time reversal invariance or in Weyl semimetals. They couple to electromagnetism via a topological Chern-Simons term, leading to their decay into two photons. We extend the Weisskopf-Wigner formulation of atomic spontaneous emission to the quantum field theory of dynamical axion quasiparticles, allowing us to obtain the quantum two-photon state emerging from axion decay in real time. This state features \emph{hyperentanglement} in momentum and polarization with a distinct polarization pattern, a consequence of the parity and time reversal breaking of the axion-photon interaction. Polarization aspects of this two-photon state are studied by introducing quantum Stokes operators. Whereas the two-photon quantum state features vanishing \emph{averages} of the degree of polarization and polarization asymmetry, there are non-trivial momentum correlations of the Stokes operators. In particular momentum correlations of the \emph{polarization asymmetry} can be obtained directly from coincident momentum and polarization resolved two photon detection. Correlations of Stokes operators are directly related to momentum and polarization resolved Hanbury-Brown Twiss second order coherences. This relationship suggests two-photon correlations as a direct probe of dynamical axion quasiparticles. Similarities and differences with parametrically down converted photons and other systems where spontaneous emission yield hyperentangled two photon states are recognized, suggesting experimental avenues similar to tests of Bell inequalities to probe dynamical axion quasiparticles with coincident two photon detection.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2506.17030v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present the results of our lattice QCD computation of the electric ($E_{1}$) and magnetic $(M_{2})$ form factors relevant to the $\chi_{c1}\to J/\psi\,\gamma$ decay by using the gauge field configurations produced by the Extended Twisted Mass Collaboration with $N_{f}=2+1+1$ dynamical Wilson-Clover twisted mass fermions at four different lattice spacings with physical dynamical $u$ , $d$, $s$ and $c$ quark masses (except for the coarsest lattice for which the lightest sea quark corresponds to a pion with $m_{\pi}\simeq 175~\mathrm{MeV}$). In the continuum limit, we obtain $\Gamma( \chi_{c1}\to J/\psi\ \gamma ) = 0.3265(79)~\mathrm{MeV}$, which agrees to $(1\div 2) \sigma$ with the experimental results and disagrees with a previous (unquenched) lattice QCD calculation. Our result for the magnetic quadrupole fractional transition amplitude, $a_{2} =M_{2}/\sqrt{E_{1}^{2}+M_{2}^{2}} = -0.0666(22)$, is in agreement with the experiment and represents an improvement by a factor of about $30$ with respect to the only existing (quenched) lattice QCD result.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2506.17100v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The low-energy effective description of Weyl semimetals is defined by the axion electrodynamics, which captures the effects arising due to the presence of nodes of opposite chirality in the electronic structure. Here we explore the magnetoelectric response of time-reversal breaking (TRB) Weyl superconductors in the London regime. The influence of the axion contribution leads to an increase in the London penetration depth$-$a behavior that can be anticipated by first considering the photon spectrum of a TRB Weyl semimetal. Moreover, we find that both the Meissner state and the vortex phase feature an interplay between the electric and magnetic fields. This leads to a nonvanishing electromagnetic angular momentum, which we calculate for a number of geometrical configurations.</description>

      <title>Multi-particle potentials from light-like Wilson lines in quark-gluon plasmas: a generalized relation of in-medium splitting rates to jet-quenching parameters $\hat q$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/1901.05475</link>
      <description>arXiv:1901.05475v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A powerful historical insight about the theory of in-medium showering in QCD backgrounds was that splitting rates can be related to a parameter $\hat q$ that characterizes the rate of transverse-momentum kicks to a high-energy particle from the medium. Another powerful insight was that $\hat q$ can be defined (with caveats) even when the medium is strongly coupled, using long, narrow Wilson loops whose two long edges are light-like Wilson lines. The medium effects for the original calculations of in-medium splitting rates can be formulated in terms of 3-body imaginary-valued `potentials' that are defined with three long, light-like Wilson lines. Corrections due to overlap of two consecutive splittings can be calculated using similarly defined 4-body potentials. I give a simple argument for how such $N$-body potentials can be determined in the appropriate limit just from knowledge of the values of $\hat q$ for different color representations. For $N &gt; 3$, the $N$-body potentials have non-trivial color structure, which will complicate calculations of overlap corrections outside of the large-$N_c$ or soft bremsstrahlung limits.</description>

Abstract: In this paper, we present the novel analytical expressions for the bounded-from-below or the vacuum stability conditions of scalar potential for a general CP violating two-Higgs-doublet model by using the concepts of co-positivity and the gauge orbit spaces. More precisely, several analyticial sufficient conditions and necessary conditions are established for the vacuum stability of the general 2HDM potential, respectively. We also give an equivalent condition of the vacuum stability of the general 2HDM potential in theory, and then, apply it to derive the analyticial necessary conditions of the general 2HDM potential. Meanwhile, the positive semi-definiteness is proved for a class of 4th-order 2-dimensional complex tensor.</description>

      <title>Constraints on the trilinear and quartic Higgs couplings from triple Higgs production at the LHC and beyond</title>

      <description>arXiv:2312.04646v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Experimental information on the trilinear Higgs boson self-coupling $\kappa_3$ and the quartic self-coupling $\kappa_4$ will be crucial for gaining insight into the shape of the Higgs potential and the nature of the electroweak phase transition. While Higgs pair production processes provide access to $\kappa_3$, triple Higgs production processes, despite their small cross sections, will provide valuable complementary information on $\kappa_3$ and first experimental constraints on $\kappa_4$. We investigate triple Higgs boson production at the HL-LHC, employing efficient Graph Neural Network methodologies to maximise the statistical yield. We show that it will be possible to establish bounds on the variation of both couplings from the HL-LHC analyses that significantly go beyond the constraints from perturbative unitarity. We also discuss the prospects for the analysis of triple Higgs production at future high-energy lepton colliders operating at the TeV scale.</description>

      <title>Finite-energy sum rules at finite chemical potential and zero temperature</title>

      <description>arXiv:2402.14137v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this article we explore the effect of chemical potential at zero temperature in the implementation of in-medium effects in the perturbative sector in finite energy sum rules. For this purpose, we explore the axial, axial-pseudoscalar and pseudoscalar current correlators involving charged pions. The inclusion of non-normal ordered condensates with chemical potential effects in the operator mixing is considered. As a result, the contribution of the operator mixing with chemical potential dependence cancels all the explicit chemical potential contribution of the perturbative sector, aligned with the so-called "silver blaze problem". We find an abrupt transition when $\mu=\sqrt{s_0}/2$, with $s_0$ representing the hadronic continuum threshold. Exploring beyond this critical chemical potential we found similarities with low-energy effective meson models at high chemical potential.</description>

      <title>A realistic method to access heavy meson light-cone distribution amplitudes from first-principle</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.17492v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Lightcone distribution amplitudes (LCDAs) of heavy meson within heavy quark effective theory (HQET) are crucial for predicting physical observables in $B$ decays, but unfortunately there is no first-principle result due to severe challenges. After analyzing these challenges, we propose a realistic method to determine heavy meson LCDA. We utilize equal-time correlations and incorporate a dynamic quark field for a fast moving heavy quark. To verify this method, we make use of lattice QCD simulation on a lattice ensemble with spacing $a = 0.05187$\,fm. The preliminary findings for HQET LCDAs qualitatively align with phenomenological models, and the fitted result for the first inverse moment $\lambda_B^{-1}$ is consistent with the experimentally constrain from $B \to \gamma \ell\nu_\ell$. We explore how our findings can reduce model uncertainties in predictions of heavy-to-light form factors at large recoil. These results demonstrate the promise of our method in providing first-principle predictions for heavy meson LCDAs.</description>

      <title>Mysterious anomalies in Earth's atmosphere and strongly interacting Dark Matter</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.04635v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: It has been recently argued in \cite{Bertolucci:2016xjm, Zioutas:2020ndf, Zioutas:2023ybw} that numerous enigmatic observations remain challenging to explain within the framework of conventional physics. These anomalies include unexpected correlations between temperature variations in the stratosphere, the total electron content of the Earth's atmosphere, and earthquake activity on one hand, and the positions of planets on the other. Decades of collected data provide statistically significant evidence for these observed correlations. The work in \cite{Bertolucci:2016xjm, Zioutas:2020ndf, Zioutas:2023ybw} suggests that these correlations arise from strongly interacting ``streaming invisible matter'' which gets gravitationally focused by the solar system bodies including the Earth's inner mass distribution. Here, we propose that some of these, as well as other anomalies, may be explained by rare yet energetic events involving the so-called axion quark nuggets (AQNs) impacting the Earth. In other words, we identify the ``streaming invisible matter'' conjectured in \cite{Bertolucci:2016xjm, Zioutas:2020ndf, Zioutas:2023ybw} with AQNs, offering a concrete microscopic mechanism to elucidate the observed correlations. It is important to note that the AQN model was originally developed to address the observed similarity between the dark matter and visible matter densities in the Universe \cite{Zhitnitsky:2002qa, Zhitnitsky:2021iwg}, i.e., $\Omega_{\rm DM} \sim \Omega_{\rm visible}$ and not explain the anomalies discussed here. Nonetheless, we support our proposal by demonstrating that the intensity and spectral characteristics of AQN-induced events are consistent with the aforementioned puzzling observations.</description>

      <title>Effective range expansion with a long-range force</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.09375</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.09375v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The validity range of the time-honored effective range expansion can be very limited due to the presence of a left-hand cut close to the two-particle threshold. Such a left-hand cut arises in the two-particle interaction involving a light particle exchange with a mass small or slightly heavier than the mass difference of the two particles, identified as a long-range force, a scenario encountered in a broad range of systems. This can hinder a precise extraction of low-energy scattering observables and resonance poles. To address this issue, we propose a new parameterization for the low-energy scattering amplitude that accounts for the left-hand cut. The parameterization is like a Pad\'e approximation but with nonanalytic terms from the left-hand cut and can be regarded as an extension of the effective range expansion. This parameterization is versatile and applicable to a broad range of systems with Yukawa-type interactions -- including particle, hadronic, nuclear, cold atom and quantum gas systems. In particular, it should be invaluable in understanding various near-threshold hadron resonances. As byproducts, we also show that the parameterization can be used to extract the couplings of the exchanged particle to the scattering particles, and derive expressions for amplitude zeros caused by the interplay between the short- and long-range interactions.</description>

      <title>Non-conservation of Lepton Numbers in the Neutrino Sector Could Change the Prospects for Core Collapse Supernova Explosions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.01080v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We show that interactions violating the conservation of lepton numbers in the neutrino sector could significantly alter the standard low entropy picture for the pre-supernova collapsing core of a massive star. A rapid neutrino-antineutrino equilibration leads to entropy generation and enhanced electron capture and, hence, a lower electron fraction than in the standard model. This would affect the downstream core evolution, the prospects for a supernova explosion, and the emergent neutrino signal. If realized by lepton-number-violating neutrino self-interactions (LNV $\nu$SI), the relevant mediator mass and coupling ranges can be probed by future accelerator-based experiments.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.19619v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present a microscopic dynamical model to study the formation, dissociation, and recombination processes of charmonium states in a heat bath at constant temperature and volume. Within this classical approach, heavy quarks are described as Brownian particles in a background medium of light constituents and can therefore be modeled by a Fokker-Planck equation with constant transport coefficients, which is then implemented through relativistic Langevin simulations. The heavy quarks interact classically via a Coulomb-like screened potential to form a bound state if the relative energy of the pair becomes negative. Dissociation of bound states is possible as a result of screening effects on the potential as well as through scatterings with plasma particles. We demonstrate the full equilibration of the system and show that the resulting equilibrium charmonium yields are in accordance with the Statistical Hadronization Model.</description>

Abstract: The flavor puzzles remain among the most compelling open questions in particle physics. The striking hierarchies observed in the masses and mixing of charged fermions define the Standard Model (SM) flavor puzzle, a profound structural enigma pointing to physics beyond the SM. Simultaneously, the absence of deviations from SM predictions in precision measurements of flavor-changing neutral currents imposes severe constraints on new physics at the TeV scale, giving rise to the new physics flavor puzzle. This review article provides an overview of a selection of recent advancements in flavor model building, with a particular focus on attempts to address one or both of these puzzles within the quark sector.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.14282v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Atom interferometers offer exceptional sensitivity to ultra-light dark matter (ULDM) by precisely measuring effects on atomic systems. Previous studies have demonstrated their capability to detect scalar and vector ULDM candidates, yet their potential for probing spin-2 ULDM remains unexplored. In this work, we address this gap by investigating the sensitivity of atom interferometers to spin-2 ULDM across several frameworks for massive gravity, including the Lorentz-invariant Fierz-Pauli case and two distinct Lorentz-violating scenarios. We show that coherent oscillations of the spin-2 ULDM field induce measurable phase shifts in atom interferometers through three coupling mechanisms: scalar interactions that modify atomic energy levels, and vector and tensor effects that alter the propagation of both atoms and light. We demonstrate that these multifaceted interactions enable atom interferometers to probe a range of ULDM properties and mass scales that are inaccessible to laser interferometric gravitational wave detectors. Our results establish the potential of atom interferometers to open a new experimental frontier for spin-2 dark matter detection.</description>

      <title>Neutrinos as background and signal in searches using the Migdal effect</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.17649v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Ionization or excitation resulting from the noninstantaneous response of the electron cloud to nuclear recoil is known as the Migdal effect. Dark matter searches utilizing this process set the most stringent bounds on the spin-independent dark matter-nucleon scattering cross section over a large region of the sub-GeV dark matter parameter space, underscoring its significance in dark matter detection. In this paper, we quantify the regions of dark matter parameter space that are challenging to probe via the Migdal effect due to the presence of dominant solar neutrino backgrounds for both liquid noble and semiconductor targets. Our findings reveal that there is no hard floor in the dark matter parameter space. Instead, we map the so-called neutrino fog. In mapping the neutrino fog, we identify the importance of incorporating the Migdal effect induced by neutrinos, as well as neutrino-electron scattering and dominant coherent neutrino-nucleus scattering, particularly for semiconductor targets. Furthermore, we demonstrate that a large portion of the relic density allowed parameter space lies within the neutrino fog. Finally, we estimate the exposure required to detect neutrino-induced Migdal events in direct detection experiments.</description>

      <title>Pion fragmentation functions from a quark-jet model in a functional approach</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.19907v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The elementary fragmentation function that describes the process $q\to \pi$ is predicted applying crossing and charge symmetry to the cut diagram of the pion valence quark distribution function. This elementary probability distribution defines the ladder-kernel of a quark jet fragmentation equation, which is solved self-consistently to obtain the full pion fragmentation function. The hadronization into a pion employs the complete Poincar\'e invariant Bethe-Salpeter wave function, though the overwhelming contribution to the fragmentation function is due the leading Bethe-Salpeter amplitude. Compared to a Nambu--Jona-Lasinio model prediction, the fragmentation function we obtain is enhanced in the range $z \lesssim 0.8$ but otherwise in good qualitative agreement. The full pion fragmentation function is overall greater than the elementary fragmentation function below $z\lesssim 0.6$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2501.04525v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Searches for axion-like particles (ALPs) with masses in the GeV range are a central objective of present and future Intensity-Frontier experiments. Interpreting these searches demands a reliable description of ALP production and decay. The prescription currently adopted by the community depends on unphysical chiral-rotation parameters, wrongly describes the mass scaling of the ALP flux, and ignores mixing with heavy pseudoscalar resonances. We introduce the framework that treats GeV-scale ALP interactions self-consistently, includes their mixing with heavier excitations $\pi(1300)$, $\eta(1295)$, $\eta(1440)$, and properly describes production channels. When applying our description to proton beam experiments, we find that existing bounds and projected sensitivities shift by up to an order of magnitude relative to earlier estimates. We further delineate the dominant theoretical uncertainties, which originate from the still-incomplete experimental knowledge of the light-meson spectrum.</description>

      <title>High Energy Vector Boson Scattering in Four-Body Final States to Probe Higgs Cubic, Quartic, and HEFT interactions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.16439</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.16439v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We compute the energy scales of perturbative unitarity violation in various $2 \to 4$ vector boson scattering (VBS) processes and compare them to lower multiplicity processes. The final states include $h^4$, $V_L V_L h h$, and $V_L^4$, where $V_L$ represents the longitudinal mode of $Z$ or $W$ boson, and $h$ the Higgs boson. We consider scenarios with modified cubic and quartic Higgs self-couplings, including those derived from the Standard Model Effective Field Theory (SMEFT), as well as scenarios involving derivative operators from Higgs Effective Field Theory (HEFT). Modified Higgs self-couplings typically lead to perturbative unitarity violation in at least the $2\to 3$ VBS; however, the corresponding energy scales of unitarity violation are often very high. Our analysis reveals that, in the case of modified Higgs potentials, $2\to4$ processes exhibit significantly lower energy scales of unitarity violation compared to $2 \to 3$ processes. This, combined with the fact that the cross sections of $2 \to 4$ processes increase with energy, suggests they generate more signal events at high energies, $\sqrt{\hat{s}} \gtrsim 2$ TeV, which could be achieved in future colliders. In contrast, for HEFT derivative interactions, higher multiplicity offers diminished benefits, as $2 \to 4$ cross sections are often smaller than those of related $2 \to 3$ processes within the valid energy range. This study shows that $2 \to 4$ VBS processes are particularly compelling for probing Higgs potential modification, including the cubic and quartic couplings, but are less advantageous when derivative interactions dominate.</description>

      <title>Two-loop corrections to QCD $\theta$ angle from evanescent operator in the BMHV scheme</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.14500v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the renormalization of the QCD $\theta$ angle at the two-loop level focusing on divergent and finite $CP$-violating contributions from evanescent operators, using dimensional regularization with the BMHV scheme. When one considers the Lagrangian in $d$-dimensional space-time instead of four dimensions in dimensional regularization, evanescent operators that break the chiral symmetry are induced. Consequently, $T$-odd and $P$-odd fermion loops in the BMHV scheme generate evanescent contributions to the QCD $\theta$ angle. We carefully classify the evanescent contributions into two types: one originating from the evanescent operators at the one-loop level and the other directly produced by two-loop calculations. We show that renormalization of the parameters in the BMHV scheme keeps removing those unphysical contributions to the QCD $\theta$ angle at any scale at the two-loop level. We also discuss how the rephasing invariance of the radiative correction to the QCD $\theta$ angle is realized in the BMHV scheme.</description>

      <title>Next-to-next-to-leading order threshold soft function for $tW$ production</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.18648</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.18648v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We compute the two-loop soft function for the associated production of a top quark and a $W$ boson near the threshold, where the invariant mass of the $tW$ system approaches the collider energy. We employ the reverse unitarity technique and integration-by-parts identities to reduce soft loop integrals to a minimal basis of master integrals. These master integrals are analytically evaluated using the method of differential equations, yielding results expressed in terms of multiple polylogarithms. Additionally, we analyze the asymptotic behavior of the soft function in the low and high energy limits. Our results provide a vital component for threshold resummation at the next-to-next-to-next-to-leading logarithmic level in this process.</description>

      <title>Time-evolution of parity-odd cascades in homogeneous Abelian and non-Abelian media with chiral imbalance</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.00933v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study radiation by a fast particle in a medium with a finite chiral chemical potential. The medium's anomalous response encompasses the chiral magnetic effect, enabling novel chiral Cherenkov and pair production processes. The kinematics of the corresponding cascades is fundamentally different from conventional cascades. Notably, it is not dominated by the strong ordering of momenta. Employing the effective Chern-Simons extensions of QED and QCD to incorporate the chiral magnetic effect, we derive and solve the evolution equations describing the cascades in a chiral medium, presuming that the anomalous contributions are dominant.</description>

      <title>Testing Lepton Flavor Universality at the Electron-Ion Collider</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.02605v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Measurements of $b\to c\tau^-\bar\nu_\tau$ transitions at colliders are highly motivated for testing lepton flavor universality (LFU), a cornerstone hypothesis of the Standard Model (SM). Potential observations of LFU violation could provide significant evidence for physics beyond the SM (BSM). The substantial production of $b$-hadrons at the Electron-Ion Collider (EIC) would highlight its potential to support LFU testing and complement studies conducted at other experimental facilities. In this paper, we study the production of $b$-hadrons in deep inelastic scattering processes at the EIC with $\sqrt{s}=100\,\rm GeV$. We estimate the $b$-hadron yields at the EIC to reach $\mathcal O(10^9)$ with an integrated luminosity of up to $10^3\,{\rm fb}^{-1}$. Furthermore, we perform a systematic study on various $b$-hadron decays, exploring the sensitivities of LFU-violating observables, including $R_{J/\psi}$, $R_{D_s^{(\ast)}}$ and $R_{\Lambda_c}$. Detailed strategies for track-based event reconstruction are investigated for these observables. We also include a discussion of the annihilation process $B_c^+ \to \tau^+\nu_\tau$. Finally, we provide a theoretical interpretation of the projected sensitivities within the framework of low energy effective field theory (LEFT). Our analysis indicates that the EIC has the potential to constrain the relevant Wilson coefficients at $\mathcal O(0.1)$, offering complementary insights to other measurements.</description>

      <title>Dynamical dark energy from an ultralight axion</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.18120v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Recently the Dark Energy Survey (DES) Collaboration presented evidence that the equation of state $w$ of the dark energy is varying, or $w \simeq -0.948$ if it is constant. In either case, the dark energy cannot be due to a cosmological constant alone. Here we study an ultralight axion (or axion-like particle) with mass $m_\phi \simeq 2 \times 10^{-33}$ eV that has properties that can explain the new $w$ measurement. In particular, $w\ge -1$ and a negative cosmological constant $\Lambda &lt; 0$ is preferred in this model. We also present a simple formula for $w$ for the model to ease data fitting.</description>

      <title>Two or three things particle physicists (mis)understand about (pre)heating</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.19980v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The transition from the end of inflation to a hot, thermal Universe, commonly referred to as (re)heating, is a critical yet often misunderstood phase in early Universe cosmology. This short review aims to provide a comprehensive, conceptually clear, and accessible introduction to the physics of (re)heating, tailored to the particle physics community. We critically examine the standard Boltzmann approach, emphasizing its limitations in capturing the intrinsically non-perturbative and non-linear dynamics that dominate the early stages of energy transfer. These include explosive particle production, inflaton fragmentation, turbulence, and thermalization; phenomena often overlooked in perturbative treatments. We survey a wide range of theoretical tools, from Boltzmann equations to lattice simulations, clarifying when each is applicable and highlighting scenarios where analytic control is still feasible. Special attention is given to model-dependent features such as (pre)heating, the role of fermions, gravitational couplings, and the impact of multifield dynamics. We also discuss exceptional cases, including Starobinsky-like models and instant (pre)heating, where (re)heating proceeds through analytically tractable channels without requiring full non-linear simulations. Ultimately, this review serves both as a practical guide and a cautionary tale, advocating for a more nuanced and physically accurate understanding of this pivotal epoch within the particle physics community.</description>

      <title>Chiral Solitons</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.20534v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Generalizing quantum chromodynamics (QCD) from three to arbitrarily many color degrees of freedom suggests that baryons can be described as solitons in an effective meson theory whose interaction strength decreases with the number of colors. The exact form of that theory is unknown, but at low energies chiral symmetry and its breaking are considered as the construction recipes for modeling the theory. The Skyrmion is a static, localized solution in a non-linear field theory for pions and it is the most prominent version of a soliton in a chirally symmetric meson theory. Upon quantization it reproduces the spectrum of the low-lying baryons and their static properties reasonably well. Extending that theory by vector mesons improves on the agreement between predicted and empirical data. Chiral solitons within models for the quark flavor dynamics facilitate the investigation of nucleon structure functions. Here we provide a pedagogical overview of these facets.</description>

      <title>Relativistic dynamics of charmonia in strong magnetic fields</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.03294v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate the properties of charmonium systems in strong external magnetic fields using a relativistic light-front Hamiltonian approach within the Basis Light-Front Quantization (BLFQ) framework. By solving the eigenvalue problem for the invariant mass squared operator with confinement potentials and one-gluon-exchange interactions, we obtain the mass spectrum and wave functions under varying magnetic fields. Our results reveal significant spectral modifications via the Zeeman effect, including $\eta_c$-$J/\psi$ mixing and magnetic sublevel splitting. Momentum density analysis demonstrates wave function deformation, with transverse momentum broadening and longitudinal narrowing under strong fields, alongside structural shifts in parton distributions such as double-hump profiles in excited states. Relativistic corrections and center-of-mass coupling critically drive these dynamics, highlighting the necessity of a relativistic framework for QCD bound states in extreme magnetic environments.</description>

      <title>Timelike form factor for the anomalous process $\gamma^\ast \pi \rightarrow \pi \pi$</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.20899v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The form factor $F_{3\pi}(s,t,u)$ for the anomalous process $\gamma^\ast \pi \rightarrow \pi \pi$ is calculated in the isospin limit for several values of the light current-quark mass (i.e., the pion mass) using Dyson-Schwinger and Bethe-Salpeter equations. Beyond a quark interaction kernel representing gluon-mediated interactions, leading beyond-rainbow-ladder effects at low energies are incorporated by back-coupling pions as explicit degrees of freedom. Building upon an earlier calculation of the quark-photon vertex that captures the branch cut associated with the two-pion threshold and the rho meson resonance, the form factor $F_{3\pi}(s,t,u)$ is determined for timelike Mandelstam s. In particular, predictions are made for the kinematics relevant for the Primakoff reaction studied with COMPASS/AMBER at CERN.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2505.04477v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Applying the holographic 2-flavor Einstein--Maxwell-dilaton model, the parameters of which are fixed by lattice QCD, we extract the equations of state for hot quark--gluon plasma around the critical point at T=182 MeV, and have corresponding quark star cores constructed. By further adding hadron shells, the mass range of the whole stars spans from 2 to 17 solar masses, with the maximum compactness around 0.22. This result allows them to be black hole mimickers and candidates for gap events. The I--Love--Q--C relations are also analyzed, which show consistency with the neutron star cases when the discontinuity at the quark--hadron interface is not large. Furthermore, we illustrate the full parameter maps of the energy density and pressure as functions of the temperature and chemical potential and discuss the constant thermal conductivity case supposing a heat source inside.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2505.06726v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, I investigate the gluon distributions for the kaon and pion, as well as the improvement of the valence-quark distributions, in the framework of the gauge-invariant nonlocal chiral quark model (NL$\chi$QM), where the momentum dependence is taken into account. I then compute the gluon distributions for the kaon and pion that are dynamically generated from the splitting functions in the DGLAP QCD evolution. In a comparison with the recent lattice QCD and JAM global analysis results, it is found that the results for the pion gluon distributions at $Q =$ 2 GeV, which is set based on the lattice QCD, have a good agreement with the recent lattice QCD data; this is followed up with the up valence-quark distribution of the pion results at $Q =$ 5.2 GeV in comparison with the reanalysis experimental data. The prediction for the kaon gluon distributions at $Q = 2$ GeV is consistent with the recent lattice QCD calculation.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2505.18349v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We obtain the electromagnetic pion form factor (emFF) $F_\pi$ for spacelike mid-range of momentum transfer in QCD. We use renormalization group summation within the light cone sum rules (LCSRs) to obtain the QCD radiative corrections to the $F_\pi$ and involve contributions of the leading twist 2 and twists 4, 6. The strong coupling constants in this approach are free of Landau singularities, which allows one to go down to the lower transferred momentum $Q^2$. The prediction of the calculations performed reproduces the experimental data below/around $Q^2= 1$ GeV$^2$ significantly better than analogous predictions based on a fixed-order power-series expansion in the standard QCD.</description>

      <title>The anomalous magnetic moment of the muon in the Standard Model: an update</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.21476</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.21476v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present the current Standard Model (SM) prediction for the muon anomalous magnetic moment, $a_\mu$, updating the first White Paper (WP20) [1]. The pure QED and electroweak contributions have been further consolidated, while hadronic contributions continue to be responsible for the bulk of the uncertainty of the SM prediction. Significant progress has been achieved in the hadronic light-by-light scattering contribution using both the data-driven dispersive approach as well as lattice-QCD calculations, leading to a reduction of the uncertainty by almost a factor of two. The most important development since WP20 is the change in the estimate of the leading-order hadronic-vacuum-polarization (LO HVP) contribution. A new measurement of the $e^+e^-\to\pi^+\pi^-$ cross section by CMD-3 has increased the tensions among data-driven dispersive evaluations of the LO HVP contribution to a level that makes it impossible to combine the results in a meaningful way. At the same time, the attainable precision of lattice-QCD calculations has increased substantially and allows for a consolidated lattice-QCD average of the LO HVP contribution with a precision of about 0.9%. Adopting the latter in this update has resulted in a major upward shift of the total SM prediction, which now reads $a_\mu^\text{SM} = 116\,592\,033(62)\times 10^{-11}$ (530 ppb). When compared against the current experimental average based on the E821 experiment and runs 1-6 of E989 at Fermilab, one finds $a_\mu^\text{exp} - a_\mu^\text{SM} =38(63)\times 10^{-11}$, which implies that there is no tension between the SM and experiment at the current level of precision. The final precision of E989 (127 ppb) is the target of future efforts by the Theory Initiative. The resolution of the tensions among data-driven dispersive evaluations of the LO HVP contribution will be a key element in this endeavor.</description>

      <title>Astrophysical flux of dark particles as a solution to the KM3NeT and IceCube tension over KM3-230213A</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.22711</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.22711v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We entertain the possibility that transient astrophysical sources can produce a flux of dark particles that induce ultra-high-energy signatures at neutrino telescopes such as IceCube and KM3NeT. We construct scenarios where such ``dark flux" can produce meta-stable dark particles inside the Earth that subsequently decay to muons, inducing through-going tracks in large-volume neutrino detectors. We consider such a scenario in light of the $\mathcal{O}(70)$~PeV ultra-high-energy muon observed by KM3NeT and argue that because of its location in the sky and the strong geometrical dependence of the signal, such events would not necessarily have been observed by IceCube. Our model relies on the upscattering of a new particle $X$ onto new metastable particles that decay to dimuons with decay lengths of $\mathcal{O}(100)$~km. This scenario can explain the observation by KM3NeT without being in conflict with the IceCube data.</description>

      <title>The Primakoff effect: The Axion-Photon Mixing in the Context of Stellar Plasma Physics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.09103</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.09103v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We propose in this work the study of the production of axions in stellar plasma medium through an external magnetic field. In the background field approximation, we can show that the presence of the external magnetic field induces a mixing between the photon and the axion, i.e. the so called Primakoff effect. Since the axion is one of the greatest candidates for dark matter, for being a neutral pseudo-scalar field, the Primakoff process constitutes a mechanism (or portal) to access the dark sector, which in turn provides us new perspectives beyond the standard model. In the high energies limit, observables like probabilities transitions and particles production rates were computed.</description>

Abstract: Here we have considered $J/\Psi$ is a normal charmonium meson, while $\Psi(2S)$ is a mixed hybrid charmonium meson. Similarly $\Upsilon(1S)$ and$\Upsilon(2S)$ are normal upsilon mesons, while $\Upsilon(3S)$ is a mixed hybrid upsilon meson. We discuss the differential rapidity cross sections for $J/\Psi$, $\Psi(2S)$, $\Upsilon(1S)$, $\Upsilon(2S)$, $\Upsilon(3S)$ production via p-p, and O-O collisions at proton-proton energy $\equiv \sqrt{s_{pp}}$= 5.44 TeV. The rapidity taken for the present study goes from y=-1 to 1.</description>

      <title>Recommended conventions for reporting results from direct dark matter searches</title>

      <description>arXiv:2105.00599v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The field of dark matter detection is a highly visible and highly competitive one. In this paper, we propose recommendations for presenting dark matter direct detection results particularly suited for weak-scale dark matter searches, although we believe the spirit of the recommendations can apply more broadly to searches for other dark matter candidates, such as very light dark matter or axions. To translate experimental data into a final published result, direct detection collaborations must make a series of choices in their analysis, ranging from how to model astrophysical parameters to how to make statistical inferences based on observed data. While many collaborations follow a standard set of recommendations in some areas, for example the expected flux of dark matter particles (to a large degree based on a paper from Lewin and Smith in 1995), in other areas, particularly in statistical inference, they have taken different approaches, often from result to result by the same collaboration. We set out a number of recommendations on how to apply the now commonly used Profile Likelihood Ratio method to direct detection data. In addition, updated recommendations for the Standard Halo Model astrophysical parameters and relevant neutrino fluxes are provided. The authors of this note include members of the DAMIC, DarkSide, DARWIN, DEAP, LZ, NEWS-G, PandaX, PICO, SBC, SENSEI, SuperCDMS, and XENON collaborations, and these collaborations provided input to the recommendations laid out here. Wide-spread adoption of these recommendations will make it easier to compare and combine future dark matter results.</description>

      <title>GRB 221009A: Spectral signatures based on ALPs candidates</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.05145</link>
      <description>arXiv:2305.05145v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: GRB 221009A has posed a significant challenge to our current understanding of the mechanisms that produce TeV photons in gamma-ray bursts (GRB). On one hand, the Klein-Nishina (KN) effect of the inverse Compton scattering leads to less efficient energy losses of high-energy electrons. In the other hand, at a redshift of 0.151, the TeV spectrum of GRB 221009A undergoes significant absorption by the Extragalactic Background Light (EBL). Therefore, the observation of a 13-TeV photon in this event implies the presence of enormous photon fluxes at the source, which the Synchrotron Self-Compton mechanism in external shocks cannot easily generate. As an alternative, some authors have suggested the possibility of converting the TeV-photons into Axion-like particles (ALPs) at the host galaxy, in order to avoid the effects of EBL absorption, and then reconverting them into photons within the Milky Way. While this solution relaxes the requirement of very high photon fluxes, the KN effect still poses a challenge. Previously, we have shown that the injections of ALPs could explain the observation of 13-TeV photons. Here, we include the energy dependence of the survival probability and the amount of energy carried to determine the ALP candidates which could potentially explain the TeV photons observed by LHAASO and their hard spectrum. We found that the allowed candidates are generally cluster around masses of $10^{-7}$ eV. We also considered different EBL models, for the one predicting larger attenuation tends to reject ALP candidates with the lowest coupling factor. For some hypothesis of EBL model, these candidates are found below a region of the parameter space in which, if detected, ALPs could account for all of the cold dark matter in the Universe.</description>

      <title>Towards multi-messenger observations of core-collapse supernovae harbouring choked jets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.16234</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.16234v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Choked jets (CJ) have attracted particular attention as potential sources of high-energy cosmic neutrinos. Testing this hypothesis is challenging because of the missing gamma-ray counterpart, hence the identification of other electromagnetic (EM) signatures is crucial. A CJ source is expected harbouring in core-collapse supernovae (CCSNe) with extended H envelopes, releasing ultraviolet (UV) and optical emission for a few days. The UV band will be visible with an unprecedentedly large field of view by the future satellite ULTRASAT, for which we investigate the detection prospects in relation to the CJ visibility in the optical band with the currently operating telescope ZTF. ULTRASAT will be able to double the volume of sky currently visible by ZTF for the same emitting sources (sample of observed Type II SNe enlarged by 50%). As these sources can produce neutrinos via hadronic/photohadronic interactions in CJ, we investigate how neutrino observations by existing Cherenkov high-energy neutrino telescopes (IceCube and KM3NeT) can be used in association with EM signals coming from shock breakout (SBO) events. For optimized multimessenger detections, the delay between neutrino produced at SBO (during the jet propagation inside the stellar envelope) and ULTRASAT observations should be of around 4(5) days, with a follow-up by instruments like ZTF about one week after. We estimate that at most ~20% of the CCSNe from red supergiant stars detectable with ULTRASAT might host a CJ and release TeV neutrinos. EM and neutrino detections, if accompanied by photometric and spectroscopic follow-up with evidence for a relativistic jet launched by the central engine, would suggest CCSNe harbouring choked jets as main contributors to the cosmic diffuse neutrino flux.</description>

      <title>Primordial Black Holes in the Solar System</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.04518v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: If primordial black holes (PBHs) of asteroidal mass make up the entire dark matter, they could be detectable through their gravitational influence in the solar system. In this work, we study the perturbations that PBHs induce on the orbits of planets. Detailed numerical simulations of the solar system, embedded in a halo of PBHs, are performed. We find that the gravitational effect of the PBHs is dominated by the closest encounter. Using the Earth-Mars distance as an observational probe, we show that the perturbations are smaller than the current measurement uncertainties and thus PBHs are not directly constrained by solar system ephemerides. We estimate that an improvement in the ranging accuracy by an order of magnitude or the extraction of signals well below the noise level is required to detect the gravitational influence of PBHs in the solar system in the foreseeable future.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.03639v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We show how certain types of magnetic asymptotically Anti-de Sitter Euclidean wormholes can catalyze the onset of inflation. These wormholes can be embedded as saddle point solutions of General Relativity coupled to the Standard Model, the inflaton being identified with the Higgs particle. Our scenario is based on the assumption that the quantum effective potential for the Higgs turns negative at a certain high energy window, in line with current measured values for the Higgs and Top quark masses. Within our proposal, we can estimate various parameters and physical quantities of interest, in consistency with current observational bounds.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.15052v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present the first theoretical study of the polarization of lepton pairs produced in $\sqrt{s_\mathrm{NN}} = 5.02$ TeV Pb+Pb collisions at the LHC, using next-to-leading order (NLO) dilepton emission rates. These calculations employ a multi-stage framework to simulate the evolution of relativistic heavy-ion collisions, and to explore the sensitivity of polarization to early times. It is found that the intermediate invariant-mass dileptons are indeed probes of the thermal equilibration process, and go beyond the reach of hadronic observables. We compute the polarization anisotropy coefficient obtained with LO dilepton rates, and show that the LO and NLO results differ radically, both in trend and in magnitude, at low and intermediate lepton pair invariant masses.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.19324v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recently proposed $SL(2,\mathbb{Z})$ invariant $\alpha$-attractor models have plateau potentials with respect to the inflaton and axion fields. The slope of the potential in the inflaton direction is exponentially suppressed at large values of the inflaton field, but the slope of the potential in the axion direction is double-exponentially suppressed. Therefore, the axion field remains nearly massless and practically does not change during inflation. The inflationary trajectory in such models is stable with respect to quantum fluctuations of the axion field. We show that isocurvature perturbations do not feed into the curvature perturbations during inflation, and discuss the possibility of such transfer at the post-inflationary stage.</description>

Abstract: We construct, for the first time, a three-family $\mathcal{N}=1$ supersymmetric Pati-Salam model from rigid intersecting D6-branes on a factorizable $\mathbb{T}^6/(\mathbb{Z}_2\times \mathbb{Z}_2')$ orientifold with discrete torsion. The factorizable geometry allows for explicit control over rigid cycles and moduli stabilization. We can break the Pati-Salam gauge symmetry down to the Standard Model (SM) gauge symmetry via the supersymmetry preserving Higgs mechanism, generate the SM fermion masses and mixings, and break the supersymmetry via gaugino condensations in the hidden sector.</description>

Abstract: Recent Bayesian analyses of heavy ion collision data have established a non-trivial temperature dependence of the shear and bulk viscosity per entropy. Motivated by this, we consider higher derivative corrections to realistic, bottom-up holographic models of quark-gluon plasma based on five-dimensional Einstein-dilaton theories and determine the dilaton potentials in the higher derivative terms by matching the Bayesian analyses. A byproduct of our analysis is the bulk viscosity that follows from the holographic V-QCD theory. Higher derivative corrections when treated perturbatively lead to tension with existing data. We investigate possible resolutions.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.19072v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Entanglement is solely a quantum property and it can be extremely helpful to test the physics beyond the Standard Model in tabletop experiments with the advent of future quantum technologies. In this work, we provide an entanglement-based partial positive transpose witness for Yukawa-type potentials in the infrared regime between pairs of neutral/charged particles in a spatial quantum superposition. The entanglement is created by the interaction beyond the Standard Model such as axionlike particle or physics motivated by string theory such as extra dimensions in the context of gravity. We will study the constrained couplings in a few different models along with the decoherence rate to show what parameters can be searched for in near-future entanglement-driven experiments for the search of new physics.</description>

      <title>nuSCOPE: A short-baseline neutrino beam at CERN for high-precision cross-section measurements</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.21589</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.21589v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A new generation of neutrino cross-section experiments at the GeV scale is crucial in the precision era of oscillation physics and lepton flavor studies. In this document, we present a novel neutrino beam design that leverages the experience and R&amp;D achievements of the NP06/ENUBET and NuTag Collaborations and explore its potential implementation at CERN. This beam enables flux monitoring at the percent level and provides a neutrino energy measurement independent of final state particle reconstruction at the neutrino detector. As a result, it eliminates the two primary sources of systematic uncertainty in cross-section measurements: flux normalization and energy bias caused by nuclear effects. We provide a detailed description of the beam technology and instrumentation, along with an overview of its physics potential, with particular emphasis on cross-sections relevant to DUNE and Hyper-Kamiokande.</description>

      <title>Enhancing European Cooperation in the Search for Dark Matter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.01688</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.01688v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The search for dark matter is an exciting topic that is pursued in different communities over a wide range of masses and using a variety of experimental approaches. The result is a strongly correlated matrix of activities across Europe and beyond, both on the experimental and the theoretical side. We suggest to encourage and foster the collaboration of the involved institutions on technical, scientific and organisational level, in order to realise the synergies that are required to increase the impact of dark matter research and to cope with the increasing experiment sizes. The suggested network -- loosely titled "DMInfraNet" -- could be realised as a new initiative of the European strategy or be based on existing structures like iDMEu or DRD. The network can also serve as a nucleus for future joint funding proposals.</description>

      <title>Universal inverse Radon transforms: Inhomogeneity, angular restrictions and boundary</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.01744</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.01744v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: An alternative method to invert the Radon transforms without the use of Courant-Hilbert's identities has been proposed and developed independently from the space dimension. For the universal representation of inverse Radon transform, we study the consequences of inhomogeneity of outset function without the restrictions on the angular Radon coordinates. We show that this inhomogeneity yields a natural evidence for the presence of the extra contributions in the case of the full angular region. In addition, if the outset function is well-localized in the space, we demonstrate that the corresponding boundary conditions and the angular restrictions should be applied for both the direct and inverse Radon transforms. Besides, we relate the angular restrictions on the Radon variable to the boundary exclusion of outset function and its Radon image.</description>

      <title>Fractional attractors in light of the latest ACT observations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.02809</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.02809v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In light of the latest results from ACT observations we review a class of potentials labeled as fractional attractors, that can originate from Palatini gravity. We show that, for certain choices of the scalar potential $V(\phi)$, the fractional attractors predict both a spectral index $n_s$ and a tensor-to-scalar ratio $r$ that fall within the $1\sigma$ region of the combined ACT+Planck data for a wide range of parameters. We also provide a numerical fit for the parameter space of this models in the case of a simple quadratic and quartic fractional potential.</description>

      <title>First Nucleon Gluon PDF from Large Momentum Effective Theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.13321</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.13321v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We report the first nucleon gluon parton distribution function (PDF) using Large-Momentum Effective Theory (LaMET). We focus on the gluon operator which was demonstrated to have the best signal-to-noise in the previous attempt [1] in computing gluon PDFs using LaMET. We compute the corresponding Wilson coefficients needed for the hybrid-renormalized matrix elements and the matching kernel to convert the quasi-PDF to the lightcone one at the one-loop level. We demonstrate that with the proper Wilson coefficients in place, the counterterms for the renormalization are independent of the hadron and mass within statistical error. Using the resulting renormalization, we then compute the nucleon PDF using a HISQ ensemble generated by the MILC collaboration with $N_f=2+1+1$, $a \approx 0.12$ fm, with valence pion masses of 310 and 690 MeV and two gauge link smearing techniques. Despite the physics effects of the heavier than physical pion masses and gauge link smearing, this calculation provides excellent proof of principle and compares reasonably with selected global fit results.</description>

      <title>Naive parton picture for color transparency of kaon in the electronuclear reaction $A(e,e'K^+)$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.15331</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.15331v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Nuclear transparency in the kaon-induced nuclear reaction $A(e,e'K^+)$ is investigated in parallel with our previous study on the pion transparency in Phys. Rev. C {\bf111}, 064608 (2025). Based on the Glauber scattering theory, which incorporates shadowing by the two-step process, the kaon color transparency (CT) is analyzed to find that the slope of the kaon CT steeper than the pion CT along with the photon virtuality $Q^2$ increase is well accounted for by the naive parton model (NPM) rather than by the quantum diffusion model (QDM). Further diminishing of CT due to shadowing in the initial state yields better agreement with experimental data. The dependence of kaon transparency on $Q^2$ up to 10 GeV$^2/c^2$ and the mass number $A$ is presented for comparison with the JLab data at the 6 GeV electron beam for the reaction $A(e,e'K^+)$ in $^{12}$C, $^{63}$Cu, and $^{197}$Au nuclei.</description>

      <title>Entanglement through high-energy scattering in noncommutative quantum electrodynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.15350</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.15350v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We analyze the tree-level generation of entanglement through some key scattering processes in massless quantum electrodynamics on canonical noncomutative spacetime with space-space type of noncommutativity. The fermions in the noncommutative theory will be zero charge fermions. The scattering processes we shall study do not occur in ordinary Minkowski spacetime. We shall use the concurrence to characterize the amount of entanglement generated through a given scattering process. We shall show that, at tree-level, the concurrence for the scattering of two photons of opposite helicity is given by the same expression as in the case of the scattering of gluons in ordinary Minkowski spacetime. Thus, maximal entanglement is achieved if and only if the polar scattering angle is equal to $\pi/2$. We also compute the concurrence for the head-on collision in the laboratory reference frame of two fermions of opposite helicity to obtain the same result as in the case of photon scattering. Finally, we shall study a type of collision at right angles in the laboratory frame of fermions with opposite helicity. We show that in the latter case the concurrence depends on energy of the incoming fermions, the noncommutativity matrix $\theta^{ij}$, the polar, $\theta$, and azimuth angle, $\phi$, of the zero-momentum frame of the incoming fermions. In this latter case we see that when $\theta=\pi/2$ there are values of $\phi$ for which no entanglement is generated.</description>
