      <title>Unveiling secondary particle generation in a SONTRAC detector through GEANT4 simulations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.01616</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.01616v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: SOlar Neutron TRACking (SONTRAC) is a detector concept based on a bundle of plastic scintillators by aiming at tracking the solar neutrons through the generation of the secondary particles such as protons from the (n, np) and (n, p) processes. In this study, in addition to the particle population, the energy spectra of the secondary particles including protons, gamma rays, electrons, alphas, and ions that are produced either due to the interaction between the fast neutrons and a SONTRAC detector or through the interplay between the secondary particles and the detector components are determined by means of GEANT4 simulations. The detector geometry in the present study consists of 34$\times$34 Kuraray Y11-200(M) fibers, and the current fiber bundle is irradiated with a planar vertical neutron beam of 0.2$\times$0.2 cm$^{2}$ by using an energy list composed of 20, 40, 60, 80, and 100 MeV where the number of incident neutrons is $10^5$. First, It is revealed that a non-negligible number of secondary protons are generated by the fast neutron bombardment; however, the population of these secondary protons is still low compared to the incident beam, i.e. in the order of $10^3$. Secondly, it is also observed that the energy spectrum of secondary protons exhibits a decreasing trend that is limited by the kinetic energy of incident neutrons. Additionally, the range of the secondary protons along with the deposited energy is computed, and it is demonstrated that a significant portion of the generated protons lose their entire energy and stop within the present SONTRAC detector. Finally, a 34$\times$34 pixel grid detector is introduced on each side of the fiber bundle to collect the optical photons produced from the energy deposition in the scintillation fibers, and the trajectory of the secondary protons on the pixel grid is shown by using a fast neutron beam of 100 MeV.</description>

      <title>Radio-frequency cavity field measurements through free falling bead</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.01609</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.01609v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper introduces a novel bead-falling measurement method for the precise and efficient mapping of electromagnetic fields within radio-frequency (RF) cavities, which are crucial components in the design of accelerators. The traditional bead-pull method, while effective, involves mechanical complexities and is prone to errors from wire perturbations. The innovative method reported here leverages the simplicity and accuracy of free-falling beads to mitigate these issues. This technique eliminates the need for a wire-pulley system, thereby simplifying the experimental setup and reducing potential mechanical errors. We detail the development and operational principles of this new method, including the design of a compact, portable measurement device that integrates a bead/droplet release system and a bead detection system linked to a Vector Network Analyzer (VNA). The device has been tested with a three-gap buncher cavity and a scaled Alvarez-type cavity, demonstrating its ability to perform rapid, reliable field measurements under various challenging conditions, including low signal-to-noise ratios and environmental vibrations. The results confirm the method's superiority in precision and operational efficiency, potentially setting a new standard for RF cavity diagnostics and tuning.</description>

      <title>Brownian thermal birefringent noise due to non-diagonal anisotropic photoelastic effect in multilayer coated mirrors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.01634</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.01634v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Thermal noise in the mirror coatings limits the accuracy of today's most optical precision measurement experiments. Unlike the more commonly discussed thermal phase noise, the crystalline coating can generate thermal birefringent noise due to its anisotropic nature. In this study, we propose that the non-diagonal anisotropic photoelastic effect induced by the Brownian motion of mirror coating layers may contribute to this noise. Employing a standard model for the coating surface, we calculate the spectrum of the non-diagonal anisotropic Brownian photoelastic(NABP) noise to be $1.2 \times 10^{-11} p_{63} f^{-1/2}/\rm{Hz}^{1/2}$. Further experiments are warranted to validate the influence of this effect and reduce its uncertainty. Our findings highlight that for high-precision experiments involving optical resonant cavities targeting signals imprinted in optical polarizations, this noise could emerge as a limiting factor for experimental sensitivity.</description>

      <title>2-Terminal Coaxial Capacitance Measurements and Cable Corrections</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2211.00757</link>
      <description>arXiv:2211.00757v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Coaxial 2-terminal bridge comparison is a widely used metrological method in the dissemination of value of capacitance up to 1000 pF and $10^4$ rad/s. In this range, capacitance can be measured with uncertainties as small as few parts in $10^{7}$; however, such measuments must take into account the corrections due to the impedance of cables, connectors and ports, which can tipically amount up to $10^{-8}$ $\mu$F/F $-$ and maybe larger. In this work, we report on how correction factors in 2-terminal pair coaxial bridge capacitance measurements are presently measured and calculated at Inmetro.</description>

      <title>Characterization of the BOLDPET optical prototype, an innovative Cherenkov detector for 511 keV $\gamma$ radiation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.17003</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.17003v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In the present work we describe the design, construction, and testing of the optical prototype developed for the BOLDPET project, with the objective of creating a PET detection module with high spatial and time resolution. The BOLDPET technology uses an innovative detection liquid, trimethylbismuth, for detecting 511 keV $\gamma$-quanta resulting from positron annihilation. The optical signal is exclusively produced through the Cherenkov mechanism, and the produced photons are detected using Planacon microchannel-plate photomultiplier. We achieve an excellent time resolution of 150 ps (FWHM) within a sizable detection volume measuring 55 mm x 55 mm x 25 mm. Through detailed Geant4 simulations, we examine the limiting factors affecting time resolution and explore potential avenues for improvement. Furthermore, we demonstrate the feasibility of coarse 2D localization of interactions using the optical signal alone, achieving a precision of about 5-8 mm (FWHM) within the homogeneous detection volume.</description>

      <title>Neutron and $\boldsymbol{\gamma}$-ray Discrimination by a Pressurized Helium-4 Based Scintillation Detector</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.09704</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.09704v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Pressurized helium-4 based fast neutron scintillation detector offers an useful alternative to organic liquid-based scintillator due to its relatively low response to the $\gamma$-rays compared to the latter type of scintillator. In the present work, we have investigated the capabilities of a pressurized $^4$He (PHe) detector for the detection of fast neutrons in a mixed radiation field where both the neutrons and the $\gamma$-rays are present. Discrimination between neutrons and $\gamma$-rays is achieved by using fast-slow charge integration method. We have also conducted systematic studies of the attenuation of fast neutrons and $\gamma$-rays by high-density polyethylene (HDPE). These studies are further corroborated by simulation analyses conducted using GEANT4, which show qualitative agreement with the experimental results. Additionally, the simulation provides detailed insights into the interactions of the radiation quanta with the PHe detector. Estimates of the scintillation signal yield are made based on our GEANT4 simulation results by considering the scintillation mechanism in the PHe gas.</description>

      <title>Embedded FPGA Developments in 130nm and 28nm CMOS for Machine Learning in Particle Detector Readout</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.17701</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.17701v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Embedded field programmable gate array (eFPGA) technology allows the implementation of reconfigurable logic within the design of an application-specific integrated circuit (ASIC). This approach offers the low power and efficiency of an ASIC along with the ease of FPGA configuration, particularly beneficial for the use case of machine learning in the data pipeline of next-generation collider experiments. An open-source framework called "FABulous" was used to design eFPGAs using 130 nm and 28 nm CMOS technology nodes, which were subsequently fabricated and verified through testing. The capability of an eFPGA to act as a front-end readout chip was assessed using simulation of high energy particles passing through a silicon pixel sensor. A machine learning-based classifier, designed for reduction of sensor data at the source, was synthesized and configured onto the eFPGA. A successful proof-of-concept was demonstrated through reproduction of the expected algorithm result on the eFPGA with perfect accuracy. Further development of the eFPGA technology and its application to collider detector readout is discussed.</description>

      <title>Low temperature proton irradiation with DEPFETs for Athena's Wide Field Imager</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.19942</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.19942v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The Wide Field Imager (WFI), one of two instruments on ESA's next large X-ray mission Athena, is designed for imaging spectroscopy of X-rays in the range of 0.2 to 15 keV with a large field of view and high count rate capability. The focal plane consists of back-illuminated DEPFET (Depleted p-channel field effect transistor) sensors that have a high radiation tolerance and provide a near Fano-limited energy resolution. To achieve this, a very low noise readout is required, about 3 electrons ENC at beginning of life is foreseen. This makes the device very susceptible to any radiation induced worsening of the readout noise. The main mechanism of degradation will be the increase of dark current due to displacement damage caused primarily by high energy protons. To study the expected performance degradation, a prototype detector module with fully representative pixel layout and fabrication technology was irradiated with 62.4 MeV protons at the accelerator facility MedAustron in Wiener Neustadt. A total dose equivalent to 3.3 $\textstyle{10^{9}}$ 10-MeV protons/$\mathrm{cm^{2}}$ was applied in two steps. During, in-between and after the irradiations the detector remained at the operating temperature of 213 K and was fully biased and operated. Data was recorded to analyze the signal of all incident particles. We report on the increase of dark current after the irradiation and present the current related damage rate at 213 K. The effect of low temperature annealing at 213 K , 236 K, 253 K, 273 K, and 289 K is presented.</description>

      <title>Bounds to strong gravity from electron-positron annihilations near threshold</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.01430</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.01430v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We discuss bounds to strong gravity arising from annihilation of electron and positrons and the corresponding enhancement of the cross section for the production of massive particles. Two complementary examples are discussed, the case of the $e^+e^- \to W^+ W^-$ processes, with maximum mass and short lifetime for the particle pairs in the final state, and the case of electron positron annihilation into heavier charged lepton pairs, $e^+ e^- \to \mu^+ \mu^-$ and $e^+ e^- \to \tau^+ \tau^-$. These bounds may be improved by the next generation of electron-positron colliders, and are complementary to bounds arising from direct graviton searches.</description>
