      <title>Distinguishing noisy crystal symmetries in coarse-grained computer simulations: New procedures for noise reduction and lattice reconstruction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.15539</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.15539v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We suggest new modification (we call it a noise reduction procedure) for Steinhardt parameters which are often used for detecting crystalline structures in computer simulation of solids and soft matter systems. We have also developed a new methodology how to reconstruct "ideal" lattice structure in the whole simulation box that would be most close to a real noisy crystalline symmetry, when it is defined locally and then averaged over the whole box. For this second procedure, which we call lattice reconstruction procedure, we have developed an algorithm for finding the lattice vectors from the values of Steinhardt parameters obtained after the noise reduction procedure. We apply noise to the classical crystalline structures (sc, bcc, fcc, hcp), and use both procedures to detect the crystalline structures in these classical but noisy systems. We demonstrate advantages of our procedures in comparison with existing methods and discuss their applicability limits.</description>

      <title>Reconstructing the Magnetic Field in an Arbitrary Domain via Data-driven Bayesian Methods and Numerical Simulations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.15745</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.15745v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Inverse problems are prevalent in numerous scientific and engineering disciplines, where the objective is to determine unknown parameters within a physical system using indirect measurements or observations. The inherent challenge lies in deducing the most probable parameter values that align with the collected data. This study introduces an algorithm for reconstructing parameters by addressing an inverse problem formulated through differential equations underpinned by uncertain boundary conditions or variant parameters. We adopt a Bayesian approach for parameter inference, delineating the establishment of prior, likelihood, and posterior distributions, and the subsequent resolution of the maximum a posteriori problem via numerical optimization techniques. The proposed algorithm is applied to the task of magnetic field reconstruction within a conical domain, demonstrating precise recovery of the true parameter values.</description>

      <title>Neural Operators Learn the Local Physics of Magnetohydrodynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.16015</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.16015v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Magnetohydrodynamics (MHD) plays a pivotal role in describing the dynamics of plasma and conductive fluids, essential for understanding phenomena such as the structure and evolution of stars and galaxies, and in nuclear fusion for plasma motion through ideal MHD equations. Solving these hyperbolic PDEs requires sophisticated numerical methods, presenting computational challenges due to complex structures and high costs. Recent advances introduce neural operators like the Fourier Neural Operator (FNO) as surrogate models for traditional numerical analyses. This study explores a modified Flux Fourier neural operator model to approximate the numerical flux of ideal MHD, offering a novel approach that outperforms existing neural operator models by enabling continuous inference, generalization outside sampled distributions, and faster computation compared to classical numerical schemes.</description>

      <title>Cell agglomeration strategy for cut cells in eXtended discontinuous Galerkin methods</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.15285</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.15285v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this work, a cell agglomeration strategy for the cut cells arising in the extended discontinuous Galerkin (XDG) method is presented. Cut cells are a fundamental aspect of unfitted mesh approaches where complex geometries or interfaces separating sub-domains are embedded into Cartesian background grids to facilitate the mesh generation process. In such methods, arbitrary small cells occur due to the intersections of background cells with embedded geometries and lead to discretization difficulties due to their diminutive sizes. Furthermore, temporal evolutions of these geometries may lead to topological changes across different time steps. Both of these issues, i.e., small-cut cells and topological changes, can be addressed with a cell agglomeration technique. In this work, a comprehensive strategy for the typical issues associated with cell agglomeration in three-dimensional and multiprocessor simulations is provided. The proposed strategy is implemented into the open-source software package BoSSS and tested with 2- and 3-dimensional simulations of immersed boundary flows.</description>

      <title>High-accurate and efficient numerical algorithms for the self-consistent field theory of liquid-crystalline polymers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.15363</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.15363v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we develop and investigate numerical methods for the self-consistent field theory (SCFT) of liquid crystalline polymers. Both the Flory-Huggins interaction potential and the Maier-Saupe orientational interaction are considered, enabling simultaneous exploration of microphase separation and liquid crystalline order in these systems. The main challenge in numerically solving this complex system lies in solving 6-dimensional (3D spatial + 2D orientation + 1D time) partial differential equations and performing nonlinear iterations to optimize the fields. We present ten numerical algorithms for solving high-dimensional PDEs and give an evaluation criterion of choosing the most appropriate PDE solver both from theoretical and numerical performance. Results demonstrate that coupling the fourth-order Runge-Kutta scheme with Fourier pseudo-spectral methods and spherical harmonic transformations is superior compared to other algorithms. We develop two nonlinear iteration schemes, alternating direction iteration method and Anderson mixing method, and design an adaptive technique to enhance the stability of the Anderson mixing method. Moreover, the cascadic multi-level (CML) technique further accelerates the SCFT computation when applied to these iteration methods. Meanwhile, an approach to optimize the computational domain is developed. To demonstrate the power of our approaches, we investigate the self-assembled behaviors of flexible-semiflexible diblock copolymers in 4,5,6-dimensional simulations. Numerical results illustrate the efficiency of our proposed method.</description>

      <title>Polyconvex neural network models of thermoelasticity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.15562</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.15562v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Machine-learning function representations such as neural networks have proven to be excellent constructs for constitutive modeling due to their flexibility to represent highly nonlinear data and their ability to incorporate constitutive constraints, which also allows them to generalize well to unseen data. In this work, we extend a polyconvex hyperelastic neural network framework to thermo-hyperelasticity by specifying the thermodynamic and material theoretic requirements for an expansion of the Helmholtz free energy expressed in terms of deformation invariants and temperature. Different formulations which a priori ensure polyconvexity with respect to deformation and concavity with respect to temperature are proposed and discussed. The physics-augmented neural networks are furthermore calibrated with a recently proposed sparsification algorithm that not only aims to fit the training data but also penalizes the number of active parameters, which prevents overfitting in the low data regime and promotes generalization. The performance of the proposed framework is demonstrated on synthetic data, which illustrate the expected thermomechanical phenomena, and existing temperature-dependent uniaxial tension and tension-torsion experimental datasets.</description>

      <title>Renormalization group of topological scattering networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.15866</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.15866v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Exploring and understanding topological phases in systems with strong distributed disorder requires developing fundamentally new approaches to replace traditional tools such as topological band theory. Here, we present a general real-space renormalization group (RG) approach for scattering models, which is capable of dealing with strong distributed disorder without relying on the renormalization of Hamiltonians or wave functions. Such scheme, based on a block-scattering transformation combined with a replica strategy, is applied for a comprehensive study of strongly disordered unitary scattering networks with localized bulk states, uncovering a connection between topological physics and critical behavior. Our RG scheme leads to topological flow diagrams that unveil how the microscopic competition between reflection and non-reciprocity leads to the large-scale emergence of macroscopic scattering attractors, corresponding to trivial and topological insulators. Our findings are confirmed by a scaling analysis of the localization length (LL) and critical exponents, and experimentally validated. The results not only shed light on the fundamental understanding of topological phase transitions and scaling properties in strongly disordered regimes, but also pave the way for practical applications in modern topological condensed-matter and photonics, where disorder may be seen as a useful design degree of freedom, and no longer as a hindrance.</description>

      <title>X marks the spot: accurate energies from intersecting extrapolations of continuum quantum Monte Carlo data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.00649</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.00649v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We explore the application of an extrapolative method that yields very accurate total and relative energies from variational and diffusion quantum Monte Carlo (VMC and DMC) results. For a trial wave function consisting of a small configuration interaction (CI) wave function obtained from full CI quantum Monte Carlo and reoptimized in the presence of a Jastrow factor and an optional backflow transformation, we find that the VMC and DMC energies are smooth functions of the sum of the squared coefficients of the initial CI wave function, and that quadratic extrapolations of the non-backflow VMC and backflow DMC energies intersect within uncertainty of the exact total energy. With adequate statistical treatment of quasi-random fluctuations, the extrapolate and intersect with polynomials of order two (XSPOT) method is shown to yield results in agreement with benchmark-quality total and relative energies for the C2, N2, CO2, and H2O molecules, as well as for the C2 molecule in its first electronic singlet excited state, using only small CI expansion sizes.</description>

      <title>Proposal on the Calculation of the Ionisation-Cluster Size Distribution</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.03961</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.03961v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A stochastic model for the calculation of the ionisation-cluster size distribution in nanodosimetry is proposed. It is based on a canonical ensemble and derives from the well-known nuclear droplet model. It is able to describe the ionisation-cluster size distributions caused by electrons. It can easily be extented to light ions. In principle, the model has no free parameters. The model especially can be seen as a refinement to B. Grosswendts model. It is shown that it leads to a cluster-size distribution function F2 being more similar to of the yield of double-strand breaks in the DNA than the one calculated by B. Grosswendt. However, the results are still subject to major uncertainties. The focus of this work is on presenting the model and demonstrating its feasibility.</description>

      <title>Quinpi: Integrating stiff hyperbolic systems with implicit high order finite volume schemes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.14685</link>
      <description>arXiv:2307.14685v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Many interesting physical problems described by systems of hyperbolic conservation laws are stiff, and thus impose a very small time-step because of the restrictive CFL stability condition. In this case, one can exploit the superior stability properties of implicit time integration which allows to choose the time-step only from accuracy requirements, and thus avoid the use of small time-steps. We discuss an efficient framework to devise high order implicit schemes for stiff hyperbolic systems without tailoring it to a specific problem. The nonlinearity of high order schemes, due to space- and time-limiting procedures which control nonphysical oscillations, makes the implicit time integration difficult, e.g.~because the discrete system is nonlinear also on linear problems. This nonlinearity of the scheme is circumvented as proposed in (Puppo et al., Comm.~Appl.~Math.~\&amp; Comput., 2023) for scalar conservation laws, where a first order implicit predictor is computed to freeze the nonlinear coefficients of the essentially non-oscillatory space reconstruction, and also to assist limiting in time. In addition, we propose a novel conservative flux-centered a-posteriori time-limiting procedure using numerical entropy indicators to detect troubled cells. The numerical tests involve classical and artificially devised stiff problems using the Euler's system of gas-dynamics.</description>
