      <title>Coupled two-phase flow and surfactant/PFAS transport in porous media with angular pores: From pore-scale physics to Darcy-scale modeling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.11721</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.11721v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Two-phase surfactant-laden flow and transport in porous media are central to many natural and engineering applications. Surfactants alter two-phase flow by modifying interfacial tension and wettability, while two-phase flow controls surfactant transport pathways and interfacial adsorption. These coupled processes are commonly modeled using Darcy-type two-phase flow equations combined with advection--dispersion--adsorption transport equations, with capillary pressure--saturation relationships scaled by the Leverett $J$-function. However, the Leverett $J$-function idealizes porous media as bundles of cylindrical tubes and decouples interfacial tension and wettability, limiting its ability to represent angular pore geometries and interfacial tension--wettability coupling effects. We present a modeling framework that explicitly incorporates pore angularity and interfacial tension--wettability coupling into Darcy-scale surfactant-laden flow and transport models. Two-phase flow properties are derived for angular pores, upscaled across pore size distributions, and formulated as explicit and closed-form expressions. These upscaled relationships are integrated into a coupled flow--transport model to simulate transient two-phase flow and surfactant transport. Results reveal a nonlinear and nonmonotonic dependence of two-phase flow properties on pore angularity, pore size distribution, and interfacial tension. Example simulations of water flow and PFAS migration in unsaturated soils indicate that surfactant-induced flow effects on PFAS leaching are generally minor under typical conditions, whereas pore angularity strongly controls water flow, interfacial area, and PFAS retention. Overall, the proposed framework provides a more physically grounded approach for modeling two-phase surfactant-laden flow and transport in porous media.</description>

      <title>A Convolutional Neural Network Based Framework for Linear Fluid Dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.11946</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.11946v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Fluid dynamics, for its strength in describing physical phenomena across vastly different scales from the cheerios effect on the breakfast table to the evolution of cosmic and quantum systems, has been called the 'queen mother' of science (Bush, 2015). However, a central challenge remains: ensuring the generalisability, interpretability and reliability of the machine learned models when applied to physical systems. To address this, we present a transparent approach that provides insights into how data-driven fluid dynamics and machine learning (ML) work. This is achieved by training a convolutional neural network (CNN) on data from a simple laminar fluid flow to behave as an operator that exactly matches the finite-difference numerics. Importantly, the model demonstrates strong generalisation capability by reproducing the dynamics for a wide range of distinct and unseen flow conditions within the same flow category. The CNN learns the forward Euler three-point stencil weights, capturing physical principles such as consistency and symmetry despite having only three tunable weights. Going beyond pure numerical training (numCNN), the approach is shown to work when trained on analytical (anCNN) and even molecular dynamics (mdCNN) data. In some cases, the physics is not captured, and thanks to the simple and interpretable form, these CNNs provide insight into the limits, pitfalls and best practice of data-driven fluid models. Because the approach is based on finite-difference operators and demonstrated with diffusive flow, it naturally extends to many structured-grid computational fluid dynamics (CFD) problems, including turbulent, multiphase, and multiscale flows.</description>

      <title>Minimal seed in supersonic boundary layer at $M=3$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.11964</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.11964v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study investigates the minimal seed for laminar-to-turbulent transition in a supersonic boundary layer at $M=3.0$ and $Re=300$ using adjoint-based nonlinear non-modal analysis. While linear theory identifies oblique waves as the optimal disturbances for transient growth, we demonstrate that nonlinear effects fundamentally alter the optimal perturbation structure as the initial amplitude exceeds a critical threshold. Our analysis reveals that the nonlinear optimal perturbation exhibits a distinctive spatial distribution characterized by flattened structures in the outer layer and streamwise vortices near the wall, leading to a more rapid transition compared to the linear counterpart. A key finding is that this nonlinear amplification mechanism remains robust even under wall-cooled conditions ($T_w = 0.6 T_{ad}$), where the disappearance of the generalized inflection point (GIP) suppresses linear instabilities of Mack's first mode. This rapid growth is driven by the nonlinear interaction between two-dimensional planar waves near the wall and staggered vortex patterns in the outer layer, facilitating streak formation through vortex self-induction. Although the late-stage evolution eventually converges to the classical oblique breakdown scenario as characterized by the formation of $\Lambda$-vortices, the identified nonlinear path significantly reduces the disturbance energy required for transition.</description>

      <title>Wave Phenomena and Wave Equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.12176</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.12176v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: For any kind of wave phenomenon one can find ways to derive the respective dispersion relation from experimental observations and measurements. This dispersion relation determines the structure of the wave equation and thus characterizes the dynamics of the respective wave. Different wave phenomena are thus governed by different differential equations. Here we want to emphasize the experimental approach to matter waves, but before doing so we will discuss and test the procedure for other types of waves, in particular water waves.</description>

      <title>Explicit and Implicit Finite Difference Solvers Implemented in JAX for Shock Wave Physics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.12204</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.12204v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Shock dynamics and nonlinear wave propagation are fundamental to computational fluid dynamics (CFD) and high-speed flow modeling. In this study, we developed explicit and implicit finite-difference solvers for the one-dimensional Burgers viscous equation to model shock formation, propagation, and dissipation. The governing equation, which incorporates convective and diffusive effects, serves as a simplified analogue of the Navier-Stokes equations. Using the Finite-JAX framework, each solver is implemented with upwind and central finite-difference schemes for the convective and diffusive terms, respectively. Time integration is performed using explicit forward Euler and implicit backward-time central space (BTCS) schemes under periodic and Dirichlet boundary conditions. Stability is ensured by the Courant-Friedrichs-Lewy (CFL) criteria for the convective and diffusive components. Numerical experiments quantify the accuracy, convergence, and real-time performance of JAX across CPUs, GPUs, and TPUs, demonstrating that JAX maintains fidelity while achieving portability. The results show that the explicit scheme captures impact accurately under strict time-step constraints, while the implicit formulation provides greater stability and accuracy at a higher computational cost. Taken together, these results establish a reproducible dataset for benchmarking CFD solvers and training machine learning models for nonlinear transport and impact-driven phenomena. Our new implementation of FiniteJAX enhances the portability, scalability, and performance of solvers based on the JAX framework developed by Google DeepMind.</description>

      <title>Rotational flow underlying coupled surface and internal waves. I: Eulerian perspective</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.12229</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.12229v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper we examine the flow generated by coupled surface and internal small-amplitude water waves in a two-fluid layer model, where we take the upper layer to be rotational (constant vorticity) and the lower layer to be irrotational. The presence of vorticity greatly complicates the underlying analysis, yet it generates a rich array of otherwise unobservable phenomena such as the presence of critical layers, and stagnation points, in the fluid interior. We employ a phase-plane analysis to elucidate the qualitative behaviour of streamlines for a range of different coupled-wave, and vorticity, regimes. Although the water waves considered are linear in the fluid dynamics sense, the dynamical systems which govern their motion are nonlinear.</description>

      <title>Unified multifractal description of longitudinal and transverse intermittency in fully developed turbulence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.12528</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.12528v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Small-scale intermittency is a defining feature of fully developed fluid turbulence, marked by rare and extreme fluctuations of velocity increments and gradients that defy mean-field descriptions. Existing multifractal descriptions of intermittency focus primarily on longitudinal increments and gradients, despite mounting evidence that transverse components exhibit distinct and stronger intermittency. Here, we develop a unified multifractal framework that jointly prescribes longitudinal and transverse velocity increments, and extends to gradients. We derive explicit relations linking inertial-range scaling exponents of structure functions to moments of velocity gradients in dissipation range. Our results reveal that longitudinal gradient scaling is solely prescribed by longitudinal structure functions, as traditionally expected; however, transverse gradient scaling is prescribed by mixed longitudinal-transverse structure functions. Validation with high-resolution direct numerical simulations of isotropic turbulence, at Taylor-scale Reynolds number up to $1300$ demonstrates excellent agreement, paving way for a more complete and predictive description of intermittency faithful to the underlying turbulence dynamics.</description>

      <title>Inertia-Dilatancy Interplay Governs Shear-Thickening Drop Impact</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.12642</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.12642v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Combining high-speed photography with direct force measurements, we investigate the impact dynamics of drops of cornstarch-water mixtures -- a premier example of shear-thickening fluids -- across a wide range of impact conditions. Our study identifies three distinct impact regimes. In addition to the liquid-like and solid-like behaviors generally expected for the impact-induced response of shear-thickening fluids, we uncover a counterintuitive regime in which high-concentration cornstarch-water mixtures display a liquid-like response at the onset of impact when shear rates are high and only transition to a solid-like behavior at later times as shear rates reduce. By integrating the classic drop-impact theory with the Reynolds-Darcy mechanism for dilatancy, we develop a unified model that quantitatively describes the impact dynamics of shear-thickening drops across all regimes. Our work reveals the unexpected response of shear-thickening fluids to ultra-fast deformation and advances fundamental understanding of drop impact for complex fluids.</description>

      <title>Flapping strategies for flying formations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.12920</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.12920v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Long arrays of identical, self-propelling flapping flyers are inherently unstable and thus unlikely to exist without active control mechanisms. One approach to enable long in-line formations is to enforce a constant separation between the group members. The objective then becomes to determine the flapping strategies the flyers should adopt to achieve a certain separation. Using an aerodynamic model of vortex wake production and inter-flyer effects, we explore different flapping strategies for followers given the motion of the leader. The choice of tactic is dependent upon the aerodynamic, kinematic, and physical parameters of the system, and reflects an interplay between efficiency and stability. We find that whether a flyer flaps in or out of phase with its upstream neighbour, together with the target separation, strongly affect the flapping amplitude and, therefore, the energetic cost of group flight. In certain regimes, group flight is energetically favourable compared to isolated flight, while in others, flying in formation becomes less efficient. We also identify "goldilocks zones", ranges of separation in which one of the in- or out-of-phase motions can be simultaneously energetically efficient and dynamically stable. Outside these regions, energetically favourable flight is unstable and therefore unlikely to occur.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2601.13237v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The General Lagrangian Mean (GLM) theory uses a version of the averaged equations of fluid dynamics, designed to examine interactions between small-amplitude waves and mean flows. These equations are formulated in coordinates following the fluid's average velocity and are often referred to as `pseudo-Lagrangian'. This paper focuses on the principles for deriving the GLM equations, using an inviscid, incompressible, homogeneous fluid as a demonstration case. Our exposition methodically differs from others and is aimed at the learners of this theory.</description>

      <title>Revealing mesoscale bubble and particle dynamics in ultrasound-driven multiphase fluids by ultrafast synchrotron X-ray radiography and hybrid modelling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.13582</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.13582v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Multiphase fluid flows comprising of mesoscale solid particles, liquid droplets, or gas bubbles are common in both natural and man-made systems, but quantifying the energy transfer is challenging due to complex bubble-particle interactions. In this study, we used ultrafast synchrotron X-ray imaging to study the mesoscale dynamic interactions among ultrasonic cavitation bubbles and hydrophobic particles or clusters. Critical dynamic information and data were extracted from the vast amount of X-ray images and then fed into the hybrid analytical-numerical model for calculating the energy transfer from the oscillating bubble and the imploding bubble to the nearby hydrophobic particles. Using the Ni spherical microparticles as an example, at bubble oscillation approximately 16% (80-320 nJ) of the local energy was transferred to the particle. At bubble implosion, the transferred energy increased approximately 26% (0.135-1.09 uJ). Local energy transfer occurred on timescales of 1 us to 1 ms and length scales of 1 um to 1 mm. Within each ultrasound cycle, kinetic and potential energy underwent complex exchanges, with local energy exhibiting a stepwise decay at the end of each cycle. The transferred energy was mainly consumed for enabling highly efficient particle dispersion. This research provides quantitative insights into optimizing hydrophobic nanomaterial dispersion and has broader implications for interfacial energy transfer processes such as making suspensions, composite materials and exfoliated 2D materials.</description>

      <title>100-Billion-Atom Molecular Dynamics Simulation of Acoustic Cavitation in a Simple Liquid</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.13594</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.13594v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A large-scale molecular dynamics (MD) simulation of acoustic cavitation in a simple liquid was performed using the supercomputer Fugaku. The system, consisting of approximately 100 billion atoms, was subjected to ultrasonic irradiation. Direct observation of multi-bubble dynamics has been challenging in both experimental measurements and conventional numerical fluid mechanics simulations. Moreover, previous MD simulations involving only hundreds of millions of atoms were unable to generate multiple bubbles within a system. Our results reveal that cavitation bubbles nucleate and grow near the ultrasonic horn, forming a large bubble cluster that periodically splits into multiple small clusters and subsequently merges again. This cycle is synchronized with the oscillation period of the horn. Pressure and temperature inside the bubbles exhibit sharp increases during cluster fragmentation, and their oscillation amplitudes vary on a timescale longer than the driving period of the horn, indicating the presence of subharmonic behavior consistent with experimental observations. Despite bubble formation, the effect on the acoustic properties of the sound wave was almost negligible, indicating that cavitation near the horn surface has limited influence on bulk acoustic properties. These findings provide new insights into the molecular-scale mechanisms of cavitation and offer guidance for optimizing ultrasonic systems in chemical and biomedical applications. Future work will focus on quantifying long-period oscillations, analyzing attenuation effects, and extending simulations to complex fluids.</description>

      <title>Manifold Learning with Implicit Physics Embedding for Reduced-Order Flow-Field Modeling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.13673</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.13673v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Nonlinear manifold learning (ML) based reduced-order models (ROMs) can substantially improve the quality of nonlinear flow-field modeling. However, noise and the lack of physical information often distort the dimensionality-reduction process, reducing the robustness and accuracy of flow-field prediction. To address this problem, we propose a novel manifold learning ROM with implicit physics embedding (IPE-ML). Starting from data-driven manifold coordinates, we incorporate physical parameters (e.g., angle of attack, Mach number) into manifold coordinates system by minimizing the prediction error of Gaussian process regression (GPR) model, thereby fine-tuning the manifold structure. These adjusted coordinates are then used to construct a flow-fields prediction model that predict nonlinear flow-field more accurately. The method is validated on two test cases: transonic flow-field modeling of the RAE2822 and supersonic flow-field modeling of the hexagon airfoil. The results indicate that the proposed IPE-ML can significantly improve the overall prediction accuracy of nonlinear flow fields. In transonic case, shock-related errors have been notably reduced, while in supersonic case the method can confine errors to small local regions. This study offers a new perspective on embedding physical information into nonlinear ROMs.</description>

      <title>Flash Freeze--Thaw Phenomenon in Sprayed Evaporating Micrometer Droplets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.13716</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.13716v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Two-fluid spray nozzles are widely used in combustion, chemical processing, pharmaceutical coating, environmental control, and spray drying to atomize liquids with pressurized gas. However, the adiabatic cooling and resulting flash freeze--thaw exposure of atomized droplets remain underexplored. Using high-fidelity computational fluid dynamics coupled with droplet-scale nucleation modeling, we show that the atomizing gas temperature at the nozzle exit can fall from $22\,^{\circ}\mathrm{C}$ to below $-130\,^{\circ}\mathrm{C}$, initiating rapid ice nucleation and freezing in micro-scale droplets. For atomizing gas at $5\,\mathrm{bar}$ (gauge) and $22\,^{\circ}\mathrm{C}$, all droplets smaller than $1.5\,\mu\mathrm{m}$ freeze, whereas droplets larger than $3\,\mu\mathrm{m}$ remain liquid. These frozen droplets thaw within $O(10)\,\mu\mathrm{s}$ upon leaving the cold zone, subjecting sensitive actives to intense freeze--thaw thermomechanical stresses near the nozzle even when the bulk drying gas is warm. Parametric studies show that ice formation is eliminated at atomizing gas temperatures above $110\,^{\circ}\mathrm{C}$ for all gas-to-liquid mass ratios (GLRs) between 8 and 25, or at $\mathrm{GLR}&lt;12$ for all atomizing gas temperatures; the chamber drying gas does not influence near-nozzle freezing. Additionally, we demonstrate that swirling flow intensifies flash freeze--thaw by deepening gas cooling, whereas non-swirling flow extends cold-zone residence time, yet both designs produce similar iced-droplet fractions. We construct an operating map delineating conditions that avoid flash freeze--thaw and show that the no-ice boundary provides a conservative criterion for both swirl and non-swirl nozzles.

      <title>Rigid Body Dynamics in Ambient Fluids</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.13971</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.13971v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a novel framework for rigid body dynamics in ambient media, such as air or water, enabling accurate motion prediction of objects without requiring computational fluid dynamics simulations. Our method computes the added mass of the fluid and replaces heuristic models for shape-dependent lift and drag with a generalized estimate of flow separation and dynamic pressure. Our method is the first within the rigid body dynamics context to reproduce the full range of falling plate behaviors: fluttering, tumbling, chaotic and steady modes, as well as phenomena such as the Magnus effect and the flight dynamics of an American football (tight spiral pass paradox). The resulting algorithm is simple to implement, robust, does not rely on specialized integrators and incorporates seamlessly into existing physics engines for real-time simulation.</description>

      <title>Experimental study on gravity currents flowing on heated walls</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.13984</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.13984v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present an experimental study on steady gravity currents advancing along a heated wall. The current is generated by a mixture of air and carbon dioxide continuously supplied at the channel inlet. To have a complete point-wise characterization of the flow, simultaneous high-frequency measurements of two velocity components, CO_2 concentration, and temperature are performed. An experimental protocol is presented to reconstruct the local fluid density and to estimate turbulent vertical and horizontal fluxes of CO_2, temperature, and buoyancy. The reliability of both the flow measurements and of the estimate of convective heat flux exchanged at the wall is assessed through integral balances of \textnormal{CO}$_2$ mass, enthalpy, and buoyancy, performed at different distances from the source. Three wall-heating conditions are considered: an adiabatic case, a moderately heated case, and a strongly heated case. In the heated experiments, a convectively unstable boundary layer forms near the wall, capped by a stably stratified region. The influence of this condition on the first- and second-order flow statistics profiles is examined. Although wall heating influences the vertical shear, the Brunt-Vaisala frequency, and both shear and buoyancy production of turbulent kinetic energy within the stably-stratified region characterized by an almost constant vertical gradient of streamwise velocity, neither the gradient Richardson number nor the flux Richardson number exhibits a clear trend in this region with the imposed wall heat flux.</description>

      <title>A curvature-weighted spectral precursor to dissipation in decaying three-dimensional turbulence: robustness across initial conditions and viscosity effects</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.14043</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.14043v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the robustness of a curvature-weighted spectral precursor to dissipation in freely decaying three-dimensional incompressible turbulence. Building on our recent work in Physical Review Fluids on the Taylor--Green vortex, we analyze direct numerical simulations using the curl-of-vorticity spectrum $|\nabla\times \boldsymbol{\omega}|^2(k)$, equivalent to a $k^4$-weighted energy spectrum for solenoidal flow. Extending the study across multiple initial conditions -- multi-mode ABC flows, a randomized low-wavenumber ABC field, the Taylor--Green vortex, and the Kida--Pelz flow -- we find a consistent temporal ordering: the characteristic time associated with the advance and saturation of the peak wavenumber of $|\nabla\times \boldsymbol{\omega}|^2(k)$ precedes the dissipation-peak time, which in turn precedes the characteristic time associated with the peak scale of the nonlinear energy-flux spectrum. We further probe viscosity effects in Taylor--Green turbulence: the precursor persists at lower viscosity when adequate resolution is employed, but weakens and can break at higher viscosity, consistent with stronger viscous damping of curvature-dominated small-scale content. Throughout, we use explicit inspection of curvature-weighted spectra to distinguish physical peak evolution from cutoff-proximate artifacts. These results establish robustness across initial conditions and clarify the practical role of viscosity and resolution for deploying curvature-weighted spectral precursors in decaying turbulence.</description>

      <title>Caustics of finitely dense inertial particles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.14179</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.14179v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Estimating collision rates is of immense importance in particle-laden flows. An economical way of doing this is to directly identify incidences of caustics, or extreme clustering, by tracking particle velocity gradients in the neighborhoods of individual particles. The objective of this work is two-fold. (i) We find conditions under which caustics form, in point-vortex flow and in two-dimensional turbulence. While caustics are known to form in regions of strain, we show that the type of strain is key. Particles must remain in compressional strain throughout the process to form caustics, whereas survivor particles: which visit high strain but do not form caustics, briefly go through extensional strain during the early part of the process. This enables survivor particles to attain significantly straighter paths, and to move faster, whereas caustics particles follow paths of high curvature and move slower. As a result, caustics particles stay longer in high-strain regions than survivors. (ii) We ask about the effect of finite particle density, where the particle is denser than the background fluid. We show that finite-density particles need to sample stronger background strain than infinite-density ones to trigger caustics, but our other findings are universal across particle density.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2512.25053v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We formulate the covariant hydrodynamics equations describing the fluid dynamics as the problem of intersection theory on the infinite dimensional symplectic manifold associated with spacetime. This point of view separates the structures related to the equation of state, the geometry of spacetime, and structures related to the (differential) topology of spacetime. We point out a five-dimensional origin of the formalism of Lichnerowicz and Carter. Our formalism also incorporates the chiral anomaly and Onsager quantization. We clarify the relation between the canonical velocity and Landau $4$-velocity, the meaning of Kelvin's theorem. Finally, we discuss some connections to topological strings, Poisson sigma models, and topological field theories in various dimensions.</description>

      <title>Universal wrinkling dynamics of a sheet on viscous liquid</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.11682</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.11682v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the wrinkling dynamics of a thin elastic sheet that is indented or compressed while floating on a viscous liquid. We show that the deformation speed controls the dynamics, leading to a wrinkle wavelength significantly smaller than that selected under quasistatic compression. Once active compression ceases, the wrinkles coarsen until their wavelength relaxes toward the equilibrium value. We develop a theoretical model coupling Stokes flow in the liquid to elastic bending of the sheet, which quantitatively predicts both the initial wavelength selection and its subsequent coarsening. We demonstrate that the same mechanism governs two dimensional and axisymmetric geometries, thereby extending classical static wavelength selection laws to dynamic situations. Although developed from controlled laboratory experiments, the model captures a generic viscous-elastic coupling and applies broadly to thin elastic films interacting with viscous environments, including the formation of surface wrinkles in pahoehoe lava flows.</description>

      <title>Global Recovery from Local Data: Interior Nudging for 2D Navier-Stokes equations in a Physical Domain</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.11831</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.11831v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In many real-world applications of data assimilation (DA), the strategic placement of observers is crucial for effective and efficient forecasting. Motivated by practical constraints in sensor deployment, we show that global recovery of the flow field can be achieved using observations available only in a subregion of the domain, possibly far from the boundary. We focus on the two-dimensional incompressible Navier-Stokes equations posed in a bounded physical domain with Dirichlet boundary conditions. Building on the continuous data assimilation framework of Azouani, Olson, and Titi (2014), we rigorously prove that the assimilated solution converges globally to the true solution under suitable conditions on the nudging parameter, spatial resolution, and the geometry of the observation region, specifically, when the maximum distance from any point in the domain to the observational subregion is bounded by a constant multiple of \( \nu^{1/2} \) (in terms of scaling). Our computational results, conducted via finite element methods over complex geometries, support the theoretical findings and reveal even greater robustness in practice. Specifically, synchronization with the true solution is achieved even when the observational subregion lies farther from the rest of the domain than the theoretical threshold permits. Across all three tested scenarios, the local nudging algorithm performs comparably to full-domain assimilation, reaching global accuracy up to machine precision. Interestingly, observational data near the boundary are found to be largely uninformative. This demonstrates that full observability is not necessary: carefully chosen interior observations, even far from the boundary, can suffice.</description>

      <title>LAViG-FLOW: Latent Autoregressive Video Generation for Fluid Flow Simulations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.13190</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.13190v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Modeling and forecasting subsurface multiphase fluid flow fields underpin applications ranging from geological CO2 sequestration (GCS) operations to geothermal production. This is essential for ensuring both operational performance and long-term safety. While high fidelity multiphase simulators are widely used for this purpose, they become prohibitively expensive once many forward runs are required for inversion purposes and quantify uncertainty. To tackle this challenge we propose LAViG-FLOW, a latent autoregressive video generation diffusion framework that explicitly learns the coupled evolution of saturation and pressure fields. Each state variable is compressed by a dedicated 2D autoencoder, and a Video Diffusion Transformer (VDiT) models their coupled distribution across time. We first train the model on a given time horizon to learn their coupled relationship and then fine-tune it autoregressively so it can extrapolate beyond the observed time window. Evaluated on an open-source CO2 sequestration dataset, LAViG-FLOW generates saturation and pressure fields that stay consistent across time while running orders of magnitude faster than traditional numerical solvers.</description>

      <title>An efficient treatment of heat-flux boundary conditions in GSIS for rarefied gas flows</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.13870</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.13870v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Heat-flux boundary conditions are challenging to implement efficiently in rarefied gas flow simulations because the wall-reflected gas temperature and density must be determined dynamically during the computation. This paper aims to tackle this problem within the general synthetic iterative scheme (GSIS), where the Boltzmann kinetic equation is solved deterministically in an outer loop and macroscopic synthetic equations are solved in an inner loop. To avoid kinetic-macroscopic boundary-flux mismatch and the resulting convergence bottlenecks, for the macroscopic boundary flux at every inner iteration, the incident increment is estimated using a Maxwellian distribution, and then the reflected contribution is obtained by boundary conditions consistent with those in the kinetic solver. In addition to retaining the fast-converging and asymptotic-preserving properties of GSIS, the proposed method significantly reduces the iterations required to determine the wall-reflected gas parameters. Numerical simulations of rarefied gas flows in and around a 3D nozzle, a 2D adiabatic cylinder, and a 2D annular heat-transfer configuration show good agreement with the direct simulation Monte Carlo method, while achieving substantial efficiency gains over conventional iterative schemes.</description>

      <title>Comparison of Generative Learning Methods for Turbulence Surrogates</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.16417v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Numerical simulations of turbulent flows present significant challenges in fluid dynamics due to their complexity and high computational cost. High resolution techniques such as Direct Numerical Simulation (DNS) and Large Eddy Simulation (LES) are generally not computationally affordable, particularly for technologically relevant problems. Recent advances in machine learning, specifically in generative probabilistic models, offer promising alternatives as surrogates for turbulence. This paper investigates the application of three generative models - Variational Autoencoders (VAE), Deep Convolutional Generative Adversarial Networks (DCGAN), and Denoising Diffusion Probabilistic Models (DDPM) - in simulating a von K\'arm\'an vortex street around a fixed cylinder projected into 2D, as well as a real-world experimental dataset of the wake flow of a cylinder array. Training data was obtained by means of LES in the simulated case and Particle Image Velocimetry (PIV) in the experimental case. We evaluate each model's ability to capture the statistical properties and spatial structures of the turbulent flow. Our results demonstrate that DDPM and DCGAN effectively replicate all flow distributions, highlighting their potential as efficient and accurate tools for turbulence surrogacy. We find a strong argument for DCGAN, as although they are more difficult to train (due to problems such as mode collapse), they show the fastest inference and training time, require less data to train compared to VAE and DDPM, and provide the results most closely aligned with the input stream. In contrast, VAE train quickly (and can generate samples quickly) but do not produce adequate results, and DDPM, whilst effective, are significantly slower at both, inference and training time.</description>

      <title>Micromagnetorotation effects in micropolar magnetohydrodynamic blood flow through stenosis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.13678</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.13678v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This study presents a numerical investigation of a 3D micropolar magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) blood flow through stenosis, with and without the effects of micromagnetorotation (MMR). MMR refers to the magnetic torque caused by the misalignment of the magnetization of magnetic particles in the fluid with the magnetic field, which affects the internal rotation (microrotation) of these particles. Blood can be modeled as a micropolar fluid with magnetic particles due to the magnetization of erythrocytes. In this manner, this study analyzes important flow features, i.e., streamlines, vorticity, velocity, microrotation, wall shear stress, and pressure drop under varying stenosis, hematocrit levels, and magnetic fields, using two newly developed transient OpenFOAM solvers epotMicropolarFoam and epotMMRFoam. Results indicate that micropolar effects become more pronounced at severe stenosis due to the significant reduction in artery size, resulting also in higher wall shear stress and pressure drop. Furthermore, when MMR is disregarded, the magnetic field does not significantly alter blood flow, regardless of its intensity, due to the minimal impact of the Lorentz force on blood. Conversely, MMR substantially affects blood flow, particularly at higher hematocrit levels and severe stenoses, leading to reductions of up to 30% in velocity and vorticity and up to 99.9% in microrotation and higher wall shear stress and pressure drop. Simultaneously, any vortices or disturbances are dampened. These findings underscore the critical role of MMR (which was ignored so far) in altering flow behavior in stenosed arteries, suggesting that it should be considered in future MHD micropolar blood flow studies.</description>

      <title>On the development of OpenFOAM solvers for simulating MHD micropolar fluid flows with or without the effect of micromagnetorotation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.14543v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Any micropolar fluid containing magnetic particles, such as blood or ferrofluids, subjected to an external magnetic field experiences a magnetic torque due to the misalignment between particle magnetization and the magnetic field. This effect, known as micromagnetorotation (MMR), remains underexplored in blood flows where erythrocyte magnetization is often neglected. To investigate this, two transient OpenFOAM solvers were developed: epotMicropolarFoam, for incompressible, laminar magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) micropolar flows, and epotMMRFoam, which extends it by incorporating MMR. Both solvers use the PISO algorithm for pressure-velocity coupling and adopt the low magnetic Reynolds number approximation. Micropolar effects are modeled by including the microrotation-vorticity difference in the momentum equation and solving the internal angular momentum equation. In epotMMRFoam, the MMR term is added to this equation, and a constitutive equation for magnetization is also solved. Validation against analytical MHD micropolar Poiseuille flow showed excellent accuracy (error less than 2 percent). Including MMR led to notable reductions in velocity (up to 40 percent) and microrotation (up to 99.9 percent), especially under strong magnetic fields and high hematocrit. Without MMR, magnetic effects were minimal due to the low electrical conductivity of blood. Simulations of 3D MHD artery and 2D MHD aneurysm flows confirmed these findings. In aneurysm geometries, MMR suppressed vortex cores, indicating strong stabilizing and shear-dampening effects. These solvers show high potential for biomedical applications such as magnetic hyperthermia and targeted drug delivery.</description>

      <title>Coalescence of viscoelastic sessile drops: the small and large contact angle limits</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.02226v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The coalescence and breakup of drops are classic examples of flows that feature singularities. The behavior of viscoelastic fluids near these singularities is particularly intriguing - not only because of their added complexity, but also due to the unexpected responses they often exhibit. In particular, experiments have shown that the coalescence of viscoelastic sessile drops can differ significantly from their Newtonian counterparts, sometimes resulting in a sharply defined interface. However, the mechanisms driving these differences in dynamics, as well as the potential influence of the contact angle are not fully known. Here, we study two different flow regimes effectively induced by varying the contact angle and demonstrate how that leads to markedly different coalescence behaviors. We show that the coalescence dynamics is effectively unaltered by viscoelasticity at small contact angles. The Deborah number, which is the ratio of the relaxation time of the polymer to the timescale of the background flow, scales as $\theta^3$ for $\theta \ll 1$, thus rationalizing the near-Newtonian response. On the other hand, it has been shown previously that viscoelasticity dramatically alters the shape of the interface during coalescence at large contact angles. We study this large contact angle limit using experiments and 2D numerical simulations of the equation of motion. We show that the departure of the coalescence dynamics from the Newtonian case is a function of the Deborah number and the elastocapillary number, which is the ratio between the shear modulus of the polymer solution and the characteristic stress in the fluid.</description>

      <title>On the concentration distribution in turbulent thermals</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.21707v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Turbulent thermals emerge in a wide variety of geophysical and industrial flows, such as atmospheric cumulus convection and pollutant dispersal in oceans and lakes. When a buoyant fluid mass rises, or sinks, heat and mass transfers occur by the engulfment of the fresh surrounding fluid inside the thermal - a process that spans over multiple scales from macroscopic entrainment of ambient fluid to microscopic diffusive processes. Turbulent thermals are typically investigated through their integral properties (radius, depth, entrainment rate). However, mixing processes depend on the internal distribution of concentration or temperature inside a thermal, which remains poorly constrained. Here, we use laboratory fluid dynamics experiments and direct numerical simulations to investigate the mixing of a passive scalar in turbulent thermals with large Reynolds numbers. We track the evolution of the concentration field, computing its moments and the probability density function. The concentration distribution exhibits self-similarity over time, except at high concentrations, possibly because of the presence of undiluted cores. These distributions are well approximated by an exponential probability density function. Although diffusion has a strong effect on the spatial structure of the concentration field, we observe no significant effect of diffusivity on the concentration distributions in the investigated range of Peclet numbers.</description>

      <title>Compression, simulation, and synthesis of turbulent flows with tensor trains</title>

Abstract: Numerical simulations of turbulent fluids are paramount to real-life applications, from predicting and modeling flows to diagnostic purposes in engineering. However, they are also computationally challenging due to their intrinsically non-linear dynamics, which require a very high spatial resolution to accurately describe them. A promising idea is to represent flows on a discrete mesh using tensor trains (TTs), featuring a convenient scaling of the number of parameters with the mesh size. However, it is unclear how the compression power of TTs is affected by the complexity of the flows, as measured by the Reynolds number. In fact, no comprehensive analysis of how the TT representation affects the turbulent properties has yet been carried out. We fill this gap by analyzing TTs as an Ansatz to compress, simulate, and generate 3D snapshots with turbulent-like features. Specifically, we first investigate the effect of TT compression on key turbulence signatures, such as the energy spectrum, the PDF of velocity increments, and flatness. Second, we extend the 2D TT-solver introduced in [1] to a 3D cubic domain with periodic boundary conditions. We use it to simulate the incompressible Navier-Stokes dynamics at $Re_{\lambda}=315$ for a total of 9-10 Kolmogorov turnover times, showcasing the numerical stability of the TT-solver in fully developed turbulent regimes. Third, we develop a TT algorithm to synthesize artificial snapshots that exhibit turbulent-like features, with a logarithmic cost in the mesh size. Our analysis demonstrates the ability of the TT representation to capture the characteristic features of turbulence. This offers a powerful quantum-inspired toolkit for the computational treatment of turbulent flows.</description>

      <title>Effects of the sheared flow velocity profile on impedance eduction in a 2D duct</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10129</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.10129v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Impedance eduction methods are the current standard approach to measure the impedance of acoustic liner under sheared grazing flow. The dedicated facilities for these methods consists on a waveguide with rectangular cross-section, which implies a sheared grazing flow. A current debate in the literature is the effect of this sheared flow in the impedance eduction methods. We assess the impact of the flow profile shape on acoustic propagation in a two-dimensional duct within the typical operating range of impedance eduction facilities. Firstly, a numerical experiment is proposed in which the Pridmore--Brown equation is assumed to represent the true physical behaviour, and is used with both simplified flow profiles commonly used in the literature and a realistic representation of a turbulent boundary layer using a van Driest universal law of the wall model. The data from these numerical experiments are then used with a traditional impedance eduction process, and the resulting variation in obtained impedances are investigated. Secondly, we apply a less-traditional impedance eduction method that incorporates the sheared velocity profile to data obtained from real-world experiments. The results suggest that the Ingard--Myers boundary condition remains a good approximation to a realistic boundary layer profile, such as the universal law of the wall, at least in the two-dimensional case. However, it is also shown that the simplified flow profiles often used in the literature can lead to significant deviations from the results obtained using a realistic velocity distribution.</description>

      <title>Optically-Trapped Particle Tracking Velocimetry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.03676</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.03676v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we propose a microflow velocimetry based on particle tracking with the aid of optical trapping of tracers, namely, optically-trapped particle tracking velocimetry (ot-PTV). The ot-PTV has two phases: a trap phase, in which individual tracers are trapped by an optical force and held at a measurement position; a release phase, in which the tracer is released and advected by the fluid flow, without interference from the optical force. The released tracer is subsequently trapped again by the optical force. By repeating the set of trap and release phases, we can accumulate the sequential images of the tracer that have the same initial position. Although the data acquisition rate of ot-PTV is lower than that of standard micro-resolution particle image velocimetry ($\mu$PIV) due to the nature of pointwise measurement, an advantage of ot-PTV is that the measurement positions can be chosen by the experimenter. That is, even when tracers are scarce in a test section because of some external effects and/or the small size of the test section -- ill-suited cases for $\mu$PIV since the experimenter has to wait for tracers to diffuse into the test section (i.e., diffusion-limited situation) -- ot-PTV remains efficient. The concept of ot-PTV is validated using a benchmark experiment, i.e., a pressure-driven flow in a straight microchannel with a square cross-section. An application to thermally-induced microflows is also demonstrated, where tracers can be scarce in a test section due to thermophoresis.</description>

      <title>Data-Augmented Resolvent Analysis of Wall-Bounded High-Pressure Transcritical Flow</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.25398v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: High-pressure transcritical fluid flows are central to modern energy and propulsion systems. A key challenge arises in confined configurations, where optimizing performance requires a detailed understanding of the coupled hydrodynamic and thermodynamic nonlinearities governing these flows. In this context, low-order decomposition techniques, particularly resolvent analysis, provide an interpretable linear input-output framework to identify and quantify dominant amplification mechanisms of coherent flow structures. This work pursues two main objectives: (i) to establish a resolvent-based framework tailored to high-pressure transcritical fluid flows, and (ii) to characterize the spatio-temporal sensitivity of the resolvent operator using data-driven turbulent base flows. These analyses identify flow responses and forcings that optimally enhance mixing and heat transfer, along with their characteristic scales. Results show that amplification is dominated by streamwise-elongated structures with spanwise periodicity, associated with peak singular values at normalized spanwise wavenumbers of order unity. Unlike ideal-gas or incompressible flows, the dominant forcings originate from thermodynamic fluctuations in the pseudo-boiling region. Linearization about the turbulent mean flow yields intensified responses in the form of coherent counter-rotating vortex pairs. Energetic-scale motions are constrained by the low-Reynolds-number and non-isothermal conditions considered, with a dominant spectral mode reaching streamwise lengths comparable to instantaneous structures. Data-driven analyses further reveal coherent motions propagating at phase speeds absent from classical incompressible wall-bounded turbulence, intensified near the pseudo-boiling region and constrained toward the hot wall.</description>

      <title>Consistent kinetic modeling of compressible flows with variable Prandtl numbers: Double-distribution quasi-equilibrium approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.04197</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.04197v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A consistent kinetic modeling and discretization strategy for compressible flows across all Prandtl numbers and specific heat ratios is developed using the quasi-equilibrium approach within two of the most widely used double-distribution frameworks. The methodology ensures accurate recovery of the Navier-Stokes-Fourier equations, including all macroscopic moments and dissipation rates, through detailed hydrodynamic limit analysis and careful construction of equilibrium and quasi-equilibrium attractors. Discretization is performed using high-order velocity lattices with a static reference frame in a discrete velocity Boltzmann context to isolate key modeling aspects such as the necessary requirements on expansion and quadrature orders. The proposed models demonstrate high accuracy, numerical stability and Galilean invariance across a wide range of Mach numbers and temperature ratios. Separate tests for strict conservation and measurements of all dissipation rates confirm these insights for all Prandtl numbers and specific heat ratios. Simulations of a thermal Couette flow and a sensitive two-dimensional shock-vortex interaction excellently reproduce viscous Navier-Stokes-Fourier-level physics. The proposed models establish an accurate, efficient and scalable framework for kinetic simulations of compressible flows with moderate supersonic speeds and discontinuities at arbitrary Prandtl numbers and specific heat ratios, offering a valuable tool for studying complex problems in fluid dynamics and paving the way for future extensions to the lattice Boltzmann context, by application of correction terms, as well as high-Mach and hypersonic regimes, employing target-designed reference frames.</description>

      <title>Gauss Principle in Incompressible Flow: Unified Variational Perspective on Pressure and Projection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.22925</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.22925v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Following recent work (Gonzalez and Taha 2022; Peters and Ormiston 2025), this manuscript clarifies what the Gauss-Appell principle determines in incompressible, inviscid flow and how it connects to classical projection methods. At a fixed time, freezing the velocity and varying only the material acceleration leads to minimization of a quadratic subject to acceleration-level constraints. First-order conditions yield a Poisson-Neumann problem for a reaction pressure whose gradient removes the non-solenoidal and wall-normal content of the provisional residual, i.e. the Leray-Hodge projection. Thus, Gauss-Appell enforces the instantaneous kinematic constraints and recovers Euler at the instant. In steady flows, this principle -- on its own -- cannot select circulation or stagnation points because these are properties of the velocity state, not the instantaneous acceleration correction. The principle only determines the reaction pressure for an already-specified velocity field. The impressed/reaction pressure bookkeeping can be supplemented with orthogonality conventions that separate prescribed conservative forcing (if any) from the reaction enforcing the constraints. This variational viewpoint also yields a simple computational diagnostic: the minimized Appellian equals a L-2 norm of the reaction-pressure gradient which vanishes for constraint-compatible updates and grows with the magnitude of divergence and wall-flux mismatch. The goal of this note is simply to lend more clarity to the application of the Gauss principle, and to connect it concretely to well known concepts including potential flow theory, recent variational approaches and projection algorithms.</description>

      <title>Drift towards isotropization during the 3D hydrodynamic turbulence onset</title>

      <description>arXiv:2512.04665v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The incompressible three-dimensional Euler equations develop very thin pancake-like regions of exponentially increasing vorticity. The characteristic thickness of such regions decreases exponentially with time, while the other two dimensions do not change considerably, making the flow near each pancake strongly anisotropic. The pancakes emerge in increasing number with time, which may enhance the anisotropy of the flow, especially if they orient similarly in space. In the present paper, we study numerically the anisotropy by analyzing the evolution of the so-called isotropy markers [Phys. Rev. Fluids 10, L022602 (2025)]. We show that these functions drift slowly towards unity, indicating the process of slow isotropization, which takes place without the viscous scales getting exited and despite the similar orientation of the emerging pancakes.</description>

      <title>Nonlinear phase synchronization and the role of spacing in shell models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.14142</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.14142v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A shell model can be considered as a chain of triads, where each triad can be interpreted as a nonlinear oscillator that can be mapped to a spinning top. Investigating the relation between phase dynamics and intermittency in a such a chain of nonlinear oscillators, it is found that synchronization is linked to increased energy transfer. In particular, the results provide evidence that the observed systematic increase of intermittency, as the shell spacing is decreased, is associated with strong phase alignment among consecutive triadic phases, facilitating the energy cascade. It is shown that while the overall level of synchronization can be quantified using a Kuramoto order parameter for the global phase coherence in the inertial range, a local, weighted Kuramoto parameter can be used for the detection of burst-like events propagating across shells in the inertial range. This novel analysis reveals how partially phase-locked states are associated with the passage of extreme events of energy flux. Applying this method to helical shell models, reveals that for a particular class of helical interactions, a reduction in phase coherence correlates with suppression of intermittency. When inverse cascade scenarios are considered using two different shell models including a non local helical shell model, and a local standard shell model with a modified conservation law, it was shown that a particular phase organization is needed in order to sustain the inverse energy cascade. It was also observed that the PDFs of the triadic phases were peaked in accordance with the basic considerations of the form of the flux, which suggests that a triadic phase of \pi/2 and -\pi/2 maximizes the forward and the inverse energy cascades respectively.</description>

Abstract: We review inadequacy of existing nematodynamic theories and suggest a novel way of establishing relations between nematic orientation and flow based on the \emph{local} symmetry between simultaneous rotation of nematic alignment and flow, which establishes energy exchange between the the two without reducing the problem to near-equilibrium conditions and invoking Onsager's relations. This approach, applied in the framework of the vector-based theory with a variable modulus, involves antisymmetric interactions between nematic alignment and flow and avoids spurious instabilities in the absence of an active inputs.</description>

      <title>Multiphase transport and compositional mixing mechanisms in twin-wire laser directed energy deposition: toward process stability and graded material fabrication</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.13142</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.13142v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Twin-wire laser directed energy deposition (TW-LDED) provides a promising route for alloying and fabrication of compositionally graded structures. However, inherent multiparameter coupling in twin-wire systems critically exacerbates both process instabilities and compositional inhomogeneity. This unresolved issue escalates into a fundamental technological bottleneck, as the underlying physical mechanisms remain poorly understood. This study developed a high-fidelity multi-physics and multiphase simulation framework coupled with experimental validation to reveal thermal-fluid behavior and heat-mass transfer mechanisms in TW-LDED using Inconel 718 and SS316L fine wires. Three distinct transition modes were identified: twin-wire melt droplet, twin-wire liquid bridge, and droplet-bridge mixed transitions, with the twin-wire liquid bridge regime delivering optimal stability and uniform mixing. Parametric analysis demonstrates that increasing wire feeding speed or decreasing wire initial height promotes stable liquid bridge formation, while small laser spots at low feeding speeds induce excessive volumetric energy density and bridge instability. Simulation and single-track experiments confirm that liquid bridge transitions reduce dimensional fluctuations by 85% while enhancing compositional homogeneity. Conversely, the melt droplet-bridge transition mode creates periodic flow switching and compositional discontinuities along the scan direction. Finally, a 60 mm functionally graded ring was successfully fabricated using optimized parameters, achieving uniform elemental distribution in the transition zone without significant segregation, validating the feasibility of TW-LDED for functionally graded components.</description>
