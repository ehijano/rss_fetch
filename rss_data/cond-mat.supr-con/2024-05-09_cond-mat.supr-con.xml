      <title>Signature of T$_\textrm{c}$ above 111 K in Li-doped (Bi,Pb)-2223 superconductors: synergistic nature of hole concentration, coherence length and Josephson interlayer coupling</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.04689v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Understanding the bottleneck to drive higher critical transition temperature $T_\textrm{c}$ plays a pivotal role in the underlying study of superconductors. We systematically investigate the effect of Li$^+$ substitution for Cu$^{2+}$ cations on the $T_\textrm{c}$, hole concentration, coherence length and interlayer coupling, and microstructure in Li-doped Bi$_{1.6}$Pb$_{0.4}$Sr$_2$Ca$_2$Cu$_3$O$_{10 + \delta}$ or (Bi,Pb)-2223 compound. Remarkably, we demonstrate by utilizing a long-time sintering accompanied by a multiple recurrent intermediate stages of calcining and pressing within our renovated solid-state reaction method, the optimal Li-doped (Bi,Pb)-2223 samples achieve the well-enhanced $T_\textrm{c}$ of 111--113.8 K compared with the standard value of 110 K. We evince the superconducting mechanism that the substitution of Li$^{+}$ for Cu$^{2+}$ ions on the CuO$_2$ layers causes augmenting the hole concentrations and promotes the correlation between the overdoped outer and the underdoped inner CuO$_2$ planes, and thus effects improve $T_\textrm{c}$. Following a universal quadratic relation between $T_\textrm{c}$ and hole concentration, a new higher optimal hole concentration is provided. Additionally, by analyzing the Aslamazov-Larkin and Lawrence-Doniach theories on the reliable excess conductivity data near the critical temperature, we observe the strong effect of Li-doping on the system. The coherence length steadily increases versus the Li-doped content, while the Josephson interlayer coupling strength between the CuO$_2$ layers almost remains a constant for the whole series of Li-doping. Our findings establish an insightful roadmap to improve the critical temperature and intrinsic superconducting properties in the Bi-2223 compounds through the doping process.</description>

      <title>Transverse Cooper-Pair Rectifier</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.04751</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.04751v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Non-reciprocal devices like diodes are key components in modern electronics covering broad applications ranging from transistors to logic circuits thanks to the output rectified signal in the direction parallel to the input. In this work, we predict a transverse Cooper-pair rectifier in which a non-reciprocal current is driven perpendicular to the driving field, when inversion, time reversal, and mirror symmetries are broken simultaneously. The Blonder-Tinkham-Klapwijk formalism is developed to describe the transverse current-voltage relation in a normal-metal/superconductor tunneling junction with an effective built-in supercurrent which leads to an asymmetric and anisotropic Andreev reflection due to the lack of symmetry constraints. The asymmetry in the Andreev reflection is induced when inversion and time reversal symmetry are broken by the supercurrent component parallel to the junction while the anisotropy occurs when the mirror symmetry with respect to the normal of the junction interface is broken by the perpendicular supercurrent component to the junction. Compared to the conventional longitudinal one, the transverse rectifier supports fully polarized diode efficiency and colossal nonreciprocal conductance rectification, completely decoupling the path of the input excitation from the output rectified signal. This work provides a formalism for realizing transverse non-reciprocity in superconducting junctions, which is expected to be achieved after some modification to the current experimental setups and may pave the way for future low-dissipation and fast superconducting electronics.</description>

      <title>Asymmetric Symmetry Breaking: Unequal Probabilities of Vacuum Selection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.05168</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.05168v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the probabilities of a field, subject to random perturbations, to roll down from the top of a potential, where the top is only $C^1$ continuous. We find that the probability to roll down to the left or right depends the square root of the second derivative of the potential at the top. We solve this problem theoretically by using the Fokker-Planck equations in stochastic process and verify our findings numerically. This study may potentially be a new mechanism to explain the origins of asymmetries in the Universe.</description>

      <title>Prediction of Room-Temperature Superconductivity in Quasi-atomic H2-Type Hydrides at High Pressure</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2302.02621</link>
      <description>arXiv:2302.02621v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Achieving superconductivity at room temperature (RT) is a holy grail in physics. Recent discoveries on high-Tc superconductivity in binary hydrides H3S and LaH10 at high pressure have directed the search for RT superconductors to compress hydrides with conventional electron-phonon mechanisms. Here, we predict an exceptional family of superhydrides under high pressures, MH12 (M = Mg, Sc, Zr, Hf, Lu), all exhibiting RT superconductivity with calculated Tcs ranging from 313 to 398 K. In contrast to H3S and LaH10, the hydrogen sublattice in MH12 is arranged as quasi-atomic H2 units. This unique configuration is closely associated with high Tc, attributed to the high electronic density of states derived from H2 antibonding states at the Fermi level and the strong electron-phonon coupling related to the bending vibration of H2 and H-M-H. Notably, MgH12 and ScH12 remain dynamically stable even at pressure below 100 GPa. Our findings offer crucial insights into achieving RT superconductivity and pave the way for innovative directions in experimental research.</description>

      <title>Strain induced flat-band superconductivity and symmetry breaking</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.02824</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.02824v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Superconductivity in single-layer graphene has attracted considerable interest. Here, using the determinant quantum Monte Carlo method, we study transitions of superconductivity and magnetism in a graphene monolayer with a special periodic strain. Consistent with experiments, the deformation accumulates a series of flat bands, whose robustness under interaction is verified through electron localization in real space. During the reconstruction of the band structure, the superconductivity appears in flat band range with next-nearest neighbor d+id pairing symmetry dominating other modes and is accompanied by ferromagnetism caused by symmetry breaking. We also demonstrate that the strain-induced symmetry breaking would accumulate an energy-gap antiferromagnetic insulating phase at half filling even under the limitation of not strong enough interaction, which shows its potential as a platform that exhibits strongly correlated phenomena.</description>

      <title>Dependence of the critical temperature and disorder in holographic superconductors on superfluid density</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.16029</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.16029v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recent experiments strongly indicate deep connections between transports of strange metal and high $T_c$ superconductors. For example, the dependence of the zero-temperature phase stiffness on the critical superconducting temperature is generally linear, which is incompatible with the standard Bardeen-Cooper-Schrieffer description. We develop an analytical method for AC conductivity calculation and explore the scaling relations among superconducting critical temperature, superfluid density, and momentum dissipation strength for the Gubser-Rocha model with extensions in the probe limit. In the normal phase, we show that the critical temperature is proportional to the momentum dissipation strength in a certain parameter range, which is universal in holographic models. In the superconducting phase, studying the AC conductivity analytically and numerically, we find linear dependence of zero-temperature superfluid density (phase stiffness) on the critical superconducting temperature, which is consistent with recent experiments of high $T_c$ superconductors. These results further underpin the deep connections between strange metal and high $T_c$ superconductors.</description>
