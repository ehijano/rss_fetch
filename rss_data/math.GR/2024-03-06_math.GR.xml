      <title>Balls in groups: volume, structure and growth</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.02485</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.02485v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We give sharp bounds in Breuillard, Green and Tao's finitary version of Gromov's theorem on groups with polynomial growth. Precisely, we show that for every non-negative integer d there exists $c=c(d)&gt;0$ such that if $G$ is a group with finite symmetric generating set $S$ containing the identity and $|S^n|\le cn^{d+1}|S|$ for some positive integer $n$ then there exist normal subgroups $H\le\Gamma\le G$ such that $H\subseteq S^n$, such that $\Gamma/H$ is $d$-nilpotent (i.e. has a central series of length $d$ with cyclic factors), and such that $[G:\Gamma]\le g(d)$, where $g(d)$ denotes the maximum order of a finite subgroup of $GL_d(\mathbb{Z})$. The bounds on both the nilpotence and index are sharp; the previous best bounds were $O(d)$ on the nilpotence, and an ineffective function of $d$ on the index. In fact, we obtain this as a small part of a much more detailed fine-scale description of the structure of $G$. These results have a wide range of applications in various aspects of the theory of vertex-transitive graphs: percolation theory, random walks, structure of finite groups, scaling limits of finite vertex-transitive graphs.... We obtain some of these applications in the present paper, and treat others in companion papers. Some are due to or joint with other authors.</description>

      <title>Grid diagrams for higher-dimensional Thompson's groups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.02562</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.02562v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We describe standard forms for elements of the higher-dimensional Thompson groups $nV$ arising from gridding subdivision processes. These processes lead to standard normal form descriptions for elements in these groups, and sizes of these standard forms estimate the word length with respect to finite generating sets. These gridded forms lead to standard algebraic descriptions as well, with respect to the both infinite and finite generating sets for these groups.</description>

      <title>Common neighborhood (signless) Laplacian spectrum and energy of CCC-graph</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.02703</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.02703v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we consider commuting conjugacy class graph (abbreviated as CCC-graph) of a finite group $G$ which is a graph with vertex set $\{x^G : x \in G \setminus Z(G)\}$ (where $x^G$ denotes the conjugacy class containing $x$) and two distinct vertices $x^G$ and $y^G$ are joined by an edge if there exist some elements $x'\in x^G$ and $y'\in y^G$ such that they commute. We compute common neighborhood (signless) Laplacian spectrum and energy of CCC-graph of finite non-abelian groups whose central quotient is isomorphic to either $\mathbb{Z}_p \times \mathbb{Z}_p$ (where $p$ is any prime) or the dihedral group $D_{2n}$ ($n \geq 3$); and determine whether CCC-graphs of these groups are common neighborhood (signless) Laplacian hyperenergetic/borderenergetic. As a consequence, we characterize certain finite non-abelian groups viz. $D_{2n}$, $T_{4n}$, $U_{6n}$, $U_{(n, m)}$, $SD_{8n}$ and $V_{8n}$ such that their CCC-graphs are common neighborhood (signless) Laplacian hyperenergetic/borderenergetic.</description>

      <title>On the Mathieu Conjecture for $Sp(N)$ and $G_2$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.02813</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.02813v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: As a direct continuation of K. Zwart, arXiv:2304.02648, which is built on the work of M. M\"uger and L. Tuset, we reduce the Mathieu conjecture, formulated by O. Mathieu in 1997, for $Sp(N)$ and $G_2$ to a conjecture involving functions over $\mathbb{R}^n\times (S^1)^m$ with $n,m\in\mathbb{N}_0$. The proofs rely on Euler-style parametrizations of these groups, a specific version of the $KAK$ decomposition, which we discuss and prove.</description>

      <title>Two results on complexities of decision problems of groups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.02492</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.02492v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We answer two questions on the complexities of decision problems of groups, each related to a classical result. First, C. Miller characterized the complexity of the isomorphism problem for finitely presented groups in 1971. We do the same for the isomorphism problem for recursively presented groups. Second, the fact that every Turing degree appears as the degree of the word problem of a finitely presented group is shown independently by multiple people in the 1960s. We answer the analogous question for degrees of ceers instead of Turing degrees. We show that the set of ceers which are computably equivalent to a finitely presented group is $\Sigma^0_3$-complete, which is the maximal possible complexity.</description>

      <title>Endomorphisms of Artin groups of type D</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.02880</link>
      <description>arXiv:2307.02880v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper we determine a classification of the endomorphisms of the Artin group $A [D_n]$ of type $D_n$ for $n\ge 6$. In particular we determine its automorphism group and its outer automorphism group. We also determine a classification of the homomorphisms from $A[D_n]$ to the Artin group $A [A_{n-1}]$ of type $A_{n-1}$ and a classification of the homomorphisms from $A[A_{n-1}]$ to $A[D_n]$ for $n\ge 6$. We show that any endomorphism of the quotient $A [D_n] / Z (A [D_n])$ lifts to an endomorphism of $A [D_n]$ for $n \ge 4$. We deduce  a classification of the endomorphisms of $A [D_n] / Z (A [D_n])$, we determine the automorphism and outer automorphism groups of $A [D_n] / Z (A [D_n])$, and we show that $A [D_n] / Z (A [D_n])$ is co-Hopfian, for $n \ge 6$. The results are algebraic in nature but the proofs are based on topological arguments (curves on surfaces and mapping class groups).</description>

      <title>Regular bi-interpretability and finite axiomatizability of Chevalley groups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.01954</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.01954v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper we consider Chevalley groups over commutative rings with $1$, constructed by irreducible root systems of rank $&gt;1$. We always suppose that for the systems $A_2, B_\ell, C_\ell, F_4, G_2$ our rings contain $1/2$ and for the system $G_2$ also $1/3$. Under these assumptions we prove that the central quotients of Chevalley groups are regularly bi-interpretable with the corresponding rings, the class of all central quotients of Chevalley groups of a given type is elementarily definable and even finitely axiomatizable. The same holds for adjoint Chevalley groups and for other Chevalley groups with some special condition of bounded generation. We also give an example of Chevalley group with infinite center, which is not bi-interpretable with the corresponding ring and is elementarily equivalent to a group that is not a Chevalley group itself.</description>

      <title>Linking numbers of modular knots</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2211.05957</link>
      <description>arXiv:2211.05957v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The modular group PSL(2;Z) acts on the hyperbolic plane HP with quotient the modular surface M, whose unit tangent bundle U is a 3-manifold homeomorphic to the complement of the trefoil knot in the 3-sphere. The hyperbolic conjugacy classes of PSL(2;Z) correspond to the closed oriented geodesics in M. Those lift to the periodic orbits for the geodesic flow in U, which define the modular knots. The linking numbers between modular knots and the trefoil is well understood. Indeed, Etienne Ghys showed in 2006 that they are given by the Rademacher invariant of the corresponding conjugacy classes. The Rademacher function is a homogeneous quasi-morphism of PSL(2;Z) which he had recognised with Jean Barge in 1992 as half the primitive of the bounded euler class. This shed light on the 1987 work of Michael Atiyah concerning the logarithm of the Dedekind eta function which identified it with no less than that six other important functions appearing in diverse areas of mathematics. We are concerned with the linking numbers between modular knots and derive several formulae with arithmetical, combinatorial, topological and group theoretical flavours. In particular we associate to a pair of modular knots a function defined on the character variety of PSL(2;Z), whose limit at the boundary point recovers their linking number. Moreover, we show that the linking number with a modular knot minus that with its inverse yields a homogeneous quasi-morphism on the modular group, and how to extract a free basis out of these. For this we prove that the linking pairing is non degenerate.</description>

      <title>The Character Triple Conjecture for maximal defect characters and the prime 2</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.13809</link>
      <description>arXiv:2307.13809v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We prove that Sp\"ath's Character Triple Conjecture holds for every finite group with respect to maximal defect characters at the prime 2. This is done by reducing the maximal defect case of the conjecture to the so-called inductive Alperin-McKay condition whose verification has recently been completed by Ruhstorfer for the prime 2. As a consequence we obtain the Character Triple Conjecture for all 2-blocks with abelian defect groups by applying Brauer's Height Zero Conjecture, a proof of which is now available. We also obtain similar results for the block-free version of the Character Triple Conjecture at any prime p.</description>
