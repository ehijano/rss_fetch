      <title>Assessing the physical risks of climate change for the financial sector: a case study from Mexico's Central Bank</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.18834</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.18834v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The financial sector is increasingly concerned with the physical risks of climate change, but economic and financial impact representations are still developing, particularly for chronic risks. Mexico's Central Bank conducted a comprehensive assessment using a suite of global models to evaluate both physical and transition risks. We present the analysis concerning with chronic physical risks, underlining innovations such as the use of a recent integrated assessment model that enables grid-cell level analysis and differentiates urban and non-urban areas, capturing the local effects of climate change more accurately. The model includes multiple damage functions and a probabilistic climate model for encompassing analyses and detailed economic impact insights. Under the Current Policies scenario, economic losses could exceed 35 percent of Mexico's GDP by 2100. Accounting for the urban heat island effect, losses could surpass 20 trillion (USD) in present value, over ten times Mexico's 2024 GDP. However, implementing a scenario aligned with the Paris Agreement significantly reduces these losses, showcasing the benefits of international mitigation efforts, though substantial residual impacts persist. This study emphasizes integrating chronic physical risks into financial evaluations, proposing new approaches, metrics, and methods that exploit detailed, spatially explicit measures to improve risk and loss estimation and facilitate communication.</description>

      <title>Quantifying Global Food Trade: A Net Caloric Content Approach to Network Analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.18856</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.18856v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: As the global population and the per capita demand for resource intensive diets continues to grow, the corresponding increase in food demand challenges the global food system, enhancing its reliance on trade. Most previous research typically constructed either unweighted networks or weighted solely by tonnage to represent food trade, and focused on bilateral trade relationships between pairs of countries. This study investigates the properties of global food trade constructed in terms of total food calories associated with all the main food products exchanged along each trade link (edge of the food trade network). Utilizing data from the Food and Agriculture Organization between 1986 and 2022, we construct a directed, weighted network of net caloric flows between countries. This approach highlights the importance of considering nutritional value in discussions of food security and trade policies, offering a more holistic view of global food trade dynamics. Our analysis reveals significant heterogeneity in trade patterns, with certain countries emerging as major exporters or importers of food calories. Moreover, we employ network measures, including network connectivity, network heterogeneity, network modularity, and node correlation similarity, to elucidate the structural dynamics of global net food calorie trade networks that are relevant to the stability and resilience of the global food system. Our work provides a more nuanced understanding of global food trade dynamics, emphasizing the need for comprehensive strategies to enhance the resilience and sustainability of food trade networks.</description>

      <title>Democratising Agricultural Commodity Price Forecasting: The AGRICAF Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.20363</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.20363v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Ensuring food security is a critical global challenge, particularly for low-income countries where food prices impact the access to nutritious food. The volatility of global agricultural commodity (AC) prices exacerbates food insecurity, with international trade restrictions and market disruptions further complicating the situation. Despite online platforms for monitoring food prices, there is a significant gap in providing detailed explanations and forecasts accessible to non-specialists. To address this, we propose the Agricultural Commodity Analysis and Forecasts (AGRICAF) methodology, integrating explainable machine learning (XML) and econometric techniques to analyse and forecast global agricultural commodity prices up to one year ahead, dynamically adapting to different forecast horizons. This innovative integration allows us to model complex interactions and dynamics while providing clear, interpretable results. This paper demonstrates how AGRICAF can be used, applying it to three major agricultural commodities - maize, soybean, and wheat - and explaining how different factors impact prices across various months and forecast horizons. By facilitating access to accurate and interpretable medium-term forecasts of AC prices, AGRICAF can contribute to developing a fair and sustainable food system.</description>

      <title>The Rise and Fall of Ideas' Popularity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.18541</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.18541v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In the dynamic landscape of contemporary society, the popularity of ideas, opinions, and interests fluctuates rapidly. Traditional dynamical models in social sciences often fail to capture this inherent volatility, attributing changes to exogenous shocks rather than intrinsic features of the system. This paper introduces a novel, tractable model that simulates the natural rise and fall of ideas' popularity, offering a more accurate representation of real-world dynamics. Building upon the SIRS (Susceptible, Infectious, Recovered, Susceptible) epidemiological model, we incorporate a feedback mechanism that allows the recovery rate to vary dynamically based on the current state of the system. This modification reflects the cyclical nature of idea adoption and abandonment, driven by social saturation and renewed interest. Our model successfully captures the rapid and recurrent shifts in popularity, providing valuable insights into the mechanisms behind these fluctuations. This approach offers a robust framework for studying the diffusion dynamics of popular ideas, with potential applications across various fields such as marketing, technology adoption, and political movements.</description>
