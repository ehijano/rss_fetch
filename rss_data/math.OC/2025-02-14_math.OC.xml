      <title>Policy Selection and Schedules for Exclusive Bus Lane and High Occupancy Vehicle Lane in a Bi-modal Transportation Corridor</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.08729</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.08729v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Efficient management of transportation corridors is critical for sustaining urban mobility, directly influencing transportation efficiency. Two prominent strategies for enhancing public transit services and alleviating congestion, Exclusive Bus Lane (EBL) and High Occupancy Vehicle Lane (HOVL), are gaining increasing attention. EBLs prioritize bus transit by providing dedicated lanes for faster travel times, while HOVLs encourage carpooling by reserving lanes for high-occupancy vehicles. However, static implementations of these policies may underutilize road resources and disrupt general-purpose lanes. Dynamic control of these policies, based on real-time demand, can potentially maximize road efficiency and minimize negative impacts. This study develops cost functions for Mixed Traffic Policy (MTP), Exclusive Bus Lane Policy (EBLP), and High Occupancy Vehicle Lane Policy (HOVLP), incorporating optimized bus frequency and demand split under equilibrium condition. Switching thresholds for policy selection are derived to identify optimal periods for implementing each policy based on dynamic demand simulated using an Ornstein-Uhlenbeck (O-U) process. Results reveal significant reductions in total system costs with the proposed dynamic policy integration. Compared to static implementations, the combined policy achieves cost reductions of 12.0%, 5.3% and 42.5% relative to MTP-only, EBLP-only, and HOVLP-only scenarios, respectively. Additionally, in two real case studies of existing EBL and HOVL operations, the proposed dynamic policy reduces total costs by 32.2% and 27.9%, respectively. The findings provide valuable insights for policymakers and transit planners, offering a robust framework for dynamically scheduling and integrating EBL and HOVL policies to optimize urban corridor efficiency and reduce overall system costs.</description>

      <title>Equity-aware Design and Timing of Fare-free Transit Zoning under Demand Uncertainty</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.08731</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.08731v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose the first analytical stochastic model for optimizing the configuration and implementation policies of fare-free transit. The model focuses on a transportation corridor with two transportation modes: automobiles and buses. The corridor is divided into two sections, an inner one with fare-free transit service and an outer one with fare-based transit service. Under the static version of the model, the optimized length and frequency of the fare-free transit zone can be determined by maximizing total social welfare. The findings indicate that implementing fare-free transit can increase transit ridership and reduce automobile use within the fare-free zone while social equity among the demand groups can be enhanced by lengthening the fare-free zone. Notably, the optimal zone length increases when both social welfare and equity are considered jointly, compared to only prioritizing social welfare. The dynamic model, framed within a market entry and exit real options approach, solves the fare policy switching problem, establishing optimal timing policies for activating or terminating fare-free service. The results from dynamic models reveal earlier implementation and extended durations of fare-free transit in the social welfare-aware regime, driven by lower thresholds compared to the social equity-aware regime.</description>

      <title>A Bundle-based Augmented Lagrangian Framework: Algorithm, Convergence, and Primal-dual Principles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.08835</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.08835v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose a new bundle-based augmented Lagrangian framework for solving constrained convex problems. Unlike the classical (inexact) augmented Lagrangian method (ALM) that has a nested double-loop structure, our framework features a $\textit{single-loop}$ process. Motivated by the proximal bundle method (PBM), we use a $\textit{bundle}$ of past iterates to approximate the subproblem in ALM to get a computationally efficient update at each iteration. We establish sub-linear convergences for primal feasibility, primal cost values, and dual iterates under mild assumptions. With further regularity conditions, such as quadratic growth, our algorithm enjoys $\textit{linear}$ convergences. Importantly, this linear convergence can happen for a class of conic optimization problems, including semidefinite programs. Our proof techniques leverage deep connections with inexact ALM and primal-dual principles with PBM.</description>

      <title>Controlling discrete semilinear wave equations toward flocks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.08852</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.08852v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, we initiate the research on controlling nonlinear waves propagating on lattices from a completely new perspective. We consider nonlinear waves on a lattice as a system of interacting particles and study their collective flocking behavior. By designing suitable feedback controls, we show that any admissible flock can be reached within a finite amount of time. Finally, we highlight the connection between our flocking problem and a minimal-time problem in the framework of nonlinear Hamilton-Jacobi equations and optimal control theory.</description>

      <title>On the tightness of linear relaxations of alternative mixed integer programming formulations for the generator maintenance scheduling problem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.08855</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.08855v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper presents a comprehensive theoretical analysis of six distinct Mixed-Integer Programming (MIP) formulations for preventive Generator Maintenance Scheduling (GMS), a critical problem for ensuring the reliability and efficiency of power systems. By comparing the tightness of their linear relaxations, we identify which formulations offer superior dual bound and, thus, better computational performance. Our analysis includes establishing relationships between the formulations through definitions, lemmas, and propositions, demonstrating that some formulations provide tighter relaxations that lead to more efficient optimization outcomes. These findings offer valuable insights for practitioners and researchers in selecting the most effective models to enhance the scheduling process of preventive generator maintenance.</description>

      <title>Ergodicity and turnpike properties of linear-quadratic mean field control problems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.08935</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.08935v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the asymptotic behavior of solutions to linear-quadratic mean field stochastic optimal control problems. By formulating an ergodic control framework, we characterize the convergence between the finite time horizon control problem and its ergodic counterpart. Leveraging these convergence results, we establish the turnpike property for the optimal pairs, demonstrating that solutions to the finite time horizon control problem remain exponentially close to the ergodic equilibrium except near the temporal boundaries. This result reveals the intrinsic connection between long-term dynamics and their asymptotic behavior in mean field control systems.</description>

      <title>Decentralized Stochastic Optimization over Unreliable Networks via Two-timescales Updates</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.08964</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.08964v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper introduces a robust two-timescale compressed primal-dual (TiCoPD) algorithm tailored for decentralized optimization under bandwidth-limited and unreliable channels. By integrating the majorization-minimization approach with the primal-dual optimization framework, the TiCoPD algorithm strategically compresses the difference term shared among agents to enhance communication efficiency and robustness against noisy channels without compromising convergence stability. The method incorporates a mirror sequence for agent consensus on nonlinearly compressed terms updated on a fast timescale, together with a slow timescale primal-dual recursion for optimizing the objective function. Our analysis demonstrates that the proposed algorithm converges to a stationary solution when the objective function is smooth but possibly non-convex. Numerical experiments corroborate the conclusions of this paper.</description>

      <title>Second-Order Necessary Optimality Conditions for Multi-Objective Optimal Control Problems on Riemannian Manifolds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.09005</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.09005v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we investigate the multi-objective optimal control problem of ordinary differential equations on Riemannian manifolds. We first obtain the second-order necessary conditions for weak Pareto optimal solutions for multi-objective optimal control problems with fixed terminal time, and then extend these results to multi-objective optimal control problems with free terminal time, deriving the corresponding second-order necessary conditions for weak Pareto optimal solutions. Our main results (i.e., Theorem 2.2 and Theorem 2.4) show that weak Pareto optimal solutions depend on the curvature tensor of the Riemannian manifold. Finally, we provide an example (i.e., Example 2.1) as an application of our main results, illustrating how our findings differ from existing related results (see Remark 2.2).</description>

      <title>Bilevel gradient methods and Morse parametric qualification</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.09074</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.09074v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Morse parametric qualification condition is a new condition that generalizes uniform strong convexity. Generic semi-algebraic functions are Morse parametric in a piecewise sense, implying that generic semi-algebraic bilevel problems reduce to mixed-integer programming. In this new framework, we study bilevel gradient algorithms with two strategies: the single-step multi-step strategy, which involves a sequence of steps on the lower-level problems followed by one step on the upper-level problem, and a differentiable programming strategy that optimizes a smooth approximation of the bilevel problem. While the first is shown to be a biased gradient method on the problem with rich properties, the second, inspired by meta-learning applications, is less stable but offers simplicity and ease of implementation.</description>

      <title>Sum-of-Squares Hierarchy for the Gromov Wasserstein Problem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.09102</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.09102v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Gromov-Wasserstein (GW) problem is a variant of the classical optimal transport problem that allows one to compute meaningful transportation plans between incomparable spaces. At an intuitive level, it seeks plans that minimize the discrepancy between metric evaluations of pairs of points. The GW problem is typically cast as an instance of a non-convex quadratic program that is, unfortunately, intractable to solve. In this paper, we describe tractable semidefinite relaxations of the GW problem based on the Sum-of-Squares (SOS) hierarchy. We describe how the Putinar-type and the Schm\"udgen-type moment hierarchies can be simplified using marginal constraints, and we prove convergence rates for these hierarchies towards computing global optimal solutions to the GW problem. The proposed SOS hierarchies naturally induce a distance measure analogous to the distortion metrics, and we show that these are genuine distances in that they satisfy the triangle inequality. In particular, the proposed SOS hierarchies provide computationally tractable proxies of the GW distance and the associated distortion distances (over metric measure spaces) that are otherwise intractable to compute.</description>

Abstract: This paper, in the setting at infinity, presents some relationships between the modulus of metric regularity and the radius of (strong) metric regularity that gives a measure of the extent to which a set-valued mapping can be perturbed before (strong) metric regularity is lost. The results given here can be viewed as versions at infinity of [2, Theorem 1.5] and [3, Theorem 4.6].</description>

      <title>Dynamic Rolling Horizon Optimization for Network-Constrained V2X Value Stacking of Electric Vehicles Under Uncertainties</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.09290</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.09290v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Electric vehicle (EV) coordination can provide significant benefits through vehicle-to-everything (V2X) by interacting with the grid, buildings, and other EVs. This work aims to develop a V2X value-stacking framework, including vehicle-to-building (V2B), vehicle-to-grid (V2G), and energy trading, to maximize economic benefits for residential communities while maintaining distribution voltage. This work also seeks to quantify the impact of prediction errors related to building load, renewable energy, and EV arrivals. A dynamic rolling-horizon optimization (RHO) method is employed to leverage multiple revenue streams and maximize the potential of EV coordination. To address energy uncertainties, including hourly local building load, local photovoltaic (PV) generation, and EV arrivals, this work develops a Transformer-based forecasting model named Gated Recurrent Units-Encoder-Temporal Fusion Decoder (GRU-EN-TFD). The simulation results, using real data from Australia's National Electricity Market, and the Independent System Operators in New England and New York in the US, reveal that V2X value stacking can significantly reduce energy costs. The proposed GRU-EN-TFD model outperforms the benchmark forecast model. Uncertainties in EV arrivals have a more substantial impact on value-stacking performance, highlighting the significance of its accurate forecast. This work provides new insights into the dynamic interactions among residential communities, unlocking the full potential of EV batteries.</description>

      <title>Global Stabilization of Chemostats with Nonzero Mortality and Substrate Dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.09310</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.09310v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In "chemostat"-type population models that incorporate substrate (nutrient) dynamics, the dependence of the birth (or growth) rate on the substrate concentration introduces nonlinear coupling that creates a challenge for stabilization that is global, namely, for all positive concentrations of the biomass and nutrients. This challenge for global stabilization has been overcome in the literature using relatively simple feedback when natural mortality of the biomass is absent. However, under natural mortality, it takes fortified, more complex feedback, outside of the existing nonlinear control design toolbox, to avoid biomass extinction from nutrient-depleted initial conditions. Such fortified feedback, the associated control Laypunov function design, and Lyapunov analysis of global stability are provided in this paper. We achieve global stabilization for two different chemostat models: (i) a lumped model, with two state variables, and (ii) a three-state model derived from an age-structured infinite-dimensional model. The proposed feedback stabilizers are explicit, applicable to both the lumped and the age-structured models, and coincide with simple feedback laws proposed in the literature when the mortality rate is zero. Global stabilization means subject to constraints: all positive biomass and nutrient concentrations are within the region of attraction of the desired equilibrium, and, additionally, this is achieved with a dilution input that is guaranteed to remain positive. For the lumped case with Haldane kinetics, we show that the reproduction rate dominating the mortality (excluding the reproduction and mortality being in balance) is not only sufficient but also necessary for global stabilization. The obtained results are illustrated with simple examples.</description>

      <title>Feedback control solves pseudoconvex optimal tracking problems in nonlinear dynamical systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.09322</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.09322v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Achieving optimality in controlling physical systems is a profound challenge across diverse scientific and engineering fields, spanning neuromechanics, biochemistry, autonomous systems, economics, and beyond. Traditional solutions, relying on time-consuming offline iterative algorithms, often yield limited insights into fundamental natural processes. In this work, we introduce a novel, causally deterministic approach, presenting the closed-form optimal tracking controller (OTC) that inherently solves pseudoconvex optimization problems in various fields. Through rigorous analysis and comprehensive numerical examples, we demonstrate OTC's capability of achieving both high accuracy and rapid response, even when facing high-dimensional and high-dynamical real-world problems. Notably, our OTC outperforms state-of-the-art methods by, e.g., solving a 1304-dimensional neuromechanics problem 1311 times faster or with 113 times higher accuracy. Most importantly, OTC embodies a causally deterministic system interpretation of optimality principles, providing a new and fundamental perspective of optimization in natural and artificial processes. We anticipate our work to be an important step towards establishing a general causally deterministic optimization theory for a broader spectrum of system and problem classes, promising advances in understanding optimality principles in complex systems.</description>

      <title>Speed planning by minimizing travel time and energy consumption</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.09468</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.09468v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper we address the speed planning problem for a vehicle over an assigned path with the aim of minimizing a weighted sum of travel time and energy consumption under suitable constraints (maximum allowed speed, maximum traction or braking force, maximum power consumption). The resulting mathematical model is a non--convex optimization problem. We prove that, under some mild assumptions, a convex reformulation of the non--convex problem is exact. In particular, the convex reformulation is a Second Order Cone Programming (SOCP) problem, for which efficient solvers exist. Through the numerical experiments we confirm that the convex relaxation can be solved very efficiently and, moreover, we also provide the Pareto front of the trade-off between the two objectives (travel time and energy consumption).</description>

      <title>A First-order Generative Bilevel Optimization Framework for Diffusion Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.08808</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.08808v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Diffusion models, which iteratively denoise data samples to synthesize high-quality outputs, have achieved empirical success across domains. However, optimizing these models for downstream tasks often involves nested bilevel structures, such as tuning hyperparameters for fine-tuning tasks or noise schedules in training dynamics, where traditional bilevel methods fail due to the infinite-dimensional probability space and prohibitive sampling costs. We formalize this challenge as a generative bilevel optimization problem and address two key scenarios: (1) fine-tuning pre-trained models via an inference-only lower-level solver paired with a sample-efficient gradient estimator for the upper level, and (2) training diffusion models from scratch with noise schedule optimization by reparameterizing the lower-level problem and designing a computationally tractable gradient estimator. Our first-order bilevel framework overcomes the incompatibility of conventional bilevel methods with diffusion processes, offering theoretical grounding and computational practicality. Experiments demonstrate that our method outperforms existing fine-tuning and hyperparameter search baselines.</description>

      <title>Recovery guarantees for compressed sensing photoacoustic tomography</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.08846</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.08846v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Photoacoustic tomography is an emerging medical imaging technology whose primary aim is to map the high-contrast optical properties of biological tissues by leveraging high-resolution ultrasound measurements. Mathematically, this can be framed as an inverse source problem for the wave equation over a specific domain. In this work, for the first time, it is shown how, by assuming signal sparsity, it is possible to establish rigorous stable recovery guarantees when the data collection is given by spatial averages restricted to a limited portion of the boundary. Our framework encompasses many approaches that have been considered in the literature. The result is a consequence of a general framework for subsampled inverse problems developed in previous works and refined stability estimates for an inverse problem for the wave equation with surface measurements.</description>

      <title>Robust Graph-Based Semi-Supervised Learning via $p$-Conductances</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.08873</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.08873v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the problem of semi-supervised learning on graphs in the regime where data labels are scarce or possibly corrupted. We propose an approach called $p$-conductance learning that generalizes the $p$-Laplace and Poisson learning methods by introducing an objective reminiscent of $p$-Laplacian regularization and an affine relaxation of the label constraints. This leads to a family of probability measure mincut programs that balance sparse edge removal with accurate distribution separation. Our theoretical analysis connects these programs to well-known variational and probabilistic problems on graphs (including randomized cuts, effective resistance, and Wasserstein distance) and provides motivation for robustness when labels are diffused via the heat kernel. Computationally, we develop a semismooth Newton-conjugate gradient algorithm and extend it to incorporate class-size estimates when converting the continuous solutions into label assignments. Empirical results on computer vision and citation datasets demonstrate that our approach achieves state-of-the-art accuracy in low label-rate, corrupted-label, and partial-label regimes.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2502.09034v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose to relax the classic Cauchy-Riemann equations for a mapping. We support the interest of such a proposal by looking at one specific situation in 3D, and proving the existence of pairs of harmonic conjugate functions with respect to a unitary gradient as the title of this contribution conveys. We further investigate the relationship between boundary conditions for such pairs, the importance of the unitary constraint, and the eventual link of these ideas to Calder\'on's problem in 3D.</description>

      <title>Optimal rate of convergence in the vanishing viscosity for quadratic Hamilton-Jacobi equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.09103</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.09103v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The purpose of this note is to provide an optimal rate of convergence in the vanishing viscosity regime for first-order Hamilton-Jacobi equations with purely quadratic Hamiltonian. We show that for a globally Lipschitz-continuous terminal condition the rate is of order O($\epsilon$ log $\epsilon$), and we provide an example to show that this rate cannot be sharpened. This improves on the previously known rate of convergence O( $\sqrt$ $\epsilon$), which was widely believed to be optimal. Our proof combines techniques involving regularization by sup-convolution with entropy estimates for the flow of a suitable version of the adjoint linearized equation. The key technical point is an integrated estimate of the Laplacian of the solution against this flow. Moreover, we exploit the semiconcavity generated by the equation.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2502.09131v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recently, the fundamental lemma by Willems et. al has been extended towards stochastic LTI systems subject to process disturbances. Using this lemma requires previously recorded data of inputs, outputs, and disturbances. In this paper, we exploit causality concepts of stochastic control to propose a variant of the stochastic fundamental lemma that does not require past disturbance data in the Hankel matrices. Our developments rely on polynomial chaos expansions and on the knowledge of the disturbance distribution. Similar to our previous results, the proposed variant of the fundamental lemma allows to predict future input-output trajectories of stochastic LTI systems. We draw upon a numerical example to illustrate the proposed variant in data-driven control context.</description>

Abstract: We consider a random dynamical system on $\mathbb{R}^d$, whose dynamics is defined by a stochastic differential equation. The annealed transfer operator associated with such systems is a kernel operator. Given a set of feasible infinitesimal perturbations $P$ to this kernel, with support in a certain compact set, and a specified observable function $\phi: \mathbb{R}^d \to \mathbb{R}$, we study which infinitesimal perturbation in $P$ produces the greatest change in expectation of $\phi$. We establish conditions under which the optimal perturbation uniquely exists and present a numerical method to approximate the optimal infinitesimal kernel perturbation. Finally, we numerically illustrate our findings with concrete examples.</description>

      <title>A finite element scheme for an optimal control problem on steady Navier-Stokes-Brinkman equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.09336</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.09336v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper presents a rigorous finite element framework for solving an optimal control problem governed by the steady Navier-Stokes-Brinkman equations, focusing on identifying a scalar permeability parameter $\gamma$ from local velocity observations. Three different finite element discretization schemes are proposed, and a priori error estimates are proven under appropriate regularity assumptions for each one. A key contribution of this paper is the development of residual-based a posteriori error estimators for both fully discrete and semi-discrete schemes, guiding adaptive mesh refinement to achieve comparable accuracy with fewer degrees of freedom. The method of manufactured solutions is used for numerical experiments to validate the theoretical findings, to demonstrate optimal convergence rates and the effectivity index is evaluated to measure their reliability. The framework offers insights into flow control mechanisms and paving the way for extensions to time-dependent, stochastic, or multiphysics problems.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2502.09352v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Design of adversarial attacks for deep neural networks, as well as methods of adversarial training against them, are subject of intense research. In this paper, we propose methods to train against distributional attack threats, extending the TRADES method used for pointwise attacks. Our approach leverages recent contributions and relies on sensitivity analysis for Wasserstein distributionally robust optimization problems. We introduce an efficient fine-tuning method which can be deployed on a previously trained model. We test our methods on a range of pre-trained models on RobustBench. These experimental results demonstrate the additional training enhances Wasserstein distributional robustness, while maintaining original levels of pointwise robustness, even for already very successful networks. The improvements are less marked for models pre-trained using huge synthetic datasets of 20-100M images. However, remarkably, sometimes our methods are still able to improve their performance even when trained using only the original training dataset (50k images).</description>

      <title>Inverse Design with Dynamic Mode Decomposition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.09490</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.09490v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce a computationally efficient method for the automation of inverse design in science and engineering. Based on simple least-square regression, the underlying dynamic mode decomposition algorithm can be used to construct a low-rank subspace spanning multiple experiments in parameter space. The proposed inverse design dynamic mode composition (ID-DMD) algorithm leverages the computed low-dimensional subspace to enable fast digital design and optimization on laptop-level computing, including the potential to prescribe the dynamics themselves. Moreover, the method is robust to noise, physically interpretable, and can provide uncertainty quantification metrics. The architecture can also efficiently scale to large-scale design problems using randomized algorithms in the ID-DMD. The simplicity of the method and its implementation are highly attractive in practice, and the ID-DMD has been demonstrated to be an order of magnitude more accurate than competing methods while simultaneously being 3-5 orders faster on challenging engineering design problems ranging from structural vibrations to fluid dynamics. Due to its speed, robustness, interpretability, and ease-of-use, ID-DMD in comparison with other leading machine learning methods represents a significant advancement in data-driven methods for inverse design and optimization, promising a paradigm shift in how to approach inverse design in practice.</description>

      <title>Scalable First-order Method for Certifying Optimal k-Sparse GLMs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.09502</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.09502v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper investigates the problem of certifying optimality for sparse generalized linear models (GLMs), where sparsity is enforced through an $\ell_0$ cardinality constraint. While branch-and-bound (BnB) frameworks can certify optimality by pruning nodes using dual bounds, existing methods for computing these bounds are either computationally intensive or exhibit slow convergence, limiting their scalability to large-scale problems. To address this challenge, we propose a first-order proximal gradient algorithm designed to solve the perspective relaxation of the problem within a BnB framework. Specifically, we formulate the relaxed problem as a composite optimization problem and demonstrate that the proximal operator of the non-smooth component can be computed exactly in log-linear time complexity, eliminating the need to solve a computationally expensive second-order cone program. Furthermore, we introduce a simple restart strategy that enhances convergence speed while maintaining low per-iteration complexity. Extensive experiments on synthetic and real-world datasets show that our approach significantly accelerates dual bound computations and is highly effective in providing optimality certificates for large-scale problems.</description>

      <title>A systematic literature review on the application of analytical approaches and mathematical programming in public bus transit network design and operations planning: Part I</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.09508v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Public Bus Transit Network Design Problem and Operations Planning (PBTNDP&amp;OP) remains a core research area within transportation, in particular, because of the emergence of new transit technologies and services. Analytical approaches and mathematical programming are the most commonly applied methodologies to study this problem. Many studies utilize either of these two methods, often viewed as competing due to the unique benefits each provides that the other does not. This two-part paper systematically reviews the application of analytical approaches and mathematical programming in PBTNDP&amp;OP, analyzing publications from 1968 to 2021. It begins by comparing analytical methods and mathematical programming through various statistical analyses, including the number of published papers, the most active journals and authors, keyword frequencies, keyword co-occurrence maps, and co-authorship maps. Subsequent analysis of the identified papers includes examinations from multiple perspectives: the problems investigated, modeling methods used, decision variables considered, network structures, and key findings. This is followed by a critical review of selected papers. The paper concludes by discussing the advantages and disadvantages of each approach and suggests potential extensions for future research based on identified gaps in existing studies.</description>

      <title>Exact Leader Estimation: A New Approach for Distributed Differentiation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.09529</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.09529v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A novel strategy aimed at cooperatively differentiating a signal among multiple interacting agents is introduced, where none of the agents needs to know which agent is the leader, i.e. the one producing the signal to be differentiated. Every agent communicates only a scalar variable to its neighbors; except for the leader, all agents execute the same algorithm. The proposed strategy can effectively obtain derivatives up to arbitrary $m$-th order in a finite time under the assumption that the $(m+1)$-th derivative is bounded. The strategy borrows some of its structure from the celebrated homogeneous robust exact differentiator by A. Levant, inheriting its exact differentiation capability and robustness to measurement noise. Hence, the proposed strategy can be said to perform robust exact distributed differentiation. In addition, and for the first time in the distributed leader-observer literature, sampled-data communication and bounded measurement noise are considered, and corresponding steady-state worst-case accuracy bounds are derived. The effectiveness of the proposed strategy is verified numerically for second- and fourth-order systems, i.e., for estimating derivatives of up to first and third order, respectively.</description>

      <title>Enhancing Traffic Safety Analysis with Digital Twin Technology: Integrating Vehicle Dynamics and Environmental Factors into Microscopic Traffic Simulation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.09561</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.09561v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Traffic safety is a critical concern in transportation engineering and urban planning. Traditional traffic safety analysis requires trained observers to collect data in the field, which is time-consuming, labor-intensive, and sometimes inaccurate. In recent years, microscopic traffic simulation, which simulates individual vehicles' movements within a transportation network, have been utilized to study traffic safety. However, microscopic traffic simulation only focuses on traffic-related factors, such as traffic volume, traffic signals, and lane configurations, neglecting vehicle dynamics and environment-related factors like weather and lighting conditions, which can significantly impact traffic safety. In light of this, this paper explores the application of digital twin technology in traffic safety analysis, integrating vehicle simulators, which consider vehicle dynamics and environmental factors, and microscopic traffic simulators, which simulate the operations of traffic flow, for enhanced safety evaluations. Various scenarios, including different weather conditions and visibility levels, are simulated using a digital twin of a road segment in Tuscaloosa, Alabama. The simulations employ Surrogate Safety Measures (SSMs) like Time to Collision (TTC) and Deceleration Rate to Avoid a Crash (DRAC) to assess safety under varying conditions. The results demonstrate that traffic digital twin can identify potential safety issues that traditional microscopic simulation cannot, providing insights for improving traffic control strategies and transportation infrastructure to enhance traffic safety.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2111.13256v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Exhausters and coexhausters are notions of constructive nonsmooth analysis which are used to study extremal properties of functions. An upper exhauster (coexhauster) is used to get an approximation of a considered function in the neighborhood of a point in the form of $\min\max$ of linear (affine) functions. A lower exhauster (coexhauster) is used to represent the approximation in the form of $\max\min$ of linear (affine) functions. Conditions for a minimum in a most simple way are expressed by means of upper exhausters and coexhausters, while conditions for a maximum are described in terms of lower exhausters and coexhausters. Thus the problem of obtaining an upper exhauster or coexhauster when the lower one is given and vice verse arises. We study this problem in the paper and propose new method for its solution which allows one to pass easily between $\min\max$ and $\max\min$ representations.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2311.17596v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The stochastic linear--quadratic regulator problem subject to Gaussian disturbances is well known and usually addressed via a moment-based reformulation. Here, we leverage polynomial chaos expansions, which model random variables via series expansions in a suitable $\mathcal{L}^2$ probability space, to tackle the non-Gaussian case. We present the optimal solutions for finite and infinite horizons and we analyze the infinite-horizon asymptotics. We show that the limit of the optimal state-input trajectory is the unique solution to a corresponding stochastic stationary optimization problem in the sense of probability measures. Moreover, we provide a constructive error analysis for finite-dimensional polynomial chaos approximations of the optimal solutions and of the optimal stationary pair in non-Gaussian settings. A numerical example illustrates our findings.</description>

      <title>The Robust Bilevel Selection Problem</title>

      <description>arXiv:2401.03951v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In bilevel optimization problems, a leader and a follower make their decisions in a hierarchy, and both decisions may influence each other. Usually one assumes that both players have full knowledge also of the other player's data. In a more realistic model, uncertainty can be quantified, e.g., using the robust optimization approach: We assume that the leader does not know the follower's objective precisely, but only up to some uncertainty set, and her aim is to optimize the worst case of the corresponding scenarios. Now the question arises how the complexity of bilevel optimization changes under the additional complications of this uncertainty.
  We make a further step towards answering this question by examining an easy bilevel problem. In the Bilevel Selection Problem (BSP), the leader and the follower each select some items from their own item set, while a common number of items to select in total is given, and each player minimizes the total costs of the selected items, according to different sets of item costs. We show that the BSP can be solved in polynomial time and then investigate its robust version. If the two players' item sets are disjoint, it can still be solved in polynomial time for several types of uncertainty sets. Otherwise, we show that the Robust BSP is NP-hard and present a 2-approximation algorithm and exact exponential-time approaches.
  Furthermore, we investigate variants of the BSP where one or both of the two players take a continuous decision. One variant leads to an example of a bilevel optimization problem whose optimal value may not be attained. For the Robust Continuous BSP, where all variables are continuous, we also develop a new approach for the setting of discrete uncorrelated uncertainty, which gives a polynomial-time algorithm for the Robust Continuous BSP and a pseudopolynomial-time algorithm for the Robust Bilevel Continuous Knapsack Problem.</description>

      <title>Stochastic ISTA/FISTA Adaptive Step Search Algorithms for Convex Composite Optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.15646</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.15646v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We develop and analyze stochastic variants of ISTA and a full backtracking FISTA algorithms [Beck and Teboulle, 2009, Scheinberg et al., 2014] for composite optimization without the assumption that stochastic gradient is an unbiased estimator. This work extends analysis of inexact fixed step ISTA/FISTA in [Schmidt et al., 2011] to the case of stochastic gradient estimates and adaptive step-size parameter chosen by backtracking. It also extends the framework for analyzing stochastic line-search method in [Cartis and Scheinberg, 2018] to the proximal gradient framework as well as to the accelerated first order methods.</description>

      <title>A general framework of Riemannian adaptive optimization methods with a convergence analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.00859</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.00859v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper proposes a general framework of Riemannian adaptive optimization methods. The framework encapsulates several stochastic optimization algorithms on Riemannian manifolds and incorporates the mini-batch strategy that is often used in deep learning. Within this framework, we also propose AMSGrad on embedded submanifolds of Euclidean space. Moreover, we give convergence analyses valid for both a constant and a diminishing step size. Our analyses also reveal the relationship between the convergence rate and mini-batch size. In numerical experiments, we applied the proposed algorithm to principal component analysis and the low-rank matrix completion problem, which can be considered to be Riemannian optimization problems. Python implementations of the methods used in the numerical experiments are available at https://github.com/iiduka-researches/202408-adaptive.</description>

      <title>Beyond Non-Degeneracy: Revisiting Certainty Equivalent Heuristic for Online Linear Programming</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.01716</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.01716v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The Certainty Equivalent heuristic (CE) is a widely-used algorithm for various dynamic resource allocation problems in OR and OM. Despite its popularity, existing theoretical guarantees of CE are limited to settings satisfying restrictive fluid regularity conditions, particularly, the non-degeneracy conditions, under the widely held belief that the violation of such conditions leads to performance deterioration and necessitates algorithmic innovation beyond CE.
  In this work, we conduct a refined performance analysis of CE within the general framework of online linear programming. We show that CE achieves uniformly near-optimal regret (up to a polylogarithmic factor in $T$) under only mild assumptions on the underlying distribution, without relying on any fluid regularity conditions. Our result implies that, contrary to prior belief, CE effectively beats the curse of degeneracy for a wide range of problem instances with continuous conditional reward distributions, highlighting the distinction of the problem's structure between discrete and non-discrete settings. Our explicit regret bound interpolates between the mild $(\log T)^2$ regime and the worst-case $\sqrt{T}$ regime with a parameter $\beta$ quantifying the minimal rate of probability accumulation of the conditional reward distributions, generalizing prior findings in the multisecretary setting.
  To achieve these results, we develop novel algorithmic analytical techniques. Drawing tools from the empirical processes theory, we establish strong concentration analysis of the solutions to random linear programs, leading to improved regret analysis under significantly relaxed assumptions. These techniques may find potential applications in broader online decision-making contexts.</description>

      <title>Characterisation of optimal solutions to second-order Beckmann problem through bimartingale couplings and leaf decompositions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.05683</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.05683v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We completely characterise the optimal solutions for the three-marginal optimal transport problem - introduced in [K. Bolbotowski, G. Bouchitt\'e, Kantorovich-Rubinstein duality theory for the Hessian, 2024, preprint], and whose relaxation is the second-order Beckmann problem - for arbitrary pairs $\mu,\nu\in\mathcal{P}_2(\mathbb{R}^n)$ of absolutely continuous measures with common barycentre such that there exists an optimal plan with absolutely continuous third marginal.
  In our work, we define the concept of bimartingale couplings for a pair of measures and establish several equivalent conditions that ensure such couplings exist. One of these conditions is that the pair is ordered according to the convex-concave order, thereby generalising the classical Strassen theorem. Another equivalent condition is that the dual problem associated with the second-order Beckmann problem attains its optimum at a $\mathcal{C}^{1,1}(\mathbb{R}^n)$ function with isometric derivative.
  We prove that the problem for $\mu,\nu$ completely decomposes into a collection of simpler problems on the leaves of the $1$-Lipschitz derivative $Du$ of an optimal solution $u\in\mathcal{C}^{1,1}(\mathbb{R}^n)$ for the dual problem. On each such, leaf the solution is expressed in terms of bimartingale couplings between conditional measures of $\mu,\nu$, where the conditioning is defined relative to the foliation induced by $Du$.</description>

      <title>Rendering Wireless Environments Useful for Gradient Estimators: A Zero-Order Stochastic Federated Learning Method</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.17460</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.17460v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Cross-device federated learning (FL) is a growing machine learning setting whereby multiple edge devices collaborate to train a model without disclosing their raw data. With the great number of mobile devices participating in more FL applications via the wireless environment, the practical implementation of these applications will be hindered due to the limited uplink capacity of devices, causing critical bottlenecks. In this work, we propose a novel doubly communication-efficient zero-order (ZO) method with a one-point gradient estimator that replaces communicating long vectors with scalar values and that harnesses the nature of the wireless communication channel, overcoming the need to know the channel state coefficient. It is the first method that includes the wireless channel in the learning algorithm itself instead of wasting resources to analyze it and remove its impact. We then offer a thorough analysis of the proposed zero-order federated learning (ZOFL) framework and prove that our method converges \textit{almost surely}, which is a novel result in nonconvex ZO optimization. We further prove a convergence rate of $O(\frac{1}{\sqrt[3]{K}})$ in the nonconvex setting. We finally demonstrate the potential of our algorithm with experimental results.</description>

      <title>Dual Interior Point Optimization Learning</title>

      <description>arXiv:2402.02596v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In many practical applications of constrained optimization, scale and solving time limits make traditional optimization solvers prohibitively slow. Thus, the research question of how to design optimization proxies -- machine learning models that produce high-quality solutions -- has recently received significant attention. Orthogonal to this research thread which focuses on learning primal solutions, this paper studies how to learn dual feasible solutions that complement primal approaches and provide quality guarantees. The paper makes two distinct contributions. First, to train dual linear optimization proxies, the paper proposes a smoothed self-supervised loss function that augments the objective function with a dual penalty term. Second, the paper proposes a novel dual completion strategy that guarantees dual feasibility by solving a convex optimization problem. Moreover, the paper derives closed-form solutions to this completion optimization for several classes of dual penalties, eliminating the need for computationally-heavy implicit layers. Numerical results are presented on large linear optimization problems and demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach. The proposed dual completion outperforms methods for learning optimization proxies which do not exploit the structure of the dual problem. Compared to commercial optimization solvers, the learned dual proxies achieve optimality gaps below $1\%$ and several orders of magnitude speedups.</description>

      <title>Optimal complexity solution of space-time finite element systems for state-based parabolic distributed optimal control problems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.10350</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.10350v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We consider a distributed optimal control problem subject to a parabolic evolution equation as constraint. The control will be considered in the energy norm of the anisotropic Sobolev space $[H_{0;,0}^{1,1/2}(Q)]^\ast$, such that the state equation of the partial differential equation defines an isomorphism onto $H^{1,1/2}_{0;0,}(Q)$. Thus, we can eliminate the control from the tracking type functional to be minimized, to derive the optimality system in order to determine the state. Since the appearing operator induces an equivalent norm in $H_{0;0,}^{1,1/2}(Q)$, we will replace it by a computable realization of the anisotropic Sobolev norm, using a modified Hilbert transformation. We are then able to link the cost or regularization parameter $\varrho&gt;0$ to the distance of the state and the desired target, solely depending on the regularity of the target. For a conforming space-time finite element discretization, this behavior carries over to the discrete setting, leading to an optimal choice $\varrho = h_x^2$ of the regularization parameter $\varrho$ to the spatial finite element mesh size $h_x$. Using a space-time tensor product mesh, error estimates for the distance of the computable state to the desired target are derived. The main advantage of this new approach is, that applying sparse factorization techniques, a solver of optimal, i.e., almost linear, complexity is proposed and analyzed. The theoretical results are complemented by numerical examples, including discontinuous and less regular targets. Moreover, this approach can be applied also to optimal control problems subject to non-linear state equations.</description>

      <title>Regret Bounds for Episodic Risk-Sensitive Linear Quadratic Regulator</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.05366</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.05366v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Risk-sensitive linear quadratic regulator is one of the most fundamental problems in risk-sensitive optimal control. In this paper, we study online adaptive control of risk-sensitive linear quadratic regulator in the finite horizon episodic setting. We propose a simple least-squares greedy algorithm and show that it achieves $\widetilde{\mathcal{O}}(\log N)$ regret under a specific identifiability assumption, where $N$ is the total number of episodes. If the identifiability assumption is not satisfied, we propose incorporating exploration noise into the least-squares-based algorithm, resulting in an algorithm with $\widetilde{\mathcal{O}}(\sqrt{N})$ regret. To our best knowledge, this is the first set of regret bounds for episodic risk-sensitive linear quadratic regulator. Our proof relies on perturbation analysis of less-standard Riccati equations for risk-sensitive linear quadratic control, and a delicate analysis of the loss in the risk-sensitive performance criterion due to applying the suboptimal controller in the online learning process.</description>

      <title>Computing Capacity-Cost Functions for Continuous Channels in Wasserstein Space</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.10670v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper investigates the problem of computing capacity-cost (C-C) functions for continuous channels. Motivated by the Kullback-Leibler divergence (KLD) proximal reformulation of the classical Blahut-Arimoto (BA) algorithm, the Wasserstein distance is introduced to the proximal term for the continuous case, resulting in an iterative algorithm related to the Wasserstein gradient descent. Practical implementation involves moving particles along the negative gradient direction of the objective function's first variation in the Wasserstein space and approximating integrals by the importance sampling (IS) technique. Such formulation is also applied to the rate-distortion (R-D) function for continuous source spaces and thus provides a unified computation framework for both problems.</description>

      <title>A Bias-Correction Decentralized Stochastic Gradient Algorithm with Momentum Acceleration</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.19082</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.19082v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Distributed stochastic optimization algorithms can simultaneously process large-scale datasets, significantly accelerating model training. However, their effectiveness is often hindered by the sparsity of distributed networks and data heterogeneity. In this paper, we propose a momentum-accelerated distributed stochastic gradient algorithm, termed Exact-Diffusion with Momentum (EDM), which mitigates the bias from data heterogeneity and incorporates momentum techniques commonly used in deep learning to enhance convergence rate. Our theoretical analysis demonstrates that the EDM algorithm converges sub-linearly to the neighborhood of the optimal solution, the radius of which is irrespective of data heterogeneity, when applied to non-convex objective functions; under the Polyak-Lojasiewicz condition, which is a weaker assumption than strong convexity, it converges linearly to the target region. Our analysis techniques employed to handle momentum in complex distributed parameter update structures yield a sufficiently tight convergence upper bound, offering a new perspective for the theoretical analysis of other momentum-based distributed algorithms.</description>

      <title>Online Scheduling for LLM Inference with KV Cache Constraints</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.07115</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.07115v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Large Language Model (LLM) inference, where a trained model generates text one word at a time in response to user prompts, is a computationally intensive process requiring efficient scheduling to optimize latency and resource utilization. A key challenge in LLM inference is the management of the Key-Value (KV) cache, which reduces redundant computations but introduces memory constraints. In this work, we model LLM inference with KV cache constraints theoretically and propose novel batching and scheduling algorithms that minimize inference latency while effectively managing the KV cache's memory.
  We analyze both semi-online and fully online scheduling models, and our results are threefold. First, we provide a polynomial-time algorithm that achieves exact optimality in terms of average latency in the semi-online prompt arrival model. Second, in the fully online case with a stochastic prompt arrival, we introduce an efficient online scheduling algorithm with constant regret. Third, we prove that no algorithm (deterministic or randomized) can achieve a constant competitive ratio in fully online adversarial settings. Our empirical evaluations on a public LLM inference dataset, using the Llama-70B model on A100 GPUs, show that our approach significantly outperforms benchmark algorithms used currently in practice, achieving lower latency while reducing energy consumption. Overall, our results offer a path toward more sustainable and cost-effective LLM deployment.</description>
