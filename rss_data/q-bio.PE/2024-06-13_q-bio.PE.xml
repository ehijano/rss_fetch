      <title>A conceptual predator-prey model with super-long transients</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.08163</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.08163v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Drawing on the understanding of the logistic map, we propose a simple predator-prey model where predators and prey adapt to each other, leading to the co-evolution of the system. The special dynamics observed in periodic windows contribute to the coexistence of multiple time scales, adding to the complexity of the system. Typical dynamics in ecosystems, such as the persistence and coexistence of population cycles and chaotic behaviors, the emergence of super-long transients, regime shifts, and the quantifying of resilience, are encapsulated within this single model. The simplicity of our model allows for detailed analysis, including linear analysis, reinforcing its potential as a conceptual tool for understanding ecosystems deeply. Additionally, our results suggest that longer lifetimes in ecosystems might come at the expense of reduced populations due to limited resources.</description>

      <title>Familiar biological, chemical and physical events credibly evolve the Standard Genetic Code</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.08302</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.08302v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The genetic code is profoundly shaped by an origin in ancient RNA-mediated interactions, needing an extended development to reach the Standard Genetic Code (SGC). That development can serially use RNA specificities, a ribonucleopeptide transition (RNPT), finally code escape and diaspora. An index of evolutionary plausibility based on least selection takes simultaneous account of speed and accuracy of evolution, identifying favored evolutions. Combining RNA world specificities allowed convergence of early coding to SGC assignments. Secondly, this was sufficient to launch a post-RNA-world RNPT. The RNPT allowed biosynthesis of complex amino acids, depending heavily on late code fusions between coexisting independent codes. Thirdly, escape from fluctuating, but highly-evolved codes of the RNPT applied a near-ideal selection for fastest-evolving and most accurate/useful genetic codes. Concurrently, a code and its microbial carrier suited to a free-living existence necessarily evolved. The established unity of life on Earth likely traces to SGC ascendancy during escape from the RNPT, and code diaspora.</description>
