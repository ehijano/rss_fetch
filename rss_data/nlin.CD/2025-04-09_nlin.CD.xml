      <title>Improving the prediction of spatio-temporal chaos by combining parallel reservoir computing with dimensionality reduction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.05512</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.05512v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Reservoir computers can be used to predict time series generated by spatio-temporal chaotic systems. Using multiple reservoirs in parallel has shown improved performances for these predictions, by effectively reducing the input dimensionality of each reservoir. Similarly, one may further reduce the dimensionality of the input data by transforming to a lower-dimensional latent space. Combining both approaches, we show that using dimensionality-reduced latent space predictions for parallel reservoir computing not only reduces computational costs, but also leads to better prediction results for small to medium reservoir sizes. This synergetic approach is illustrated and evaluated on the basis of the prediction of the one-dimensional Kuramoto-Sivashinsky equation.</description>

      <title>Laminar chaos in systems with random and chaotically time-varying delay</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.05944</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.05944v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A type of chaos called laminar chaos was found in singularly perturbed dynamical systems with periodically [Phys. Rev. Lett. 120, 084102 (2018)] and quasiperiodically [Phys. Rev. E 107, 014205 (2023)] time-varying delay. Compared to high-dimensional turbulent chaos that is typically found in such systems with large constant delay, laminar chaos is a very low-dimensional phenomenon. It is characterized by a time series with nearly constant laminar phases that are interrupted by irregular bursts, where the intensity level of the laminar phases varies chaotically from phase to phase. In this paper, we demonstrate that laminar chaos, and its generalizations, can also be observed in systems with random and chaotically time-varying delay. Moreover, while for periodic and quasiperiodic delays the appearance of (generalized) laminar chaos and turbulent chaos depends in a fractal manner on the delay parameters, it turns out that short-time correlated random and chaotic delays lead to (generalized) laminar chaos in almost the whole delay parameter space, where the properties of circle maps with quenched disorder play a crucial role. It follows that introducing such a delay variation typically leads to a drastic reduction of the dimension of the chaotic attractor of the considered systems. We investigate the dynamical properties and generalize the known methods for detecting laminar chaos in experimental time series to random and chaotically time-varying delay.</description>

      <title>Scaling Invariance: A Gateway to Phase Transitions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.06187</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.06187v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We explore the concept of scaling invariance in a type of dynamical systems that undergo a transition from order (regularity) to disorder (chaos). The systems are described by a two-dimensional, nonlinear mapping that preserves the area in the phase space. The key variables are the action and the angle, as usual from Hamiltonian systems. The transition is influenced by a control parameter giving the form of the order parameter. We observe a scaling invariance in the average squared action within the chaotic region, providing evidence that this change from regularity (integrability) to chaos (non-integrability) is akin to a second-order or continuous phase transition. As the order parameter approaches zero, its response against the variation of the control parameter (susceptibility) becomes increasingly pronounced (indeed diverging), resembling a phase transition. These findings could not be obtained without a seminal paper on Phys. Rev. Lett. {\bf 2004}, {\em 93}, 014101.</description>

      <title>Natural convection in a vertical channel. Part 3. Bifurcations of many (additional) unstable equilibria and periodic orbits</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.05524</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.05524v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Vertical thermal convection system exhibits weak turbulence and spatio-temporally chaotic behavior. In this system, we report seven equilibria and 26 periodic orbits, all new and linearly unstable. These orbits, together with four previously studied in Zheng et al. (2024) bring the number of periodic orbit branches computed so far to 30, all solutions to the fully non-linear three-dimensional Navier-Stokes equations. These new invariant solutions capture intricate flow patterns including straight, oblique, wavy, skewed and distorted convection rolls, as well as bursts and defects in rolls. Most of the solution branches show rich spatial and/or spatio-temporal symmetries. The bifurcation-theoretic organisation of these solutions are discussed; the bifurcation scenarios include Hopf, pitchfork, saddle-node, period-doubling, period-halving, global homoclinic and heteroclinic bifurcations, as well as isolas. Given this large number of unstable orbits, our results may pave the way to quantitatively describing transitional fluid turbulence using periodic orbit theory.</description>

      <title>The Work Capacity of Channels with Memory: Maximum Extractable Work in Percept-Action Loops</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.06209</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.06209v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Predicting future observations plays a central role in machine learning, biology, economics, and many other fields. It lies at the heart of organizational principles such as the variational free energy principle and has even been shown -- based on the second law of thermodynamics -- to be necessary for reaching the fundamental energetic limits of sequential information processing. While the usefulness of the predictive paradigm is undisputed, complex adaptive systems that interact with their environment are more than just predictive machines: they have the power to act upon their environment and cause change. In this work, we develop a framework to analyze the thermodynamics of information processing in percept-action loops -- a model of agent-environment interaction -- allowing us to investigate the thermodynamic implications of actions and percepts on equal footing. To this end, we introduce the concept of work capacity -- the maximum rate at which an agent can expect to extract work from its environment. Our results reveal that neither of two previously established design principles for work-efficient agents -- maximizing predictive power and forgetting past actions -- remains optimal in environments where actions have observable consequences. Instead, a trade-off emerges: work-efficient agents must balance prediction and forgetting, as remembering past actions can reduce the available free energy. This highlights a fundamental departure from the thermodynamics of passive observation, suggesting that prediction and energy efficiency may be at odds in active learning systems.</description>

      <title>Topological Approach for Data Assimilation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.18627</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.18627v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Many dynamical systems are difficult or impossible to model using high fidelity physics based models. Consequently, researchers are relying more on data driven models to make predictions and forecasts. Based on limited training data, machine learning models often deviate from the true system states over time and need to be continually updated as new measurements are taken using data assimilation. Classical data assimilation algorithms typically require knowledge of the measurement noise statistics which may be unknown. In this paper, we introduce a new data assimilation algorithm with a foundation in topological data analysis. By leveraging the differentiability of functions of persistence, gradient descent optimization is used to minimize topological differences between measurements and forecast predictions by tuning data driven model coefficients without using noise information from the measurements. We describe the method and focus on its capabilities performance using the chaotic Lorenz 63 system as an example and we also show that the method works on a higher dimensional example with the Lorenz 96 system.</description>

      <title>Impact of Network Heterogeneity on Neuronal Synchronization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.18922</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.18922v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Synchronization dynamics is a phenomenon of great interest in many fields of science. One of the most important fields is neuron dynamics, as synchronization in certain regions of the brain is related to some of the most common mental illnesses. To study the impact of the network heterogeneity in the neuronal synchronization, we analyze a small-world network of non-identical Chialvo neurons that are electrically coupled. We introduce a mismatch in one of the model parameters to introduce the heterogeneity of the network. Our study examines the effects of this parameter mismatch, the noise intensity in the stochastic model, and the coupling strength between neurons on synchronization and firing frequency. We have identified critical values of noise intensity, parameter mismatch, and rewiring probability that facilitate effective synchronization within the network. Furthermore, we observe that the balance between excitatory and inhibitory connections plays a crucial role in achieving global synchronization. Our findings offer insights into the mechanisms driving synchronization dynamics in complex neuron networks.</description>

      <title>Quantum trails and memory effects in the phase space of chaotic quantum systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.04310</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.04310v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The eigenstates of a chaotic system can be enhanced along underlying unstable periodic orbits in so-called quantum scars, making it more likely for a particle launched along one such orbits to be found still there at long times. Unstable periodic orbits are, however, a negligible part of the phase space, and a question arises regarding the structure of the wave function elsewhere. Here, we address this question and show that a weakly-dispersing dynamics of a localized wave packet in phase space leaves a "quantum trail" on the eigenstates, that is, makes them vary slowly when moving along trajectories in phase space, even if not periodic. The quantum trails underpin a remarkable dynamical effect: for a system initialized in a localized wave packet, the long-time phase-space distribution is enhanced along the short-time trajectory, which can result in ergodicity breaking. We provide the general intuition for these effects and prove them in the stadium billiard, for which an unwarping procedure allows us to visualize the phase space on the two-dimensional space of the page.</description>
