      <title>Robust chiral optical force via electric dipole interactions, inspired by a sea creature</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.13206</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.13206v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Inspired by a sea creature, we identify a robust chiral optical force that pushes the opposite enantiomers of a chiral molecule towards regions of orthogonal linear polarization in an optical field via electric dipole interactions. Our chiral optical force can be orders of magnitude stronger than others proposed to date and applies to essentially all chiral molecules, including isotopically chiral varieties which are notoriously difficult to separate using existing methods. We propose a realistic experiment supported by full numerical simulations, potentially enabling optical separation of opposite enantiomers for the first time.</description>

      <title>Ultra-Long-Range Bessel Beams via Leaky Waves with Mitigated Open Stopband</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.13338</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.13338v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Open stop-band (OSB) mitigation techniques are commonly used to improve the far-field radiating properties of leakywave antennas based on periodic structures. Recently, leaky waves have been proposed to focus energy in the near field through Bessel beams. However, the focusing character of Bessel beams is notably limited to a maximum distance known as the nondiffractive range. In this work, an OSB mitigation technique is originally exploited to significantly extend the nondiffractive range of a Bessel beam generated by a leaky-wave launcher in the microwave/millimeter-wave range. A comprehensive analysis of this device is presented, comparing the performance of the proposed launcher with the typical structure of a leaky-wave Bessel-beam launcher where the OSB is not suppressed. Theoretical results corroborated by full-wave simulations demonstrate that the proposed device, designed around 30 GHz, achieves an impressive nondiffractive range of approximately 25 m, which corresponds to 2500 vacuum wavelengths and to 50 times its aperture diameter of 50 cm. These results look particularly attractive for, e.g., near-field communications and wireless power transfer applications, where focusing energy in narrow spots and over large distances is a key factor.</description>

      <title>Experimental investigation of the uncertainty relation in pre- and postselected systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.13399</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.13399v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Uncertainty principle is one of the fundamental principles of quantum mechanics. Exploring such uncertainty relations in pre- and postselected (PPS) systems, where weak measurements on post-selected states have been used as a powerful tool for exploring the foundation of quantum mechanics, has so far eluded experimental effort. In this work, we experimentally investigate the Robertson-Heisenberg-type uncertainty relation for two incompatible observables in a PPS system. Through conducting a von Neumann-type measurement, uncertainty relations between two non-commuting Pauli observables are experimentally unveiled. Such uncertainty relations in the PPS system impose limitations on the joint sharp preparation of pre- and postselected states for two incompatible observables. Our experiments would be useful for the development of amplification techniques for precision measurements.</description>

      <title>A versatile method for nano-fabrication on diamond film: flexible diamond metasurfaces as a demonstration</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.13406</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.13406v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Diamond exhibits superb performance across a wide range of applications due to its enormous outstanding properties in electronic, photonic and quantum fields. Yet heterogeneous integration of diamond for on-chip functionalities, like 2D materials, remains challenging due to the hard acquisition of scalable, transferable and ultrathin diamond samples. Recently, the edge-exposed exfoliation has been demonstrated as an effective way to produce wafer-scale, freestanding and ultrathin diamond films. However, the incompatibility of the newly developed diamond film with conventional nano-fabrication methods makes it difficult to fabricate diamond film into practical devices. Herein, we demonstrate the mask-transferring by sugar as a versatile method for pattern-definition on diamond films, which shows excellent geometrical resolution and accuracy comparing to conventional approaches. Additionally, based on this method, the flexible all-diamond metasurfaces functioning as structural colors have been achieved, which indicates its huge potential for fabricating more diamond-related devices.</description>

      <title>Fluorescence enabled phonon counting in an erbium doped piezo-optomechanical microcavity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.13411</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.13411v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Converting phonons to photons with optomechanical interaction provides a pathway to realize single phonon counting, which is instrumental in the quantum applications of mechanical systems such as entanglement generation, thermometry, and study of macroscopic quantum phenomenon. In this process, the key requirement is high-extinction, narrowbandwidth, and stable filtering of the parametric optical pump. Here, we propose to lift this necessity by counting fluorescence emission from a rare earth embedded optomechanical cavity. By doing so, we show that an equivalent filtering effect can be achieved due to spectral hole burning and cavity Purcell effect. To demonstrate this, we designed, fabricated, and characterized an integrated piezo-optomechanical FabryPerot cavity on the erbium doped thin-film lithium niobate platform. By collecting fluorescence from the optomechanical sideband, we show that 93dB suppression of the pump can be achieved with 10dB loss of signal, resulting in an increase of 83dB in sidebandpump ratio. Our results facilitate a route to realize f ilterless single phonon counting and also create new opportunities to study the interaction between solid state emitters and mechanical systems.</description>

      <title>Unidirectional Raman emissions of Stokes photons via chiral atom-photon coupling in a ring cavity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.13433</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.13433v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The non-reciprocal (unidirectional) atom-photon couplings are crucial for modern photonics ranging from chiral quantum networks to cold-atom many-body physics. In the presented experiment, we demonstrated unidirectional Raman emission of Stokes photons from 87Rb atoms in a ring cavity. A bias magnetic field B0 is applied along z-direction on the atoms to define the quantum axis, which breaks the time inverse symmetry. By transversely applying write laser pulses to drive a \pi-transition of the atoms, we generate spontaneous Raman emissions of Stokes photons from a chiral (\sigma+) transition. The emissions are coupled into the clock-wise (z-direction) and counter-clock-wise (-z-direction) modes of a running-wave cavity, respectively. According to the mirror (parity) symmetry of the atom-light coupling, we demonstrated that spins (polarizations) of the Stokes fields are correlated with their propagation directions along z and -z -axis. The Stokes emissions constrained to the spin-momentum correlation are found to be violation of Kirchhoff's law of thermal radiation. Based on the correlation, we demonstrated that the Stokes emissions propagate along the clock-wise or counter-clock-wise via polarization dissipation. The directional factor is up to 1500:1.</description>

      <title>Single-exposure X-ray dark-field imaging via a dual-energy propagation-based setup</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.13451</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.13451v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: X-ray dark-field imaging visualises scattering from sample microstructure, and has found application in medical and security contexts. While most X-ray dark-field imaging techniques rely on masks, gratings, or crystals, recent work on the Fokker--Planck model of diffusive imaging has enabled dark-field imaging in the propagation-based geometry. Images captured at multiple propagation distances or X-ray energies can be used to reconstruct dark-field from propagation-based images but have previously required multiple exposures. Here, we show single-exposure dark-field imaging by exploiting the harmonic content in a monochromatised synchrotron beam and utilising an energy-discriminating photon-counting detector to capture dual-energy propagation-based images. The method is validated by filming time-varying samples, showing the advantage of the dark-field contrast in analysing dynamic evolution. We measure and adjust for the impact of detector charge-sharing on the images. This work opens the way for low-dose and dynamic dark-field X-ray imaging without the need for a high-stability set-up and precision optics.</description>

      <title>Spatial Optical Simulator for Classical Statistical Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.13476</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.13476v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Optical simulators for the Ising model have demonstrated great promise for solving challenging problems in physics and beyond. Here, we develop a spatial optical simulator for a variety of classical statistical systems, including the clock, $XY$, Potts, and Heisenberg models, utilizing a digital micromirror device composed of a large number of tiny mirrors. Spins, with desired amplitudes or phases of the statistical models, are precisely encoded by a patch of mirrors with a superpixel approach. Then, by modulating the light field in a sequence of designed patterns, the spin-spin interaction is realized in such a way that the Hamiltonian symmetries are preserved. We successfully simulate statistical systems on a fully connected network, with ferromagnetic or Mattis-type random interactions, and observe the corresponding phase transitions between the paramagnetic, and the ferromagnetic or spin-glass phases. Our results largely extend the research scope of spatial optical simulators and their versatile applications.</description>

Abstract: Optical angular momentum (OAM) in light beams is manifested as the two-dimensional spatial distribution of its complex amplitude, necessitating a 2D detector for its measurement.

      <title>Uncovering the Maximum Chirality in Dielectric Nanostructures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.13513</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.13513v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Maximum structural chirality refers to the highest selectivity for circularly polarized light (CPL) in nanostructures, often manifested as maximum circular dichroism (CD), optical rotation (OR), and spin-orbit coupling (SOC). However, the underlying physical mechanisms that lead to maximum chirality remain unclear. In this work, we demonstrate that maximum chirality in dielectric nanostructures arises from the constructive and destructive interference of multipole moments with different CPL. By employing generalized multipole decomposition, we introduce a generalized chiral multipole mechanism that allows for direct numerical calculation of CD and establishes the conditions required to achieve maximum chirality. This approach provides a comprehensive framework for analyzing chirality and serves as a foundation for future investigations of chiral nanostructures.</description>

      <title>Multiplexed Metasurfaces for Diffractive Optics via Phase Correlation Method</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.13531</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.13531v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The multiplexing capability of metasurfaces has been successfully demonstrated in applications such as holography and diffractive neural networks. However, identifying a suitable structure that simultaneously satisfies the phase requirements across multiple channels remains a significant challenge in many multiplexing design scenarios. In this study, we propose an innovative phase correlation method for metasurface multiplexing design that utilizes a multi-layer perceptron to establish phase correlations across multiple channels. This approach reduces the difficulty of multi-channel phase training by converting it into a simpler single-channel optimization task, thereby reducing design complexity and computational cost. Using the proposed method, we design a dual-wavelength multiplexed diffractive neural network and a multi-wavelength metasurface color holography under a linear polarization. The designed multiplexed metasurface achieves up to 90% classification accuracy in image recognition and exhibits good performance in color holography.</description>

      <title>Effective Medium Theory for Time-modulated Subwavelength Resonators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.13545</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.13545v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper provides a general framework for deriving effective material properties of time-modulated systems of subwavelength resonators. It applies to subwavelength resonator systems with a general form of time-dependent parameters. We show that the resonators can be accurately described by a point-scattering formulation when the width of the resonators is small. In contrast to the static setting, where this point interaction approximation yields a Lippmann-Schwinger equation for the effective material properties, the mode coupling in the time-modulated case instead yields an infinite linear system of Lippmann-Schwinger-type equations. The effective equations can equivalently be written as a system of integro-differential equations. Moreover, we introduce a numerical scheme to approximately solve the system of coupled equations and illustrate the validity of the effective equation.</description>

      <title>Decoherent Focusing Design and Advanced Passive Speckle Reduction for Laser Illumination Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.13869</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.13869v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: To effectively apply passive speckle reduction methods, it is essential to use an illumination system that maximally exploits the non-ideal temporal coherence and angular diversity (spatial coherence reduction) of laser light. This study examines the necessary conditions for these factors to act independently to achieve maximum speckle reduction. A novel design for decoherent focusing of laser illumination into a rectangular, uniformly lit spot is proposed. The design is based on an array of rectangular prisms of varying heights and a Fresnel lens comprising crossed 1D cylindrical Fresnel lenses with flat facets. Mathematical modelling demonstrates that such a lens can effectively focus a Gaussian beam into a rectangular uniform illuminated spot, even for lenses with a high numerical aperture (NA = 0.2). A planar implementation of this lens is also proposed. The comb-like spectrum of a laser diode is shown to limit the capabilities of passive methods, as it is challenging to generate a significant number of decorrelated laser sub-beams beyond the available spectral modes. Experimental results confirm that applying a slight modulation (~15%) to the laser diode current during intensity integration transforms the comb spectrum into a continuous one. This enables the generation of an unlimited number of decorrelated laser beams, independent of the laser's spectral modes, to achieve the desired number for a specific optical device.</description>

      <title>Nanogap-Engineered Core-Shell-Like Nanostructures for Comprehensive SERS Analysis</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.13882v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Development of fabrication protocols for large-area plasmonic nanostructures with sub-10 nm gaps with a spatially controlled distribution is critical for their real-world applications. In this work, we develop a simple, cleanroom-free protocol for the fabrication of macroscopic-sized plasmonic substrates (&gt;6 cm^2), featuring a tunable multi-resonance optical response and light concentration in sub-10 nm gaps. Critically, these gaps are free to interact with the surrounding medium. This architecture consists of non-periodically distributed dielectric nanospheres coated with a metal multilayer, forming semi-spherical core-shell-like nanostructures (CSLNs) surrounded by a planar film. The sub-10 nm gaps formed between metal caps and the planar film are easily tuned by adjusting fabrication parameters such as multimetal layer thickness, composition, or nanosphere size and density. The excellent structural homogeneity, wide optical tunability, and extreme light confinement in the spatially controlled subwavelength nanogaps make CSLN-based substrates an ideal platform for comprehensive surface-enhanced Raman scattering (SERS) spectroscopy. This is proven through a combination of numerical modeling and iterative fabrication/characterization, leading to the optimized substrates showing cutting-edge spatial uniformity down to 1.9% determined as the relative standard deviation (RSD) of the SERS signal of p-mercaptobenzoic acid for 225 spectra over 3600 {\mu}m^2 area. High sensitivity is evidenced by an enhancement factor of ~10^6. The proposed substrates also meet all other demanding criteria, including sufficient signal temporal stability (RSD &lt;4%), high substrate-to-substrate reproducibility (&lt;15%), and SERS activity towards three various analytes. The unique geometry and wide spectral tunability of the CSLN substrates will also be of great value for other plasmon-driven applications.</description>

      <title>Quantifying Stress States of Theoretically Modelled Polarimetric Measurements on Dielectric Media</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.13910</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.13910v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This work introduces and characterizes a theoretical model of a reflective polarimetric measurement technique determining the surface stress of a dielectric material, e.g. glass. We have developed a procedure to reconstruct the actual stress state, which is the orientation and value of the principal axes of stress, from the calculated Stokes vector components that would appear as polarization signals in a measurement. We consider a special geometry of the principle stress axis, where we chose one of them to be perpendicular to the surface and relaxed to a zero value. Our new approach of reconstructing surface stress states from reflected polarization states embraces the determination of the reflection M\"uller matrix. With that and an initial Stokes vector, the resulting reflected Stokes vector is calculated to create a database. The database represents the dependence of the resulting Stokes vector on the initial Stokes vector and the stress states included in the reflection matrix, which is iteratively calculated for several stress components and its orientations. Introducing a model for the dependency of the reflected Stokes vector components on the stress states and fitting it to the database results in a system of equations of those dependencies which are solved for the stress state components and orientation. Finally, we found a theoretical determination accuracy of the model for surface stress magnitude to be of the order of a few MPa.</description>

      <title>Ultra-directional and high-efficiency $\mu$LEDs via gradient index filled micro-Horn collimators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.14027</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.14027v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Micro-LEDs ($\mu$LEDs) are poised to transform AR/VR, display, and optical communication technologies, but they are currently hindered by low light extraction efficiency and non-directional emission. Our study introduces an innovative approach using a descending index multilayer anti-reflection coating combined with a horn collimator structure atop the $\mu$LED pixel. This design leverages the propagation of light outside the critical angle to enhance both the directionality and extraction efficiency of emitted light. By implementing either discrete or continuous refractive index gradients within the horn, we achieve a dramatic tenfold increase in light extraction within a $\pm$15$^\circ$ cone, with an overall light extraction efficiency reaching approximately 80%, where 31% of the power is concentrated within this narrow cone. This performance surpasses that of an optimized SiO2 half-ellipsoidal lens, which diameter and height is 24X and 26X larger than the pixel width respectively, while our design only slightly increases the device height and expands the final light escape surface to 3 times and roughly 4 times the pixel width respectively. Such efficiency, directionality enhancement, and compactness make this solution particularly suitable for high-resolution, densely packed $\mu$LED arrays, promising advancements in high-performance, miniaturized display systems.</description>

      <title>Combined selective plane illumination microscopy (SPIM) and full-field optical coherence tomography (FF-OCT) for in vivo imaging</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.14047</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.14047v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Selective plane illumination microscopy (SPIM), also known as light sheet fluorescence microscopy, provides high specificity through fluorescence labeling. However, it lacks complementary structural information from the surrounding context, which is essential for the comprehensive analysis of biological samples. Here, we present a high-resolution, multimodal imaging system that integrates SPIM with full-field optical coherence tomography (FF-OCT), without requiring modifications to the existing SPIM setup. Both SPIM and FF-OCT offer low phototoxicity and intrinsic optical sectioning, making them well-suited for in vivo imaging. Their shared detection path enables seamless and efficient co-registration of fluorescence and structural data. We demonstrate the functionality of this combined system by performing in vivo imaging of zebrafish larvae.</description>

      <title>Modulating Low-Power Threshold Optical Bistability by Electrically Reconfigurable Free-Electron Kerr Nonlinearity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.14082</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.14082v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose a microscopic mechanism to electrically reconfigure the Kerr nonlinearity by modulating the concentration of free electrons in heavily doped semiconductors under a static bias. Our theory incorporates electrostatic and hydrodynamic frameworks to describe the electronic dynamics, demonstrating electrically tunable linear and nonlinear modulations. The power threshold of achieving optical bistability shows unprecedented tunability over two orders of magnitude, reaching values as low as 10 $\mu$W through surface charge control. These findings offer new insights into understanding and actively controlling Kerr nonlinearities, paving the way for efficient refractive index engineering as well as the development of advanced linear and nonlinear electro-optical modulators.</description>

      <title>Optical Power Beaming in the Lunar Environment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.14083</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.14083v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The increasing focus on lunar exploration requires innovative power solutions to support scientific research, mining, and habitation in the Moon's extreme environment. Optical power beaming (OPB) has emerged as a promising alternative to conventional systems. However, the impact of lofted lunar dust (LLD) on optical transmissions remains poorly understood. This research addresses that gap by evaluating LLD-induced attenuation and optimizing OPB design for efficient power delivery over long distances. A combined theoretical and simulation-based approach is employed, utilizing the T-matrix method to model LLD attenuation and Gaussian beam theory to optimize transmission and receiver parameters. The results indicate that LLD significantly attenuates ground-to-ground optical power transmission in illuminated regions, thus making OPB more suitable in darker areas, such as permanently shadowed regions or during the lunar night. Furthermore, we demonstrate that OPB can operate over long distances on the Moon while maintaining reasonable aperture sizes through appropriate optical design optimizations. These findings highlight the potential of OPB as a reliable power solution for sustainable lunar exploration and habitation.</description>

      <title>Quantum fluid dimers of hyperbolic exciton-polariton condensates</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.14147</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.14147v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Coupled many-body quantum systems give rise to rich emergent physics and abundance of both stationary and dynamical behaviours. Designing platforms with tunable and distinct forms of coupling gives new insight into the collective behaviour of the dimerised quantum systems. Fundamentally, two systems can exchange particles through either forbidden or allowed channels, underpinning evanescent and ballistic coupling mechanisms, respectively. Based on proximity, the former leads to large spectral splitting that defines, for instance, chemical binding energies, whereas the latter pushes for stringent phase-matching and synchronicity between oscillating degrees-of-freedom, analogous to phase-coupled harmonic oscillators, with a significantly smaller impact on the energy landscape. Here, we demonstrate an all-optically tunable evanescent-ballistic quantum fluid dimer based on hyperbolic exciton-polariton condensates in a photonic crystal waveguide. By changing the angle of the polariton dimer relative to the grating, the system transitions from an evanescently-coupled molecule with large mode-splitting to a ballistic condensate dimer with strict phase-matching conditions and rich interference patterns. We directly measure the condensate spectral features and mass flow subject to a saddle dispersion relation, and connect our results to mean field theory. These results showcase the potential of photonic crystals to study condensed matter phenomena lying at the interface between delay-coupled nonlinear oscillators and tight binding physics.</description>

Abstract: We study one-dimensional optical wave turbulence described by the 1D Schr{\"o}dinger-Helmholtz model for nonlinear light propagation in spatially nonlocal nonlinear optical media such as nematic liquid crystals. By exploiting the specific structure of the nonlocal response, we derive a reduced wave kinetic equation under a semi-local approximation that permits the study of weak-wave turbulent cascades. We explore the realisability of the wave turbulence predictions and demonstrate new turbulent behaviour related to spatial nonlocality. Moreover, we show strong dependence of the wave turbulence to the possible presence of incoherent solitonic structures.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.13249v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The remarkable sensitivity of non-Hermitian systems has been extensively studied and stimulated ideas about developing new types of sensors. In this paper, we examine a chain of parametrically driven coupled resonators governed by the squeezed Su-Schrieffer-Heeger model. We emphasize the qualitative difference in sensor performance between configurations depending on bulk topology and boundary modes, specifically for detecting both on-site and non-Hermitian skin effect perturbations. Our analysis goes beyond the scenario of infinitesimal perturbations, extending to arbitrary perturbation strengths beyond the linear response regime. We stress the importance of optimizing the system's parameters to achieve quantum enhancement while avoiding fine-tuned regimes that could limit the practical applicability of this system for real-world quantum sensing.</description>

      <title>Optical Coherence Elastography Measures Mechanical Tension in the Lens and Capsule in situ</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.13262</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.13262v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Lens tension is essential for accommodative vision but remains challenging to measure with precision. Here, we present an optical coherence elastography (OCE) technique that quantifies both the tension and elastic modulus of lens tissue and capsule. This method derives mechanical parameters from surface wave dispersion across a critical frequency range of 1-30 kHz. Using isolated lenses from six-month-old pigs, we measured intrinsic anterior capsular tensions of 0-20 kPa and posterior capsular tensions of 40-50 kPa, induced by intra-lenticular pressure at the cortical surface. Young's modulus (E) was 1.9 MPa for anterior capsules and 1.2 MPa for posterior capsules. Tensions in cortical tissue (E ~ 10 kPa) were below 1 kPa. Biaxial zonular stretching (~4% strain) increased anterior capsular tension from near zero to 64 kPa. This acousto-optical method holds significant promise for diagnosing and managing accommodative dysfunctions through lens mechanics assessment in clinical settings.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.13718v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Controlling electron dynamics at optical clock rates is a fundamental challenge in lightwave-driven nanoelectronics. Here, we demonstrate ultrafast charge-state manipulation of individual selenium vacancies in monolayer and bilayer tungsten diselenide (WSe$_2$) using picosecond terahertz (THz) source pulses, focused onto the picocavity of a scanning tunneling microscope (STM). Using THz pump--THz probe time-domain sampling of the defect charge population, we capture atomic-scale snapshots of the transient Coulomb blockade, a signature of charge transport via quantized defect states. We identify back tunneling of localized charges to the tip electrode as a key challenge for lightwave-driven STM when probing electronic states with charge-state lifetimes exceeding the pulse duration. However, we show that back tunneling can be mitigated by the Franck-Condon blockade, which limits accessible vibronic transitions and promotes unidirectional charge transport. Our rate equation model accurately reproduces the time-dependent tunneling process across the different coupling regimes. This work builds on recent progress in imaging coherent lattice and quasiparticle dynamics with lightwave-driven STM and opens new avenues for exploring ultrafast charge dynamics in low-dimensional materials, advancing the development of lightwave-driven nanoscale electronics.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.13744v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Optical phase measurements play a key role in the detection of macroscopic parameters such as position, velocity, and displacement. They also permit to qualify the microscopic properties of photonic waveguides such as polarization mode dispersion, refractive index difference, and chromatic dispersion. In the quest for ever-better measurement performance and relevance, we report an original quantum non-linear interferometer based on a Sagnac configuration allowing precise, accurate, self-stabilized, and reproductible optical phase measurement. The potential of this system is demonstrated through the measurement of second-order dispersion, namely chromatic dispersion, of a commercial dispersion-shifted fiber at telecommunication wavelength. We assess precision by exhibiting a statistical error of $7.10^{-3}\, \%$, showing more that one order of magnitude compares to state-of-the-art measurements. Additionally, the accuracy of the second-order dispersion value is determined through the measurement of the third-order dispersion, showing a quadratic error as low as 5\,\%. Our system promises the development of photonic-based sensors enabling the measurements of optical-material properties in a user-friendly manner.</description>

Abstract: We present a framework for the efficient and accurate computation of resonance modes in photonic waveguides. The framework is based on AAA rational approximation with the application of special light sources. It allows one to calculate only relevant modes, such as the fundamental resonance modes localized in the central core of the waveguides. We demonstrate the framework using an example from the literature, a hollow-core photonic crystal fiber. This waveguide supports many other modes, such as cladding modes and higher-order modes. These nonrelevant modes are not calculated, so that challenging post-processing with mode filtering is not required.</description>

Abstract: The interference between two independent photons stands as a crucial aspect of numerous quantum information protocols and technologies. In this work, we leverage fiber-coupled devices, which encompass fibered photon pair-sources and off-the-shelf optics, to demonstrate Hong-Ou-Mandel interference. We employ two distinct single photon sources, namely an heralded single-photon source and a weak coherent laser source, both operating asynchronously in continuous-wave regime. We record two-photon coincidences, showing a state-of-art visibility of 91.9(5)\%. This work, compliant with telecom technology provides realistic backbones for establishing long-range communication based on quantum teleportation in hybrid quantum networks.</description>

Abstract: We obtain time-resolved spectra of spontaneous emission and resonance fluorescence of a single multilevel emitter where two antiparallel transitions interfere and cause quantum beats. After rising as a single broad peak, the spontaneous emission spectrum turns into a doublet of subnatural peaks and then fades for long times. For strong field resonance fluorescence, the beat signature is the formation of doublet sidebands, which initially grow asymmetrically but end up symmetrical. We stress the filter bandwidth's crucial role in the spectral resolution and causal evolution.</description>

Abstract: Achieving strong coherent interaction between qubits separated by large distances holds the key to many important developments in quantum technology, including new designs of quantum computers, new platforms for quantum simulations and implementation of large scale quantum optical networks. However, the inherent mismatch between the spatial dimensions of a quantum emitter and the photon wavelength fundamentally limits the transmission of quantum entanglement over long distances. Here we demonstrate, that long-range qubit entanglement can be readily achieved when qubit interactions are mediated by optical polariton waves in a hyperbolic material, due to the phenomenon of the Hyperbolic Super-Resonance. We show that in this regime the resulting quantum gate fidelity that exceeds 99%, can be achieved with the use of qubits based on well known deep donors in silicon when their interactions are mediated by polariton fields in the substrate formed by a hyperbolic material (such as e.g. hexagonal boron nitride. At the physical level the proposed system is essentially a silicon-based optoelectronic chip, and it's readily accessible to the existing methods of semiconductor nanofabrication, leading to the integration densities of well over 10^8. qubits/cm^2, and therefore opening the way to scalable and fault-tolerant error correction in quantum computation. Furthermore, we demonstrate that, due to the optical time scales that define the duration of the gate operation in the proposed system, and sub-nanosecond time of the decoherence in deep donors in silicon at the liquid nitrogen temperatures, the proposed Hyperbolic Quantum Processor does not require dilution refrigeration and therefore offers a pathway to bring quantum computation to the realm of conventional engineering.</description>

Abstract: The continuous growth in data volume has sparked interest in silicon-organic-hybrid nanophotonic devices integrated into silicon photonic integrated circuits (PICs). SOH devices offer improved speed and energy efficiency compared to silicon photonics devices. However, a comprehensive and accurate modeling methodology of SOH devices is lacking. While some preliminary modeling approaches for SOH devices exist, their reliance on theoretical and numerical methodologies, along with a lack of compatibility with electronic design automation (EDA), hinders their seamless and rapid integration with silicon PICs. Here, we develop a phenomenological, building-block-based SOH PICs simulation methodology spanning from the physics to the system level, offering high accuracy, comprehensiveness, and EDA-style compatibility. Our model is also readily integrable and scalable, lending itself to the design of large-scale silicon PICs. Our proposed modeling methodology is agnostic and compatible with any photonics-electronics co-simulation software. We validate this methodology by comparing experimentally demonstrated SOH microring modulators and Mach Zehnder modulators with those obtained through simulation, demonstrating its ability to model various modulator topologies. We also show our methodology's ease and speed in modeling large-scale systems. As an illustrative example, we use our methodology to design and study a 3-channel SOH MRM-based wavelength-division (de)multiplexer, a widely used component in various applications, including neuromorphic computing, data center interconnects, communications, and sensing. Our modeling approach is compatible with other materials exhibiting the Pockels and Kerr effects.

      <title>Photoacoustic Iterative Optimization Algorithm with Shape Prior Regularization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.00705</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.00705v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Photoacoustic imaging (PAI) suffers from inherent limitations that can degrade the quality of reconstructed results, such as noise, artifacts and incomplete data acquisition caused by sparse sampling or partial array detection. In this study, we proposed a new optimization method for both two-dimensional (2D) and three-dimensional (3D) PAI reconstruction results, called the regularized iteration method with shape prior. The shape prior is a probability matrix derived from the reconstruction results of multiple sets of random partial array signals in a computational imaging system using any reconstruction algorithm, such as Delay-and-Sum (DAS) and Back-Projection (BP). In the probability matrix, high-probability locations indicate high consistency among multiple reconstruction results at those positions, suggesting a high likelihood of representing the true imaging results. In contrast, low-probability locations indicate higher randomness, leaning more towards noise or artifacts. As a shape prior, this probability matrix guides the iteration and regularization of the entire array signal reconstruction results using the original reconstruction algorithm (the same algorithm for processing random partial array signals). The method takes advantage of the property that the similarity of the object to be imitated is higher than that of noise or artifact in the results reconstructed by multiple sets of random partial array signals of the entire imaging system. The probability matrix is taken as a prerequisite for improving the original reconstruction results, and the optimizer is used to further iterate the imaging results to remove noise and artifacts and improve the imaging fidelity. Especially in the case involving sparse view which brings more artifacts, the effect is remarkable. Simulation and real experiments have both demonstrated the superiority of this method.</description>

      <title>Photon transport through the entire adult human head</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.01360v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Optical brain imaging technologies are promising due to their relatively high temporal resolution, portability and cost-effectiveness. However, the highly scattering nature of near-infrared light in human tissue makes it challenging to collect photons emerging from more than 4 cm below the scalp, or with source-detector separation larger than several centimeters. We explore the physical limits of photon transport in the head and show that despite an extreme attenuation of ~10^(18), we can experimentally detect light that is transmitted diametrically through the entire adult human head. Analysis of various photon migration pathways through the head also indicates how the source-detector configuration can be used to isolate photons interacting with deep regions of the brain that are inaccessible with current optical techniques.</description>

      <title>Realization of joint weak measurement in classical optics using optical beam shifts</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.07440</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.07440v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Quantum weak measurements became extremely popular in classical optics to amplify small optical signals for fundamental interests and potential applications. Later, a more general extension, joint weak measurement has been proposed to extract weak value from a joint quantum measurement. However, the detection of joint weak value in the realm of classical optics remains less explored. Here, using the polarization-dependent longitudinal and transverse optical beam shift as a platform, we experimentally realize the quantum joint weak measurement in a classical optical setting. Polarization states are cleverly pre and post-selected, and different single and joint canonical position-momentum observables of the beam are experimentally extracted and subsequently analyzed for successful detection of complex joint weak value. We envision that this work will find usefulness for gaining fundamental insights on quantum measurements and to tackle analogous problems in optics.</description>

      <title>Nanoparticle doping as a way to enhance holmium fiber lasers efficiency</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.10593</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.10593v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Highly-doped holmium fibers have been prepared using modified chemical vapor deposition in combination with nanoparticle-doping method. Within a series of various Al2O3 and Ho3+ concentrations, relations between fibers composition and their fluorescence and laser parameters have been studied. Al/Ho molar ratio equal to at least 50 was found to be the key factor for fibers with outstanding parameters. Fibers with slope efficiency above 80%, laser threshold below 100 mW and fluorescence lifetime up to 1.6 ms have been prepared. Thanks to high Al2O3 concentrations, obtained through nanoparticle doping, we were able to achieve high-performance fibers in a wide range of Ho3+ concentrations. An output power of 19 W with 81% slope efficiency was reached using fiber with almost 4000 ppm of Ho3+ and 10 mol.% of Al2O3. This result is encouraging for highly efficient high-power cladding-pumped holmium fiber lasers, and studied relations between fibers composition and their laser parameters will be used in the designing of such laser sources.</description>

      <title>Enhanced Detection Rate and High Photon-Number Efficiencies with a Scalable Parallel SNSPD</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.15312</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.15312v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Since their inception, superconducting nanowire single-photon detectors have been enabling quantum optical applications and the rise of the photonic quantum industry. The evolution in the detector design and read-out strategies has led to the introduction of devices with a plurality of independent pixels, which have been able to operate with high system detection efficiency at high speed while also supporting photon number resolution capabilities. However, this comes at the cost of a complex readout that requires one coaxial cable for each pixel of the array. Here, we report a 28-pixel SNSPD with a dedicated parallel architecture that, while maintaining a simple readout with a single coaxial line, enables the detector to operate at high speed with low-performance degradation. The device shows a maximum single-photon efficiency of 88% and is able to maintain its efficiency above 50%, coupled with a timing jitter lower than 80 ps, up to a detection rate of 200 million counts per second. The detector also provides state-of-the-art photon-number-resolving performances with a 2-photon efficiency of 75% and a 3-photon efficiency of 62%.</description>

      <title>A Low-Temperature Tunable Microcavity featuring High Passive Stability and Microwave Integration</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.01857</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.01857v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Open microcavities offer great potential for the exploration and utilization of efficient spin-photon interfaces with Purcell-enhanced quantum emitters thanks to their large spectral and spatial tunability combined with high versatility of sample integration. However, a major challenge for this platform is the sensitivity to cavity length fluctuations in the cryogenic environment, which leads to cavity resonance frequency variations and thereby a lowered averaged Purcell enhancement. This work presents a closed-cycle cryogenic fiber-based microcavity setup, which is in particular designed for a low passive vibration level, while still providing large tunability and flexibility in fiber and sample integration, and high photon collection efficiency from the cavity mode. At temperatures below 10 Kelvin, a stability level of around 25 picometer is reproducibly achieved in different setup configurations, including the extension with microwave control for manipulating the spin of cavity-coupled quantum emitters, enabling a bright photonic interface with optically active qubits.</description>
