      <title>Planification d'observations sur t{\'e}lescope avec nuits incertaines</title>

Abstract: The observation of celestial objects is a fundamental activity in astronomy. Ground-based and space telescopes are used to gather electromagnetic radiation from space, allowing astronomers to study a wide range of celestial objects and phenomena, such as stars, planets, galaxies, and black holes. The European Southern Observatory (ESO) charges each night 83 kEUR (Milli et al. 2019), so the schedules of the telescopes are really important in order to optimize every second. Ground-based telescopes are affected by meteorological conditions, such as clouds, wind, and atmospheric turbulence. Accurate scheduling of observations in the presence of such uncertainties can significantly improve the efficiency of telescopes use and support from automated tools is highly desirable. In this paper, we study a mathematical approach for scheduling ground-based telescope observations under an uncertain number of clear nights due to uncertain weather and atmospheric conditions. The model considers multiple targets, uncertain number of nights, and various observing constraints. We demonstrate the viability and effectiveness of an approach based on stochastic optimization and reactive strategy comparing it against other methods.</description>

      <title>Community need for an Astrobiology Sample Repository and Sample Reference Suite</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.03813</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.03813v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: As we prepare for the next planetary mission charged with finding life beyond Earth, the Astrobiology community must continue to improve its understanding of what constitutes a biosignature, through the use of planetary analog samples. The study of these collected and generated samples is expanding our knowledge of what constitutes habitable environments, what life is capable of, and importantly, how to make biosignature detections within compositionally complex samples - aiding in the development of life detection instrumentation. And yet the full potential of these samples remains untapped. While the Astrobiology community possesses an incredible inventory of planetary analog samples, some incredibly precious, these are scattered across the country in individual freezers with varying degrees of documentation, curation practices, and contamination control. We, as a community, need to change the status quo of how we approach planetary analog research. One of the biggest actions we could take over the next 10 years to change that paradigm would be the creation of a sample repository for Astrobiology relevant materials, providing a centralized, well-curated, wealth of precious samples for the community. Such a collection would create a framework for material and meta-data submission that minimizes burden on the individual PIs, satisfying open data requirements; it would facilitate biosignature research, and aid in the creation of a robust life detection framework; support the development of a standardized sample reference suite for life detection instrumentation; and finally, aid in the development of techniques to be used for future sample return endeavors.</description>

      <title>Planetary World Coordinate System in Astropy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.03820</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.03820v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Different research communities are involved in planetary coordinate standardization. Geologists and Remote Sensing specialists work on extending Earth standards to Planets using Geographical Information Systems (GIS) and coordinate descriptions endorsed by the Open Geospatial Consortium (OGC). Astronomers work to define Virtual Observatory (VO) metadata and FITS World Coordinate System (WCS) for planetary bodies. In this proceeding the implementation of the planetary WCS description in Astropy is described. The related new features are available starting from Astropy 6.0. The current work is part of a broader effort involving other consortia (e.g., heliophysics for Solar or magnetospheric reference frames), and focuses on body-fixed frames to support surface and atmosphere studies.</description>

      <title>Probing the Firn Refractive Index Profile and Borehole Closure Using Antenna Response</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.03862</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.03862v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a methodology for extracting firn ice properties using S-parameter reflection coefficients (`$S_{11}$') of antennas lowered into boreholes. Coupled with Finite-Difference Time Domain (FDTD) simulations and calculations, a depth-dependent $S_{11}$ profile can be translated into a refractive index profile. Since the response of an antenna deployed into a dry borehole depends on the diameter of the hole, multi-year $S_{11}$ measurements also permit an estimate of borehole closure complementary to estimates based on calipers or other dedicated mechanical loggers. We present first results, based on data taken in August, 2024 from boreholes at Summit Station, Greenland. We estimate borehole closure resolution of $\mathbf{\sim 2}$mm and also derive an index of refraction profile consistent with previous measurements.</description>

      <title>The Bayesian Global Sky Model (B-GSM): A Calibrated Low Frequency Sky Model for EoR Applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.04503</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.04503v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present the Bayesian Global Sky Model (B-GSM), a new absolutely calibrated model of the diffuse Galactic foreground at frequencies below 408 MHz. We assemble a dataset of publicly available diffuse emission maps at frequencies between 45 MHz and 408 MHz, along with absolute temperature data from the EDGES radiometer between 40 and 200 MHz. We use nested sampling to perform a joint Bayesian analysis of these two datasets and determine posterior distributions of: spatially resolved diffuse components, spectral parameters for the diffuse emission, and calibration corrections for each observed map. Using Bayesian model comparison, we find that the low-frequency sky is optimally modelled by two emission components, each following a curved power-law spectrum. The spectrum for the first component has a spectral index of beta_1 = -2.633 plus/minus 0.002 and a curvature of gamma_1 = 0.014 plus/minus 0.001, while the second has beta_2 = -2.108 plus/minus 0.008 and gamma_2 = -0.424 plus/minus 0.008. The diffuse maps require temperature-scale corrections of 1% to 29%, and zero-level adjustments of a few kelvin to a few hundred kelvin. We find that the Haslam 408 MHz map is well calibrated, requiring a scale correction of 1.029 plus/minus 0.003 (about 3%) and a zero-level correction of 0.91 plus/minus 0.05 kelvin. Posterior predictions for the sky's absolute temperature are in excellent agreement with EDGES data, indicating accurate calibration. The posterior sky predictions agree with observations within statistical uncertainty across all frequencies. However, agreement varies by position, with the largest discrepancies in the Galactic plane. This is the second paper in the B-GSM series; the low-frequency sky model, along with all code and data, is available for download.</description>

      <title>The Kratos Framework for Heterogeneous Astrophysical Simulations: Ray Tracing, Reacting Flow and Thermochemistry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.04941</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.04941v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Thermochemistry, ray-tracing radiation, and radiation-matter interactions are important processes which are computationally difficult to model in astrophysical simulations, addressed by introducing novel algorithms optimized for heterogeneous architectures in the Kratos framework. Key innovations include a stoichiometry-compatible reconstruction scheme for consistent chemical species advection, which ensures element conservation while avoiding matrix inversions, and a LU decomposition method specifically designed for multi-thread parallelization in order to solve stiff thermochemical ordinary differential equations with high efficiency. The framework also implements efficient ray-tracing techniques for radiation transport for radiation-matter interactions. Various verification tests, spanning from chemical advection, combustion, Str\"omgren spheres, and detonation dynamics, are conducted to demonstrate the accuracy and robustness of Kratos, with results closely matching semi-analytic solutions and benchmarks such as Cantera and the Shock and Detonation Toolbox. The modular design and performance optimizations position it as a versatile tool for studying coupled microphysical processes in the diverse environments of contemporary astrophysical studies.</description>

      <title>The Short-spacing Interferometer Array for Global 21-cm Signal Detection (SIGMA): Design of the Antennas and Layout</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.04955</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.04955v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Numerous experiments have been designed to investigate the Cosmic Dawn (CD) and Epoch of Reionization (EoR) by examining redshifted 21-cm emissions from neutral hydrogen. Detecting the global spectrum of redshifted 21-cm signals is typically achieved through single-antenna experiments. However, this global 21-cm signal is deeply embedded in foreground emissions, which are about four orders of magnitude stronger. Extracting this faint signal is a significant challenge, requiring highly precise instrumental calibration. Additionally, accurately modelling receiver noise in single-antenna experiments is inherently complex. An alternative approach using a short-spacing interferometer is expected to alleviate these difficulties because the noise in different receivers is uncorrelated and averages to zero upon cross-correlation. The Short-spacing Interferometer array for Global 21-cm Signal detection (SIGMA) is an upcoming experiment aimed at detecting the global CD/EoR signal using this approach. We describe the SIGMA system with a focus on optimal antenna design and layout, and propose a framework to address cross-talk between antennas in future calibrations. The SIGMA system is intended to serve as a prototype to gain a better understanding of the system's instrumental effects and to optimize its performance further.</description>

      <title>SILVIA: Ultra-precision formation flying demonstration for space-based interferometry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.05001</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.05001v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose SILVIA (Space Interferometer Laboratory Voyaging towards Innovative Applications), a mission concept designed to demonstrate ultra-precision formation flying between three spacecraft separated by 100 m. SILVIA aims to achieve sub-micrometer precision in relative distance control by integrating spacecraft sensors, laser interferometry, low-thrust and low-noise micro-propulsion for real-time measurement and control of distances and relative orientations between spacecraft. A 100-meter-scale mission in a near-circular low Earth orbit has been identified as an ideal, cost-effective setting for demonstrating SILVIA, as this configuration maintains a good balance between small relative perturbations and low risk for collision. This mission will fill the current technology gap towards future missions, including gravitational wave observatories such as DECIGO (DECihertz Interferometer Gravitational wave Observatory), designed to detect the primordial gravitational wave background, and high-contrast nulling infrared interferometers like LIFE (Large Interferometer for Exoplanets), designed for direct imaging of thermal emissions from nearby terrestrial planet candidates. The mission concept and its key technologies are outlined, paving the way for the next generation of high-precision space-based observatories.</description>

      <title>Non-Smooth Multi-objective Controller Synthesis for Test-Mass Actuation in Gravitational-Wave Detectors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.05100</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.05100v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper proposes a non-smooth controller optimization method and shows the results of ongoing research on the implementation of this method for gravitational wave applications. Typical performance requirements concerning these type of suspensions are defined in terms of both H2- and Hinf-type constraints. A non-smooth optimization approach is investigated, which allows the use of non-convex cost functions that are often a result of mixed H2/Hinf optimization problems. Besides the controller, the distribution of the actuation is integrated with the optimization to investigate the feasibility of simultaneous controller and actuator optimization. The results demonstrate that the proposed non-smooth optimization method is able to find suitable solutions for the control and actuator distribution that satisfy all required performance and design constraints.</description>

      <title>Doppler Shifted Transient Sodium Detection by KECK/HIRES</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.03974</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.03974v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We carried out the first high-resolution transit observations of the exoplanet WASP-49 Ab with Keck/HIRES. Upon custom wavelength calibration we achieve a Doppler RV precision of $&lt;$ 60 {\mbox{${\rm m\,s}^{-1}$}}. This is an improvement in RV stability of roughly 240 {\mbox{${\rm m\,s}^{-1}$}} with respect to the instrument standard. We report an average sodium flux residual of $\Delta \mathcal{F}_{NaD}/ \mathcal{F}_{\star} (\lambda) \sim$ 3.2 $\pm$ 0.4 $\%$ (8.0 $\sigma$) comparable to previous studies. Interestingly, an average Doppler shift of -6.2 $\pm$ 0.5 {\mbox{${\rm km\,s}^{-1}$}} (12.4 $\sigma$) is identified offset from the exoplanet rest frame. The velocity residuals \textit{in time} trace a blueshift (v$_{\Gamma, ingress} \sim$ -10.3 $\pm$ 1.9 {\mbox{${\rm km\,s}^{-1}$}}) to redshift (v$_{\Gamma, egress} \sim$ +4.1 $\pm$ 1.5 {\mbox{${\rm km\,s}^{-1}$}}) suggesting the origin of the observed sodium is unlikely from the atmosphere of the planet. The average Na light curves indicate a depth of $\Delta \mathcal{F}_{NaD} /\mathcal{F}_{\star} (t) \sim$ 0.47 $\pm$ 0.04 \% (11.7 $\sigma$) enduring $\lesssim$ 90 minutes with a half-max duration of $\sim$ 40.1 minutes. Frequent high-resolution spectroscopic observations will be able to characterize the periodicity of the observed Doppler shifts. Considering the origin of the transient sodium gas is of unknown geometry, a co-orbiting natural satellite may be a likely source.</description>

      <title>Astrometric Parallax Measurements with JWST for Localization of Near-Earth Objects</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.04003</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.04003v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose the use of the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) in simultaneous observations with an Earth-based telescope for parallax measurements to tightly constrain the orbital trajectory of hazardous near-Earth objects (NEOs). We demonstrate the significant reduction in localization error with varying epochs of observation at the potential time-of-impact via a Monte Carlo simulated case study of 2024 YR4, an Apollo-type near-Earth asteroid. By leveraging the L2-Earth baseline and the considerable parallax angles formed, we highlight the unexplored potential for improved localization of NEOs through parallax observations with JWST.</description>

      <title>Unveiling the Coma Cluster Structure: From the Core to the Hubble Flow</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.04135</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.04135v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Coma cluster, embedded in a cosmic filament, is a complex and dynamically active structure in the local Universe. Applying a density-based member selection (dbscan) to data from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS), we identify its virilised core and zero-velocity boundary. Cross-correlating with the Cosmicflows-4 (CF4) catalogue enables a velocity-distance analysis, incorporating radial infall models and redshift-independent distance estimators. This reveals, for the first time, the Hubble flow surrounding Coma, a first step to investigate the entanglement between the dark matter in bound objects and the dark energy driving the expansion of their surroundings. The distance to the Coma centre is determined as $69.959 \pm 0.012 \, h^{-1}~\text{Mpc}$. From dbscan, we infer a virial radius of $r_{\rm vir} = \left(1.95 \pm 0.12\right)\,h^{-1}~\text{Mpc}$ and a turnaround of $r_{\rm ta} \geq 4.87~{h}^{-1}~\mbox{Mpc}$. Combining the SDSS redshifts with the CF4 distances, we estimate the Hubble constant to be $H_0 = (73.10 \pm 0.92)~\mbox{km}/\mbox{s}/\mbox{Mpc}$. However, with different calibrations for the distance moduli, $H_0$ varies between $[72, 80]$ km/s/Mpc. Mass estimates via caustics, the virial theorem, and the Hubble-flow method yield $M = [0.77, 2.0] \times 10^{15}\,h^{-1}\,M_{\odot}$, consistent with prior studies. Our systematic approach maps the structure of Coma into the local Hubble flow and shows the degeneracies between dynamical parameters such as the Hubble constant, the virial radius, and the total mass.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2504.04140v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The ability to accurately determine the rotation rate and spin axis of active satellites during deployment, during phases of uncertain operations (e.g. loss of control, potential fuel leaks) and particularly for defunct satellites to assess suitability of removal of space objects by active debris removal is increasingly important. Conventional techniques, such as optical photometry, face challenges in providing precise attitude information. In this work, we propose a tri-static ground-based satellite laser ranging (SLR) approach combined with three onboard laser retroreflectors for precise satellite attitude determination. Via this approach our method achieves true 3D triangulation of the reflectors' positions in space, enabling a highly accurate estimation of the satellite's attitude. This multi-station configuration overcomes limitations of existing single-station SLR techniques that rely on indirect inference, e.g. Fourier analysis of range residuals, or lead to multiple possible attitude solutions. We demonstrate through simulations that our approach can estimate the spin rate and axis of a satellite with high precision, on the order of 0.1 deg/sec and 1 deg, respectively. Notably, this can be done with data from only a single pass and does not require observation of a whole satellite rotation period. We show how the layout of retroreflectors are paramount to the effectiveness of the method. We provide placement strategies to maximize attitude determination performance to allow operators to incorporate retroreflectors effectively into their own satellites. These contributions lay the groundwork for a complete ground-based solution for attitude determination, significantly improving current methods and directly supporting ADR efforts.</description>

      <title>Simulations of coronal mass ejections on a young solar-type star and their detectability through coronal spectral observations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.04144</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.04144v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: There is a growing interest in searching for coronal mass ejections (CMEs) in other stellar systems because they are thought to be one of the important factors shaping planetary atmospheres. We investigated the possible spectral signatures related to stellar CMEs using magnetohydrodynamic simulations and spectral synthesis techniques. Blue wing enhancements of the synthetic coronal line profiles caused by the line-of-sight motion of plasma were observed during the simulated CME events. We included instrumental conditions in the spectral synthesis and tested the detectability of the asymmetries under different instrumental broadening conditions. The results show that blue wing asymmetries are visible in some EUV lines with spectral resolutions higher than around 2000, and the line-of-sight velocities of CMEs obtained from asymmetry analysis techniques are comparable to the CME velocities derived from three-dimensional model outputs. However, when the spectral resolution drops below 2000, the asymmetries in the blue wings become barely visible, but blue shifts in the line centroids with velocities around -100 to -200 km/s are observed. We suggest a method of using MHD simulation to synthesize line profiles and analyze their asymmetries which may help to guide future instrument design in terms of detecting stellar CMEs through Doppler shifts or asymmetries of coronal spectral lines.</description>

      <title>EclipseNETs: Learning Irregular Small Celestial Body Silhouettes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.04455</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.04455v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Accurately predicting eclipse events around irregular small bodies is crucial for spacecraft navigation, orbit determination, and spacecraft systems management. This paper introduces a novel approach leveraging neural implicit representations to model eclipse conditions efficiently and reliably. We propose neural network architectures that capture the complex silhouettes of asteroids and comets with high precision. Tested on four well-characterized bodies - Bennu, Itokawa, 67P/Churyumov-Gerasimenko, and Eros - our method achieves accuracy comparable to traditional ray-tracing techniques while offering orders of magnitude faster performance. Additionally, we develop an indirect learning framework that trains these models directly from sparse trajectory data using Neural Ordinary Differential Equations, removing the requirement to have prior knowledge of an accurate shape model. This approach allows for the continuous refinement of eclipse predictions, progressively reducing errors and improving accuracy as new trajectory data is incorporated.</description>

      <title>The GRINTA hard X-ray mission: an Explorer of the Transient Sky</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.04913v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The era of time domain multi-messenger (MM) astrophysics requires sensitive, large field-of-view (FoV) observatories that are able to quickly react in order to respond to alerts from gravitational wave (GW) triggers, neutrino detections, and transient sources from all parts of the electromagnetic (EM) spectrum. This is particularly true at hard X-rays and soft gamma-rays where the EM counterparts to GW triggers, gamma-ray bursts (GRBs), emit most of their flux. While the present decade has a number of instruments capable of accomplishing this task, there are no missions planned for the 2030's when improved MM facilities will detect many more events. It is in this context that we present the GRINTA mission concept. GRINTA has a large area, large FoV detector to search for short, impulsive events in the 20 keV - 10 MeV energy range and a coded mask telescope for localizing and performing follow-up observations of sources from 5-200 keV. While GRINTA's main scientific goal is studying MM events, the instruments will observe numerous other sources to explore the sky at hard X-rays/soft gamma-rays.</description>

      <title>Detecting relevant dependencies under measurement error with applications to the analysis of planetary system evolution</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.05055v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Exoplanets play an important role in understanding the mechanics of planetary system formation and orbital evolution. In this context the correlations of different parameters of the planets and their host star are useful guides in the search for explanatory mechanisms. Based on a reanalysis of the data set from \cite{figueria14} we study the as of now still poorly understood correlation between planetary surface gravity and stellar activity of Hot Jupiters. Unfortunately, data collection often suffers from measurement errors due to complicated and indirect measurement setups, rendering standard inference techniques unreliable.
  We present new methods to estimate and test for correlations in a deconvolution framework and thereby improve the state of the art analysis of the data in two directions. First, we are now able to account for additive measurement errors which facilitates reliable inference. Second we test for relevant changes, i.e. we are testing for correlations exceeding a certain threshold $\Delta$. This reflects the fact that small nonzero correlations are to be expected for real life data almost always and that standard statistical tests will therefore always reject the null of no correlation given sufficient data. Our theory focuses on quantities that can be estimated by U-Statistics which contain a variety of correlation measures. We propose a bootstrap test and establish its theoretical validity. As a by product we also obtain confidence intervals. Applying our methods to the Hot Jupiter data set from \cite{figueria14}, we observe that taking into account the measurement errors yields smaller point estimates and the null of no relevant correlation is rejected only for very small $\Delta$. This demonstrates the importance of considering the impact of measurement errors to avoid misleading conclusions from the resulting statistical analysis.</description>

      <title>CHIME/FRB Outriggers: Design Overview</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.05192v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Canadian Hydrogen Intensity Mapping Experiment (CHIME) has emerged as the world's premier facility for studying fast radio bursts (FRBs) through its fast transient search backend CHIME/FRB\@. The CHIME/FRB Outriggers project will augment this high detection rate of 2--3 FRBs per day with the ability to precisely localize them using very long baseline interferometry (VLBI). Using three strategically located stations in North America and deploying recently developed synoptic VLBI observing techniques, the Outriggers will provide $\sim 50$~milliarcsecond localization precision for the majority of detected FRBs. This paper presents an overview of the design and implementation of the Outriggers, covering their geographic distribution, structural design, and observational capabilities. We detail the scientific objectives driving the project, including the characterization of FRB populations, host galaxy demographics, and the use of FRBs as cosmological probes. We also discuss the calibration strategies available to mitigate ionospheric and instrumental effects, ensuring high-precision localization. With two stations currently in science operations, and the third in commissioning, the CHIME/FRB Outriggers project is poised to become a cornerstone of the FRB field, offering unprecedented insights into this enigmatic cosmic phenomenon.</description>

      <title>UK APAP R-matrix electron-impact excitation cross-sections for modelling laboratory and astrophysical plasma</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.05286v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Systematic R-matrix calculations of electron-impact excitation for ions of astrophysical interest have been performed since 2007 for many iso-electronic sequences as part of the UK Atomic Process for Astrophysical Plasma (APAP) network. Rate coefficients for Maxwellian electron distributions have been provided and used extensively in the literature and many databases for astrophysics. Here, we provide averaged collision strengths to be used to model plasma where electrons are non-Maxwellian, which often occur in laboratory and astrophysical plasma. We also provide for many ions new Maxwellian-averaged collision strengths which include important corrections to the published values. The H- and He-like atomic data were recently made available in Mao+(2022). Here, we provide data for ions of the Li-, Be-, B-, C-, N-, O-, Ne-, Na-, and Mg-like sequences.</description>

      <title>The first Palomar Gattini-IR catalog of J-band light curves: construction and public data release</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.01720v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Palomar Gattini-IR (PGIR) is a wide-field, synoptic infrared time domain survey covering $\approx 15000$\,sq.\,deg. of the \textbf{accessible} sky at $\approx 1-3$\,night cadence to a depth of $J\approx 13.0$ and $\approx 14.9$\,Vega mag in and outside the Galactic plane, respectively. Here, we present the first data release of $J$-band light curves of 2MASS sources within the survey footprint covering approximately the first four years of operations. We describe the construction of the source catalog based on 2MASS point sources, followed by exposure filtering criteria and forced PSF photometry. The catalog contains light curves of $\approx 286$\,million unique sources with 2MASS magnitudes of $J &lt; 15.5$\,mag, with a total of $\approx 50$\,billion photometric measurements and $\approx 20$\,billion individual source detections at signal-to-noise-ratio $&gt; 3$. We demonstrate the photometric fidelity of the catalog by i) quantifying the magnitude-dependent accuracy and uncertainty of the photometry with respect to 2MASS and ii) comparing against forced PGIR aperture photometry for known variable sources. We present simple filtering criteria for selecting reliable photometric measurements as well as example \texttt{Python} notebooks for users. This catalog is textbf{one of} the largest compilation of nightly cadence, synoptic infrared light curves to date, comparable to those in the largest optical surveys, providing a stepping stone to upcoming infrared surveys in the coming decade.</description>

      <title>On-sky demonstration of an ultra-fast intensity interferometry instrument utilizing hybrid single photon counting detectors</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.08173v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Intensity interferometry is a reemerging astronomical technique for performing high angular resolution studies at visible wavelengths, benefiting immensely from the recent improvements in (single) photon detection instrumentation. We developed an ultra-fast, single photon counting and highly stable intensity interferometry instrument for 1 m class optical telescopes. The instrument records on sky the expected stellar photon rates and reaches the temporal coherence times as measured in the laboratory. In addition, all components, especially the photon detection hardware, of the instrument are easily upgradeable with custom hardware currently being developed. The collimated telescope output is spectrally filtered via an ultra narrow band pass of 2 nm at a central wavelength of 405 nm. We use hybrid photon detectors (HPDs) for single photon detection and a constant fraction discriminator (CFD) for signal conditioning. A time to digital converter (TDC) is used for time stamping. The combination of HPDs and CFDs is optimized for large active area and high timing resolution. We successfully measured photon bunching of three bright A-type stars - Vega, Altair and Deneb at the 1.04 m Omicron telescope of C2PU at the Calern Observatory in the south of France. In all cases the observed coherence time fits well to both the pre-calculated expectations as well as the values measured in preceding laboratory tests. We obtained the previously estimated photon count rates at the telescope and achieved highly stable coupling of the star light to the detectors. Utilizing a new class of large area single photon detectors based on multichannel plate amplification, high resolution spatial intensity interferometry experiments are within reach at 1 m diameter class telescopes within one night of observation time for bright stars.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.13064v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: At frequencies below 1 Hz, fluctuations in atmospheric emission in the Chajnantor region in northern Chile are the primary source of interference for bolometric millimeter-wave observations. This paper focuses on characterizing these fluctuations using measurements from the Atacama Cosmology Telescope (ACT) and the Atacama Pathfinder Experiment (APEX) water vapor radiometer. We show that the total precipitable water vapor (PWV) is not in general an accurate estimator of the level of fluctuations in millimeter-wave atmospheric emission. We also show that the microwave frequency spectrum of atmospheric fluctuations is in good agreement with predictions by the am code for frequency bands above 90 GHz. We introduce a new method for separating atmospheric and systematic fluctuations, allowing us to fit a robust atmospheric flatfield, as well as to study in the atmosphere in greater detail than previous works. We present a direct measurement of the temporal outer scale of turbulence of $\tau_0\approx50$ s corresponding to a spatial scale of $L_0\approx500$ m. Lastly, we show the variance of fluctuations in ACT's mm-wave bands correlate with the variance of fluctuations in PWV measured by APEX, even though the observatories are $6$ km apart and observe different lines of sight.</description>

Abstract: This paper presents the development and characterization of a fiber laser hydrophone designed for deep-sea applications, with a focus on detecting neutrino interactions via their acoustic signatures. The hydrophone design includes a static pressure compensation mechanism, ensuring reliable operation at depths exceeding 1 km. The performance of the hydrophone was evaluated through laboratory tests and experiments in an anechoic basin, where its transfer function was measured before and after a 140-bar pressure cycle. The results show that the hydrophone maintains its sensitivity, with resonance peaks identified in both low- and high-frequency ranges. The hydrophone's sensitivity to acoustic signals was also compared to ambient sea state noise levels, demonstrating compatibility with the lowest noise conditions.</description>

      <title>Joint multiband deconvolution for Euclid and Vera C. Rubin images</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.17177</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.17177v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: With the advent of surveys like Euclid and Vera C. Rubin, astrophysicists will have access to both deep, high-resolution images and multiband images. However, these two types are not simultaneously available in any single dataset. It is therefore vital to devise image deconvolution algorithms that exploit the best of both worlds and that can jointly analyze datasets spanning a range of resolutions and wavelengths. In this work we introduce a novel multiband deconvolution technique aimed at improving the resolution of ground-based astronomical images by leveraging higher-resolution space-based observations. The method capitalizes on the fortunate fact that the Rubin $r$, $i$, and $z$ bands lie within the Euclid VIS band. The algorithm jointly de-convolves all the data to convert the $r$-, $i$-, and $z$-band Rubin images to the resolution of Euclid by leveraging the correlations between the different bands. We also investigate the performance of deep-learning-based denoising with DRUNet to further improve the results. We illustrate the effectiveness of our method in terms of resolution and morphology recovery, flux preservation, and generalization to different noise levels. This approach extends beyond the specific Euclid-Rubin combination, offering a versatile solution to improving the resolution of ground-based images in multiple photometric bands by jointly using any space-based images with overlapping filters.</description>

      <title>Validation of straight-line signal propagation for radio signal of very inclined cosmic ray air showers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.06388</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.06388v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: An ongoing challenge for radio-based detectors of high-energy cosmic particles is the accurate description of radio signal propagation in natural nonuniform media. For radio signals originating from extensive air showers, the current state of the art simulations often implicitly assume straight-line signal propagation. The refraction due to a nonuniform atmosphere is however expected to have an effect on the received signal and associated reconstruction. This effect is currently not completely understood for the most inclined geometries. Here, we present a study regarding the validity of straight-line signal propagation when simulating radio emission associated with very inclined air shower geometries. To this end, the calculation of the electric field based on the end point formalism used in CoREAS was improved by use of tabulated ray tracing data. We find a difference of 2% in radiation energy and a difference of O(0.01{\deg}) on direction reconstruction when working at frequencies below 600 MHz. We thus find that, for frequencies up to 600 MHz and zenith angles up to 88{\deg}, the current straight-line based simulation approaches are accurate.</description>

Abstract: Searches for variations of fundamental constants require a comprehensive understanding of measurement errors. This paper examines a source of error that is usually overlooked: the impact of continuum placement error. We investigate the problem using a high resolution, high signal to noise spectrum of the white dwarf G191$-$B2B. Narrow photospheric absorption lines allow us to search for new physics in the presence of a gravitational field approximately $10^4$ times that on Earth. Modelling photospheric lines requires knowing the underlying spectral continuum level. We describe the development of a fully automated, objective, and reproducible continuum estimation method. Measurements of the fine structure constant are produced using several continuum models. The results show that continuum placement variations result in small systematic shifts in the centroids of narrow photospheric absorption lines which impact significantly on fine structure constant measurements. This effect should therefore be included in the error budgets of future measurements. Our results suggest that continuum placement variations should be investigated in other contexts, including fine structure constant measurements in stars other than white dwarfs. The analysis presented here is based on NiV absorption lines in the photosphere of G191$-$B2B. Curiously, the inferred measurement of the fine structure constant obtained in this paper using NiV (the least negative of our measurements is $\Delta\alpha/\alpha = -1.462 \pm 1.121 \times 10^{-5}$) is inconsistent with the most recent previous G191$-$B2B photospheric measurement using FeV ($\Delta\alpha/\alpha = 6.36 \pm 0.35_{stat} \pm 1.84_{sys} \times 10^{-5}$). Given both measurements are derived from the same spectrum, we presume (but in this work are unable to check) that this 3.2$\sigma$ difference results from unknown laboratory wavelength systematics.</description>

      <title>JWST-TST High Contrast: Living on the Wedge, or, NIRCam Bar Coronagraphy Reveals CO$_2$ in the HR 8799 and 51 Eri Exoplanets' Atmospheres</title>

Abstract: High-contrast observations with JWST can reveal key composition and vertical mixing dependent absorption features in the spectra of directly imaged planets across the 3-5 $\mu$m wavelength range. We present novel coronagraphic images of the HR 8799 and 51 Eri planetary systems using the NIRCam Long Wavelength Bar in an offset "narrow" position. These observations have revealed the four known gas giant planets encircling HR 8799, even at spatial separations challenging for a 6.5 m telescope in the mid-infrared, including the first ever detection of HR 8799 e at 4.6 $\mu$m. The chosen filters constrain the strength of CO, CH4, and CO2 absorption in each planet's photosphere. The planets display a diversity of 3-5 $\mu$m colors that could be due to differences in composition and ultimately be used to trace their formation history. They also show stronger CO2 absorption than expected from solar metallicity models, indicating that they are metal enriched. We detected 51 Eri b at 4.1 $\mu$m and not at longer wavelengths, which, given the planet's temperature, is indicative of out-of-equilibrium carbon chemistry and an enhanced metallicity. Updated orbits fit to the new measurement of 51 Eri b validate previous studies that find a preference for high eccentricities ($e{=}0.57_{-0.09}^{+0.03}$), which likely indicates some dynamical processing in the system's past. These results present an exciting opportunity to model the atmospheres and formation histories of these planets in more detail in the near future, and are complementary to future higher-resolution, continuum-subtracted JWST spectroscopy.</description>

      <title>Long-Baseline Atom Interferometry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.21366</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.21366v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Long-baseline atom interferometry is a promising technique for probing various aspects of fundamental physics, astrophysics and cosmology, including searches for ultralight dark matter (ULDM) and for gravitational waves (GWs) in the frequency range around 1~Hz that is not covered by present and planned detectors using laser interferometry. The MAGIS detector is under construction at Fermilab, as is the MIGA detector in France. The PX46 access shaft to the LHC has been identified as a very suitable site for an atom interferometer of height $\sim 100$m, sites at the Boulby mine in the UK and the Canfranc Laboratory are also under investigation, and possible sites for km-class detectors have been suggested. The Terrestrial Very-Long-Baseline Atom Interferometry (TVLBAI) Proto-Collaboration proposes a coordinated programme of interferometers of increasing baselines.</description>
