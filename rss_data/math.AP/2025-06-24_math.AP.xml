      <title>Spectral asymptotics of pseudodifferential operators with discontinuous symbols</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.17426</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.17426v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study discrete spectrum of self-adjoint Weyl pseudodifferential operators with discontinuous symbols of the form $1_\Omega \phi$ where $1_\Omega$ is the indicator of a domain in $\Omega\subset\mathbb R^2$, and $\phi\in C^\infty_0(\mathbb R^2)$ is a real-valued function. It was known that in general, the singular values $s_k$ of such an operator satisfy the bound $s_k = O(k^{-3/4})$, $k = 1, 2, \dots$. We show that if $\Omega$ is a polygon, the singular values decrease as $O(k^{-1}\log k)$. In the case where $\Omega$ is a sector, we obtain an asymptotic formula which confirms the sharpness of the above bound.
  Our main technical tool is the reduction to another symbol that we call \textit{dual}, which is automatically smooth. To analyse the dual symbol we find new bounds for singular values of pseudodifferential operators with smooth symbols in $L^2(\mathbb R^d)$ for arbitrary dimension $d\ge 1$.</description>

      <title>On Vanishing Viscosity with Inflow, Outflow</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.17430</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.17430v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We establish convergence as the viscosity vanishes of solutions of the Navier-Stokes equations to a solution of the Euler equations for inflow, outflow boundary conditions. We extend the approach of Temam and Wang 2002, allowing the tangential component on outflow to be nonzero.</description>

      <title>Evolution Equations on Manifolds with Conical Singularities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.17481</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.17481v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This is an introduction to the analysis of nonlinear evolution equations on manifolds with conical singularities via maximal regularity techniques. We address the specific difficulties due to the singularities, in particular the choice of extensions of the conic Laplacian that guarantee the existence of a bounded $H_\infty$-calculus. We introduce the relevant technical tools and survey, as main examples, applications to the porous medium equation, the fractional porous medium equation, the Yamabe flow, and the Cahn-Hilliard equation.</description>

      <title>A new infinite-dimensional Linking theorem with application to a system of coupled Poisson equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.17563</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.17563v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Using the minimax technique from the critical point theory, which consists in constructing or transforming a suitable class of applications such that a critical value $c$ of a functional $f$ can be characterized as a minimax value over this class, we establish a new natural infinite-dimensional linking theorem for strongly indefinite functionals by using the $\tau-$topology of Kryszewski and Szulkin. Our result is a generalization of the classical linking theorem \cite[Theorem 2.21]{Wi}. As an application, we obtain the existence of a nontrivial solution to a system of coupled Poisson equations.</description>

      <title>Lipschitz regularity of weakly coupled vectorial almost-minimizers for Alt-Caffarelli functionals in Orlicz spaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.17616</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.17616v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: For a fixed constant $\lambda &gt; 0$ and a bounded Lipschitz domain $\Omega \subset \mathbb{R}^n$ with $n \geq 2$, we establish that almost-minimizers (functions satisfying a sort of variational inequality) of the Alt-Caffarelli type functional \[ \mathcal{J}_G({\bf v};\Omega) \coloneqq \int_\Omega \left(\sum_{i=1}^mG\big(|\nabla v_i(x)|\big) + \lambda \chi_{\{|{\bf v}|&gt;0\}}(x)\right) dx , \] where ${\bf v} = (v_1, \dots, v_m)$ and $m \in \mathbb{N}$, exhibit optimal Lipschitz continuity on compact subsets of $\Omega$, where $G$ is a Young function satisfying specific growth conditions. Furthermore, we obtain universal gradient estimates for non-negative almost-minimizers in the interior of non-coincidence sets. %{\color{blue}Furthermore, under the additional convexity assumption on $G$, we address the problem of boundary Lipschitz regularity for $v$ by adopting a fundamentally different analytical approach.} Notably, this method also provides an alternative proof of the optimal local Lipschitz regularity in the domain's interior. Our work extends the recent regularity results for weakly coupled vectorial almost-minimizers for the $p$-Laplacian addressed in \cite{BFS24}, and even the scalar case treated in \cite{daSSV}, \cite{DiPFFV24} and \cite{PelegTeix24}, thereby providing new insights and approaches applicable to a variety of non-linear one or two-phase free boundary problems with non-standard growth.</description>

      <title>Entropy decrease and emergence of order in collective dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.17635</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.17635v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the hydrodynamic description of collective dynamics driven by velocity {\it alignment}. It is known that such Euler alignment systems must flock towards a limiting ``flocking'' velocity, provided their solutions remain globally smooth. To address this question of global existence we proceed in two steps. (i) Entropy and closure. The system lacks a closure, reflecting lack of detailed energy balance in collective dynamics. We discuss the decrease of entropy and the asymptotic behavior towards a mono-kinetic closure; and (ii) Mono-kinetic closure. We prove that global regularity persists for all time for a large class of initial conditions satisfying a critical threshold condition, which is intimately linked to the decrease of entropy. The result applies in any number of spatial dimensions, thus addressing the open question of existence beyond two dimensions.</description>

      <title>Simultaneous Identification of Coefficients and Source in a Subdiffusion Equation from One Passive Measurement</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.17648</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.17648v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This article is devoted to the detection of parameters in anomalous diffusion from a single passive measurement. More precisely, we consider the simultaneous identification of coefficients as well as a time-dependent source term appearing in a time-fractional diffusion equation from a single boundary or internal passive measurement. We obtain several uniqueness results in dimension one as well as a multidimensional extension under some symmetry assumptions. Our analysis relies on spectral representation of solutions, complex and harmonic analysis combined with some known inverse spectral results for Sturm-Liouville operators. The theoretical results are complemented by a corresponding reconstruction algorithm and numerical simulations.</description>

      <title>On Growth of Sobolev norms for cubic Schr\"odinger equation with harmonic potential in dimensions $d=2,3$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.17731</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.17731v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this article, we study the growth of higher-order Sobolev norms for solutions to the defocusing cubic nonlinear Schr\"odinger equation with harmonic potential in dimensions $d=2,3$, \begin{align}\label{PNLS} \begin{cases}\tag{PNLS} i\partial_tu-Hu=|u|^{2}u,&amp;(t,x)\in\mathbb{R}\times\mathbb{R}^d,\\ u(0,x)=u_0(x), \end{cases} \end{align} where $H=-\Delta+|x|^2$. Motivated by Planchon-Tzvetkov-Visciglia [Rev. Mat. Iberoam., 39 (2023), 1405-1436], we first establish the bilinear Strichartz estimates, which removes the $\varepsilon$-loss of Burq-Poiret-Thomann [Preprint, arXiv: 2304.10979]. To show the polynomial growth of Sobolev norm, our proof relies on the upside-down $I$-method associated to the harmonic oscillator. Due to the lack of Fourier transform or expansion, we need to carefully control the freqeuncy interaction of the type "high-high-low-low". To overcome this difficulty, we establish the explicit interaction for products of eigenfunctions. Our bound covers the result of Planchon-Tzvetkov-Visciglia [Rev. Mat. Iberoam., 39 (2023), 1405-1436] in dimension two and is new in dimension three.</description>

      <title>Diffusion-free boundary conditions for the Navier-Stokes equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.17749</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.17749v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We provide a mathematical analysis of the `diffusion-free' boundary conditions recently introduced by Lin and Kerswell for the numerical treatment of inertial waves in a fluid contained in a rotating sphere. We consider here the full setting of the nonlinear Navier-Stokes equation in a general bounded domain $\Omega$ of $\mathbb{R}^d$, $d=2$ or $3$. We show that diffusion-free boundary conditions $$ \Delta u \cdot \tau \vert_{\partial \Omega} = 0, \quad u \cdot n\vert_{\partial \Omega} = 0 \quad \text{ when } d=2, $$ $$ \Delta u \times n\vert_{\partial \Omega} = 0, \quad u \cdot n\vert_{\partial \Omega} = 0 \quad \text{ when } d=3, $$
  allow for a satisfactory well-posedness theory of the full Navier-Stokes equations (global in time for $d=2$, local for $d=3$). Moreover, we perform a boundary layer analysis in the limit of vanishing viscosity $\nu \rightarrow 0$. We establish that the amplitude of the boundary layer flow is in this case of order $\nu$, i.e. much lower than in the case of standard Dirichlet or even stress-free conditions. This confirms analytically that this choice of boundary conditions may be used to reduce diffusive effects in numerical studies relying on the Navier-Stokes equation to approach nearly inviscid solutions.</description>

      <title>Berezin-Li-Yau inequality for mixed local-nonlocal Dirichlet-Laplacian</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.17780</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.17780v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we consider an eigenvalue problem for mixed local-nonlocal Laplacian $$\mathcal{L}^{a,b}_{\Om}:=-a\Delta+b(-\Delta)^s,\,a&gt;0,\,b\in\mathbb{R},\,s\in (0,1),$$ with Dirichlet boundary conditions. First, the case $a&gt;0$ and $b&gt;0$ is considered and the Berezin-Li-Yau inequality (lower bounds of the sum of eigenvalues) is established. This inequality is characterised as the maximum of the classical and fractional versions of the Berezin-Li-Yau inequality, and, in particular, yields both the classical and fractional forms of the Berezin-Li-Yau inequality. Next, we consider the case $a&gt;0$ and $-\frac{a}{C_E}&lt;b&lt;0$, where $C_E\geq 1$ is the constant of the continuous embedding $H_{0}^{1}(\Om)\subset H_{0}^{s}(\Om)$. In this setting, we also derive the Berezin-Li-Yau inequality, which explicitly depends on the constant $C_E$.</description>

      <title>Low regularity well-posedness of nonlocal dispersive perturbations of Burgers' equation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.17801</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.17801v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider the Cauchy problem associated to a class of dispersive perturbations of Burgers' equations, which contains the low dispersion Benjamin-Ono equation, (also known as low dispersion fractional KdV equation), $$ \partial_tu-D_x^{\alpha}\partial_xu=\partial_x(u^2) \, ,$$ and prove that it is locally well-posed in $H^s(\mathbb K)$, $\mathbb K=\mathbb R$ or $\mathbb T$, for $s&gt;s_{\alpha}$, where \begin{equation*} s_\alpha=\begin{cases}
  1-\frac{3\alpha}4 &amp; \text{for} \quad \frac23 \le \alpha \le 1;
  \frac 32(1-\alpha) &amp; \text{for} \quad \frac13 \le \alpha \le \frac23;
  \frac 32-\frac{\alpha}{1-\alpha} &amp; \text{for} \quad 0 &lt; \alpha \le \frac13 .
  \end{cases} \end{equation*} The uniqueness is unconditional in $H^s(\mathbb K)$ for $s&gt;\max\{\frac12,s_{\alpha}\}$. Moreover, we obtain \emph{a priori} estimates for the solutions at the lower regularity threshold $s&gt;\widetilde{s}_\alpha$ where \begin{equation*} \widetilde{s}_\alpha=\begin{cases}
  \frac 12-\frac \alpha 4 &amp; \text{for} \quad \frac23 \le \alpha \le 1;
  1-\alpha &amp; \text{for} \quad \frac12 \le \alpha \le \frac23;
  \frac 32-\frac{\alpha}{1-\alpha} &amp; \text{for} \quad 0 &lt; \alpha \le \frac12 .
  \end{cases} \end{equation*} As a consequence of these results and of the Hamiltonian structure of the equation, we deduce global well-posedness in $H^s(\mathbb K)$ for $s&gt;s_{\alpha}$ when $\alpha&gt;\frac23$, and in the energy space $H^{\frac{\alpha}2}(\mathbb K)$ when $\alpha&gt;\frac45$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2506.17813v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We obtain a fine structural result for two-dimensional mod$(q)$ area-minimizing currents of codimension one, close to flat singularities. Precisely, we show that, locally around any such singularity, the current is a $C^{1,\alpha}$-perturbation of the graph of a radially homogeneous special multiple-valued function that arises from a superposition of homogeneous harmonic polynomials. Additionally, as a preliminary step towards an analogous result in arbitrary codimension, we prove in general that the set of flat singularities of density $\frac{q}{2}$, where the current is ``genuinely mod$(q)$", consists of isolated points.</description>

      <title>Global well-posedness of planar MHD system without heat conductivity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.18057</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.18057v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we consider the Cauchy problem to the planar magnetohydrodynamics (MHD) system with both constant viscosity and constant resistivity but without heat conductivity. Global well-posedness of strong solutions in the presence of natural far field vacuum, due to the finiteness of the mass, is established for any large initial data of suitable smoothness. Density discontinuity and interior vacuum of either point-like or piecewise-like are also allowed. Technically, the entropy-type energy inequality, which although is commonly used as a basic tool in existing literature on the planar MHD system, is not workable in the current paper, as it is not consistent with the far field vacuum. Instead, besides making full use of advantages of the effective viscous flux as in \cite{LJK1DNONHEAT,LIJLIM2022,LIXINADV}, a new coupling structure, between the longitudinal velocity $u$ and the transversal magnetic field $\bm h$, is exploited to recover the dissipative estimate on $\bm h$.</description>

      <title>Ground states of the planar nonlinear Schr\"odinger--Newton system with a point interaction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.18202</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.18202v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We establish sufficient conditions for the existence of ground states of the following normalized nonlinear Schr\"odinger--Newton system with a point interaction: \[ \begin{cases} - \Delta_\alpha u = w u + \beta u |u|^{p - 2} &amp;\text{on} ~ \mathbb{R}^2; \\ - \Delta w = 2 \pi |u|^2 &amp;\text{on} ~ \mathbb{R}^2; \\ \|u\|_{L^2}^2 = c, \end{cases} \] where $p &gt; 2$; $\alpha, \beta \in \mathbb{R}$ and $- \Delta_\alpha$ denotes the Laplacian of point interaction with scattering length $(- 2 \pi \alpha)^{- 1}$. Additionally, we show that critical points of the corresponding constrained energy functional are naturally associated with standing waves of the evolution problem \[ \mathrm{i} \psi' (t) =
- \Delta_\alpha \psi (t) - (\log |\cdot| \ast |\psi (t)|^2) \psi (t) - \beta \psi (t) |\psi (t)|^{p - 2}. \]</description>

      <title>Incompressible Euler limit from the Boltzmann equation with Maxwell reflection boundary condition in the half-space</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.18420</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.18420v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we rigorously justify the incompressible Euler limit of the Boltzmann equation with general Maxwell reflection boundary condition in the half-space. The accommodation coefficient $\alpha \in (0,1]$ is assumed to be $O(1)$. Our construction of solutions includes the interior fluid part and Knudsen-Prandtl coupled boundary layers. The corresponding solutions to the nonlinear Euler and nonlinear Prandtl systems are taken to be shear flows. Due to the presence of the nonlinear Prandtl layer, the remainder equation loses one order normal derivative. The key technical novelty lies in employing the full conservation laws to convert this loss of the normal derivative into the loss of tangential spatial derivative, avoiding any loss of regularity in time. By working within an analytic $L^2 \mbox{-} L^\infty$ framework, we establish the uniform estimate on the remainder equations, thus justify the validity of the incompressible Euler limit from the Boltzmann equation for the shear flow case.</description>

      <title>Regularity of random attractor and fractal dimension of fractional stochastic Navier-Stokes equations on three-dimensional torus</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.18480</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.18480v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper we will study the asymptotic dynamics of fractional Navier-Stokes (NS) equations with additive white noise on three-dimensional torus $\mathbb T^3$. Under the conditions that the external forces $f(x)$ belong to the phase space $ H$ and the noise intensity function $h(x)$ satisfies $\|\nabla h\|_{L^\infty} &lt; \sqrt \pi \nu \lambda_1^\frac{5}{4}$, where $ \nu $ is the kinematic viscosity of the fluid and $\lambda_1$ is the first eigenvalue of the Stokes operator, we shown that the random fractional three-dimensional NS equations possess a tempered $(H,H^\frac{5}{2})$-random attractor whose fractal dimension in $H^\frac{5}{2}$ is finite. This was proved by establishing, first, an $H^\frac{5}{2}$ bounded absorbing set and, second, a local $(H,H^\frac{5}{2})$-Lipschitz continuity in initial values from which the $(H,H^\frac{5}{2})$-asymptotic compactness of the system follows. Since the forces $f$ belong only to $H$, the $H^\frac{5}{2}$ bounded absorbing set was constructed by an indirect approach of estimating the $H^\frac{5}{2}$-distance between the solutions of the random fractional three-dimensional NS equations and that of the corresponding deterministic equations. Furthermore, under the conditions that the external forces $f(x)$ belong to the $ H^{k-\frac{5}{4}}$ and the noise intensity function $h(x)$ belong to $H^{k+\frac{5}{4}}$ for $k\geq\frac{5}{2}$, we shown that the random fractional three-dimensional NS equations possess a tempered $(H,H^k)$-random attractor whose fractal dimension in $H^k$ is finite. This was proved by using iterative methods and establishing, first, an $H^k$ bounded absorbing set and, second, a local $(H,H^k)$-Lipschitz continuity in initial values from which the $(H,H^k)$-asymptotic compactness of the system follows.</description>

      <title>Stationary gravitational modes on Kerr-anti-de Sitter spacetimes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.18524</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.18524v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We prove that, for any continuous path of Kerr-adS black hole parameters crossing the Hawking-Reall threshold, for all azimuthal number $|m|$ sufficiently large, there exists black hole parameters on the path such that the Teukolsky equations with conformal boundary conditions admit a non-trivial regular stationary (\emph{i.e.} with frequency $\omega=m\omega_+$) mode solution. When $|m|$ goes to infinity, we show that these black hole parameters accumulate at the Hawking-Reall threshold. The major difficulty is that one cannot construct solutions to the system of Teukolsky equations using variational arguments as it is usually done for the classical wave equation. We introduce a new scheme of proof based on a shooting-type continuity argument and a high-frequency WKB approximation.</description>

      <title>On an Iterative Scheme for the Spinorial Yamabe Equation on Manifolds with Boundary</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.18546</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.18546v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the existence of solutions to the spinorial Yamabe equation -- that is, the Euler--Lagrange equation associated with the conformal invariant introduced by S. Raulot -- for compact manifolds with boundary. For the inhomogeneous equation, we employ an iterative scheme to establish existence under smallness assumptions on the relevant parameters. Using bootstrapping methods, we extend the regularity of the solution to $C^\infty$ away from its zero set in the interior, and up to the boundary in the case of Shapiro--Lopatinski boundary conditions.</description>

      <title>Homogenization of magnetoelastic materials with rigid magnetic inclusions at small strains</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.18585</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.18585v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate a homogenization problem for a linearly elastic magnetic material that incorporates elastically rigid magnetic inclusions firmly bonded to the matrix. By considering a periodic arrangement of this material, we identify an effective magnetoelastic energy, obtained by homogenization when the period approaches zero. For comparison, we also briefly discuss alternative, essentially equivalent magnetic models naturally linked by a Legendre-Fenchel transform of magnetic energy density where the elastic deformation enters as a parameter.</description>

      <title>Regularity of a bulk-surface Cahn-Hilliard model driven by Leray velocity fields</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.18617</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.18617v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider a convective bulk-surface Cahn--Hilliard system with dynamic boundary conditions and singular potentials. For this model, well-posedness results concerning weak and strong solutions have already been established in the literature. However, they require the prescribed velocity fields to belong to function spaces with high time regularity. In this paper, we prove that the well-posedness of weak solutions holds true under more general regularity assumptions on the velocity fields. Next, via an alternative proof for higher regularity, we show the well-posedness of strong solutions for velocity fields of Leray type, which is a more relevant assumption for physical applications. Our approach hinges upon a new well-posedness and regularity theory for a bulk-surface elliptic system with singular nonlinearities, which may be of independent interest.</description>

      <title>Stabilization of Quasilinear Parabolic Equations by Cubic Feedback at Boundary with Estimated Region of Attraction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.18634</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.18634v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: For quasilinear parabolic partial differential equations (PDEs) that exhibit finite-time blow up in open loop, i.e., under null boundary conditions, we provide an estimate of the region of attraction under cubic feedback laws applied at the boundary, using boundary measurements. We guarantee: 1-L 2 and H 1 exponential stability of the origin with an estimate of the region of attraction. 2-Convergence of the H 2 and the C 1 norms of the solutions to zero. 3-Existence and uniqueness of complete classical solutions. 4-Positivity of the solutions starting from positive initial conditions. Unlike existing approaches, our framework handles nonlinear state-dependent diffusion, convection, and (destabilizing) reaction. The cubic terms are used to enlarge our estimate of the region of attraction. The size of the region of attraction is shown, in many cases, to grow unboundedly as diffusion increases. Finally, our controllers can be implemented as Neumann, Dirichlet, or mixed-type boundary conditions.</description>

      <title>Free boundary regularity and well-posedness of physical solutions to the supercooled Stefan problem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.18741</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.18741v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the regularity and well-posedness of physical solutions to the supercooled Stefan problem. Assuming only that the initial temperature is integrable, we prove that the free boundary, known to have jump discontinuities as a function of the time variable, is $C^1$ as a function of the space variable, and is $C^{\infty}$ outside of a closed, countable set, which we describe explicitly. We also prove that, as conjectured in arXiv:1902.05174, the set of positive times when a jump occurs cannot have accumulation points. In addition, we prove that short-time uniqueness of physical solutions implies global uniqueness, which allows us to obtain uniqueness for very general initial data that fall outside the scope of the current well-posedness regime. In particular, we answer two questions left open in arXiv:1811.12356, arXiv:2302.13097, regarding the global uniqueness of solutions. We proceed by deriving a weighted obstacle problem satisfied by the solutions, which we exploit to establish regularity and non-degeneracy estimates and to classify the free boundary points. We also establish a backward propagation of oscillation property, which allows us to control the occurrence of future jumps in terms of the past oscillation of the solution.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2506.17441v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We demonstrate that the Chapman--Enskog series is locally equivalent to the exact spectral closure defined on slow kinetic eigenmodes in the limit of vanishing Knudsen number. We further show that the Chapman--Enskog series diverges everywhere expect at the global equilibrium for an explicit example, while the exact spectrally closed hydrodynamics are defined globally for any Knudsen number.</description>

      <title>Sharp $L^p$-estimates for wave equation on $ax+b$ groups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.17531</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.17531v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Let $G$ be the group $\mathbb{R}_+\ltimes \mathbb{R}^n$ endowed with Riemannian symmetric space metric $d$ and the right Haar measure $\mathrm{d} \rho$ which is of $ax+b$ type, and $L$ be the positive definite distinguished left invariant Laplacian on $G$. Let $u=u(t,\cdot)$ be the solution of $u_{tt}+Lu=0$ with initial conditions $u|_{t=0}=f$ and $u_t|_{t=0}=g$. In this article we show that for a fixed $t \in{\mathbb R}$ and every $1&lt;p&lt;\infty$, \begin{align*} \|u(t,\cdot)\|_{L^p(G)}\leq C_p\Big( (1+|t|)^{2|1/p-1/2|}\|f\|_{L^p_{\alpha_0}(G)}+(1+|t|)\,\|g\|_{L^p_{\alpha_1}(G)}\Big) \end{align*} if and only if \begin{align*} \alpha_0\geq n\left|{1\over p}- {1\over2}\right| \quad \mbox{and} \quad \alpha_1\geq n\left|{1\over p}- {1\over2}\right| -1. \end{align*} This gives an endpoint result for $\alpha_0=n|1/p-1/2|$ and $\alpha_1=n|1/p-1/2|-1$ with $1&lt;p&lt;\infty$ in Corollary 8.2, as pointed out in Remark 8.1 due to M\"{u}ller and Thiele [Studia Math. \textbf{179} (2007)].</description>

      <title>An ansatz for constructing explicit solutions of Hessian equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.17701</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.17701v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce a (variation of quadrics) ansatz for constructing explicit, real-valued solutions to broad classes of complex Hessian equations on domains in $\mathbb{C}^{n+1}$ and real Hessian equations on domains in $\mathbb{R}^{n+1}$. In the complex setting, our method simultaneously addresses the deformed Hermitian--Yang--Mills/Leung--Yau--Zaslow (dHYM/LYZ) equation, the Monge--Amp\`ere equation, and the $J$-equation. Under this ansatz each PDE reduces to a second-order system of ordinary differential equations admitting explicit first integrals. These ODE systems integrate in closed form via abelian integrals, producing wide families of explicit solutions together with a detailed description. In particular, on $\mathbb{C}^3$, we construct entire dHYM/LYZ solutions of arbitrary subcritical phase, and on $\mathbb{R}^3$ we produce entire special Lagrangian solutions of arbitrary subcritical phase. More generally, in any complex or real dimension, our ansatz yields entire solutions of certain subcritical phases for both the dHYM/LYZ and special Lagrangian equations. Some of these solutions develop singularities on compact regions. In the special Lagrangian case we show that, after a natural extension across the singular locus, these blow-up solutions coincide with previously known complete special Lagrangian submanifolds obtained via a different ansatz.</description>

      <title>The mechanism of tornadogenesis from the perspective of vortex tubes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.18222</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.18222v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we propose a new theory on tornadogenesis from the perspective of vortex tubes based on Kelvin-Helmholtz Theorems. When the pressure difference between the lowest pressure line from the wall cloud down to the ground and its surroundings is large enough, the increase of vorticity inside the squeezed vortex tube can reach the tornado level, and thus a tornado is born. When the pressure difference increases, the tornado strength increases. When the pressure difference decreases, the tornado strength decreases. The decay of tornadoes is caused by the decreasing pressure difference. This is our theory of the entire tornado lifespan.</description>

      <title>Convex-concave splitting for the Allen-Cahn equation leads to $\varepsilon^2$-slow movement of interfaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.18869</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.18869v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The convex-concave splitting discretization of the Allen-Cahn is easy to implement and guaranteed to be energy decreasing even for large time-steps. We analyze the time-stepping scheme for a large class of potentials which includes the standard potential as well as two extreme settings: Potentials with quadratic convex part (uniform positive curvature), and potentials which are concave between the potential wells and either linear or infinite outside (highly concentrated curvature). In all three scenarios, the 'effective time step size' of the scheme scales with the square of the small parameter $\varepsilon$ governing the width of transition layers. A weaker 'slow motion' result is proved under much more general assumptions. Thus, stability is achieved by effectively 'freezing' the interfaces in place. The time step limitation is not geometric in origin, but depends on the phase-field parameter $\varepsilon$. Along the way, we establish a new link between an Allen-Cahn type equation and a thresholding approximation of mean curvature flow.</description>

Abstract: Let $-\Delta_{\cal S}$ be the Laplace operator in ${\cal S} \subset \mathbb{R}^3$ on a waveguide shaped surfaces, i.e., ${\cal S}$ is built by translating a closed curve in a constant direction along an unbounded spatial curve. Under the condition that the tangent vector of the reference curve admits a finite limit at infinity, we find the essential spectrum of $-\Delta_{\cal S}$ and discuss conditions under which discrete eigenvalues emerge. Furthermore, we analyze the Laplacian in the case of a broken sheared waveguide shaped surface.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2012.01855v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this article we present three robust instability mechanisms for linear and nonlinear inverse problems. All of these are based on strong compression properties (in the sense of singular value or entropy number bounds) which we deduce through either strong global smoothing, only weak global smoothing or microlocal smoothing for the corresponding forward operators, respectively. As applications we for instance present new instability arguments for unique continuation, for the backward heat equation and for linear and nonlinear Calder\'on type problems in general geometries, possibly in the presence of rough coefficients. Our instability mechanisms could also be of interest in the context of control theory, providing estimates on the cost of (approximate) controllability in rather general settings. This is a revised version of the article ``On instability mechanisms for inverse problems'' Ars Inveniendi Analytica (2021), Paper No. 7, 93 pp by the same authors.</description>

Abstract: In the framework of Potential Theory we prove existence or the Perron-Weiner-Brelot-Bauer solution to the Dirichlet problem related to a family of totally degenerate, in the sense of Bony, differential operators. We also state and prove a Wiener-type criterium and an exterior cone condition for the regularity of a boundary point. Our results apply to a wide family of strongly degenerate operators that includes the following example $\mathcal{L} = t^2\Delta_x + \langle x, \nabla_y \rangle -\partial_t$, for $(x,y,t) \in \mathbb{R}^N \times \mathbb{R}^{N} \times \mathbb{R}$.</description>

Abstract: This paper investigates shape optimization problems in heat convection and conduction, with a focus on the stability and non-optimality of round domains under Robin boundary conditions. Using flow approach and Steklov eigenvalue estimates, we derive the necessary and sufficient stability conditions for a ball to maximize the averaged heat when the heat source is radially decreasing. Our results show that, counterintuitively, ball may not be optimal for maximizing the averaged heat under heat convection, even with radially decreasing heat sources locating on the center of the ball. Moreover, we identify stability-breaking phenomena, with thresholds depending on the Robin coefficient, dimension, and volume constraints. Additionally, we demonstrate that a ball can maximize the averaged temperature under certain conditions and we also explore optimal shapes in thin insulation problems.</description>

      <title>Traveling Sharp Waves of Porous Media Equations in Spatially Periodic Environment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.13269</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.13269v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider one dimensional porous media equations in spatially periodic environment. We will construct a periodic traveling sharp wave whose profile tends to a positive steady state at left infinity and takes zero on the right half line, with a free boundary satisfying the Darcy's law. Our method is to take the limit for a sequence of normalized solutions starting at Heaviside type of initial data. The crucial step is to give a uniform positive lower bound for the instantaneous speed of the free boundary.</description>

      <title>The free elastic flow for closed planar curves</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.12619</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.12619v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The free elastic flow is the $L^2$-gradient flow for Euler's elastic energy, or equivalently the Willmore flow with translation invariant initial data. In contrast to elastic flows under length penalisation or preservation, it is more challenging to study the free elastic flow's asymptotic behavior, and convergence for closed curves is lost. In this paper, we nevertheless determine the asymptotic shape of the flow for initial curves that are geometrically close to circles, possibly multiply-covered, proving that an appropriate rescaling smoothly converges to a unique round circle.</description>

Abstract: It is shown that the $p$-Poincar\'e inequality holds on an open set $\Omega$ in $\mathbb{R}^n$ if and only if the strict $p$-capacitary inradius of $\Omega$ is finite. To that end, new upper and lower bounds for the infimum for the associated nonlinear Rayleigh quotients are derived.</description>

      <title>Existence and dynamics of normalized solutions to Schr\"odinger equations with generic double-behaviour nonlinearities</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.05194v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the existence of solutions $(\underline u,\lambda_{\underline u})\in H^1(\mathbb{R}^N; \mathbb{R}) \times \mathbb{R}$ to \[ -\Delta u + \lambda u = f(u) \quad \text{in } \mathbb{R}^N \] with $N \ge 3$ and prescribed $L^2$ norm, and the dynamics of the solutions to \[ \begin{cases} \mathrm{i} \partial_t \Psi + \Delta \Psi = f(\Psi)\\ \Psi(\cdot,0) = \psi_0 \in H^1(\mathbb{R}^N; \mathbb{C}) \end{cases} \] with $\psi_0$ close to $\underline u$. Here, the nonlinear term $f$ has mass-subcritical growth at the origin, mass-supercritical growth at infinity, and is more general than the sum of two powers. Under different assumptions, we prove the existence of a locally least-energy solution, the orbital stability of all such solutions, the existence of a second solution with higher energy, and the strong instability of such a solution.</description>

      <title>A seamless local-nonlocal coupling diffusion model with $H^1$ vanishing nonlocality convergence</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.03153v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Based on the development in dealing with nonlocal boundary conditions, we propose a seamless local-nonlocal coupling diffusion model in this paper. In our model, a finite constant interaction horizon is equipped in the nonlocal part and transmission conditions are imposed on a co-dimension one interface. To achieve a seamless coupling, we introduce an auxiliary function to merge the nonlocal model with the local part and design a proper coupling transmission condition to ensure the stability and convergence. In addition, by introducing bilinear form, well-posedness of the proposed model can be proved and convergence to a standard elliptic transmission model with first order in $H^1$ norm can be derived.</description>

Abstract: These notes review the theory of Fisher information, especially its use in kinetic theory of gases and plasmas. The recent monotonicity theorem by Guillen--Silvestre for the Landau--Coulomb equation is put in perspective and generalised. Following my joint work with Imbert and Silvestre, it is proven that Fisher information is decaying along the spatially homogeneous Boltzmann equation, for all relevant interactions, and from this the once longstanding problem of regularity estimates for very singular collision kernels (very soft potentials) is solved.</description>

      <title>Asymptotic Behavior of Solutions of a Degenerate Diffusion Equation with a Multistable Reaction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.17177</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.17177v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider a generalized degenerate diffusion equation with a reaction term $u_t=[A(u)]_{xx}+f(u)$, where $A$ is a smooth function satisfying $A(0)=A'(0)=0$ and $A(u),\ A'(u),\ A''(u)&gt;0$ for $u&gt;0$, $f$ is of monostable type in $[0,s_1]$ and of bistable type in $[s_1,1]$. We first give a trichotomy result on the asymptotic behavior of the solutions starting at compactly supported initial data, which says that, as $t\to \infty$, either small-spreading (which means $u$ tends to $s_1$), or transition, or big-spreading (which means $u$ tends to $1$) happens for a solution. Then we construct the classical and sharp traveling waves (a sharp wave means a wave having a free boundary which satisfies the Darcy's law) for the generalized degenerate diffusion equation, and then using them to characterize the spreading solution near its front.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2502.11849v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the existence of weak solutions and the corresponding sharp interface limit of an anisotropic Cahn-Hilliard equation with disparate mobility, i.e., the mobility is degenerate in one of the two pure phases, making the diffusion in that phase vanish. The double-well potential is polynomial and is weighted by a spatially inhomogeneous coefficient. In the limit when the parameter of the interface width tends to zero, and under an energy convergence assumption, we prove that the weak solutions converge to BV solutions of a weighted anisotropic Hele-Shaw flow. We also add some numerical simulations to analyze the effects of anisotropy on the Cahn-Hilliard equation.</description>

As an application, we show using the Ishii-Lions method that not only viscosity but also weak solutions are Lipschitz continuous in the space variable. To the best of our knowledge, there is no preceding valid Lipschitz proofs in the literature.</description>

      <title>Fife-McLeod's Theorem for Spatially Periodic Degenerate Diffusion Equations</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.15862v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: For one dimensional homogeneous bistable diffusion equations, Fife-McLeod ([Arch. Ration. Mech. Anal., 65 (1977), 335-361]) gave a well-known theorem which says that spreading solutions starting from compactly supported initial data can be exponentially approximated by traveling wave solutions. We will extend this theorem to {\it degenerate diffusion equations in periodic environments}. First, we construct a {\it periodic traveling sharp wave} to the equation, which has a positive profile on the left half-line and a right free boundary governed by the Darcy's law. To achieve this we use a renormalization approach in which crucial uniform gradient estimates near the free boundary are derived via delicate asymptotic analysis. Next we show that the central part of any spreading solution decays exponentially to a periodic steady state. Based on these results, we can construct super- and sub-solutions to prove the Fife-McLeod's theorem for our equation: any spreading solution with compactly supported initial data can be exponentially approximated by the periodic traveling sharp wave.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.19184v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The present work deals with a Keller-Segel-Navier-Stokes system with potential consumption, under homogeneous Neumann boundary conditions for cell density and chemical signal, and of Dirichlet type for the velocity field, over a bounded three-dimensional domain.
  The paper aims to develop a time discretization scheme converging to weak solutions of the system,
  which are uniformly bounded at infinite time.
  While global existence results are already known for simplified cases, either in absence of fluid flow or for linear consumption, the existence of global weak solutions for the fully coupled system with potential consumption has remained as an open problem.</description>

      <title>Stratification and Rectifiability of Harmonic Map Flows via Tangent Measures</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.14880v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we investigate the stratification theory for ``suitable solutions" of harmonic map flows based on the spatial symmetry of tangent measures. Generally, suitable solutions are a category of solutions that satisfy both the localized energy inequality and the monotonicity formula. Building on the modifications and adjustments of quantitative stratifications and Reifenberg-rectifiable theory by Naber and Valtorta in the breakthrough research of harmonic maps (\emph{Ann. Math.} 185 (2017), 131-227), we confirm that each stratum in our model is rectifiable. Furthermore, for each time slice of the singular set, we establish the estimate of the Minkowski content and demonstrate its rectifiability, strengthening prior findings, which applied only to almost every time slice. Additionally, by making certain assumptions about the target manifolds to exclude specific tangent flows and measures, our analysis yields sharp improvements in the regularity of suitable solutions for harmonic map flows.</description>

Abstract: We analyze an approximation of a Laplacian subject to non-local interface conditions of a $\delta'$-type by Neumann Laplacians on a family of Riemannian manifolds with a sieve-like structure. We establish a (kind of) resolvent convergence for such operators, which in turn implies the convergence of spectra and eigenspaces, and demonstrate convergence of the corresponding semigroups. Moreover, we provide an explicit example of a manifold allowing to realize any prescribed integral kernel appearing in that interface conditions. Finally, we extend the discussion to similar approximations for the Laplacian with non-local Robin-type boundary conditions.</description>

      <title>Shape derivative approach to fractional overdetermined problems</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.00268v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We use shape derivative approach to prove that balls are the only convex and $C^{1,1}$ regular domains in which the fractional overdetermined problem \begin{equation*} \left\{\begin{aligned} \Ds u&amp;= \lambda_{s, p} u^{p-1}\quad\text{in}\quad\Om \\ u &amp;= 0\quad \text{in}\quad\R^N\setminus \Om\\ u/d^s&amp;=C_0\quad\text{on\;\; $\partial\O$} \end{aligned} \right. \end{equation*} admits a nontrivial solution for $p\in [1, 2]$ and where $\lambda_{s, p}= \lambda_{s, p}(\O)$ is the best constant in the family of Subcritical Sobolev inequalities. In the cases $p=1$ and $p=2$, we recover the classical symmetry results of Serrin, corresponding to the torsion problem and the first Dirichlet eigenvalue problem, respectively (see \cite{FS-15}). We note that for $p\in (1,2)$, the above problem lies outside the framework of \cite{FS-15}, and the methods developed therein do not apply. Our approach extends to the fractional setting a method initially developed by A. Henrot and T. Chatelain in \cite{CH-99}, and relies on the use of domain derivatives combined with the continuous Steiner symmetrization introduced by Brock in \cite{Brock-00}.</description>

      <title>Examples of small-time controllable Schr\"odinger equations</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.05698v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A variety of physically relevant bilinear Schr\"odinger equations are known to be approximately controllable in large times. There are however examples which are approximately controllable in large times, but not in small times. This obstruction happens e.g. in the presence of (sub)quadratic potentials, because Gaussian states are preserved, at least for small times.
  In this work, we provide the first examples of small-time approximately controllable bilinear Schr\"odinger equations. In particular, we show that a control on the frequency of a quadratic potential permits to construct approximate solutions that evolve arbitrarily fast along space-dilations. Once we have access to space-dilations, we can exploit them to generate time-contractions. In this way, we build on previous results of large-time control, to obtain control in small times.</description>

Abstract: This paper continues the study of controlled interacting particle systems with common noise started in [W. Gangbo, S. Mayorga and A. \'{S}wi\k{e}ch, SIAM J. Math. Anal. 53 (2021), no. 2, 1320--1356] and [S. Mayorga and A. \'{S}wi\k{e}ch, SIAM J. Control Optim. 61 (2023), no. 2, 820--851]. First, we extend the following results of the previously mentioned works to the case of multiplicative noise: (i) We generalize the convergence of the value functions $u_n$ corresponding to control problems of $n$ particles to the value function $V$ corresponding to an appropriately defined infinite dimensional control problem; (ii) we prove, under certain additional assumptions, $C^{1,1}$ regularity of $V$ in the spatial variable. The second main contribution of the present work is the proof that if $DV$ is continuous (which, in particular, includes the previously proven case of $C^{1,1}$ regularity in the spatial variable), the value function $V$ projects precisely onto the value functions $u_n$. Using this projection property, we show that optimal controls of the finite dimensional problem correspond to optimal controls of the infinite dimensional problem and vice versa. In the case of a linear state equation, we are able to prove that $V$ projects precisely onto the value functions $u_n$ under relaxed assumptions on the coefficients of the cost functional by using approximation techniques in the Wasserstein space, thus covering cases where $V$ may not be differentiable.</description>

      <title>Zero-noise selection and Large Deviations in $L^\infty_t L^p_x$ for the stochastic transport equation beyond DiPerna-Lions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.06947</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.06947v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We consider $L^\infty_t L^p_x$ solutions of the stochastic transport equation with drift in $L^\infty_t W^{1,q}_x$. We show strong existence and pathwise uniqueness of solutions in a regime of parameters $p,q$ for which non-unique weak solutions of the deterministic transport equation exist. When the intensity of the noise goes to zero, we prove that the solutions of the stochastic transport equation converge to the unique renormalized solution of the transport equation in the sense of DiPerna-Lions. Furthermore, we show that the convergence is governed by a Large Deviations Principle in the space $L^\infty_t L^p_x$. Since the space $L^\infty_t L^p_x$ is not separable, the weak convergence approach to Large Deviations by Budhiraja, Dupuis, and Maroulas is not directly applicable.</description>
