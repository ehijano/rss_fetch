      <title>The Kinematics of 30 Milky Way Globular Clusters and the Multiple Stellar Populations within</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.02855</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.02855v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The spectroscopic and photometric classification of multiple stellar populations (MPs) in Galactic globular clusters (GCs) has enabled comparisons between contemporary observations and formation theories regarding the initial spatial configurations of the MPs. However, the kinematics of these MPs is an aspect that requires more attention. We investigated the 3D kinematics of 30 Galactic GCs, extending to 3-5 half-light radii, as well as their MPs, in order to uncover clues of the initial conditions of GCs and the MPs within. We have combined Hubble Space Telescope and Gaia DR3 proper motions together with a comprehensive set of line-of-sight velocities to determine the 3D rotation amplitudes, rotation axes, and anisotropy profiles of the clusters. We include radial velocities from new IFU observations of NGC 5024 and an analysis of archival MUSE data of NGC 6101. We compare our kinematic results with structural and orbital parameters of each cluster, reporting the most significant correlations and common features. We find significant rotation in 21 GCs, with no significant differences between the total rotational amplitudes of the MPs, except for NGC 104. We find no significant differences in the position angles or inclination angles. We find that the 3D rotational amplitude is strongly correlated with mass, relaxation time, enriched star fraction and concentration. We determine the anisotropy profiles of each cluster and the MPs where possible. We investigate correlations with the structural parameters, orbital parameters and accretion history of the clusters, finding that the dynamically young clusters with the highest central concentrations of primordial stars show radial anisotropy in their outer regions ($&gt;2$ half-light radii). The dynamically young clusters with a central concentration of enriched stars show significant tangential anisotropy or isotropy in their outer regions.</description>

      <title>Ammonium hydrosulfide (NH4SH): a potential significant sulfur sink in interstellar ices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.02860</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.02860v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Sulfur is depleted with respect to its cosmic standard abundance in dense star-forming regions. It has been suggested that this depletion is caused by the freeze-out of sulfur on interstellar dust grains, but the observed abundances and upper limits of sulfur-bearing ices remain too low to account for all of the missing sulfur. Toward the same environments, a strong absorption feature at 6.85 $\mu$m is observed, but its long-standing assignment to the NH4+ cation remains tentative. We investigate the plausibility of NH4SH salt serving as a sulfur reservoir and a carrier of the 6.85 $\mu$m band in interstellar ices by characterizing its IR signatures and apparent band strengths in water-rich laboratory ice mixtures and using this laboratory data to constrain NH4SH abundances in observations of 4 protostars and 2 cold dense clouds. The observed 6.85 $\mu$m feature is fit well with the laboratory NH4SH:H2O ice spectra. NH4+ column densities obtained from the 6.85 $\mu$m band range from 8-23% with respect to H2O toward the sample of protostars and dense clouds. The redshift of the 6.85 $\mu$m feature correlates with higher abundances of NH4+ with respect to H2O in both the laboratory data presented here and observational data of dense clouds and protostars. The apparent band strength of the SH- feature is likely too low for the feature to be detectable in the spectrally busy 3.9 $\mu$m region, but the 5.3 $\mu$m NH4+ $\nu_{4}$ + SH- R combination mode may be an alternative means of detection. Its tentative assignment adds to mounting evidence supporting the presence of NH4+ salts in ices and is the first tentative observation of the SH- anion toward interstellar ices. If the majority ($\gtrsim$80-85%) of the NH4+ cations quantified toward the investigated sources in this work are bound to SH- anions, then NH4SH salts could account for up to 17-18% of their sulfur budgets.</description>

      <title>PHANGS-ML: the universal relation between PAH band and optical line ratios across nearby star-forming galaxies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.02864</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.02864v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The structure and chemistry of the dusty interstellar medium (ISM) are shaped by complex processes that depend on the local radiation field, gas composition, and dust grain properties. Of particular importance are Polycyclic Aromatic Hydrocarbons (PAHs), which emit strong vibrational bands in the mid-infrared, and play a key role in the ISM energy balance. We recently identified global correlations between PAH band and optical line ratios across three nearby galaxies, suggesting a connection between PAH heating and gas ionization throughout the ISM. In this work, we perform a census of the PAH heating -- gas ionization connection using $\sim$700,000 independent pixels that probe scales of 40--150 pc in nineteen nearby star-forming galaxies from the PHANGS survey. We find a universal relation between $\log$PAH(11.3 \mic/7.7 \mic) and $\log$([SII]/H$\alpha$) with a slope of $\sim$0.2 and a scatter of $\sim$0.025 dex. The only exception is a group of anomalous pixels that show unusually high (11.3 \mic/7.7 \mic) PAH ratios in regions with old stellar populations and high starlight-to-dust emission ratios. Their mid-infrared spectra resemble those of elliptical galaxies. AGN hosts show modestly steeper slopes, with a $\sim$10\% increase in PAH(11.3 \mic/7.7 \mic) in the diffuse gas on kpc scales. This universal relation implies an emerging simplicity in the complex ISM, with a sequence that is driven by a single varying property: the spectral shape of the interstellar radiation field. This suggests that other properties, such as gas-phase abundances, gas ionization parameter, and grain charge distribution, are relatively uniform in all but specific cases.</description>

      <title>The Stellar Initial Mass Function of Early Dark Matter-free Gas Objects</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.02868</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.02868v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: To date, JWST has detected the earliest known star clusters in our Universe (Adamo et al. 2024, Messa et al. 2024, Vanzella et al. 2024, Mowla et al. 2024). They appear to be relatively compact (~few pc, Adamo et al. 2024) and had only recently formed their stars. It was speculated that these clusters may be the earliest progenitors of globular clusters ever detected. Globular clusters are a relic of the initial stages of star formation in the Universe. However, because they contain little to no dark matter (e.g., Heggie &amp; Hut 1996, Bradford et al. 2011, Conroy et al. 2011, Ibata et al. 2013), their formation mechanism poses a significant theoretical challenge. A recent suggestion pointed out that the relative velocity between the gas and the dark matter (Tseliakhovich &amp; Hirata 2010) in the early Universe could naturally form potentially star-forming regions outside of dark matter halos. Here, for the first time, we follow the star formation process of these early Universe objects using high-resolution hydrodynamical simulations, including mechanical feedback. Our results suggest that the first dark matter-less star clusters are top-heavy, with a higher abundance of massive stars compared to today's clusters and extremely high stellar mass surface densities compared to the local Universe.</description>

      <title>Constraining the Low Mass End of the Stellar Halo Mass Relation with Surveys of Satellite Galaxies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.02873</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.02873v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The abundance of satellite galaxies is set by the hierarchical assembly of their host halo. We leverage this to investigate the low mass end ($M_{\mathrm{H}} &lt; 10^{11} M_{\odot}$) of the Stellar-to-Halo Mass Relation (SHMR), which is key to constraining theories of galaxy formation and cosmology. We argue that recent analyses of satellite galaxies in the Local Group environment have not adequately modelled the dominant source of scatter in satellite stellar mass functions: the variance in accretion histories for a fixed host halo mass. We present a novel inference framework that not only properly accounts for this halo-to-halo variance but also naturally identifies the amount of host halo mass mixing, which is generally unknown. Specifically, we use the semi-analytical SatGen model to construct mock satellite galaxy populations consistent with the third data release of the Satellites Around Galactic Analogs (SAGA) survey. We demonstrate that even under the most idealized circumstances, the halo-to-halo variance makes it virtually impossible to put any meaningful constraints on the scatter in the SHMR. Even a satellite galaxy survey made up 100 hosts can at best only place an upper limit of $\sim 0.5$dex on the scatter (at the 95\% confidence level). This is because the large variance in halo assembly histories dominates over the scatter in the SHMR. This problem can be overcome by increasing the sample size of the survey by an order of magnitude ($\sim 1000$ host galaxies), something that should be fairly straightforward with forthcoming spectroscopic surveys.</description>

      <title>Systematics in tests of general relativity using LISA massive black hole binaries</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.02910</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.02910v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Our current understanding is that an environment - mainly consisting of gas or stars - is required to bring massive black hole binaries (MBHBs) with total redshifted mass $M_z\sim[10^{4},10^7]~{\rm M}_\odot$ to the LISA band from parsec separation. Even in the gravitational wave (GW) dominated final inspiral, realistic environments can non-negligibly speed up or slow down the binary evolution, or leave residual, measurable eccentricity in the LISA band. Despite this fact, most of the literature does not consider environmental effects or orbital eccentricity in modelling GWs from near-equal mass MBHBs. Considering either a circular MBHB embedded in a circumbinary disc or a vacuum eccentric binary, we explore if ignoring either secular gas effects (migration and accretion) or eccentric corrections to the GW waveform can mimic a failure of General Relativity (GR). We use inspiral-only aligned-spin 3.5 post-Newtonian waveforms, a complete LISA response model, and Bayesian inference to perform a parameterized test of GR. For a four-year LISA observation of an MBHB with $M_z=10^{5}~{\rm M}_\odot$, primary-to-secondary mass ratio $q=8$, and component BHs' dimensionless spins $\chi_{1,2}=0.9$ at redshift $z=1$, even a moderate gas-disc imprint (Eddington ratio ${\rm f}_{\rm Edd}\sim0.1$) or low initial eccentricity ($e_0\sim10^{-2.5}$) causes a false violation of GR in several PN orders. However, correctly modelling either effect can mitigate systematics while avoiding significant biases in vacuum circular systems. The adoption of LISA makes it urgent to consider gas imprints and eccentricity in waveform models to ensure accurate inference for MBHBs.</description>

      <title>Galaxy-Galaxy Strong Lensing with U-Net (GGSL-UNet). I. Extracting 2-Dimensional Information from Multi-Band Images in Ground and Space Observations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.02936</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.02936v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a novel deep learning method to separately extract the two-dimensional flux information of the foreground galaxy (deflector) and background system (source) of Galaxy-Galaxy Strong Lensing events using U-Net (GGSL-Unet for short). In particular, the segmentation of the source image is found to enhance the performance of the lens modeling, especially for ground-based images. By combining mock lens foreground+background components with real sky survey noise to train the GGSL-Unet, we show it can correctly model the input image noise and extract the lens signal. However, the most important result of this work is that the GGSL-UNet can accurately reconstruct real ground-based lensing systems from the Kilo Degree Survey (KiDS) in one second. We also test the GGSL-UNet on space-based (HST) lenses from BELLS GALLERY, and obtain comparable accuracy of standard lens modeling tools. Finally, we calculate the magnitudes from the reconstructed deflector and source images and use this to derive photometric redshifts (photo-z), with the photo-z of the deflector well consistent with spectroscopic ones. This first work, demonstrates the great potential of the generative network for lens finding, image denoising, source segmentation, and decomposing and modeling of strong lensing systems. For the upcoming ground- and space-based surveys, the GGSL-UNet can provide high-quality images as well as geometry and redshift information for precise lens modeling, in combination with classical MCMC modeling for best accuracy in the galaxy-galaxy strong lensing analysis.</description>

      <title>Hooks, Lines, and Sinkers: How AGN Feedback and Cosmic-Ray Transport shape the Far Infrared-Radio Correlation of Galaxies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.02971</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.02971v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The far-infrared (FIR) - radio correlation (FRC) is one of the most promising empirical constraints on the role of cosmic-rays (CRs) and magnetic fields (\textbf{B}) in galaxy formation and evolution. While many theories have been proposed in order to explain the emergence and maintenance of the FRC across a gamut of galaxy properties and redshift, the non-linear physics at play remain unexplored in full complexity and cosmological context. We present the first reproduction of the $z \sim 0$ FRC using detailed synthetic observations of state-of-the-art cosmological zoom-in simulations from the FIRE-3 suite with explicitly-evolved CR proton and electron (CRe) spectra, for three models for CR transport and multi-channel AGN feedback. In doing so, we generally verify the predictions of `calorimeter' theories at high FIR luminosities (\Lsixty\, $\gtrsim$ 10$^{9.5}$) and at low FIR luminosities (\Lsixty\, $\lesssim$ 10$^{9.5}$) the so-called `conspiracy' of increasing ultraviolet radiation escape in tandem with increasing CRe escape, and find that the global FRC is insensitive to \textit{orders-of-magnitude} locally-variable CR transport coefficients. Importantly, the indirect effect of AGN feedback on emergent observables highlights novel interpretations of outliers in the FRC. In particular, we find that in many cases, `radio-excess' objects can be better understood as \textit{IR-dim} objects with longer-lived radio contributions at low $z$ from Type Ia SNe and intermittent black hole accretion in quenching galaxies, though this is sensitive to the interplay of CR transport and AGN feedback physics. This creates characteristic evolutionary tracks leading to the $z=0$ FRC, which shape the subsequent late-time behavior of each model.</description>

      <title>Transverse clues on the kpc-scale structure of the circumgalactic medium as traced by C IV absorption</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.03029</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.03029v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present VLT/MUSE integral-field spectroscopy ($R\approx 1\,800$) of four giant gravitational arcs exhibiting strong C IV absorption at 8 intervening redshifts, $z_{abs}\approx 2.0$--$2.5$. We detect C IV absorption in a total of 222 adjacent and seeing-uncorrelated sightlines, whose spectra sample beams of ("de-lensed") linear size $\approx 1$ kpc. Our data show that (1) absorption velocities cluster at all probed transverse scales, $\Delta r_\perp\approx0$--$15$ kpc, depending on system; (2) the (transverse) velocity dispersion never exceeds the mean (line-of-sight) absorption spread; and (3) the (transverse) velocity autocorrelation function does not resolve kinematic patterns at the above spatial scales, but its velocity projection, $\xi^{arc}(\Delta v)$, exhibits a similar shape to the known two-point correlation function toward quasars, $\xi^{QSO}(\Delta v)$. An empirical kinematic model suggests that these results are a natural consequence of wide-beam observations of an unresolved clumpy medium. Our model recovers both the underlying velocity dispersion of the clumps ($70$--$170$ \kms) and the mean number of clumps per unit area ($2$--$13$ kpc$^{-2}$). The latter constrains the projected mean inter-clump distance to within $\approx0.3$--$0.8$ kpc, which we argue is a measure of clump size for near-unity covering fraction. The model is also able to predict $\xi^{arc}(\Delta v)$ from $\xi^{QSO}(\Delta v)$, suggesting that the strong systems that shape the former and the line-of-sight velocity components that define the latter trace the same kinematic population. Consequently, the clumps must possess an internal density structure that generates both weak and strong components. We discuss how our interpretation is consistent with previous observations using background galaxies and multiple quasars.</description>

      <title>Gas flows in the central region of the Seyfert galaxy NGC 4593 with MUSE</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.03110</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.03110v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Understanding how gas flows into galactic centres, fuels the AGN, and is in turn expelled back through feedback processes is of great importance to appreciate the role AGN play in the growth and evolution of galaxies. We use the MUSE-AO optical spectra of the inner 7".5x 7".5 of the nearby Seyfert 1 galaxy NGC 4593 to characterise its ionised gas kinematics. We fit single-Gaussian components to the [O iii]$\lambda$ 5007 and [N ii]$\lambda$ 6583 emission lines, and double-Gaussian components to H$\alpha$ and H$\beta$ to determine the main ionisation mechanism of the gas. To determine the kinematics of the ionised gas, we fit double-Gaussian components to the [O iii]$\lambda$ 5007 line. Based on the stellar kinematic maps, we confirm the presence of a rotating disc. For the ionised gas, we find high-velocity dispersion values of up to $\mathrm{200-250\,km\,s^{-1}}$ that show that part of the gas is highly perturbed. The dominant ionisation mechanism of the gas is AGN photoionisation, which reaches the highest values within the innermost 4arcsec (680pc) diameter of the galaxy. At larger radii, the emission line ratios correspond to values in the composite region of the BPT diagram. The broad-component of [O iii]$\lambda$ 5007 shows blue-shifted velocities on the east side of the central 2arcsec (340pc), which spatially coincide with a region of high velocity-dispersion. This confirms the presence of outflowing gas. We estimate a mass outflow rate and kinetic power of ${\dot{M}}\geq {0.048 \,M_\odot\,{{\rm yr}^{-1}} }$ and ${\dot{E}_{\text{kin}}} \geq 4.09 \times 10^{39} \, \text{erg} \, \text{s}^{-1}$. The derived mass outflow rate is consistent with that expected from empirical relations between mass outflow rate and AGN luminosity for a low-luminosity AGN such as NGC 4593.</description>

      <title>A negligible contribution of two luminous $z$ ~ 7.5 galaxies to the ionizing photon budget of reionization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.03337</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.03337v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present indirect constraints on the absolute escape fraction of ionizing photons ($f_{\rm esc}^{\rm LyC}$) of the system GN 42912 which comprises two luminous galaxies ($M_{\rm UV}$ magnitudes of -20.89 and -20.37) at $z\sim7.5$, GN 42912-NE and GN 42912-SW, to determine their contribution to the ionizing photon budget of the Epoch of Reionization (EoR). The high-resolution James Webb Space Telescope NIRSpec and NIRCam observations reveal the two galaxies are separated by only ~0.1$"$ (0.5 kpc) on the sky and have a 358 km s$^{-1}$ velocity separation. GN 42912-NE and GN 42912-SW are relatively massive for this redshift (log($M_\ast/M_\odot$) $\sim$ 8.4 and 8.9, respectively), with gas-phase metallicities of 18 per cent and 23 per cent solar, O$_{32}$ ratios of 5.3 and $&gt;5.8$, and $\beta$ slopes of $-1.92$ and $-1.51$, respectively. We use the Mg II$\lambda\lambda$2796,2803 doublet to constrain $f_{\rm esc}^{\rm LyC}$. Mg II has an ionization potential close to that of neutral hydrogen and, in the optically thin regime, can be used as an indirect tracer of the LyC leakage. We establish realistic conservative upper limits on $f_{\rm esc}^{\rm LyC}$ of 8.5 per cent for GN 42912-NE and 14 per cent for GN 42912-SW. These estimates align with $f_{\rm esc}^{\rm LyC}$ trends observed with $\beta$, O$_{32}$, and the H$\beta$ equivalent width at $z&lt;4$. The small inferred ionized region sizes ($&lt;0.3$ pMpc) around both galaxies indicate they have not ionized a significant fraction of the surrounding neutral gas. While these $z&gt;7$ $f_{\rm esc}^{\rm LyC}$ constraints do not decisively determine a specific reionization model, they support a minor contribution from these two relatively luminous galaxies to the EoR.</description>

      <title>JWST/NIRCam Narrowband Survey of Pa$\beta$ Emitters in the Spiderweb Protocluster at z=2.16</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.03362</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.03362v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We report the initial result of our Pa$\beta$ narrowband imaging on a protocluster with the JWST Near Infrared Camera (NIRCam). As NIRCam enables deep narrowband imaging of rest-frame NIR lines at $z&gt;1$, we target one of the most studied protoclusters, the Spiderweb protocluster at $z=2.16$, in which previous studies have confirmed more than a hundred member galaxies. The NIRCam F405N narrowband filter covers in Pa$\beta$ line the protocluster redshift given by known protocluster members, allowing the search for new member candidates. The weight-corrected color-magnitude diagram obtained 57 sources showing narrowband excesses, 41 of which satisfy further color selection criteria for limiting the sample to Pa$\beta$ emitter candidates at $z\sim2.16$, and 24 of them do not have H$\alpha$ emitter counterparts. The Pa$\beta$ emitter candidates appear to follow the spatial distribution of known protocluster members; however, follow-up spectroscopic confirmation is required. Only 17 out of 58 known H$\alpha$-emitting cluster members are selected as Pa$\beta$ emitters in the current data, albeit the rest fall out of the narrowband selection owing to their small Pa$\beta$ equivalent widths. We derive Pa$\beta$ luminosity function in the Spiderweb protocluster, showing a normalization density of $\log{\phi^\ast}=-2.53\pm0.15$ at a characteristic Pa$\beta$ luminosity of $\log{L^\ast}=42.33\pm0.17$. Furthermore, we examine the possibility of detecting faint line emitters visible only in the narrow-band image, but find no promising candidates.</description>

      <title>JWST/NIRCam Pa$\mathrm{\beta}$ narrow-band imaging reveals ordinary dust extinction for H$\mathrm{\alpha}$ emitters within the Spiderweb protocluster at z=2.16</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.03366</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.03366v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We combine JWST/NIRCam and Subaru/MOIRCS dual Pa$\mathrm{\beta}$ + H$\mathrm{\alpha}$ narrow-band imaging to trace the dust attenuation and the star-formation activities of a sample of 43 H$\mathrm{\alpha}$ emitters at the core of one of the most massive and best-studied clusters in formation at the cosmic noon: the Spiderweb protocluster at $\mathrm{z=2.16}$. We find that most H$\mathrm{\alpha}$ emitters display Pa$\mathrm{\beta}$/H$\mathrm{\alpha}$ ratios compatible with Case B recombination conditions, which translates into nebular extinction values ranging at $\mathrm{A_V\approx0-3}$ magnitudes, and dust corrected $\mathrm{Pa\beta}$ star formation rates consistent with coeval main sequence field galaxies at fixed stellar mass ($\mathrm{9.4&lt;\log M_*/M_\odot&lt;11.0}$) during this cosmic epoch. Furthermore, we investigate possible environmental impacts on dust extinction across the protocluster large-scale structure and find no correlation between the dustiness of its members and environmental proxies such as phase-space position, clustercentric radius, or local density. These results support the scenario for which dust production within the main galaxy population of this protocluster is driven by secular star formation activities fueled by smooth gas accretion across its large-scale structure. This downplays the role of gravitational interactions in boosting star formation and dust production within the Spiderweb protocluster, in contrast with observations in higher redshift and less evolved protocluster cores.</description>

      <title>Application of the FRADO model of BLR formation to the Seyfert galaxy NGC 5548 and the first step toward determining the Hubble constant</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.03597</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.03597v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The dynamical and geometric structures of the Broad Line Region (BLR), along with the origins of continuum time delays in active galaxies, remain topics of ongoing debate. In this study, we aim to reproduce the broadband spectrum, the H$\beta$ line delay, and the continuum time delays available for the source NGC 5548. We employ the standard accretion disk model with the option of an inner hot flow, alongside the lamp-post model to account for disk irradiation and a BLR structure model based on radiation pressure acting on dust. The model is parameterized by the black hole mass (fixed), accretion rate, viewing angle, lamp-post height, cloud density, and cloud covering factor. The resulting continuum delays are calculated as a combination of disk reprocessing and the reprocessing of a fraction of radiation by the BLR. Our model reasonably reproduces the observed broad-band continuum, the H$\beta$ delay, and the continuum inter-band time delays measured during the observational campaign. When the accretion rate is not fixed based on the known distance to the source, we can directly estimate the distance from our model. The resulting value of H$_0$ = $69.03^{+17.81}_{-11.75}$ km s$^{-1}$ Mpc$^{-1}$ represents a noteworthy improvement compared to the findings of Cackett et al. (2007). This pilot study demonstrates that, with sufficient data coverage, it is possible to disentangle the time delays originating from the accretion disk and the BLR. This paves the way for effectively using inter-band continuum time delays in determining the Hubble constant. Additionally, the findings support the adopted model for the formation of the H$\beta$ line.</description>

      <title>Cosmological predictions for minor axis stellar density profiles in the inner regions of Milky Way-mass galaxies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.03627</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.03627v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: $\Lambda$CDM cosmology predicts the hierarchical formation of galaxies which build up mass by merger events and accreting smaller systems. The stellar halo of the Milky Way has proven to be useful a tool for tracing this accretion history. However, most of this work has focused on the outer halo where dynamical times are large and the dynamical properties of accreted systems are preserved. In this work, we investigate the inner galaxy regime, where dynamical times are relatively small and systems are generally completely phase-mixed. Using the FIRE-2 and Auriga cosmological zoom-in simulation suites of Milky Way-mass galaxies, we find the stellar density profiles along the minor axis (perpendicular to the galactic disk) within the NFW scale radii (R$\approx$15 kpc) are best described as an exponential disk with scale height &lt;0.3 kpc and a power law component with slope $\alpha\approx$-4. The stellar density amplitude and slope for the power law component is not significantly correlated with metrics of the galaxy's accretion history. Instead, we find the stellar profiles strongly correlate with the dark matter profile. Across simulation suites, the galaxies studied in this work have a stellar to dark matter mass ratio that decreases as $1/r^2$ along the minor axis.</description>

      <title>Connecting Lyman-$\alpha$ and ionizing photon escape in the Sunburst Arc</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.03660</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.03660v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the Lyman-$\alpha$ (Ly$\alpha$) and Lyman continuum (LyC) properties of the Sunburst Arc, a $z=2.37$ gravitationally lensed galaxy with a multiply-imaged, compact region leaking LyC and a triple-peaked Ly$\alpha$ profile indicating direct Ly$\alpha$ escape. Non-LyC-leaking regions show a redshifted Ly$\alpha$ peak, a redshifted and central Ly$\alpha$ peak, or a triple-peaked Ly$\alpha$ profile. We measure the properties of the Ly$\alpha$ profile from different regions of the galaxy using $R\sim5000$ Magellan/MagE spectra. We compare the Ly$\alpha$ spectral properties to LyC and narrowband Ly$\alpha$ maps from Hubble Space Telescope (HST) imaging to explore the subgalactic Ly$\alpha-$LyC connection. We find strong correlations (Pearson correlation coefficient $r&gt;0.6$) between the LyC escape fraction ($f_{\rm esc}^{\rm LyC}$) and Ly$\alpha$ (1) peak separation $v_{\rm{sep}}$, (2) ratio of the minimum flux density between the redshifted and blueshifted Ly$\alpha$ peaks to continuum flux density $f_{\rm{min}}/f_{\rm{cont}}$, and (3) equivalent width. We favor a complex \ion{H}{1} geometry to explain the Ly$\alpha$ profiles from non-LyC-leaking regions and suggest two \ion{H}{1} geometries that could diffuse and/or rescatter the central Ly$\alpha$ peak from the LyC-leaking region into our sightline across transverse distances of several hundred parsecs. Our results emphasize the complexity of Ly$\alpha$ radiative transfer and its sensitivity to the anisotropies of \ion{H}{1} gas on subgalactic scales. Large differences in the physical scales on which we observe spatially variable direct escape Ly$\alpha$, blueshifted Ly$\alpha$, and escaping LyC photons in the Sunburst Arc underscore the importance of resolving the physical scales that govern Ly$\alpha$ and LyC escape.</description>

      <title>The galaxy-IGM connection in THESAN: observability and information content of the galaxy-Lyman-$\alpha$ cross-correlation at z$\geq$6</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.02850</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.02850v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The galaxy--Lyman-$\alpha$ cross-correlation (GaLaCC) is a promising tool to study the interplay of galaxies and inter-galactic medium (IGM) in the first billion years of the Universe. Here we thoroughly characterise the impact of observational limitations on our ability to retrieve the intrinsic GaLaCC and provide new physical insights on its origin and connection to other IGM properties. This is extremely relevant to identify promising datasets, design future surveys and assess the limitations of current measurements. We find that sightline-to-sightline variations demand at least 25 independent sightlines to quantitatively recover the true signal. Once this condition is met, the intrinsic signal can be recovered even for a relatively low signal-to-noise ratio and spectral resolution. The galaxy selection method does not affect the inferred GaLaCC and lightcone effects are only relevant for redshift windows $\Delta z \gtrsim 0.5$. We discuss the implications of these findings for previous theoretical studies. We elucidate explicitly for the first time the physical origin of the GaLaCC and demonstrate that this signal is collectively sourced by the ensemble of galaxies residing in overdense regions rather than individual objects. We show that GaLaCC measured for opaque sightlines shows a larger peak at smaller scales with respect to transparent lines of sight. We connect this to the evolution of the mean free path of ionizing photons, showing that GaLaCC peak position has a very similar evolution but on smaller scales, as it probes only the core of ionised regions. Finally, we discuss which ongoing surveys can be used to measure the GaLaCC and provide an initial analysis of future developments, including using galaxies as background sources. Our results outline a bright future for the GaLaCC as a tool to unveil the galaxy-IGM interplay during the first billion years of the Universe.</description>

      <title>The galaxy-IGM connection in THESAN: the physics connecting the IGM Lyman-$\alpha$ opacity and galaxy density in the reionization epoch</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.02853</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.02853v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The relation between the Lyman-$\alpha$ effective optical depth of quasar sightlines ($\tau_\mathrm{los}$) and the distribution of galaxies around them is an emerging probe of the connection between the first collapsed structures and the IGM properties at the tail end of cosmic reionization. We employ the THESAN simulations to demonstrate that $\tau_\mathrm{los}$ is most sensitive to galaxies at a redshift-dependent distance, reflecting the growth of ionized regions around sources of photons and in agreement with studies of the galaxy--Lyman-$\alpha$ cross correlation. This is $d \sim 15 \, h^{-1} \, \mathrm{Mpc}$ at the tail end of reionization. The flagship THESAN run struggles to reproduce the most opaque sightlines as well as those with large galaxy densities, likely as a consequence of its limited volume. We identify a promising region of parameter space to probe with future observations in order to distinguish both the timing and sources of reionization. We present an investigation of the IGM physical conditions around opaque and transparent spectra, revealing that they probe regions that reionized inside-out and outside-in, respectively, and demonstrate that residual neutral islands at the end of reionization are not required to produce optical depths of $\tau_\mathrm{los} &gt; 4$, although they facilitate the task. Finally, we investigate the sensitivity of the aforementioned results to the nature of ionizing sources and dark matter.</description>

      <title>Along the Primary Curve: Simultaneous Source and Lens Reconstruction of Bright Arcs in Cluster Lenses</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.02859</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.02859v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Gravitational lensing is the phenomenon arising when light rays are deflected by the mass between the source and the observer. Largely magnified and highly distorted images of background galaxies are formed by these angular deflections if the deflecting mass distribution and the background sources align. As the most massive gravitationally bound objects in the universe, galaxy clusters are places where such alignments are usually found. By carefully analyzing the images of lensed galaxies, one can measure the mass, both visible and invisible, along the line-of-sight. These measurements are crucial in investigating the nature of dark matter, which constitutes most of the mass within clusters. Existing lensing analysis methods typically forward model the multiple images of dozens of background galaxies lensed by the cluster. To make this forward modeling computationally tractable, these multiple images are reduced to a much smaller summary data vector, which includes the locations, magnifications, and distortions. Our work avoids this loss of information by forward modeling the data at pixel-level. We develop a parametric model for the angular deflections near the bright arcs that allows us to control the shape of the curve that gives the directions of the eigenvectors of the Jacobian of the lensing matrix. The bright and extended images often follow such curves. We apply our analysis method to the bright arcs in gravitational lenses SDSS J1110+6459 and SDSS J0004-0103. We present our lens and source reconstructions for each system. With the application of our new method to many other lensing systems, we anticipate significant improvement in lens modeling near the critical curve, which will provide higher precision mass reconstructions for the deflectors. High-precision lens models allow for more robust de-lensing, which aids the studies of various highly magnified sources.</description>

      <title>Black hole spin evolution across cosmic time from the NewHorizon simulation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.02875</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.02875v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Astrophysical black holes (BHs) have two fundamental properties: mass and spin. While the mass-evolution of BHs has been extensively studied, much less work has been done on predicting the distribution of BH spins. In this paper we present the spin evolution for a sample of intermediate-mass and massive BHs from the newHorizon simulation, which evolved BH spin across cosmic time in a full cosmological context through gas accretion, BH-BH mergers and BH feedback including jet spindown. As BHs grow, their spin evolution alternates between being dominated by gas accretion and BH mergers. Massive BHs are generally highly spinning.Accounting for the spin energy extracted through the Blandford-Znajek mechanism increases the scatter in BH spins, especially in the mass range $10^{5-7} \rm \ M_\odot$, where BHs had previously been predicted to be almost universally maximally spinning. We find no evidence for spin-down through efficient chaotic accretion. As a result of their high spin values, massive BHs have an average radiative efficiency of $&lt;\varepsilon_{\rm r}^{\rm thin}&gt; \approx 0.19$. As BHs spend much of their time at low redshift with a radiatively inefficient thick disc, BHs in our sample remain hard to observe. Different observational methods probe different sub-populations of BHs, significantly influencing the observed distribution of spins. Generally, X-ray-based methods and higher luminosity cuts increase the average observed BH spin. When taking BH spin evolution into account, BHs inject on average between 3 times (in quasar mode) and 8 times (in radio mode) as much feedback energy into their host galaxy as previously assumed.</description>

      <title>A Multi-Wavelength Characterization of the Obscuring Medium at the Center of NGC 6300</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.02878</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.02878v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Most of the super-massive black holes in the Universe accrete material in an obscured phase. While it is commonly accepted that the "dusty torus" is responsible for the nuclear obscuration, its geometrical, physical, and chemical properties are far from being properly understood. In this paper, we take advantage of the multiple X-ray observations taken between 2007 and 2020, as well as of optical to far infra-red (FIR) observations of NGC 6300, a nearby ($z=0.0037$) Seyfert 2 galaxy. The goal of this project is to study the nuclear emission and the properties of the obscuring medium, through a multi-wavelength study conducted from X-ray to IR. We perform a simultaneous X-ray spectral fitting and optical-FIR spectral energy distribution (SED) fitting to investigate the obscuring torus. For the X-ray spectral fitting, physically motivated torus models, such as borus02, UXClumpy and XClumpy are used. The SED fitting is done using XCIGALE. Through joint analysis, we constrain the physical parameters of the torus and the emission properties of the accreting supermassive black hole. Through X-ray observations taken in the last 13 years, we have not found any significant line-of-sight column density variability for this source, but observed the X-ray flux dropping $\sim40-50\%$ in 2020 with respect to previous observations. The UXClumpy model predicts the presence of an inner ring of Compton-thick gaseous medium, responsible for the reflection dominated spectra above 10 keV. Through multi-wavelength SED fitting, we measure an Eddington accretion rate $\lambda_{\rm{Edd}}\sim2\times10^{-3}$, which falls in the range of the radiatively inefficient accretion solutions.</description>

      <title>Evidence of Truly Young high-$\alpha$ Dwarf Stars</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.02962</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.02962v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The existence of high-$\alpha$ stars with inferred ages &lt; 6 Gyr has been confirmed recently with large spectroscopic and photometric surveys. However, stellar mergers or binary interactions can induce properties associated with young ages, such as high mass, rapid rotation, or high activity, even in old populations. Literature studies have confirmed that at least some of these apparently young stars are old merger products. However, none have ruled out the possibility of genuinely young high-$\alpha$ stars. Because cool GKM dwarfs spin down, rapid rotation can be used to indicate youth. In this paper, we provide strong evidence that truly young high-$\alpha$ stars exist by studying high-$\alpha$ rotators in the Kepler and K2 field with abundance measurements from GALAH and APOGEE. After excluding close binaries using radial velocity (RV) measurements from Gaia DR3 and multi-epoch RVs from APOGEE, we find a total of 70 high-$\alpha$ rapid rotators with periods ~10-30 days, 29 of which have lithium measurements from GALAH, indicating that they have not gone through past mass transfer or stellar merger events. We identify 10 young high-$\alpha$ candidates with no signs of merger-induced mixing or close companions. One clear example is a G dwarf with a measurable rotation and an age of 1.98$^{+0.12}_{-0.28}$ Gyr that is likely a single star with multiple RV measurements from APOGEE, has significant lithium detection from GALAH (A(Li) = 1.79), and has no signs of planet engulfment.</description>

Abstract: The first images of the black holes in Sagittarius A* and M87* have created a wide range of new scientific opportunities in gravitational physics, compact objects, and relativistic astrophysics. We discuss here the scientific opportunities that arise from the rich data sets that have already been obtained and the new data sets that will be obtained, exploiting a wide range of technical advances, including observational agility, receiver upgrades, and the addition of new stations. This document provides a 5-year framework for Event Horizon Telescope (EHT) science structured around four fundamental questions that are used to prioritize the analysis of existing data, guide technical upgrades, and determine the optimal use of future observational opportunities with EHT, ALMA, and multi-wavelength facilities. Through enhancements over this period, the EHT will create the first movie of M87* connecting black hole and jet physics, provide detailed studies of the structure and dynamics of Sgr A*, characterize the magnetospheres of both systems through polarimetric imaging, and explore the spacetime properties of black holes with greater precision and range.</description>

      <title>Variability of Central Stars of Planetary Nebulae with the Zwicky Transient Facility. I. Methods, Short-Timescale Variables, Binary Candidates, and the Unusual Nucleus of WeSb 1</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.03589</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.03589v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Over the past several decades, time-series photometry of CSPNe has yielded significant results including, but not limited to, discoveries of nearly 100 binary systems, insights into pulsations and winds in young white dwarfs, and studies of stars undergoing very late thermal pulses. We have undertaken a systematic study of optical photometric variability of cataloged CSPNe, using the epochal photometric data from the Zwicky Transient Facility (ZTF). By applying appropriate variability metrics, we arrive at a list of 94 significantly variable CSPNe. Based on the timescales of the light-curve activity, we classify the variables broadly into short- and long-timescale variables. In this first paper in this series, we focus on the former, which is the majority class comprising 83 objects. We infer periods for six sources for the first time, and recover several known periodic variables. Among the aperiodic sources, most exhibit a jitter around a median flux with a stable amplitude, and a few show outbursts. We draw attention to WeSb 1, which shows a different kind of variability: prominent deep and aperiodic dips, resembling transits from a dust/debris disk. We find strong evidence for a binary nature of WeSb 1 (possibly an A- to G-type companion). The compactness of the emission lines and inferred high electron densities make WeSb 1 a candidate for either an EGB 6-type planetary nucleus, or a symbiotic system inside an evolved planetary nebula, both of which are rare objects. To demonstrate further promise with ZTF, we report three additional newly identified periodic sources that do not appear in the list of highly variable sources. Finally, we also introduce a two-dimensional metric space defined by the von Neumann statistics and Pearson Skew and demonstrate its effectiveness in identifying unique variables of astrophysical interest, like WeSb 1.</description>

      <title>COZMIC. I. Cosmological Zoom-in Simulations with Initial Conditions Beyond CDM</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.03635</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.03635v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present $72$ cosmological dark matter (DM)--only N-body zoom-in simulations with initial conditions beyond cold, collisionless dark matter (CDM), as the first installment of the COZMIC suite. We simulate Milky Way (MW) analogs with linear matter power spectra, $P(k)$ for: i) thermal-relic warm dark matter (WDM) with masses $m_{\mathrm{WDM}}\in [3,4,5,6,6.5,10]~\mathrm{keV}$, ii) fuzzy dark matter (FDM) with masses $m_{\mathrm{FDM}}\in [25.9,69.4,113,151,185,490]\times 10^{-22}~\mathrm{eV}$, and iii) interacting dark matter (IDM) with a velocity-dependent elastic proton scattering cross section $\sigma=\sigma_0 v^n$ relative particle velocity scaling $n\in [2,4]$, and DM mass $m_{\mathrm{IDM}}\in[10^{-4},~ 10^{-2},~ 1]~\mathrm{GeV}$. Subhalo mass function (SHMF) suppression is significantly steeper in FDM versus WDM, while dark acoustic oscillations in $P(k)$ can reduce SHMF suppression for IDM. We fit SHMF models to our simulation results and derive new bounds on WDM and FDM from the MW satellite population, obtaining $m_{\mathrm{WDM}}&gt;5.9~\mathrm{keV}$ and $m_{\mathrm{FDM}}&gt;1.4\times 10^{-20}~\mathrm{eV}$ at $95\%$ confidence; these limits are $\approx 10\%$ weaker and $5\times$ stronger than previous constraints due to the updated transfer functions and SHMF models, respectively. We estimate IDM bounds for $n=2$ ($n=4$) and obtain $\sigma_0 &lt; 1.0\times 10^{-27}$, $1.3\times 10^{-24}$, and $3.1\times 10^{-23}~\mathrm{cm}^2$ ($\sigma_0 &lt; 9.9\times 10^{-27}$, $9.8\times 10^{-21}$, and $2.1\times 10^{-17}~\mathrm{cm}^2$) for $m_{\mathrm{IDM}}=10^{-4}$, $10^{-2}$, and $1$ GeV, respectively. Thus, future development of IDM SHMF models can improve IDM cross section bounds by up to a factor of $\sim 20$ with current data. COZMIC presents an important step toward accurate small-scale structure modeling in beyond-CDM cosmologies, critical to upcoming observational searches for DM physics.</description>

      <title>Impact of Dynamical Friction on the Tidal Formation of NGC 1052-DF2</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.07756</link>
      <description>arXiv:2306.07756v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The formation of dark matter-deficient galaxies (DMDGs) through tidal interactions has been a subject of growing interest, particularly with the discovery of galaxies such as NGC 1052-DF2. Previous studies suggested that strong tidal forces could strip dark matter from satellite galaxies, but the role of dynamical friction in this process has been largely overlooked. In this paper, we present self-consistent N-body simulations that incorporate the effects of dynamical friction on the tidal formation of DF2, and compare them with the one without dynamical friction. We find that dynamical friction significantly accelerates the decay of the satellite galaxy's orbit, causing it to experience more frequent tidal stripping and leading to the earlier formation of a DM-deficient state, approximately 7-8 Gyr after infall. This is a few Gyr earlier than simulations without dynamical friction. Our results suggest that DMDGs can form in a wider range of orbital configurations, particularly on more circular orbits, than previously thought. Furthermore, we find that globular clusters in the DM-deficient phase exhibit elevated velocity dispersion, providing an observational signature of this evolutionary stage. We also examine the evolution of satellite in the phase space of total energy versus angular momentum, and show that a vertically narrow feature in this phase space is a clear signature of pericentre passage. These findings broaden the understanding of how DMDGs form and highlight the critical role of dynamical friction in shaping the evolutionary history of satellite galaxies in massive halos.</description>

      <title>z~2 dual AGN host galaxies are disky: stellar kinematics in the ASTRID Simulation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2312.14263v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study dual AGN host galaxy morphologies at $z=2$ using the ASTRID simulation, selecting black hole (BH) pairs with small separation ($\Delta r&lt;30\rm{kpc}$), high mass ($M_{\text{BH,12}}&gt;10^7M_\odot$), and luminosity ($L_{\text{bol,12}}&gt;10^{43}\rm{erg/s}$). We kinematically decompose (using MORDOR) $\sim1000$ dual AGN hosts into standard components - a `disk' (thin and thick disk, pseudo-bulge) and 'bulge' (bulge and halo) and define disk-dominated galaxies by the disk-to-total $D/T\geq0.5$. In ASTRID, $60.9\pm2.1\%$ of dual AGN hosts (independent of separation) are disk-dominated, with the $D/T$ distribution peaking at $\sim0.7$. Notably, hosts of BH pairs have similar morphologies (most either both disk or bulge-dominated). In dual-AGN hosts, the $D/T$ increases from $\sim17\% $ at $M_{\rm *}\sim 10^{9} M_{\odot}$ to $ 64\% $ for $M_{\rm *} \sim 10^{11.5} M_{\odot}$, and the pseudo-bulge is the dominant component of the disk fraction at the high mass end. Moreover, dual AGN hosts exhibit a higher fraction of disk/large pseudo-bulge than single-AGN hosts. The Disk-to-Total ratio is approximately constant with BH mass or AGN luminosity. We also create mock images of dual AGN host galaxies, employing morphological fitting software Statmorph to calculate morphological parameters and compare them with our kinematic decomposition results. Around $83.3\pm2.4\%$ of galaxies display disk-like profiles, of which $\sim60.7\pm2.2\%$ are kinematically confirmed as disks. Se\'rsic indices and half-mass radii of dual AGN host galaxies align with observational measurements from HST at $z\sim2$. Around $34\%$ are identified as mergers from the $\text{Gini}-M_{20}$ relation. We find two dual AGN hosted by galaxies that exhibit disk-like se\'rsic index $n_{12}&lt;1$ and $(D/T)_{12}&gt;0.5$, which are in remarkable agreement with properties of recently discovered dual quasars in disk galaxies at $z\sim 2$.</description>

      <title>Metallicity distributions of halo stars: do they trace the Galactic accretion history?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.13737</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.13737v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The standard cosmological scenario predicts a hierarchical formation for galaxies. Many substructures were found in the Galactic halo, identified as clumps in kinematic spaces, like the energy-angular momentum one (E-Lz), under the hypothesis of the conservation of these quantities. If these clumps also feature different chemical properties, e.g. metallicity distribution functions (MDF), they are often associated to independent merger debris. The aim of this study is to explore to what extent we can couple kinematics and metallicities of stars in the Galactic halo to reconstruct the accretion history of the Milky Way. In particular, we want to understand whether different clumps in the E-Lz space with different MDF should be associated to distinct merger debris. We analysed dissipationless, self-consistent high-resolution N-body simulations of a MW-type galaxy accreting a satellite with mass ratio 1:10, with different orbital parameters and metallicity gradients (assigned a posteriori). We confirm that accreted stars from a ~1:10 satellite redistribute in a wide range of E and Lz, due to the dynamical friction, thus not being associated to a single clump. Because satellite stars with different metallicities can be deposited in different regions of the E-Lz space (on average the more metal-rich ones end up more gravitationally bound to the MW), this implies that a single ~1:10 accretion can manifest with different MDFs, in different regions of the E-Lz space. Groups of stars with different E, Lz and metallicities may be interpreted as originating from different satellites, but our analysis shows that these interpretations are not physically motivated. In fact, the coupling of kinematics with MDFs to reconstruct the accretion history of the MW can bias the reconstructed merger tree towards increasing the number of past accretions and decreasing the masses of the progenitor galaxies.</description>

      <title>How the Galaxy-Halo Connection Depends on Large-Scale Environment</title>

      <description>arXiv:2402.07995v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate the connection between galaxies, dark matter halos, and their large-scale environments at $z=0$ with Illustris TNG300 hydrodynamic simulation data. We predict stellar masses from subhalo properties to test two types of machine learning (ML) models: Explainable Boosting Machines (EBMs) with simple galaxy environment features and $\mathbb{E}(3)$-invariant graph neural networks (GNNs). The best-performing EBM models leverage spherically averaged overdensity features on $3$ Mpc scales. Interpretations via SHapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP) also suggest that, in the context of the TNG300 galaxy-halo connection, simple spherical overdensity on $\sim 3$ Mpc scales is more important than cosmic web distance features measured using the DisPerSE algorithm. Meanwhile, a GNN with connectivity defined by a fixed linking length, $L$, outperforms the EBM models by a significant margin. As we increase the linking length scale, GNNs learn important environmental contributions up to the largest scales we probe ($L=10$ Mpc). We conclude that $3$ Mpc distance scales are most critical for describing the TNG galaxy-halo connection using the spherical overdensity parameterization but that information on larger scales, which is not captured by simple environmental parameters or cosmic web features, can further augment these models. Our study highlights the benefits of using interpretable ML algorithms to explain models of astrophysical phenomena, and the power of using GNNs to flexibly learn complex relationships directly from data while imposing constraints from physical symmetries.</description>

      <title>Magnetic field morphology and evolution in the Central Molecular Zone and its effect on gas dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.13048</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.13048v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The interstellar medium in the Milky Way's Central Molecular Zone (CMZ) is known to be strongly magnetised, but its large-scale morphology and impact on the gas dynamics are not well understood. We explore the impact and properties of magnetic fields in the CMZ using three-dimensional non-self gravitating magnetohydrodynamical simulations of gas flow in an external Milky Way barred potential. We find that: (1) The magnetic field is conveniently decomposed into a regular time-averaged component and an irregular turbulent component. The regular component aligns well with the velocity vectors of the gas everywhere, including within the bar lanes. (2) The field geometry transitions from parallel to the Galactic plane near $z=0$ to poloidal away from the plane. (3) The magneto-rotational instability (MRI) causes an in-plane inflow of matter from the CMZ gas ring towards the central few parsecs of $0.01-0.1$ M$_\odot$ yr$^{-1}$ that is absent in the unmagnetised simulations. However, the magnetic fields have no significant effect on the larger-scale bar-driven inflow that brings the gas from the Galactic disc into the CMZ. (4) A combination of bar inflow and MRI-driven turbulence can sustain a turbulent vertical velocity dispersion of $\sigma_z \simeq 5$ km s$^{-1}$ on scales of $20$ pc in the CMZ ring. The MRI alone sustains a velocity dispersion of $\sigma_z \simeq 3$ km s$^{-1}$. Both these numbers are lower than the observed velocity dispersion of gas in the CMZ, suggesting that other processes such as stellar feedback are necessary to explain the observations. (5) Dynamo action driven by differential rotation and the MRI amplifies the magnetic fields in the CMZ ring until they saturate at a value that scales with the average local density as $B \simeq 102 (n/10^3 cm^{-3})^{0.33}$ $\mu$G. Finally, we discuss the implications of our results within the observational context in the CMZ.</description>

Abstract: Context. The recent detection of nitrogen-enhanced, metal-poor galaxies at high redshift by the James Webb Space Telescope has sparked renewed interest in exploring the chemical evolution of carbon, nitrogen, and oxygen (the CNO elements) at early times, prompting fresh inquiries into their origins. Aims. The main goal of this paper is to shed light onto the early evolution of the main CNO isotopes in our Galaxy and in young distant systems, such as GN-z11 at z=10.6. Methods. To this aim, we incorporate a stochastic star-formation component into a chemical evolution model calibrated with high-quality Milky Way (MW) data, focusing on the contribution of Population III (Pop III) stars to the early chemical enrichment. Results. By comparing the model predictions with CNO abundance measurements from high-resolution spectroscopy of an homogeneous sample of Galactic halo stars, we first demonstrate that the scatter observed in the metallicity range -4.5 &lt; [Fe/H] &lt;-1.5 can be explained by pre-enrichment from Pop III stars that explode as supernovae (SNe) with different initial masses and energies. Then, by exploiting the chemical evolution model, we provide testable predictions for log(C/N), log(N/O), and log(C/O) vs. log(O/H)+12 in MW-like galaxies observed at different cosmic epochs/redshifts. Finally, by calibrating the chemical evolution model to replicate the observed properties of GN-z11, we provide an alternative interpretation of its log(N/O) abundance ratio, demonstrating that its high N content can be reproduced through enrichment from high-mass faint Pop III SNe. Conclusions. Stochastic chemical enrichment from primordial stars explains both the observed scatter in CNO abundances in MW halo stars and the exceptionally high N/O ratios in some distant galaxies. These findings emphasize the critical role of Pop III stars in shaping early chemical evolution.</description>

      <title>Luminosity Evolution of the Hot Gas in Normal Galaxies from the Near Universe to z=0.5</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.16631</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.16631v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We explore the evolution of the ~107 degree hot gas in normal galaxies out to redshift = 0.5 (lookback time = 5 Gyr), using X-ray luminosity functions (XLF) built from a sample of 575 normal galaxies with z &lt; 0.6 detected in five high galactic latitude Chandra wide-field surveys. After estimating the emission due to the hot gas component (reducing the sample to ~400 galaxies), we compared the XLF in three redshift bins (z = 0.1, 0.3, and 0.5), finding increases in the number of galaxies per unit co-moving volume from z = 0.1 to 0.3 and then from z = 0.3 to 0.5. These XLF changes suggest a significant (~5s) X-ray luminosity evolution of the hot gas, with LX,GAS decreasing by a factor of 6-10 in the last 5 Gyr (from z = 0.5 to 0.1). The relative abundance of LX,GAS~1041 erg s-1 galaxies at higher z, suggests that high z, moderate LX,GAS galaxies may be the optimal target to solve the missing baryon problem. In early-type galaxies, this observational trend is qualitatively consistent with (but larger than) the expected time-dependent mass-loss rate in cooling flow models without AGN feedback. In late-type galaxies, the observational trend is also qualitatively consistent with (but larger than) the effect of the z-dependent SFR.</description>

      <title>Linking high-z and low-z: Are We Observing the Progenitors of the Milky Way with JWST?</title>

Abstract: The recent JWST observation of the Firefly Sparkle at $z=8.3$ offers a unique opportunity to link the high- and the low-$z$ Universe. Indeed, the claim of it being a Milky Way (MW) type of assembly at the cosmic dawn opens the possibility of interpreting the observation with locally calibrated galaxy-formation models. Here, we use the MW-evolution model NEFERTITI to perform forward modeling of our Galaxy's progenitors at high-$z$. We build a set of mock spectra for the MW building blocks to make predictions for JWST and to interpret the Firefly Sparkle observation. First, we find that the most massive MW progenitor becomes detectable in a deep survey like JADES from $z\approx 8.2$, meaning that we could have already observed MW-analogs that still need interpretation. Second, we provide predictions for the number of detectable MW progenitors in lensed surveys like CANUCS, and interpret the Firefly Sparkle as a group of MW building blocks. Both the number of detections and the observed NIRCam photometry are consistent with our predictions. By identifying the MW progenitors whose mock photometry best fits the data, we find bursty and extended star-formation histories, lasting $&gt; 150-300$~Myr, and estimate their properties: $M_h \approx 10^{8-9} \, M_{\odot}$, $ M_\star \approx 10^{6.2-7.5}\, M_{\odot}$, $ SFR \approx 0.04-0.20 \, M_{\odot} yr^{-1}$ and $ Z_{gas} \approx 0.04 - 0.24 \, Z_{\odot}$. Uncovering the properties of MW-analogs at cosmic dawn by combining JWST observations and locally-constrained models, will allow us to understand our Galaxy's formation, linking the high- and low-$z$ perspectives.</description>

      <title>Exploring a primordial solution for early black holes detected with the JWST</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.07162</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.07162v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) has unearthed black holes as massive as $10^{6.2-8.1}M_\odot$ at redshifts of $z \sim 8.5-10.6$ with many systems showing unexpectedly high black hole to stellar mass ratios &gt;=30%, posing a crucial challenge for theoretical models. Using analytic calculations, we explore the combination of {\it astrophysical} seeding mechanisms and Eddington accretion rates that can explain the observed objects. We then appeal to {\it cosmological} primordial black hole (PBH) seeds and show how these present an alternative path for "seeding" early structures and their baryonic contents. Assuming seeding (via astrophysical means) at a redshift of $z_{\rm seed}=25$ and continuous accretion, all of the black holes studied here can either be explained through super-Eddington accretion (at an Eddington fraction of $f_{\rm Edd}&lt;= 2.1 $) onto low-mass ($100M_\odot$) seeds or Eddington-limited accretion onto high-mass ($10^5 M_\odot$) seeds. The upper limit, where we assume a primordial origin for all of these black holes, yields a continuous primordial black hole mass function (between $10^{-5.25}$ and $10^{3.75} M_\odot$) and a fractional PBH value $&lt;= 10^{-12}$, in good agreement with observational constraints. Starting at the redshift of matter-radiation equality ($z \sim 3400$), we show how PBH-driven structure formation can reproduce the observed stellar and black hole masses for two of the highest redshift black holes (UHZ1 and GHZ9 at $z \sim 10.3$) with the same parameters governing star formation, black hole accretion and their feedbacks. Exploring a wide swathe of model parameter space for GHZ9, we find black hole-to-stellar mass ratios ranging between $0.1-1.86$ i.e. in some cases (of high supernova feedback), the black hole grows to be more massive than the stellar mass of its host, presenting an attractive alternative to seeding these puzzling early systems.</description>

      <title>The Villafranca project: Combining Gaia and ground-based surveys to study Galactic OB groups</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.21399v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The Villafranca project is studying Galactic stellar groups with OB stars combining information from $Gaia$ and ground-based surveys. We summarize the status of the project and we present its most important results. The Villafranca project has been used to produce a new astrometric calibration for $Gaia$ (E)DR3, which improves the previous one significantly for bright stars. We have discovered that dynamical interactions among massive stars at a very young age ($\sim$1 Ma or less) can play a significant interaction in the dynamical evolution of clusters. As a consequence, our current view of the massive-star IMF may be distorted and the number of free-floating neutron stars and black holes higher than previously considered.</description>

      <title>The spatial correlation between CN line and dust continuum emitting regions in high-mass star-forming cloud</title>

Abstract: Measuring the strength of three dimensional (3D) magnetic field vector is challenging as it is not easy to recognize whether its line-of-sight (LOS) and plane-of-sky (POS) components are obtained from the same region. CN ($N = 1 - 0$) emission has been used to get the LOS component of a magnetic field (B$_\mathrm{LOS}$) from its Zeeman splitting lines, while dust continuum emission has been used to get the POS component of a magnetic field (B$_\mathrm{POS}$). We use the CN ($N = 1 - 0$) data observed with the Taeduk Radio Astronomy Observatory (TRAO) 14-m telescope and the dust continuum data from $Herschel$ archive toward six high-mass star-forming regions in order to test whether CN line and dust continuum emission can trace a similar region and thus can be used for inferring 3D magnetic field strength. Our comparison between CN and H$_2$ column densities for all targets indicates that CN line emission tends to be strong toward bright continuum regions. The positions of peak CN column densities are particularly well correlated with those of peak H$_2$ column densities at least over the H$_2$ column density of 8.0 $\times$ 10$^{22}$ cm$^{-2}$ within one or two telescope beam size in all targets, implying that CN line and dust continuum emitting regions are likely spatially coincident. This enabled us to make the reliable measurement of 3D magnetic field strengths of five targets by taking a vector sum of their B$_\mathrm{LOS}$ and B$_\mathrm{POS}$, helping to decide the magnetical criticality of the targets as supercritical or transcritical.</description>

      <title>ISMGCC: Finding Gas Structures in Molecular Interstellar Medium Using Gaussian Decomposition and Graph Theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.01181</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.01181v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Molecular line emissions are commonly used to trace the distribution and properties of molecular Interstellar Medium (ISM). However, the emissions are heavily blended on the Galactic disk toward the inner Galaxy because of the relatively large line widths and the velocity overlaps of spiral arms. Structure identification methods based on voxel connectivity in PPV data cubes often produce unrealistically large structures, which is the ``over-linking'' problem. Therefore, identifying molecular cloud structures in these directions is not trivial. We propose a new method based on Gaussian decomposition and graph theory to solve the over-linking problem, named ISMGCC (InterStellar Medium Gaussian Component Clustering). Using the MWISP ${}^{13}\mathrm{CO}~(1-0)$ data in the range of $13.5^{\circ} \leq l \leq 14.5^{\circ}, |b| \leq 0.5^{\circ}$, and $-100\leq V_{\mathrm{LSR}} \leq +200~\mathrm{km~s^{-1}}$, our method identified three hundred molecular gas structures with at least 16 pixels. These structures contain $92\%$ of the total flux in the raw data cube and show single-peaked line profiles on more than $93\%$ of their pixels. The ISMGCC method could distinguish gas structures in crowded regions and retain most of the flux without global data clipping or assumptions on the structure geometry, meanwhile, allowing multiple Gaussian components for complicated line profiles.</description>

      <title>MAGICS III. Seeds sink swiftly: nuclear star clusters dramatically accelerate seed black hole mergers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.19095</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.19095v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Merger rate predictions of Massive Black Hole (MBH) seeds from large-scale cosmological simulations differ widely, with recent studies highlighting the challenge of low-mass MBH seeds failing to reach the galactic center, a phenomenon known as the seed sinking problem. In this work, we tackle this issue by integrating cosmological simulations and galaxy merger simulations from the MAGICS-I and MAGICS-II resimulation suites with high-resolution $N$-body simulations. Building on the findings of MAGICS-II, which showed that only MBH seeds embedded in stellar systems are able to sink to the center, we extend the investigation by incorporating nuclear star clusters (NSCs) into our models. Utilizing $N$-body resimulations with up to $10^7$ particles, we demonstrate that interactions between NSCs and their surrounding galactic environment, particularly tidal forces triggered by cluster interactions, significantly accelerate the sinking of MBHs to the galactic center. This process leads to the formation of a hard binary in $\lesssim 500$ Myr after the onset of a galaxy merger. Our results show that in 8 out of 12 models, the high stellar density of the surrounding NSCs enhances MBH hardening, facilitating gravitational wave (GW) mergers by redshift $z = 4$. We conclude that at $z &gt; 4$, dense NSCs serve as the dominant channel for MBH seed mergers, producing a merger rate of $0.3$--$0.6\, \mathrm{yr}^{-1}$ at $z = 4$, which is approximately 300--600 times higher than in non-NSC environments. In contrast, in environments without NSCs, surrounding dark matter plays a more significant role in loss-cone scattering.</description>

      <title>Discovery of interstellar 1-cyanopyrene: a four-ring polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon in TMC-1</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.00657v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) are expected to be the most abundant class of organic molecules in space. Their interstellar lifecycle is not well understood, and progress is hampered by difficulties detecting individual PAH molecules. Here, we present the discovery of CN-functionalized pyrene, a 4-ring PAH, in the dense cloud TMC-1 using the 100-m Green Bank Telescope. We derive an abundance of 1-cyanopyrene of ~1.52 x $10^{12}$ cm$^{-2}$, and from this estimate that the un-substituted pyrene accounts for up to ~0.03-0.3% of the carbon budget in the dense interstellar medium which trace the birth sites of stars and planets. The presence of pyrene in this cold (~10 K) molecular cloud agrees with its recent measurement in asteroid Ryugu where isotopic clumping suggest a cold, interstellar origin. The direct link to the birth site of our solar system is strengthened when we consider the solid state pyrene content in the pre-stellar materials compared to comets, which represent the most pristine material in the solar system. We estimate that solid state pyrene can account for 1% of the carbon within comets carried by this one single organic molecule. The abundance indicates pyrene is an "island of stability" in interstellar PAH chemistry and suggests a potential cold molecular cloud origin of the carbon carried by PAHs that is supplied to forming planetary systems, including habitable worlds such as our own.</description>

      <title>Constraints on conformal ultralight dark matter couplings from the European Pulsar Timing Array</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.01633v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Millisecond pulsars are extremely precise celestial clocks: as they rotate, the beamed radio waves emitted along the axis of their magnetic field can be detected with radio telescopes, which allows for tracking subtle changes in the pulsars' rotation periods. A possible effect on the period of a pulsar is given by a potential coupling to dark matter, in cases where it is modeled with an "ultralight" scalar field. In this paper, we consider a universal conformal coupling of the dark matter scalar to gravity, which in turn mediates an effective coupling between pulsars and dark matter. If the dark matter scalar field is changing in time, as expected in the Milky Way, this effective coupling produces a periodic modulation of the pulsar rotational frequency. By studying the time series of observed radio pulses collected by the European Pulsar Timing Array experiment, we present constraints on the coupling of dark matter, improving on existing bounds. These bounds can also be regarded as constraints on the parameters of scalar-tensor theories of the Fierz-Jordan-Brans-Dicke and Damour-Esposito-Far\`{e}se types in the presence of a (light) mass potential term.</description>

Abstract: We produce a new photometric calibration for the combined six-filter system formed by $Gaia$ DR2 + EDR3 $G$+$G_{\rm BP}$+$G_{\rm RP}$ using an improved STIS/HST spectrophotometric library with very red stars. The comparison between observed and synthetic photometry yields residual dispersions of just 3.4-8.7 mmag, resulting in the most accurate and precise whole-sky large-dynamic-range optical photometric system ever obtained. We include some tests and applications.</description>

      <title>Origin and full characterization of the secondary (assembly) halo bias</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.15935</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.15935v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The clustering of dark matter halos depends not only on their mass, the so-called primary bias, but also on their internal properties, the so-called secondary bias. While the former effect is well-understood within the Press-Schechter (PS) and excursion set (ES) models of structure formation, the latter is not. In those models, protohalos are fully characterised by their height and scale, which determine the halo mass and collapse time, so there is no room for any other halo property. This is why the secondary bias was believed not to be innate but due to the distinct merger rate of halos lying in different backgrounds, and dubbed assembly bias. However, it is now admitted that mergers leave no imprint in the inner halo properties. In fact, the innate origin of the secondary bias cannot be discarded because, in the more realistic peak model of structure formation, halo seeds are characterized by one additional property: the peak curvature. Here we use the confluent system of peak trajectories (CUSP) formalism to show that peaks lying in different backgrounds have different mean curvatures, which in turn cause them to evolve in halos with different typical inner properties. The dependence we find of the properties on halo background (or halo clustering) reproduces the results of simulations.</description>

      <title>The Tidal Torque Theory Revisited. I. Protohalo Angular Momentum</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.15939</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.15939v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: According to the Tidal Torque Theory (TTT), the angular momentum of haloes arises from the tidal torque produced on protohaloes by the mass fluctuations around them. That approach, initially developed assuming protohaloes as random overdense regions in the linear density field, was extended to the more realistic scenario that protohaloes are collapsing patches around peaks in the Gaussian-smoothed linear density field. But that extension faced two fundamental issues: 1) the unknown mass of collapsing patches marked by Gaussian peaks, and 2) the unknown ellipsoidal collapse time of those triaxial patches. Furthermore, the TTT strictly holds in linear regime only. This Paper is the first of a series of two devoted to revisiting the TTT and accurately calculating the halo angular momentum. In the present Paper we use the CUSP formalism fixing all those issues to deal with the TTT from a full peak model viewpoint, i.e. not only is the protohalo suffering the tidal torque identified to a peak, but the main mass fluctuation causing the tidal torque is also seen as a peak or a hole. This way we obtain a simple analytic expression for the Lagrangian protohalo AM, which can be readily implemented in galaxy formation models and be compared to the results of simulations.</description>

      <title>Unveiling the shape: a multi-wavelength analysis of the galaxy clusters Abell 76 and Abell 1307</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.16981</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.16981v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We analyse the dynamical state of the galaxy clusters Abell 76 and Abell 1307 from the optical point of view, presenting a coherent scenario that responds to the X-ray emissions observed in these structures. Our study is based on 231 and 164 spectroscopic redshifts, for the clusters A76 and A1307, respectively. We find that A76 and A1307 are two galaxy clusters at $z=0.0390$ and 0.0815, respectively, with velocity dispersions of $650 \pm 56$ km s$^{-1}$ and $863 \pm 85$ km s$^{-1}$, and showing velocity distributions following, in practice, Gaussian profiles. From our dynamical analysis, X-ray studies and SZ-Planck emission, we obtain a mean total mass M$_{500} = 1.7 \pm 0.6 \cdot 10^{14}$ M$_{\odot}$ and $3.5 \pm 1.3 \cdot 10^{14}$ M$_{\odot}$ for A76 and A1307, respectively. We find that the spatial distribution of likely cluster members in the case of A76 is very anisotropic, while A1307 shows a compact distribution of galaxies, but double peaked and elongated in the south-north direction. we compare the XMM-Newton surface brightness maps with galaxy distributions and see that both distributions are correlated. We reconstruct the total mass profile and velocity anisotropy of both clusters by analysing the full projected phase space, through the MG-MAMPOSSt code. Our study reveals a slight indication of radial orbits for A76, while A1307 seems to prefer more isotropic orbits in the whole cluster range. Summarizing, A76 represent a typical young cluster, in an early stage of formation, with a very low X-ray surface brightness but high temperature showing a very anisotropic galaxy distribution. A1307 is however more consolidated and massive showing in-homogeneous galaxy distribution and an asymmetric X-ray emission, which suggest a scenario characterised by recent minor mergers.</description>
