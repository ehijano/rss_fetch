      <title>A closer look at the extended edge-on low-surface brightness galaxies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.17548</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.17548v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: To understand the origin of extended disks of low-surface brightness (LSB) galaxies, we studied in detail 4 such systems with large disks seen edge-on. Two of them are edge-on giant LSB galaxies (gLSBGs) recently identified by our team. The edge-on orientation of these systems boosts their surface brightnesses that provided an opportunity to characterize stellar populations spectroscopically and yielded the first such measurements for edge-on gLSBGs. We collected deep images of one galaxy using the 1.4-m Milankovi\'c Telescope which we combined with the archival Subaru Hyper Suprime-Cam and DESI Legacy Surveys data available for the three other systems, and measured the structural parameters of the disks. We acquired deep long-slit spectra with the Russian 6-meter telescope and the 10-m Keck II telescope and estimated stellar population properties in the high- and low-surface brightness regions as well as the gas-phase metallicity distribution. The gas metallicity gradients are shallow to flat in the range between 0 and -0.03 dex per exponential disk scale length, which is consistent with the extrapolation of the gradient -- scale length relation for smaller disk galaxies. Our estimates of stellar velocity dispersion in the LSB disks as well as the relative thickness of the disks indicate the dynamical overheating. Our observations favor mergers as the essential stage in the formation scenario for massive LSB galaxies.</description>

      <title>Determining the Extents, Geometries, and Kinematics of Narrow-Line Region Outflows in Nearby Seyfert Galaxies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.17550</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.17550v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Outflowing gas from supermassive black holes in the centers of active galaxies has been postulated as a major contributor to galactic evolution. To explore the interaction between narrow-line region (NLR) outflows and their host galaxies, we use Hubble Space Telescope (HST) Space Telescope Imaging Spectrograph (STIS) spectra and Wide Field Camera 3 (WFC3) images of 15 nearby (z &lt; 0.02) active galactic nuclei (AGN) to determine the extents and geometries of their NLRs. We combine new HST WFC3 continuum and [O III] $\lambda$5007A images of 11 AGN with 4 archival AGN to match existing spectra from HST STIS. For the 6 AGN with suitable long-slit coverage of their NLRs, we use isophotal fitting of ground-based images, continuum-subtracted [O III] images, and the STIS spectra, to resolve, measure, and de-project the gas kinematics to the plane of the host galaxy disk and distinguish NLR outflows from galaxy rotation and/or kinematically disturbed gas. We find an average [O III] extent of $\sim$680pc with a correlation between gas extent and [O III] luminosity of R$_\mathrm{[O III]}$ $\propto$ L$_{\text{[O III]}}^{0.39}$. The measured extents depend strongly on the depth of the [O III] images, highlighting the importance of adopting uniform thresholds when analyzing scaling relationships. The outflows reach from 39-88% of the full NLR extents, and we find that all 6 of the AGN with STIS coverage of their entire NLRs show strong kinematic evidence for outflows, despite previous uncertainty for these AGN. This suggests that NLR outflows are ubiquitous in moderate luminosity AGN and that standard criteria for kinematic modeling are essential for identifying outflows.</description>

      <title>The BoRG-JWST Survey: Program Overview and First Confirmations of Luminous Reionization-Era Galaxies from Pure-Parallel Observations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.17551</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.17551v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present the BoRG-JWST survey, a combination of two JWST Cycle 1 programs aimed at obtaining NIRSpec spectroscopy of representative, UV-bright $7&lt;z&lt;10$ galaxy candidates across 22 independent sight lines selected from Hubble/WFC3 pure-parallel observations. We confirm the high-$z$ nature of 10 out of 19 observed primary targets through low-resolution prism observations, with the rest revealing themselves unsurprisingly to be $z\sim1-3$ interlopers, brown dwarfs, or yielding inconclusive results. From the MSA observations, we confirm an additional 9 filler sources at $z&gt;5$, highlighting the large abundance of high-redshift galaxies even in individual WFC3 pointings. The primary sample span an absolute magnitude range $-20.4&lt;M_{\rm UV}&lt;-22.4$ mag and harbour UV continuum slopes of $\beta\simeq-2.5$ to $-2.0$, representing some of the most luminous $z&gt;7$ sources currently known and comparable to the brightest sources at $z&gt;10$. Prominent [O III]+H$\beta$ lines are found across the full sample, while a stack of sources reveals a plethora of other rest-optical lines and additional rest-UV C III]1909 \r{A} emission. Despite their luminosities, none of the low-resolution spectra display evidence for Type 1 AGN activity based on a search for broad-line emission. Lastly, we present a spectroscopic data release of 188 confirmed $0.5\lesssim z\lesssim5.0$ sources from filler MSA observations, highlighting the legacy value of the survey and a representative benchmark for comparisons to deep field observations.</description>

      <title>Preliminary Evidence for Lensing-Induced Alignments of High-Redshift Galaxies in JWST-CEERS</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.17552</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.17552v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The majority of low-mass ($\log_{10} M_*/M_{\odot}=9-10$) galaxies at high redshift ($z&gt;1$) appear elongated in projection. We use JWST-CEERS observations to explore the role of gravitational lensing in this puzzle. The typical galaxy-galaxy lensing shear $\gamma\sim1\%$ is too low to explain the predominance of elongated early galaxies with ellipticity $e\approx0.6$. However, non-parametric quantile regression with Bayesian Additive Regression Trees reveals hints of an excess of tangentially-aligned source-lens pairs with $\gamma&gt;10\%$. On larger scales, we also find evidence for weak lensing shear. We rule out the null hypothesis of randomly oriented galaxies at $\gtrsim99\%$ significance in multiple NIRCam chips, modules and pointings. The number of such regions is small and attributable to chance, but coherent alignment patterns suggest otherwise. On the chip scale, the average complex ellipticity $\langle e\rangle\sim10\%$ is non-negligible and beyond the level of our PSF uncertainties. The shear variance $\langle\overline{\gamma}^2\rangle\sim10^{-3}$ is an order of magnitude above the conventional weak lensing regime but is more sensitive to PSF systematics, intrinsic alignments, cosmic variance and other biases. Taking it as an upper limit, the maximum implied ``cosmic shear'' is only a few percent and cannot explain the elongated shapes of early galaxies. The alignments themselves may arise from lensing by a protocluster or filament at $z\sim0.75$ where we find an overabundance of massive lens galaxies. We recommend a weak lensing search for overdensities in ``blank'' deep fields with JWST and the Roman Space Telescope.</description>

      <title>Periodicity significance testing with null-signal templates: reassessment of PTF's SMBH binary candidates</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.17565</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.17565v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Periodograms are widely employed for identifying periodicity in time series data, yet they often struggle to accurately quantify the statistical significance of detected periodic signals when the data complexity precludes reliable simulations. We develop a data-driven approach to address this challenge by introducing a null-signal template (NST). The NST is created by carefully randomizing the period of each cycle in the periodogram template, rendering it non-periodic. It has the same frequentist properties as a periodic signal template regardless of the noise probability distribution, and we show with simulations that the distribution of false positives is the same as with the original periodic template, regardless of the underlying data. Thus, performing a periodicity search with the NST acts as an effective simulation of the null (no-signal) hypothesis, without having to simulate the noise properties of the data. We apply the NST method to the supermassive black hole binaries (SMBHB) search in the Palomar Transient Factory (PTF), where Charisi et al. had previously proposed 33 high signal to (white) noise candidates utilizing simulations to quantify their significance. Our approach reveals that these simulations do not capture the complexity of the real data. There are no statistically significant periodic signal detections above the non-periodic background. To improve the search sensitivity we introduce a Gaussian quadrature based algorithm for the Bayes Factor with correlated noise as a test statistic, in contrast to the standard signal to white noise. We show with simulations that this improves sensitivity to true signals by more than an order of magnitude. However, using the Bayes Factor approach also results in no statistically significant detections in the PTF data.</description>

      <title>A SPectroscopic survey of biased halos In the Reionization Era (ASPIRE): Broad-line AGN at $z=4-5$ revealed by JWST/NIRCam WFSS</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.17570</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.17570v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Low-luminosity AGNs with low-mass black holes (BHs) in the early universe are fundamental to understanding the BH growth and their co-evolution with the host galaxies. Utilizing JWST NIRCam Wide Field Slitless Spectroscopy (WFSS), we perform a systematic search for broad-line ${\rm H\alpha}$ emitters (BHAEs) at $z\approx 4-5$ in 25 fields of the ASPIRE (A SPectroscopic survey of biased halos In the Reionization Era) project, covering a total area of 275 arcmin$^2$. We identify 16 BHAEs with FWHM of the broad components spanning from $\sim$ 1000 km s$^{-1}$ to 3000 km s$^{-1}$. Assuming the broad linewidths arise due to Doppler broadening around BHs, the implied BH masses range from $10^7$ to $10^{8}~M_\odot$, with broad ${\rm H\alpha}$-converted bolometric luminosity of $10^{44.5}-10^{45.5}$ erg s$^{-1}$ and Eddington ratios of $0.07-0.47$. The spatially extended structure of the F200W stacked image may trace the stellar light from the host galaxies. The ${\rm H\alpha}$ luminosity function indicates an increasing AGN fraction towards the higher ${\rm H\alpha}$ luminosities. We find possible evidence for clustering of BHAEs: two sources are at the same redshift with a projected separation of 519 kpc; one BHAE appears as a composite system residing in an overdense region with three close companion ${\rm H\alpha}$ emitters. Three BHAEs exhibit blueshifted absorption troughs indicative of the presence of high-column-density gas. We find the broad-line and photometrically selected BHAE samples exhibit different distributions in the optical continuum slopes, which can be attributed to their different selection methods. The ASPIRE broad-line ${\rm H\alpha}$ sample provides a good database for future studies of faint AGN populations at high redshift.</description>

      <title>AGN-driven outflows in clumpy media: multiphase structure and scaling relations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.17593</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.17593v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Small-scale winds driven from accretion discs surrounding active galactic nuclei (AGN) are expected to launch kpc-scale outflows into their host galaxies. However, the ways in which the structure of the interstellar medium (ISM) affects the multiphase content and impact of the outflow remains uncertain. We present a series of numerical experiments featuring a realistic small-scale AGN wind with velocity $5\times 10^3-10^4\ \rm{km/s}$ interacting with an isolated galaxy disc with a manually-controlled clumpy ISM, followed at sub-pc resolution. Our simulations are performed with AREPO and probe a wide range of AGN luminosities ($L=10^{43-47}\ \rm{erg/s}$) and ISM substructures. In homogeneous discs, the AGN wind sweeps up an outflowing, cooling shell, where the emerging cold phase dominates the mass and kinetic energy budgets, reaching a momentum flux $\dot{p} \approx 7\ L/c$. However, when the ISM is clumpy, outflow properties are profoundly different. They contain small, long-lived ($&gt; 5\ \rm{Myr}$), cold ($T&lt;10^{4.5}\ \rm{K}$) cloudlets entrained in the faster, hot outflow phase, which are only present in the outflow if radiative cooling is included in the simulation. While the cold phase dominates the mass of the outflow, most of the kinetic luminosity is now carried by a tenuous, hot phase with $T &gt; 10^7 \ \rm K$. While the hot phases reaches momentum fluxes $\dot{p} \approx (1 - 5)\ L/c$, energy-driven bubbles couple to the cold phase inefficiently, producing modest momentum fluxes $\dot{p} &lt; L/c$ in the fast-outflowing cold gas. These low momentum fluxes could lead to the outflows being misclassified as momentum-driven using common observational diagnostics. We also show predictions for scaling relations between outflow properties and AGN luminosity and discuss the challenges in constraining outflow driving mechanisms and kinetic coupling efficiencies using observed quantities.</description>

      <title>Suppressed Cosmic Ray Energy Densities in Molecular Clouds From Streaming Instability-Regulated Transport</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.17597</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.17597v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Cosmic rays (CRs) are the primary driver of ionization in star forming molecular clouds (MCs). Despite their potential impacts on gas dynamics and chemistry, no simulations of star cluster formation following the creation of individual stars have included explicit cosmic ray transport (CRT) to date. We conduct the first numerical simulations following the collapse of a $2000 M_{\odot}$ MC and the subsequent star formation including CRT using the STARFORGE framework implemented in the GIZMO code. We show that when CR-transport is streaming-dominated, the CR energy in the cloud is strongly attenuated due to energy losses from the streaming instability. Consequently, in a Milky Way like environment the median CR ionization rate (CRIR) in the cloud is low ($ \zeta \lesssim 2 \times 10^{-19} \rm s^{-1}$) during the main star forming epoch of the calculation and the impact of CRs on the star formation in the cloud is limited. However, in high-CR environments, the CR distribution in the cloud is elevated ($\zeta \lesssim 6 \times 10^{-18}$), and the relatively higher CR pressure outside the cloud causes slightly earlier cloud collapse and increases the star formation efficiency (SFE) by $50 \%$ to $\sim 13 \%$. The initial mass function (IMF) is similar in all cases except with possible variations in a high-CR environment. Further studies are needed to explain the range of ionization rates observed in MCs and explore star formation in extreme CR environments.</description>

      <title>ACACIAS I: Element abundance labels for 192 stars in the dwarf galaxy NGC 6822</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.17661</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.17661v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The element abundances of local group galaxies connect enrichment mechanisms to galactic properties and serve to contextualise the Milky Way's abundance distributions. Individual stellar spectra in nearby galaxies can be extracted from Integral Field Unit (IFU) data, and provide a means to take an abundance census of the local group. We introduce a program that leverages $R=1800$, $\mathrm{SNR}=15$, IFU resolved spectra from the Multi Unit Spectroscopic Explorer (MUSE). We deploy the data-driven modelling approach for labelling stellar spectra with stellar parameters and abundances, of The Cannon, on resolved stars in NGC 6822. We construct our model for The Cannon using $\approx$19,000 Milky Way LAMOST spectra with APOGEE labels. We report six inferred abundance labels (denoted $\ell_\mathrm{X}$), for 192 NGC 6822 disk stars, precise to $\approx$$0.15$ dex. We validate our generated spectral models provide a good fit the data, including at individual atomic line features. We infer mean abundances of $\ell_\mathrm{[Fe/H]} = -0.90 \pm 0.03$, $\ell_\mathrm{[Mg/Fe]} = -0.01 \pm 0.01$, $\ell_\mathrm{[Mn/Fe]} = -0.22 \pm 0.02$, $\ell_\mathrm{[Al/Fe]} = -0.33 \pm 0.03$, $\ell_\mathrm{[C/Fe]} =-0.43 \pm 0.03$, $\ell_\mathrm{[N/Fe]} =0.18 \pm 0.03$. These abundance labels are similar to dwarf galaxies observed by APOGEE, and the lower enhancements for NGC 6822 compared to the Milky Way are consistent with expectations. This approach supports a new era in extra-galactic archaeology of characterising the local group enrichment diversity using low-resolution, low-SNR IFU resolved spectra.</description>

      <title>Tracing the evolution of the cool gas in CGM and IGM environments through Mg II absorption from redshift z=0.75 to z=1.65 using DESI-Y1 data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.17809</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.17809v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a measurement of the mean absorption of cool gas traced by Mg II (${\lambda\lambda 2796, 2803}$) around emission line galaxies (ELGs), spanning spatial scales from 20 kpc to 10 Mpc. The measurement is based on cross-matching the positions of about 2.5 million ELGs at $z = 0.75-1.65$ and the metal absorption in the spectra of 1.4 million background quasars with data provided by the Year 1 sample of the Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument (DESI). The ELGs are divided into two redshift intervals: $0.75 &lt; z &lt; 1.0$ and $1.0 &lt; z &lt; 1.65$. We find that the composite spectra constructed by stacking the ELG-QSO pairs show evolution with redshift, with $z&gt;1$ having a systematically higher signal of Mg II absorption. Within 1 Mpc, the covering fraction of the cool gas at $z &gt; 1$ is higher than that of $z &lt; 1$. The enhancement becomes less apparent especially if the projected distance $r_{p}&gt;$1 Mpc. Also, ELGs with higher stellar mass and star formation rate (SFR) yield higher clustering of Mg II absorbers at $z&lt;1$. For $z&gt;1$, the covering fractions with different SFRs show little difference. The higher Mg II absorption at higher redshift also supports the observations of higher star formation at cosmic noon. Besides, the profile of Mg II absorption reveals a change of slope on scales of about 1 Mpc, consistent with the expected transition from a dark matter halo-dominated environment to a regime where clustering is dominated by halo-halo correlations. We estimate the cool gas density profile and derive the metal abundance at different redshifts. The growth of metal abundance suggests an increased presence of cool gas in the intergalactic medium (IGM) towards higher redshifts.</description>

      <title>Role of NH3 Binding Energy in the Early Evolution of Protostellar Cores</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.17891</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.17891v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: NH$_{3}$(ammonia) plays a critical role in the chemistry of star and planet formation, yet uncertainties in its binding energy (BE) values complicate accurate estimates of its abundances. Recent research suggests a multi-binding energy approach, challenging the previous single-value notion. In this work, we use different values of NH$_{3}$ binding energy to examine its effects on the NH$_{3}$ abundances and, consequently, in the early evolution of protostellar cores. Using a gas-grain chemical network, we systematically vary the values of NH$_{3}$ binding energies in a model Class 0 protostellar core and study the effects of these binding energies on the NH$_{3}$ abundances. Our simulations indicate that abundance profiles of NH$_{3}$ are highly sensitive to the binding energy used, particularly in the warmer inner regions of the core. Higher binding energies lead to lower gas-phase NH$_{3}$ abundances, while lower values of binding energy have the opposite effect. Furthermore, this BE-dependent abundance variation of NH$_{3}$ significantly affects the formation pathways and abundances of key species such as HNC, HCN, and CN. Our tests also reveal that the size variation of the emitting region due to binding energy becomes discernible only with beam sizes of 10 arcsec or less. These findings underscore the importance of considering a range of binding energies in astrochemical models and highlight the need for higher resolution observations to better understand the subtleties of molecular cloud chemistry and star formation processes.</description>

      <title>A tight N/O-potential relation in star-forming galaxies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.17945</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.17945v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We report a significantly tighter trend between gaseous N/O and $M_*/R_e$ (a proxy for gravitational potential) than has previously been reported between gaseous metallicity and $M_*/R_e$, for star-forming galaxies in the MaNGA survey. We argue this result to be a consequence of deeper potential wells conferring greater resistance to metal outflows while also being associated with earlier star-formation histories, combined with N/O being comparatively unaffected by metal-poor inflows. The potential-N/O relation thus appears to be both more resistant to short-timescale baryonic processes and also more reflective of a galaxy's chemical evolution state, when compared to previously-considered relations.</description>

      <title>Isotopic abundance of carbon in the DLA towards QSO B1331+170</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.17953</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.17953v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Chemical evolution models predict a gradual build-up of $^{13}$C in the universe, based on empirical nuclear reaction rates and assumptions on the properties of stellar populations. However, old metal-poor stars within the Galaxy contain more $^{13}$C than is predicted, suggesting that further refinements to the models are necessary. Gas at high redshift provides important supplementary information at metallicities $-2\lesssim$ [Fe/H] $\lesssim-1$, for which there are only a few measurements in the Galaxy. We obtained new, high-quality, VLT/ESPRESSO observations of the QSO B1331+170 and used them to measure $^{12}$C/$^{13}$C in the damped Lyman-$\alpha$ system (DLA) at $z_{abs}=1.776$, with [Fe/H]=-1.27. AI-VPFIT, an Artificial Intelligence tool based on genetic algorithms and guided by a spectroscopic information criterion, was used to explore different possible kinematic structures of the carbon gas. Three hundred independent AI-VPFIT models of the absorption system were produced using pre-set $^{12}$C/$^{13}$C values, ranging from 4 to 500. Our results show that $^{12}$C/$^{13}$C$=28.5^{+51.5}_{-10.4}$, suggesting a possibility of $^{13}$C production at low metallicity.</description>

      <title>Intergalactic-Absorption Confounding Circumgalactic Observations</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.18071v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The origin of warm ions in the circum-galactic medium (CGM) surrounding massive galaxies remains a mystery. In this paper, we argue that a significant fraction of the observed warm-ion columns may arise in the intergalactic medium (IGM) surrounding galactic halos. We use a simple spherical collapse model of the dark matter (DM) halos and their baryonic content to compute the evolving ion fractions within and outside virial halos. We show that the photoionized IGM may produce a thick blanket of warm ions around the CGM, thereby contaminating CGM observations. We find that the IGM contributes $&gt; 75\%$ of the total \ion{O}{6} column densities in halos with virial masses exceeding a few times $10^{11}~M_\odot$, and that it may dominate the \ion{O}{6} absorption even for lower mass-halos, depending on the impact parameter. We compare our results with observations and find that our simplified model reproduces the overall \ion{O}{6} columns as well as their trend with the impact parameter and halo mass. We show that observed warm ion columns may be completely dominated by the IGM envelopes, consistent with CGM$^2$ data. We, therefore, suggest that theoretical interpretations of CGM-survey observations must consider the possible contribution of the surrounding IGM. Although our simplified model suggests that it may be possible to kinematically distinguish between CGM and IGM origins through the absorption line profiles, this distinction is likely unfeasible in realistic astrophysical halos, due to the complex velocity structure in the multi-phased CGM.</description>

      <title>Merger Shocks Enhance Quenching in Local Galaxy Clusters</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.18075v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We report evidence for enhanced quenching in low-redshift galaxy clusters hosting radio relics. This effect is strongest for low-mass galaxies and is consistent with a rapid quenching of star formation. These results imply that merger shocks in the intracluster medium play a role in driving environmental quenching, which we argue is due to the elevated ram pressure experienced by satellite galaxies in these disturbed systems.</description>

      <title>Carbon enrichment in APOGEE disk stars as evidence of mass transfer in binaries</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.18130</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.18130v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Carbon abundances in first-ascent giant stars are usually lower than those of their main-sequence counterparts. At moderate metallicities, stellar evolution of single stars cannot account for the existence of red-giant branch stars with enhanced carbon abundances. The phenomenon is usually interpreted as resulting from past mass transfer from an evolved binary companion now in the white dwarf evolutionary stage. Aims: We aim to confirm the links between [C/O] enhancement, s-process element enhancement and binary fraction using large-scale catalogues of stellar abundances and probable binary stars. Methods: We use a large data set from the 17 data release of the SDSS-IV/APOGEE~2 survey to identify carbon-enhanced stars in the Galactic disk. We identify a continuum of carbon enrichment throughout three different sub-populations of disk stars and explore links between the degree of carbon enrichment and binary frequency, metallicity and chemical compositions. Results: We verify a clear correlation between binary frequency and enhancement in the abundances of both carbon and cerium, lending support to the scenario whereby carbon-enhanced stars are the result of mass transfer by an evolved binary companion. In addition, we identify clustering in the carbon abundances of high-$\alpha$ disk stars, suggesting that those on the high metallicity end are likely younger, in agreement with theoretical predictions for the presence of a starburst population following the gas-rich merger of the Gaia-Enceladus/Sausage system.</description>

      <title>Studying the Kinematics of the Stellar Association TW Hya from Modern Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.18132</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.18132v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The kinematics of the young stellar association near the Sun TW Hya is studied. Kinematic estimates of the age of this association were obtained in two ways. The first method -- analysis of stellar trajectories integrated back in time -- gave an estimate of the age $t=4.9\pm1.2$ Myr. The second was to analyze the instantaneous velocities of stars and showed that there is a volume expansion of the stellar system with an angular velocity coefficient $K_{xyz}=103\pm12$ km s$^{-1}$ kpc$^{-1}$. Based on this effect, the time interval that passed from the beginning of the expansion of the TW Hya association to the present moment was found, $t=9.5\pm1.1$ Myr. The following principal semi-axes of the residual velocity ellipsoid are determined: $\sigma_{1,2,3}=(5.25,1.84,0.35)\pm(0.34,0.63,0.26)$ km s$^{-1}$.</description>

      <title>Dust and Power: Unravelling the merger -- AGN connection in the second half of the cosmic history</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.18238</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.18238v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Galaxy mergers represent a fundamental physical process under hierarchical structure formation, but their role in triggering AGNs is still unclear. We aim to investigate the merger-AGN connection using state-of-the-art observations and novel methods in detecting mergers and AGNs. We selected stellar mass-limited samples at redshift z&lt;1 from KiDS, focusing on the KiDS-N-W2 field with a wide range of multi-wavelength data. Three AGN types, selected in the MIR, X-ray, and via SED modelling, were analysed. To identify mergers, we used convolutional neural networks trained on two cosmological simulations. We created mass and redshift-matched control samples of non-mergers and non-AGNs. We observe a clear AGN excess (a factor of 2-3) in mergers with respect to non-mergers for the MIR AGNs, and a mild excess for the X-ray and SED AGNs, indicating that mergers could trigger all 3 types but are more connected with the MIR AGNs. About half of the MIR AGNs are in mergers but it is unclear whether mergers are the main trigger. For the X-ray and SED AGNs, mergers are unlikely to be the dominant trigger. We also explore the relation using the continuous AGN fraction $f_{AGN}$ parameter. Mergers exhibit a clear excess of high $f_{AGN}$ values relative to non-mergers, for all AGNs. We unveil the first merger fraction $f_{merg}-f_{AGN}$ relation with two distinct regimes. When the AGN is not dominant, the relation is only mildly increasing or even flat, with the MIR AGNs showing the highest $f_{merg}$. In the regime of very dominant AGNs ($f_{AGN}\geq0.8$), $f_{merg}$ shows a steeply rising trend with increasing $f_{AGN}$ for all AGN types. These trends are also seen when plotted against AGN bolometric luminosity. We conclude that mergers are most connected with dust-obscured AGNs (linked to a fast-growing phase of the SMBH) and are the main or even the sole fuelling mechanism of the most powerful AGNs.</description>

      <title>Stellar Models are Reliable at Low Metallicity: An Asteroseismic Age for the Ancient Very Metal-Poor Star KIC 8144907</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.17566</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.17566v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Very metal-poor stars ([Fe/H]&lt;-2) are important laboratories for testing stellar models and reconstructing the formation history of our galaxy. Asteroseismology is a powerful tool to probe stellar interiors and measure ages, but few asteroseismic detections are known in very metal-poor stars and none have allowed detailed modeling of oscillation frequencies. We report the discovery of a low-luminosity Kepler red giant (KIC 8144907) with high S/N oscillations, [Fe/H]=-2.66+/-0.08 and [alpha/Fe]=0.38+/-0.06, making it by far the most metal-poor star to date for which detailed asteroseismic modeling is possible. By combining the oscillation spectrum from Kepler with high-resolution spectroscopy we measure an asteroseismic mass and age of 0.79+/-0.02(ran)+/-0.01(sys) Msun and 12.0+/-0.6(ran)+/-0.4(sys) Gyr, with remarkable agreement across different codes and input physics, demonstrating that stellar models and asteroseismology are reliable for very metal-poor stars when individual frequencies are used. The results also provide a direct age anchor for the early formation of the Milky Way, implying that substantial star formation did not commence until redshift z~3 (if the star formed in-situ) or that the Milky Way has undergone merger events for at least ~12 Gyr (if the star was accreted by a dwarf satellite merger such as Gaia Enceladus).</description>

      <title>Unveiling the structural content of NGC 6357 via kinematics and NIR variability</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.17577v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: NGC 6357, a star-forming complex at $\sim 1.7$ kpc from the Sun, contains giant molecular clouds and three prominent star clusters alongside with HII regions, very massive stars and thousands of young stellar objects in different evolutionary stages. We present a combined infrared kinematic and time domain study of the line of sight towards this region enabled by the VVVX survey. In terms of kinematics, a novel discovery emerges: an asymmetrical distribution in the vector point diagram. Some stars in the sample exhibit spatial proximity to dusty regions, with their proper motions aligned with filament projections, hinting at a younger population linked to triggered star formation. However, this distribution could also stem from an asymmetric stellar expansion event within NGC 6357, warranting further investigation. Comparing this data with Gaia revealed inconsistencies likely due to high extinction levels in the region. Additionally, owing to accretion episodes and surface cool spots, young stars display high variability. Using the $K_s$-band time series data, we overcome the extreme levels of extinction towards the region, and compile a catalogue of $774$ infrared light curves of young stars. Each light curve has been characterized in terms of asymmetry and periodicity, to infer the dominant underlying physical mechanism. These findings are then correlated with evolutionary stages, aiming to uncover potential age disparities among the observed stars. This study contributes to our understanding the intricate dynamics and evolutionary processes within NGC 6357, offering valuable insights into the formation and development of stellar populations within such complex environments.</description>

      <title>Atmospheric parameters and chemical abundances within 100 pc. A sample of G, K, and M main-sequence stars</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.17640</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.17640v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: To date, we have access to enormous inventories of stellar spectra that allow the extraction of atmospheric parameters and chemical abundances essential in stellar studies. However, characterizing such a large amount of data is complex and requires a good understanding of the studied object to ensure reliable and homogeneous results. In this study, we present a methodology to measure homogenously the basic atmospheric parameters and detailed chemical abundances of over 1600 thin disk main-sequence stars in the 100 pc solar neighborhood, using APOGEE-2 infrared spectra. We employed the code tonalli to determine the atmospheric parameters using a prior on log g. The log g prior in tonalli implies an understanding of the treated population and helps to find physically coherent answers. Our atmospheric parameters agree within the typical uncertainties (100 K in Teff, 0.15 dex in log g and $[M/H]$) with previous estimations of ASPCAP and Gaia DR3. We use our temperatures to determine a new infrared color-temperature sequence, in good agreement with previous works, that can be used for any main-sequence star. Additionally, we used the BACCHUS code to determine the abundances of Mg, Al, Si, Ca, and Fe in our sample. The five elements (Mg, Al, Si, Ca, Fe) studied have an abundance distribution centered around slightly sub-solar values, in agreement with previous results for the solar neighborhood. The over 1600 main-sequence stars atmospheric parameters and chemical abundances presented here are useful in follow-up studies of the solar neighborhood or as a training set for data-driven methods.</description>

      <title>Testing non-local gravity through Ultra-Diffuse Galaxies kinematics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.18084</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.18084v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The emergence of the Ultra-Diffuse Galaxies in recent years has posed a severe challenge to the galaxy formation models as well as the Extended Theories of Gravity. The existence of both dark matter lacking and dark matter dominated systems within the same family of astrophysical objects indeed requires the gravity models to be versatile enough to describe very different gravitational regimes. In this work, we study a non-local extension of the theory of General Relativity that has drawn increasing attention in recent years due to its capability to account for the late time cosmic acceleration without introducing any dark energy fluid. We leverage the kinematic data of three Ultra-Diffuse Galaxies: NGC 1052-DF2 and NGC 1052-DF4, which are dark matter lacking, and Dragonfly 44, which exhibits a highly dominant dark matter component. Our analysis shows that the non-local corrections to the Newtonian potential do not affect the kinematic predictions, hence no spoiling effects emerge when the Non-local Gravity model serves as a dark energy model. We additionally provide the minimum value that the characteristic non-local radii can reach at these mass scales.</description>

      <title>Testing Cluster Membership of Planetary Nebulae with High-Precision Proper Motions. I. HST Observations of JaFu 1 Near the Globular Cluster Palomar 6</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.18135</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.18135v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: If a planetary nebula (PN) is shown to be a member of a star cluster, we obtain important new constraints on the mass and chemical composition of the PN's progenitor star, which cannot be determined for PNe in the field. Cluster membership can be tested by requiring the projected separation between the PN and cluster to be within the tidal radius of the cluster, and the objects to have nearly identical radial velocities (RVs) and interstellar extinctions, and nearly identical proper motions (PMs). In an earlier study, we used PMs to confirm that three PNe, which had already passed the other tests, are highly likely to be members of Galactic globular clusters (GCs). For a fourth object, the PN JaFu 1, which lies in the Galactic bulge near the GC Palomar 6 on the sky and has a similar RV, the available PM measurement gave equivocal results. We have now obtained new high-resolution images of the central star of JaFu 1 with the Hubble Space Telescope (HST) which, combined with archival HST frames taken 14 and 16 years earlier, provide a high-precision PM. Unfortunately, we find that the PM of the central star differs from that of the cluster with high statistical significance, and thus is unlikely to be a member of Palomar 6. Nevertheless, JaFu 1 is of astrophysical interest because its nucleus appears to be a member of the rare class of "EGB 6-type" central stars, which are associated with compact emission-line knots.</description>

      <title>Unlocking Discovery Potential for Decaying Dark Matter and Faint X-ray Sources with XRISM</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.18189v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Astrophysical emission lines arising from particle decays can offer unique insights into the nature of dark matter (DM). Using dedicated simulations with background and foreground modeling, we comprehensively demonstrate that the recently launched XRISM space telescope with powerful X-ray spectroscopy capabilities is particularly well-suited to probe decaying DM, such as sterile neutrinos and axion-like particles, in the mass range of few to tens of keV. We analyze and map XRISM's DM discovery potential parameter space by considering Milky Way Galactic DM halo, including establishing an optimal line-of-sight search, as well as dwarf galaxies where we identify Segue 1 as a remarkably promising target. We demonstrate that with only 100 ks exposure XRISM/Resolve instrument is capable of probing the underexplored DM parameter window around few keV and testing DM couplings with sensitivity that exceeds by two orders existing Segue 1 limits. Further, we demonstrate that XRISM/Xtend instrument sensitivity enables discovery of the nature of faint astrophysical X-ray sources, especially in Segue 1, which could shed light on star-formation history. We discuss implications for decaying DM searches with improved detector energy resolution in future experiments.</description>

Abstract: We investigated the giant molecular clouds (GMCs) in M74 (NGC 628), using data obtained from the PHANGS project. We applied the GMC Types according to the activity of star formation: Type I without star formation, Type II with H$\alpha$ luminosity ($L_\mathrm{H\alpha}$) less than $10^{37.5}~\mathrm{erg~s^{-1}}$, and Type III with $L_\mathrm{H\alpha}$ greater than $10^{37.5}~\mathrm{erg~s^{-1}}$. A total of 432 GMCs were identified, with 59, 201, and 172 GMCs, for Type I, II, and III, respectively. The size and mass of the GMCs range from 23 to 238 pc and $10^{4.9}$ to $10^{7.1}$ M$_{\odot}$, indicating that the mass and radius increase from Type I to III. Clusters younger than 4 Myr and HII regions are concentrated within 150 pc of a GMC, indicating a tight association between these young objects and GMCs. The virial ratio decreases from Type I to Type III, indicating that Type III GMCs are the most gravitationally relaxed among the three. We interpret that the GMCs evolve from Type I to Type III, as previously observed in the LMC. Based on a steady-state assumption, the estimated evolutionary timescales of Type I, II, and III are 1, 5, and 4 Myr, respectively. We assume that the timescale of Type III is equal to the age of the associated clusters, indicating a GMC lifetime of 10 Myr or longer. Although Chevance et al. (2020, MNRAS, 493, 2872) investigated GMCs using the same PHANGS dataset of M74, they did not define a GMC, reaching an evolutionary picture with a 20 Myr duration of the non-star-forming phase, which was five times longer than 4 Myr. We compare the present results with those of Chevance et al. (2020) and argue that defining individual GMCs is essential for understanding GMC evolution.</description>

      <title>A critical review of recent GAIA wide binary gravity tests</title>

      <description>arXiv:2312.03162v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Over the last couple of years, the appearance of the third data release from the {\it Gaia} satellite has triggered various wide binary low acceleration
  gravity tests. Wide binaries with typical total masses $\approx 1.0 - 1.6 M_{\odot}$ and separations above a few thousand au probe the low acceleration
  $a \lesssim a_{0}$ regime, where at galactic and larger scales gravitational anomalies typically attributed to the presence of an as yet undetected dark
  matter component appear, where $a_{0} \approx 1.2\times 10^{-10}$ m s$^{-2}$ is the acceleration scale of MOND. Thus, studies of the relative velocities and
  separations on the plane of the sky, $v_{2D}$ and $s_{2D}$ respectively, of wide binary stars extending to separations above a few kau, provide an independent
  approach on the empirical study of gravity in the interesting $a \lesssim a_{0}$ acceleration range. Two independent groups, through complementary approaches,
  have obtained evidence for a departure from Newtonian predictions in the low acceleration regime, in consistency with MOND expectations for wide binary orbits
  in the Solar Neighbourhood. Two other groups however, have instead reported results showing a clear preference for Newtonian gravity over various MOND
  alternatives tested, over the same low acceleration regime. We here take a critical look at the various studies in question, from sample selection to statistical
  treatment of the wide binary relative velocities obtained. We discover a couple of critical problems in the formal design and statistical implementation
  shared by the two latter groups, and show explicitly how these yield biased conclusions.</description>

      <title>Impacts of stellar wind and supernovae on the star cluster formation: origins of extremely high N/O ratios and multiple stellar populations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.10535</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.10535v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study metal enrichment originating from stellar wind and supernovae in low-metallicity clouds by performing three-dimensional radiation hydrodynamics simulations. We find that metals ejected from stellar wind are accumulated, leading to subsequent star formation in the nitrogen-enriched gas. During this early phase, the N/O ratios are similar to observed nitrogen-enriched galaxies (${\rm [N/O]}\gtrsim0.5$). Then, once supernovae occur, the N/O ratios decrease significantly. If the duration of star formation is comparable to the timescale of SNe, the mass fraction of nitrogen-enriched stars reaches half the mass of star clusters. We suggest that the mass of the star cluster needs to exceed $\sim 10^6~M_{\odot}$ to have multiple populations due to stellar wind, considering the condition for massive star cluster formation and the timescales of stellar evolution.</description>

      <title>Inefficient star formation in high Mach number environments I. The turbulent support analytical model</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.17368v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The star formation rate (SFR), the number of stars formed per unit of time, is a fundamental quantity in the evolution of the Universe. While turbulence is believed to play a crucial role in setting the SFR, the exact mechanism remains unclear. Turbulence promotes star formation by compressing the gas, but also slows it down by stabilizing the gas against gravity. Most widely-used analytical models rely on questionable assumptions, including: $i)$ integrating over the density PDF, a one-point statistical description that ignores spatial correlation, $ii)$ selecting self-gravitating gas based on a density threshold that often ignores turbulent dispersion, $iii)$ assuming the freefall time as the timescale for estimating SFR without considering the need to rejuvenate the density PDF, $iv)$ assuming the density PDF to be lognormal. Improving upon the only existing model that incorporates the spatial correlation of the density field, we present a new analytical model. We calculate the time needed to rejuvenate density fluctuations of a given density and spatial scale, revealing that it is generally much longer than the freefall time, rendering the latter inappropriate for use. We make specific predictions regarding the role of the Mach number, $ M $, and the driving scale of turbulence divided by the mean Jeans length. At low to moderate Mach numbers, turbulence does not reduce and may even slightly promote star formation by broadening the PDF. However, at higher Mach numbers, most density fluctuations are stabilized by turbulent dispersion, leading to a steep drop in the SFR as the Mach number increases.</description>

      <title>Inefficient star formation in high Mach number environments II. Numerical simulations and comparison with analytical models</title>

Abstract: Predicting the star formation rate (SFR) in galaxies is crucial to understand their evolution and morphology. To do so requires a fine understanding of how dense structures of gas are created and collapse. In that, turbulence and gravity play a major role. Within the gravo-turbulent framework, we assume that turbulence shapes the ISM, creating density fluctuations that, if gravitationally unstable, will collapse and form stars. The goal of this work is to quantify how different regimes of turbulence, characterized by the strength and compressibility of the driving, shape the density field. We are interested in the outcome in terms of SFR and how it compares with existing analytical models for the SFR. We run a series of hydrodynamical simulations of turbulent gas. The simulations are first conducted without gravity, so that the density and velocity are shaped by the turbulence driving. Gravity is then switched on, and the SFR is measured and compared with analytical models. The physics included in these simulations is very close to the one assumed in the classical gravo-turbulent SFR analytical models, which makes the comparison straightforward. We found that the existing analytical models convincingly agree with simulations at low Mach number, but we measure a much lower SFR in the simulation with a high Mach number. We develop, in a companion paper, an updated physically-motivated SFR model that reproduces well the inefficient high Mach regime of the simulations. Our work demonstrates that accurate estimations of the turbulent-driven replenishment time of dense structures and the dense gas spatial distribution are necessary to correctly predict the SFR in the high Mach regime. The inefficient high-Mach regime is a possible explanation for the low SFR found in dense and turbulent environments such as the centers of our Milky Way and other galaxies.</description>

      <title>The Metallicity Dependence of PAH Emission in Galaxies I: Insights from Deep Radial Spitzer Spectroscopy</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.09685v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We use deep Spitzer mid-infrared spectroscopic maps of radial strips across three nearby galaxies with well-studied metallicity gradients (M101, NGC 628, and NGC 2403) to explore the physical origins of the observed deficit of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) at sub-solar metallicity (i.e. the PAH-metallicity relation or PZR). These maps allow us to trace the evolution of all PAH features from 5-18 $\mu$m as metallicity decreases continuously from solar ($Z_\odot$) to 0.2 $Z_\odot$. The total PAH to dust luminosity ratio remains relatively constant until reaching a threshold of $\sim$$\frac{2}{3}$$Z_\odot$, below which it declines smoothly but rapidly. The PZR has been attributed to preferential destruction of the smallest grains in the hard radiation environments found at low metallicity. In this scenario, a decrease in emission from the shortest wavelength PAH features is expected. In contrast, we find a steep decline in long wavelength power below $Z_\odot$, especially in the 17 $\mu$m feature, with the shorter wavelength PAH bands carrying an increasingly large fraction of power at low metallicity. We use newly developed grain models to reproduce the observed PZR trends, including these variations in fractional PAH feature strengths. The model that best reproduces the data employs an evolving grain size distribution that shifts to smaller sizes as metallicity declines. We interpret this as a result of inhibited grain growth at low metallicity, suggesting continuous replenishment in the interstellar medium is the dominant process shaping the PAH grain population in galaxies.</description>

      <title>Metal-Poor Stars in the MW Disk: Resonant Cooling of Vertical Oscillations of Halo Stars in Barred Galaxies</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.06716v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Using numerical simulations of barred disk galaxy embedded in nonspinning and spinning dark matter (DM) halos, we present a novel mechanism of `cooling' the vertical oscillations of DM particles, which acquire the disk kinematics. The underlying mechanism consists of resonant interactions between halo particles and the stellar bar, facilitated by chaotic phase space of the system. The cooling mechanism acts both on dynamical and secular timescales, from $\sim 0.5$\,Gyr to few Gyr. The stellar bar acts to absorb kinetic energy of the vertical motions. Using Milky Way-type stellar halo, we estimate the population of metal-poor disk stars trapped by the MW disk and analyze its kinematics. We find that population of metal-poor MW disk stars with $|z|\ltorder 3$\,kpc detected by the Gaia DR3 and other surveys can have their origin in the stellar halo. The cooled population also migrates radially outwards by exchanging energy and angular momentum with the spinning bar, and prograde-moving stars have a different distribution from the retrograde ones. Next, we have calculated the ratio of the prograde-to-retrograde orbits of the cooled population and found that this ratio varies radially, with the fast-spinning stellar halo resulting in the shallower radial increase of this ratio outside of the corotation. The nonspinning stellar halo shows a monotonic increase of this ratio with radius outside the corotation. Together with analyzed radial migration of these halo stars, the cooling phenomenon of halo metal-poor stars can explain their current disk population, and has corollaries for chemical evolution of disk galaxies in general.</description>

      <title>The MAGPI survey: The interdependence of the mass, star formation rate, and metallicity in galaxies at z~0.3</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.20017v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Star formation rates (SFRs), gas-phase metallicities, and stellar masses are crucial for studying galaxy evolution. The different relations resulting from these properties give insights into the complex interplay of gas inside galaxies and their evolutionary trajectory and current characteristics. We aim to characterize these relations at $z\sim 0.3$, corresponding to a 3-4 Gyr lookback time. We utilized optical integral field spectroscopy of 65 emission-line galaxies from the MAGPI survey at a redshift of $0.28&lt;z&lt;0.35$ and spanning a total stellar mass range of $8.2&lt;\log(M_{*}/M_{\odot}) &lt; 11.4$. We derived the resolved star formation main sequence (rSFMS), resolved mass metallicity relation (rMZR), and resolved fundamental metallicity relation (rFMR) at $z\sim 0.3$. We find a relatively shallow rSFMS slope of $\sim 0.425 \pm 0.014$ compared to the expected slope at this redshift for an ordinary least square (OLS) fitting routine. For an orthogonal distance regression (ODR) routine, a much steeper slope of $\sim 1.162 \pm 0.022$ is measured. We confirm the existence of an rMZR at $z\sim 0.3$ with an average metallicity located $\sim 0.03$ dex above the local Universe's metallicity. Via partial correlation coefficients, evidence is found that the local metallicity is predominantly determined by the stellar mass surface density and has a weak secondary (inverse) dependence on the SFR surface density $\Sigma_{SFR}$. Additionally, a significant dependence of the local metallicity on the total stellar mass $M_{*}$ is found. Furthermore, we find that the stellar mass surface density $\Sigma_{*}$ and $M_{*}$ have a significant influence in determining the strength with which $\Sigma_{SFR}$ correlates with the local metallicity. We observe that at lower stellar masses, there is a tighter correlation between $\Sigma_{SFR}$ and the gas-phase metallicity, resulting in a more pronounced rFMR.</description>

      <title>Corvus A: A low-mass, isolated galaxy at 3.5 Mpc</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.03393v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We report the discovery of Corvus A, a low-mass, gas-rich galaxy at a distance of approximately 3.5 Mpc, identified in DR10 of the Dark Energy Camera Legacy Imaging Survey during the initial phase of our ongoing SEmi-Automated Machine LEarning Search for Semi-resolved galaxies (SEAMLESS). Jansky Very Large Array observations of Corvus A detect HI line emission at a radial velocity of $523\pm2$ km/s. Magellan/Megacam imaging reveals an irregular and complex stellar population with both young and old stars. We detect UV emission in Neil Gehrels Swift observations, indicative of recent star formation. However, there are no signs of HII regions in H$\alpha$ imaging from Steward Observatory's Kuiper telescope. Based on the Megacam color magnitude diagram we measure the distance to Corvus A via the tip-of-the-red-giant-branch standard candle as $3.48\pm0.24$ Mpc. This makes Corvus A remarkably isolated, with no known galaxy within $\sim$1 Mpc. Based on this distance, we estimate the HI and stellar mass of Corvus A to be $\log M_\mathrm{HI}/\mathrm{M_\odot} = 6.59$ and $\log M_\ast/\mathrm{M_\odot} = 6.0$. Although there are some signs of rotation, the HI distribution of Corvus A appears to be close to face-on, analogous to that of Leo T, and we therefore do not attempt to infer a dynamical mass from its HI line width. Higher resolution synthesis imaging is required to confirm this morphology and to draw robust conclusions from its gas kinematics.</description>

Abstract: Star formation rate (SFR) is a fundamental parameter for describing galaxies and inferring their evolutionary course. HII regions yield the best measure of instantaneous SFR in galaxies, although the derived SFR can have large uncertainties depending on tracers and assumptions. We present an SFR calibration for the entire molecular gas disk of the nearby Seyfert galaxy NGC 1068, based on our new high-sensitivity ALMA 100GHz continuum data at 55pc (=0."8) resolution in combination with the HST Pa{\alpha} line data. In this calibration, we account for the spatial variations of dust extinction, electron temperature of HII regions, AGN contamination, and diffuse ionized gas (DIG) based on publicly available multi-wavelength data. Especially, given the extended nature and the possible non-negligible contribution to the total SFR, a careful consideration of DIG is essential. With a cross-calibration between two corrected ionized gas tracers (free-free continuum&amp;Pa{\alpha}), the total SFR of the NGC 1068 disk is estimated to be 3.2\pm0.5 Msol/yr, one-third of the SFR without accounting for DIG (9.1\pm1.4 Msol/yr). We confirmed high SFR around the southern bar-end and the corotation radius, which is consistent with the previous SFR measurements. In addition, our total SFR exceeds the total SFR based on 8{\mu}m dust emission by a factor of 1.5. We attribute this discrepancy to the differences in the young stars at different stages of evolution traced by each tracer and their respective timescales. This study provides an example to address the various uncertainties in conventional SFR measurements and their potential to lead to significant SFR miscalculations.</description>

      <title>The rich galactic environment of a H$_2$-absorption selected quasar</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.16818v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present the first VLT/MUSE observations of a quasar featuring a proximate molecular absorption system, SDSS J125917.31+030922.5. The proximate damped Ly$\alpha$ absorption acts as a natural coronagraph, removing the quasar emission over $\sim$40 {\AA} in wavelength, and allows us to detect extended Ly$\alpha$ emission without the necessity of subtracting the quasar emission. This natural coronagraph permits the investigation of the quasar environment down to its inner regions ($r &lt; 20$ kpc), where galaxy interactions or feedback processes should have the most noticeable effects. Our observations reveal a dense environment, with a highly asymmetric Ly$\alpha$ emission within $2"$ ($\sim 15$ kpc), possibly shaped by a companion galaxy, and a southern extension of the nebulae at about 50~kpc, with rotation-like kinematic signature. The width of the Ly$\alpha$ emission is broadest closer to the quasar, indicating perturbed kinematics as expected if interactions and significant gas flows are present. The foreground absorbing system itself is redshifted by $\approx $400 km/s relative to the background quasar, and therefore is likely arising from gas moving towards the quasar. Finally two additional Ly$\alpha$ emitters are detected with $&gt;10\,\sigma$ significance at 96 and 223 kpc from the quasar, making this field overdense relative to other similar observations of quasars at $z\sim 3$. Our results support the hypothesis that quasars with proximate neutral/molecular absorption trace rich environments where galaxy interactions are at play and motivates further studies of H$_2$-selected quasars to shed light on feeding and feedback processes.</description>

      <title>MUSE spectroscopy of the high abundance discrepancy planetary nebula NGC 6153</title>

Abstract: (Abridged) The abundance discrepancy problem in planetary nebulae (PNe) has long puzzled astronomers. NGC6153, with its high Abundance Discrepancy Factor (ADF~10), provides an opportunity to understand the chemical structure and ionisation processes by constructing detailed emission line maps and examining variations in electron temperature and density. We used the MUSE spectrograph to acquire IFU data covering the wavelength range 4600-9300 \AA\ with a spatial sampling of 0.2 arcsec and spectral resolutions ranging from R = 1600-3500. We created emission line maps for 60 lines and two continuum regions. We developed a tailored methodology for the analysis of the data, including correction for recombination contributions to auroral lines and the contributions of different plasma phases. Our analysis confirmed the presence of a low-temperature plasma component in NGC6153. We find that electron temperatures derived from recombination line and continuum diagnostics are significantly lower than those derived from collisionally excited line diagnostics. Ionic chemical abundance maps were constructed, considering the weight of the cold plasma phase in the HI emission. Adopting this approach, we found ionic abundances that could be up to 0.2 dex lower for those derived from CELs and up to 1.1 dex higher for those derived from RLs than in the case of an homogeneous HI emission. The abundance contrast factor (ACF) between both plasma components was defined, with values, on average, 0.9 dex higher than the ADF. Different methods for calculating ionisation correction factors (ICFs) yielded consistent results. Our findings emphasise that accurate chemical abundance determinations in high-ADF PNe must account for multiple plasma phases.</description>
