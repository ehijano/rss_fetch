      <title>Particle transport in open polygonal billiards: a scattering map</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.07179</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.07179v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Polygonal billiards exhibit a rich and complex dynamical behavior. In recent years polygonal billiards have attracted great attention due to their application in the understanding of anomalous transport, but also at the fundamental level, due to its connections with diverse fields in mathematics. We explore this complexity and its consequences on the properties of particle transport in infinitely long channels made of the repetitions of an elementary open polygonal cell. Borrowing ideas from the Zemlyakov-Katok construction, we construct an interval exchange transformation classified by the singular directions of the discontinuities of the billiard flow over the translation surface associated to the elementary cell. From this, we derive an exact expression of a scattering map of the cell connecting the outgoing flow of trajectories with the unconstrained incoming flow. The scattering map is defined over a partition of the coordinate space, characterized by different families of trajectories. Furthermore, we obtain an analytical expression for the average speed of propagation of ballistic modes, describing with high accuracy the speed of propagation of ballistic fronts appearing in the tails of the distribution of the particle displacement. The symbolic hierarchy of the trajectories forming these ballistic fronts is also discussed.</description>

      <title>Approximation and decomposition of attractors of a Hopfield neural network system</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.07567</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.07567v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, the Parameter Switching (PS) algorithm is used to approximate numerically attractors of a Hopfield Neural Network (HNN) system. The PS algorithm is a convergent scheme designed for approximating attractors of an autonomous nonlinear system, depending linearly on a real parameter. Aided by the PS algorithm, it is shown that every attractor of the HNN system can be expressed as a convex combination of other attractors. The HNN system can easily be written in the form of a linear parameter dependence system, to which the PS algorithm can be applied. This work suggests the possibility to use the PS algorithm as a control-like or anticontrol-like method for chaos.</description>

      <title>Spontaneous phase locking in a broad-area semiconductor laser</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.07268</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.07268v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Broad-area semiconductor lasers are employed in many high-power applications, however, their spatio-temporal dynamics is complex and intrinsically unstable due to the interaction of several transverse lasing modes. A dynamical and spatio-spectral analysis with ultra-high resolution of commercial broad-area lasers reveals multiplets of phase locked first- and second-order transverse modes that are spontaneously created by the nonlinear dynamics for a wide range of operation parameters. Phase locking between modes of different transverse order is demonstrated by comparing the linewidths of the lasing modes to that of their beat note as well as by a direct measurement of their phase fluctuation correlations. Since the laser and the setup lack any feature designed to induce locking and the overall dynamics is unstable, the observation of this spontaneous phase locking effect is very unexpected. Our findings indicate that chimera-like states featuring groups of synchronized oscillators coexisting with unsynchronized ones can spontaneously form in broad-area lasers, and may thus be found in a wider range of optical systems and beyond than previously assumed. Moreover, some of the phase locked modes do not even exist on the passive-cavity level, but are created by the nonlinear dynamics, an effect not previously observed in the context of chimera states.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.07756v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We numerically investigate a time-delayed reservoir computer architecture based on a single mode laser diode with optical injection and optical feedback. Through a high-resolution parametric analysis, we reveal unforeseen regions of high dynamical consistency. We demonstrate furthermore that the best computing performance is not achieved at the edge of consistency as previously suggested in a coarser parametric analysis. This region of high consistency and optimal reservoir performances are highly sensitive to the data input modulation format</description>

      <title>Reduced Markovian Models of Dynamical Systems</title>

      <description>arXiv:2308.10864v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Leveraging recent work on data-driven methods for constructing a finite state space Markov process from dynamical systems, we address two problems for obtaining further reduced statistical representations. The first problem is to extract the most salient reduced-order dynamics for a given timescale by using a modified clustering algorithm from network theory. The second problem is to provide an alternative construction for the infinitesimal generator of a Markov process that respects statistical features over a large range of timescales. We demonstrate the methodology on three low-dimensional dynamical systems with stochastic and chaotic dynamics. We then apply the method to two high-dimensional dynamical systems, the Kuramoto-Sivashinky equations and data sampled from fluid-flow experiments via Particle-Image Velocimetry. We show that the methodology presented herein provides a robust reduced-order statistical representation of the underlying system.</description>

      <title>Intermediate spectral statistics of rational triangular quantum billiards</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.05783v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Triangular billiards whose angles are rational multiples of $\pi$ are one of the simplest examples of pseudo-integrable models with intriguing classical and quantum properties. We perform an extensive numerical study of spectral statistics of eight quantized rational triangles, six belonging to the family of right-angled Veech triangles and two obtuse rational triangles. Large spectral samples of up to one million energy levels were calculated for each triangle which permits to determine their spectral statistics with great accuracy. It is demonstrated that they are of the intermediate type, sharing some features with chaotic systems, like level repulsion and some with integrable systems, like exponential tails of the level spacing distributions. Another distinctive feature of intermediate spectral statistics is a finite value of the level compressibility.
  The short range statistics such as the level spacing distributions, and long-range statistics such as the number variance and spectral form factors were analyzed in detail. An excellent agreement between the numerical data and the model of gamma distributions is revealed.</description>

      <title>Topological phase locking in molecular oscillators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.11788</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.11788v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The dynamics of molecular-scale enzymes and molecular motors are activated by thermal noise, and driven out-of-equilibrium by local energy dissipation. Because the energies dissipated in these systems are comparable to the thermal energy, one would generally expect their dynamics to be highly stochastic. Here, by studying a thermodynamically-consistent model of two coupled noise-activated oscillators, we show that this is not always the case. Thanks to a novel phenomenon that we term topological phase locking (TPL), the coupled dynamics become quasi-deterministic, resulting in a greatly enhanced average speed of the oscillators. TPL is characterized by the emergence of a band of periodic orbits that form a torus knot in phase space, along which the two oscillators advance in rational multiples of each other. The effectively conservative dynamics along this band coexists with the basin of attraction of the dissipative fixed point. We further show that TPL arises as a result of a complex, infinite hierarchy of global bifurcations. Our results have implications for understanding the dynamics of a wide range of systems, from biological enzymes and molecular motors to engineered nanoscale electronic, optical, or mechanical oscillators.</description>

      <title>Dynamical properties of a small heterogeneous chain network of neurons in discrete time</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.05675</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.05675v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We propose a novel nonlinear bidirectionally coupled heterogeneous chain network whose dynamics evolve in discrete time. The backbone of the model is a pair of popular map-based neuron models, the Chialvo and the Rulkov maps. This model is assumed to proximate the intricate dynamical properties of neurons in the widely complex nervous system. The model is first realized via various nonlinear analysis techniques: fixed point analysis, phase portraits, Jacobian matrix, and bifurcation diagrams. We observe the coexistence of chaotic and period-4 attractors. Various codimension-1 and -2 patterns for example saddle-node, period-doubling, Neimark-Sacker, double Neimark-Sacker, flip- and fold-Neimark Sacker, and 1:1 and 1:2 resonance are also explored. Furthermore, the study employs two synchronization measures to quantify how the oscillators in the network behave in tandem with each other over a long number of iterations. Finally, a time series analysis of the model is performed to investigate its complexity in terms of sample entropy.</description>

      <title>Attochaos I: The classically chaotic postcursor of high harmonic generation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.05804</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.05804v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Attosecond physics provides unique insights into light-matter interaction on ultrafast time scales. Its core phenomenon, High Harmonic Generation (HHG), is often described by a classical recollision model, the simple-man or three-step model, where the atomic potential is disregarded. Many features are already well explained using this model; however, the simplicity of the model does not allow the possibility of classical chaotic motion. We show that beyond this model, classical chaotic motion does exist albeit on timescales that are generally longer than the first recollision time. Chaos is analyzed using tools from the theory of dynamical systems, such as Lyapunov exponents and stroboscopic maps. The calculations are done for a one-dimensional Coulomb potential subjected to a linearly polarized electric field.</description>
