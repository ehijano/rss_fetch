      <title>Condensates in aggregation processes with input: a new power law and intermittency</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.09827</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.09827v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large-mass condensates, which coexist with a power-law-decaying distribution in the one-dimensional Takayasu model of mass aggregation with input, were recently found in numerical simulations. Here we establish the occurrence of condensates by analyzing exact recursions, and further show that they have a strong effect on the properties of the system. In the steady state of a large but finite system, there is a single condensate, whose movement through the system leads to a reorganization of the mass profile on a macroscopic scale. A scaling analysis of the mean mass and standard deviation at different distances from the condensate leads to the surprising conclusion that the mass distribution on sites close to the condensate follow a power-law decay with a new exponent 5/3, while further-away sites show the customary Takayasu exponent 4/3, with a crossover in between. Finally, the exit of condensates from a system with open boundaries has a strong effect on the temporal fluctuations of the total mass in the steady state. Their departure is followed by a build-up of mass and subsequent departures, leading to strong intermittency, established through a divergence of the flatness as the scaled time approaches zero.</description>

      <title>Ultimate Kinetic Uncertainty Relation and Optimal Performance of Stochastic Clocks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.09839</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.09839v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: For Markov processes over discrete configurations, an asymptotic bound on the uncertainty of stochastic fluxes is derived in terms of the harmonic mean of decay rates with respect to the stationary distribution. This bound is necessarily tighter than the bound in terms of the arithmetic mean, i.e., the activity, known as the kinetic uncertainty relation. What is more, it can always be saturated. In turn, an exact limit for the uncertainty of first-passage times as well as the optimal long-time performance of stochastic clocks are established. The results generalise to semi-Markov processes, including quantum reset processes, where it can be determined when clock performance improves thanks to coherent driving.</description>

      <title>Corrections to scaling in the 2D phi^4 model: Monte Carlo results and some related problems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.09856</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.09856v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Monte Carlo (MC) simulations have been performed for a refined estimation of the correction-to-scaling exponent omega in the 2D phi^4 model. The best estimate omega=1.546(30) has been obtained from the finite-size scaling of the susceptibility data in the range of linear lattice sizes L from 128 to 2048 at the critical value of the Binder cumulant, this result is confirmed also by several other MC estimations. It served as a basis for a critical reconsideration of some earlier theoretical conjectures and scaling assumptions. In particular, we have corrected and refined our previous analysis by grouping Feynman diagrams. The renewed analysis gives omega = 4-d-2 eta as some approximation for spatial dimensions d&lt;4, or omega approximately 1.5 in two dimensions. Our MC value is comparable with the known results of the epsilon-expansion.</description>

      <title>The induced friction on a probe moving in a nonequilibrium medium</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.09989</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.09989v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Using a powerful combination of projection-operator method and path-space response theory, we derive the fluctuation dynamics of a slow inertial probe coupled to a steady nonequilibrium medium under the assumption of time-scale separation. The nonequilibrium can be realized by external nongradient driving on the medium particles or by their (athermal) active self-propulsion. The resulting friction on the probe is explicit as a time-correlation for medium observables and is decomposed into two terms, one entropic and proportional to the noise amplitude as in the Einstein relation for equilibrium media, and a frenetic term that can take both signs. As illustration, we give the exact expressions for the friction and noise of a probe in a rotating run-and-tumble medium and in a sheared overdamped medium. In both examples, we find an interesting transition to absolute negative probe friction as the nonequilibrium medium exhibits sufficient and persistent rotational current.</description>

      <title>A family of thermodynamic uncertainty relations valid for general fluctuation theorems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.10390</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.10390v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Thermodynamic Uncertainty Relations (TURs) are relations that establish lower bounds for the relative fluctuations of thermodynamic quantities in terms of the statistics of the associated entropy production. In this work we derive a family of TURs that explores higher order moments of the entropy production and is valid in any situation a Fluctuation Theorem holds. The resulting bound holds in both classical and quantum regimes and can always be saturated. These TURs are shown in action for a two level system weakly coupled to a bath undergoing a non time-symmetric drive, where we can use the Tasaki-Crooks fluctuation theorem. Finally, we draw a connection between our TURs and the existence of correlations between the entropy production and the thermodynamic quantity under consideration.</description>

      <title>Explosive percolation in finite dimensions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.10492</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.10492v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Explosive percolation (EP) has received significant research attention due to its rich and anomalous phenomena near criticality. In our recent study [Phys. Rev. Lett. 130, 147101 (2023)], we demonstrated that the correct critical behaviors of the EP in infinite dimensions (complete graph) can be accurately extracted using the event-based method, with finite-size scaling behaviors still described by the standard finite-size scaling theory. We perform an extensive simulation of the EPs on hypercubic lattices ranging from dimensions $d=2$ to $6$, and find that the critical behaviors consistently obey the standard finite-size scaling theory. Consequently, we obtain a high-precision determination of the percolation thresholds and critical exponents, revealing that the EPs governed by the product and sum rules belong to different universality classes. Remarkably, despite the mean of the dynamic pseudo-critical point $\mathcal{T}_L$ deviating from the infinite-lattice criticality by a distance determined by the $d$-dependent correlation-length exponent, $\mathcal{T}_L$ follows a normal (Gaussian) distribution across all dimensions, with a standard deviation proportional to $1/\sqrt{V}$, where $V$ denotes the system volume. A theoretical argument associated with the central-limit theorem is further proposed to understand the probability distribution of $\mathcal{T}_L$. These findings offer a comprehensive understanding of critical behaviors in EPs across various dimensions.</description>

      <title>Pole Analysis of the Inter-Replica Correlation Function in a Two-Replica System as a Binary Mixture: Mean Overlap in the Cluster Glass Phase</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.10519</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.10519v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: To investigate the cluster glass phase of ultrasoft particles, we examine an annealed two-replica system endowed with an attractive inter-replica field similar to that of a binary symmetric electrolyte. Leveraging this analogy, we conduct pole analysis on the total correlation functions in the two-replica system where the inter-replica field will eventually be switched off. By synthesizing discussions grounded in the pole analysis with a hierarchical view of the free-energy landscape, we derive an analytical form of the mean overlap between two replicas within the mean field approximation of the Gaussian core model. This formula elucidates novel numerical findings observed in the cluster glass phase.</description>

      <title>Forces from coarse-graining nonequilibrium degrees of freedom: exact results</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.10531</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.10531v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study paradigmatic examples of a tracer trapped in a harmonic potential and coupled to a bath particle of various types. Restricting to linear couplings between tracer and bath allows for analytical treatment. We discuss the resulting stochastic Langevin equation for the tracer and its relaxation function, for which this equation is averaged under an initial tracer position. For equilibrium, the tracer-bath force on average vanishes, a well known consequence of Boltzmann statistics. If tracer and bath are subject to different temperatures, the conditioned tracer-bath force is finite, and can be as large in magnitude as the force between tracer and trapping potential. For a bath particle with intrinsic memory, e.g., an active particle, even the noise felt by the bath particle takes a finite average under conditioning of the tracer. If the noise of the bath particle is non-Gaussian, the relaxation function of the tracer can be non-monotonic as a function of time. We display how these phenomena are reflected in the Langevin equation of the tracer.</description>

      <title>The effective diffusion constant of stochastic processes with spatially periodic noise</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.10813</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.10813v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We discuss the effective diffusion constant $D_{{\it eff}}$ for stochastic processes with spatially-dependent noise. Starting from a stochastic process given by a Langevin equation, different drift-diffusion equations can be derived depending on the choice of the discretization rule $ 0 \leq \alpha \leq 1$. We initially study the case of periodic heterogeneous diffusion without drift and we determine a general result for the effective diffusion coefficient $D_{{\it eff}}$, which is valid for any value of $\alpha$. We study the case of periodic sinusoidal diffusion in detail and we find a relationship with Legendre functions. Then, we derive $D_{{\it eff}}$ for general $\alpha$ in the case of diffusion with periodic spatial noise and in the presence of a drift term, generalizing the Lifson-Jackson theorem. Our results are illustrated by analytical and numerical calculations on generic periodic choices for drift and diffusion terms.</description>

Abstract: We show that Hawking black-hole evaporation saturates the Landauer Principle of information thermodynamics. Our result implies that information loss experienced by a black hole during Hawking evaporation takes place as efficiently as possible. We also extend the analysis to the case of Barrow entropy as a phenomenological realization of a fractal event horizon, where the Landauer Principle informs amongst different options for the black hole temperature. To our knowledge, this work is the first identification of the two results as expressions of the same process.</description>

      <title>Non-Adiabatic Quantum Optimization for Crossing Quantum Phase Transitions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.09596</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.09596v2 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider the optimal driving of the ground state of a many-body quantum system across a quantum phase transition in finite time. In this context, excitations caused by the breakdown of adiabaticity can be minimized by adjusting the schedule of the control parameter that drives the transition. Drawing inspiration from the Kibble-Zurek mechanism, we characterize the timescale of onset of adiabaticity for several optimal control procedures. Our analysis reveals that schedules relying on local adiabaticity, such as Roland-Cerf's local adiabatic driving and the quantum adiabatic brachistochrone, fail to provide a significant speedup over the adiabatic evolution in the transverse-field Ising and long-range Kitaev models. As an alternative, we introduce a novel framework, Non-Adiabatic Quantum Optimization (NAQO), that, by exploiting the Landau-Zener formula and taking into account the role of higher-excited states, outperforms schedules obtained via both local adiabaticity and state-of-the-art numerical optimization. NAQO is not restricted to exactly solvable models, and we further confirm its superior performance in a disordered non-integrable model.</description>

      <title>Role of symmetry in the correlated orientational disorder phase of entropic crystals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.09637</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.09637v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Correlated orientational disordered phase is a thermodynamic phase with the constituent particles following some conserved laws or correlation despite the orientational disorder present in the system. Polyhedral particles in the presence of hard interaction serve the purpose of studying the orientational disorder in entropy driven self-assembly. We report the computational evidence of the role of symmetry of both particle and self-assembled crystal in the single-component system of anisotropic polyhedra in the correlated orientational disordered phase. The point groups of the particle and crystal structure appear to make a direct correspondence with the existence of multiple unique orientations of the system satisfying all the orientational conserved quantities towards the correlation. As a signature of correlation, the system exhibits orientationally frozen state at sufficiently higher packing fractions and discrete orientational hopping of the particles are observed at comparatively lower density solids. This symmetry relationship appears to control all the aspects of orientational correlation in the crystalline solids which might be useful to draw fundamental insights about the disordered crystalline solids with orientational correlation as well as designing the disorder in the crystals.</description>

      <title>A foundational framework for the mesoscale modeling of dynamic elastomers and gels</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.09654</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.09654v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Discrete mesoscale network models, in which explicitly modeled polymer chains are replaced by implicit pairwise potentials, are capable of predicting the macroscale mechanical response of polymeric materials such as elastomers and gels, while offering greater insight into microstructural phenomena than constitutive theory or macroscale experiments alone. However, whether such mesoscale models accurately represent the molecular structures of polymer networks requires investigation during their development, particularly in the case of dynamic polymers that restructure in time. We here introduce and compare the topological and mechanical predictions of an idealized, reduced-order mesoscale approach in which only tethered dynamic bonding sites and crosslinks in a polymer's backbone are explicitly modeled, to those of molecular theory and a Kremer-Grest, coarse-grained molecular dynamics approach. We find that for short chain networks at intermediate polymer packing fractions, undergoing relatively slow loading rates, the mesoscale approach reasonably reproduces the chain conformations, bond kinetic rates, and ensemble stress responses predicted by molecular theory and the bead-spring model. Further, it does so with a 90% reduction in computational cost. These savings grant the mesoscale model access to larger spatiotemporal domains than conventional molecular dynamics, enabling simulation of large deformations as well as durations approaching experimental timescales (e.g., those utilized in DMA). While the model investigated is for monodisperse polymer networks in theta-solvent, without entanglement, charge interactions, long-range dynamic bond interactions, or other confounding physical effects, this work highlights the utility of these models and lays a foundational groundwork for the incorporation of such phenomena moving forward.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.09860v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose a quantum analog of the Vicsek model, consisting of an ensemble of overdamped spin$-1/2$ particles with ferromagnetic couplings, driven by a uniformly polarized magnetic field. The spontaneous magnetization of the spin components breaks the $SO(3)$ (or $SO(2)$) symmetry, inducing an ordered phase of flocking. We derive the hydrodynamic equations, similar to those formulated by Toner and Tu, by applying a mean-field approximation to the quantum analog model up to the next leading order. Our investigation not only establishes a microscopic connection between the Vicsek model and the Toner-Tu hydrodynamics for active matter, but also aims to inspire further studies of active matter in the quantum regime.</description>

      <title>Metabolic activity controls the emergence of coherent flows in microbial suspensions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.09884v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Photosynthetic microbes have evolved and successfully adapted to the ever-changing environmental conditions in complex microhabitats throughout almost all ecosystems on Earth. In the absence of light, they can sustain their biological functionalities through aerobic respiration, and even in anoxic conditions through anaerobic metabolic activity. For a suspension of photosynthetic microbes in an anaerobic environment, individual cellular motility is directly controlled by its photosynthetic activity, i.e. the intensity of the incident light absorbed by chlorophyll. The effects of the metabolic activity on the collective motility on the population level, however, remain elusive so far. Here, we demonstrate that at high light intensities, a suspension of photosynthetically active microbes exhibits a stable reverse sedimentation profile of the cell density due to the microbes' natural bias to move against gravity. With decreasing photosynthetic activity, and therefore suppressed individual motility, the living suspension becomes unstable giving rise to coherent bioconvective flows. The collective motility is fully reversible and manifests as regular, three-dimensional plume structures, in which flow rates and cell distributions are directly controlled via the light intensity. The coherent flows emerge in the highly unfavourable condition of lacking both light and oxygen and, thus, might help the microbial collective to expand the exploration of their natural habitat in search for better survival conditions.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.09912v2 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Using the recently proposed covariant framework of general relativistic stochastic mechanics and stochastic thermodynamics, we proved the detailed and integral fluctuation theorems in curved spacetime. The time-reversal transformation is described as a transformation from the perspective of future-directed observer to that of the corresponding past-directed observer, which enables us to maintain general covariance throughout the construction. The result presented in this work may be applied in understanding the origin of irreversibility in macroscopic processes in the presence of relativistic gravity, as in most astrophysical or cosmological processes.</description>

      <title>Improved models for ideal Fermi gas and ideal Bose gas using quantum phase space</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.09998</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.09998v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The current models of ideal Fermi gas and ideal Bose gas are often considered as compatible with quantum theory. In this work, however, it is shown that improvements should be introduced into these models to rigorously take into account the quantum nature of phase space which is related to the uncertainty principle. The construction of the improved models which are considered is based on the use of the concepts of phase space representation of quantum mechanics and quantum phase space that were introduced and developed recently. Hamiltonian operator of a gas particle and its eigenstates are firstly determined and the use of quantum statistical mechanics leads to the deduction of the thermodynamics properties of the ideal gas itself. The explicit expressions of thermodynamic quantities such as the thermodynamic particles number, the internal energy, the grand canonical potential and the pressure as well as the state equations, corresponding to the improved models, are established for both bosons and fermions. The corrections introduced by these expressions are expected to be particularly significant at low temperature and for confined volume. They permit in particular to highlight the existence of quantum shape and size effects. It is also shown that the thermodynamics functions and variables are directly related to the momenta quantum statistical variances. Well-known relations corresponding to classical ideal gas model can be retrieved from the improved models as asymptotic limits at high temperature and for large volume.</description>

      <title>AtomAgents: Alloy design and discovery through physics-aware multi-modal multi-agent artificial intelligence</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.10022v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The design of alloys is a multi-scale problem that requires a holistic approach that involves retrieving relevant knowledge, applying advanced computational methods, conducting experimental validations, and analyzing the results, a process that is typically reserved for human experts. Machine learning (ML) can help accelerate this process, for instance, through the use of deep surrogate models that connect structural features to material properties, or vice versa. However, existing data-driven models often target specific material objectives, offering limited flexibility to integrate out-of-domain knowledge and cannot adapt to new, unforeseen challenges. Here, we overcome these limitations by leveraging the distinct capabilities of multiple AI agents that collaborate autonomously within a dynamic environment to solve complex materials design tasks. The proposed physics-aware generative AI platform, AtomAgents, synergizes the intelligence of large language models (LLM) the dynamic collaboration among AI agents with expertise in various domains, including knowledge retrieval, multi-modal data integration, physics-based simulations, and comprehensive results analysis across modalities that includes numerical data and images of physical simulation results. The concerted effort of the multi-agent system allows for addressing complex materials design problems, as demonstrated by examples that include autonomously designing metallic alloys with enhanced properties compared to their pure counterparts. Our results enable accurate prediction of key characteristics across alloys and highlight the crucial role of solid solution alloying to steer the development of advanced metallic alloys. Our framework enhances the efficiency of complex multi-objective design tasks and opens new avenues in fields such as biomedical materials engineering, renewable energy, and environmental sustainability.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.10097v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this short review article, we present recent progress in quantum thermodynamics in the framework with a correlated catalyst. We examine two key properties of thermal operations, the Gibbs preserving property and the covariant property. The state convertibility of a Gibbs preserving operation is fully characterized by the second law of thermodynamics with the nonequilibrium free energy. The state convertibility of a covariant operation is shown to be free as long as an initial state has finite coherence. We finally show that these two findings can be combined in the enhanced thermal operation (covariant Gibbs-preserving operation).</description>

      <title>Stochastic Density Functional Theory on Lane Formation in Electric-Field-Driven Ionic Mixtures: Flow-Kernel-Based Formulation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.10568</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.10568v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Simulation and experimental studies have demonstrated non-equilibrium ordering in driven colloidal suspensions: with increasing driving force, a uniform colloidal mixture transforms into a locally demixed state characterized by the lane formation or the emergence of strongly anisotropic stripe-like domains. Theoretically, we have found that a linear stability analysis of density dynamics can explain the non-equilibrium ordering by adding a non-trivial advection term. This advection arises from fluctuating flows due to non-Coulombic interactions associated with oppositely driven migrations. Recent studies based on the dynamical density functional theory (DFT) without multiplicative noise have introduced the flow kernel for providing a general description of the fluctuating velocity. Here, we assess and extend the above deterministic DFT by treating electric-field-driven binary ionic mixtures as the primitive model. First, we develop the stochastic DFT with multiplicative noise for the laning phenomena. The stochastic DFT considering the fluctuating flows allows us to determine correlation functions in a steady state. In particular, asymptotic analysis on the stationary charge-charge correlation function reveals that the above dispersion relation for linear stability analysis is equivalent to the pole equation for determining the oscillatory wavelength of charge--charge correlations. Next, the appearance of stripe-like domains is demonstrated not only by using the pole equation but also by performing the 2D inverse Fourier transform of the charge--charge correlation function without the premise of anisotropic homogeneity in the electric field direction.</description>

      <title>Unitary tetrahedron quantum gates</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.10731v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Quantum simulations of many-body systems using 2-qubit Yang-Baxter gates offer a benchmark for quantum hardware. This can be extended to the higher dimensional case with $n$-qubit generalisations of Yang-Baxter gates called $n$-simplex operators. Such multi-qubit gates potentially lead to shallower and more efficient quantum circuits as well. Finding them amounts to identifying unitary solutions of the $n$-simplex equations, the building blocks of higher dimensional integrable systems. These are a set of highly non-linear and over determined system of equations making it notoriously hard to solve even when the local Hilbert spaces are spanned by qubits. We systematically overcome this for higher simplex operators constructed using two methods: from Clifford algebras and by lifting Yang-Baxter operators. The $n=3$ or the tetrahedron case is analyzed in detail. For the qubit case our methods produce 13 inequivalent families of unitary tetrahedron operators. 12 of these families are obtained by appending the 5 unitary families of 4 by 4 constant Yang-Baxter operators of Dye-Hietarinta, with a single qubit operator. As applications, universal sets of single, two and three qubit gates are realized using such unitary tetrahedron operators. The ideas presented in this work can be naturally extended to the higher simplex cases.</description>

      <title>Effect of order of transfer matrix exceptional points on transport at band edges</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.10884</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.10884v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recently, it has been shown that, in one dimensional fermionic systems, close to band edges, the zero temperature conductance scales as $1/N^2$, where $N$ is the system length. This universal subdiffusive scaling of conductance at band edges has been tied to an exceptional point (EP) of the transfer matrix of the system that occur at every band edge. Further, in presence of bulk dephasing probes, this EP has been shown to lead to a counterintuitive superballistic scaling of conductance, where the conductance increases with $N$ over a finite but large regime of system lengths. In this work, we explore how these behaviors are affected by the order of the transfer matrix EP at the band edge. We consider a one-dimensional fermionic lattice chain with a finite range of hopping. Depending on the range of hopping and the hopping parameters, this system can feature band edges which correspond to arbitrarily higher order EPs of the associated transfer matrix. Using this system we establish in generality that, in absence of bulk dephasing, surprisingly, the universal $1/N^2$ scaling of conductance is completely unaffected by the order of the EP. This is despite the fact that existence of transfer matrix EP is crucial for such behavior. In presence of bulk dephasing, however, the phase coherence length, the extent of the superballisitic scaling regime and the exponent of superballistic scaling, all encode the order of the transfer matrix EP.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2211.00670v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Using a thermodynamically consistent, mesoscopic model for modern complementary metal-oxide-semiconductor transistors, we study an array of logical circuits and explore how their function is constrained by recent thermodynamic uncertainty relations when operating near thermal energies. For a single NOT gate, we find operating direction-dependent dynamics, and a trade-off between dissipated heat and operation time certainty. For a memory storage device, we find an exponential relationship between the memory retention time and energy required to sustain that memory state. For a clock, we find that the certainty in the cycle time is maximized at biasing voltages near thermal energy, as is the trade-off between this certainty and the heat dissipated per cycle. We identify a control mechanism that can increase the cycle time certainty without an offsetting increase in heat dissipation by working at a resonance condition for the clock. These results provide a framework for assessing thermodynamic costs of realistic computing devices, allowing for circuits to be designed and controlled for thermodynamically optimal operation.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2310.16627v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Measuring entropy production of a system directly from the experimental data is highly desirable since it gives a quantifiable measure of the time-irreversibility for non-equilibrium systems and can be used as a cost function to optimize the performance of the system. Although numerous methods are available to infer the entropy production of stationary systems, there are only a limited number of methods that have been proposed for time-dependent systems and, to the best of our knowledge, none of these methods have been applied to experimental systems. Herein, we develop a general non-invasive methodology to infer a lower bound on the mean total entropy production for arbitrary time-dependent continuous-state Markov systems in terms of the moments of the underlying state variables. The method gives surprisingly accurate estimates for the entropy production, both for theoretical toy models and for experimental bit erasure, even with a very limited amount of experimental data.</description>

      <title>Critical quantum dynamics of observables at eigenstate transitions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2312.00873v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: It is an outstanding goal to unveil the key features of quantum dynamics at eigenstate transitions. Focusing on quadratic fermionic Hamiltonians that exhibit localization transitions, we identify physical observables that exhibit scale-invariant critical dynamics at the transition when quenched from the initially localized charge density-wave states. The identification is based on two ingredients: (a) A relationship between the time evolution of observables in a many-body state and the transition probabilities of single-particle states, and (b) scale invariance of transition probabilities, which generalizes the corresponding recent result for survival probabilities [M. Hopjan and L. Vidmar, Phys. Rev. Lett. 131, 060404 (2023); Phys. Rev. Res. 5, 043301 (2023)]. These properties suggest that the scale-invariant critical dynamics in the quantum-quench dynamics is also exhibited by the observables, which share the common eigenbasis with the Hamiltonian before the quench. Focusing on experimentally relevant observables such as site occupations and the particle imbalance, we numerically demonstrate their critical behavior at the eigenstate transitions in the three-dimensional Anderson model and the one-dimensional Aubry-Andr\'e model model.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.02789v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: By introducing a simple competition mechanism for bond insertion in random graphs, explosive percolation exhibits a sharp phase transition with rich critical phenomena. We investigate high-order connectivity in explosive percolation using an event-based ensemble, focusing on biconnected clusters, where any two sites are connected by at least two independent paths. Our numerical analysis confirms that explosive percolation with different intra-cluster bond competition rules shares the same percolation threshold and universality, with biconnected clusters percolating simultaneously with simply connected clusters. However, the volume fractal dimension $d_{f}'$ of biconnected clusters varies depending on the competition rules of intra-cluster bonds. The size distribution of biconnected clusters exhibits double-scaling behavior: large clusters follow the standard Fisher exponent derived from the hyperscaling relation $\tau'=1+1/d_{f}'$, while small clusters display a modified Fisher exponent $\tau_0&lt;\tau'$. These findings provide insights into the intricate nature of connectivity in explosive percolation.</description>

      <title>Toward Practical Benchmarks of Ising Machines: A Case Study on the Quadratic Knapsack Problem</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.19175v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Combinatorial optimization has wide applications from industry to natural science. Ising machines bring an emerging computing paradigm for efficiently solving a combinatorial optimization problem by searching a ground state of a given Ising model. Current cutting-edge Ising machines achieve fast sampling of near-optimal solutions of the max-cut problem. However, for problems with additional constraint conditions, their advantages have been hardly shown due to difficulties in handling the constraints. In this work, we focus on benchmarks of Ising machines on the quadratic knapsack problem (QKP). To bring out their practical performance, we propose fast two-stage post-processing for Ising machines, which makes handling the constraint easier. Simulation based on simulated annealing shows that the proposed method substantially improves the solving performance of Ising machines and the improvement is robust to a choice of encoding of the constraint condition. Through evaluation using an Ising machine called Amplify Annealing Engine, the proposed method is shown to dramatically improve its solving performance on the QKP. These results are a crucial step toward showing advantages of Ising machines on practical problems involving various constraint conditions.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.14708v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In 1998, O'Loan et al. introduced a simplified bus route model to illustrate bus dynamics. However, fluctuations in passenger numbers make it challenging to achieve an exact solution for the model's stationary state, as these fluctuations can impact bus behavior. In this study, we present an exactly solvable model for a dual bus route system that builds upon O'Loan et al.'s model. This dual model allows us to comprehensively analyze bus route dynamics. Our model introduces additional parameters not previously considered by O'Loan et al. to account for neighboring effects and align with an observation in the original model, which can influence the average stationary current and velocity of buses. When the neighboring effect is weak, our model behaves similarly to O'Loan et al.'s bus route model. However, with a strong neighboring effect, our model exhibits intriguing characteristics. Additionally, in some limiting cases, our model recovers well-known models such as the simple exclusion process, its generalization, the cooperative exclusion process, and the RNA polymerase model during the elongation stage.</description>

      <title>Hierarchy of emergent cluster states by measurement from symmetry-protected-topological states with large symmetry to subsystem cat state</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.02592v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We propose {\it measurement-producing hierarchy} emerging among correlated states by sequential subsystem projective measurements. We start from symmetry-protected-topological (SPT) cluster states with a large symmetry and apply sequential subsystem projective measurements to them and find that generalized cluster SPT states with a reduced symmetry appear in the subsystem of the unmeasured sites. That prescription finally produces Greenberger-Home-Zeilinger states with long-range order in the subsystem composed of periodic unmeasured sites of the original lattice. The symmetry-reduction hierarchical structure from a general large symmetric SPT cluster state is clearly captured by the measurement update flow in the efficient algorithm of stabilizer formalism. This approach is useful not only for the analytical search for the measured state but also for numerical simulation with a large system size. We also numerically verify the symmetry-reduction hierarchy by sequential subsystem projective measurements applied to large systems and large symmetric cluster SPT states.</description>

      <title>Generalized Diffusive Epidemic Process with Permanent Immunity in Two Dimensions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.08175v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We introduce the generalized diffusive epidemic process, which is a metapopulation model for an epidemic outbreak where a non-sedentary population of walkers can jump along lattice edges with diffusion rates $D_S$ or $D_I$ if they are susceptible or infected, respectively, and recovered individuals possess permanent immunity. Individuals can be contaminated with rate $\mu_c$ if they share the same lattice node with an infected individual and recover with rate $\mu_r$, being removed from the dynamics. Therefore, the model does not have the conservation of the active particles composed of susceptible and infected individuals. The reaction-diffusion dynamics are separated into two stages: (i) Brownian diffusion, where the particles can jump to neighboring nodes, and (ii) contamination and recovery reactions. The dynamics are mapped into a growing process by activating lattice nodes with successful contaminations where activated nodes are interpreted as infection sources. In all simulations, the epidemic starts with one infected individual in a lattice filled with susceptibles. Our results indicate a phase transition in the dynamic percolation universality class controlled by the population size, irrespective of diffusion rates $D_S$ and $D_I$ and a subexponential growth of the epidemics in the percolation threshold.</description>

      <title>Fractional Brownian motion in confining potentials: non-equilibrium distribution tails and optimal fluctuations</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.08461v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: At long times, a fractional Brownian particle in a confining external potential reaches a non-equilibrium (non-Boltzmann) steady state. Here we consider scale-invariant power-law potentials $V(x)\sim |x|^m$, where $m&gt;0$, and employ the optimal fluctuation method (OFM) to determine the large-$|x|$ tails of the steady-state probability distribution $\mathcal{P}(x)$ of the particle position. The calculations involve finding the optimal (that is, the most likely) path of the particle, which determines these tails, via a minimization of the exact action functional for this system, which has recently become available. Exploiting dynamical scale invariance of the model in conjunction with the OFM ansatz, we establish the large-$|x|$ tails of $\ln \mathcal{P}(x)$ up to a dimensionless factor $\alpha(H,m)$, where $0&lt;H&lt;1$ is the Hurst exponent. We determine $\alpha(H,m)$ analytically (i) in the limits of $H\to 0$ and $H\to 1$, and (ii) for $m=2$ and arbitrary $H$, corresponding to the fractional Ornstein-Uhlenbeck (fOU) process. Our results for the fOU process are in agreement with the previously known exact $\mathcal{P}(x)$ and autocovariance. The form of the tails of $\mathcal{P}(x)$ yields exact conditions, in terms of $H$ and $m$, for the particle confinement in the potential. For $H\neq 1/2$, the tails encode the non-equilibrium character of the steady state distribution, and we observe violation of time reversibility of the system except for $m=2$. To compute the optimal paths and the factor $\alpha(H,m)$ for arbitrary permissible $H$ and $m$, one needs to solve an (in general nonlinear) integro-differential equation. To this end we develop a specialized numerical iteration algorithm which accounts analytically for an intrinsic cusp singularity of the optimal paths for $H&lt;1/2$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2208.01989v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Consider the semi-flow given by the continuous time shift $\Theta_t:\mathcal{D} \to \mathcal{D} $, $t \geq 0$, acting on the
  $\mathcal{D} $ of \textit{c\`{a}dl\`{a}g} paths $w: [0,\infty) \to S^1$, where $S^1$ is the unitary circle. We equip the space $\mathcal{D} $ with the Skorokhod metric, and we show that the semi-flow is expanding. We also introduce a stochastic semi-group $e^{t\, L}$, $t \geq 0,$ where $L$ acts linearly on continuous functions $f:S^1\to\mathbb{R}$. This stochastic semigroup and an initial vector of probability $\pi$ define an associated stationary shift-invariant probability $\mathbb{P}$ on the Polish space $\mathcal{D} $. Given such $\mathbb{P}$ and an H\"older potential $V:S^1 \to \mathbb{R}$, we define a continuous time Ruelle operator, which is described by a family of linear operators $ \mathbb{L}^t_V$, $t\geq 0,$ acting on continuous functions $\varphi: S^1 \to \mathbb{R}$. More precisely, given any H\"older $V$ and $t\geq 0$, the operator $ \mathbb{L}^t_V$, is defined by
  $\varphi \to \psi(y) = \mathbb{L}^t_V(\varphi)(y)= \int_{w(t)=y} e^{ \int_0^t V(w(s)) ds} \varphi (w(0)) d \mathbb{P}(w).$
  For some specific parameters we show the existence of an eigenvalue $\lambda_V$ and an associated H\"older eigenfunction $\varphi_V&gt;0$.After a coboundary procedure we obtain another stochastic semigroup, with infinitesimal generator $L_V$, and this will define a new probability $\mathbb{P}_V$ on $\mathcal{D}$, which we call the Gibbs (or, equilibrium) probability for the potential $V$. In this case, we define entropy for some shift-invariant probabilities on $\mathcal{D}$, and we consider a variational problem of pressure. Finally, we define entropy production and present our main result: we analyze its relation with time-reversal and symmetry of $L$. We also show that the continuous-time shift $\Theta_t$, acting on the Skorohod space $D$, is expanding.</description>

      <title>Detecting and Attributing Change in Climate and Complex Systems: Foundations, Green's Functions, and Nonlinear Fingerprints</title>

      <description>arXiv:2212.02628v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Detection and attribution (D&amp;A) studies are cornerstones of climate science, providing crucial evidence for policy decisions. Their goal is to link observed climate change patterns to anthropogenic and natural drivers via the optimal fingerprinting method (OFM). We show that response theory for nonequilibrium systems offers the physical and dynamical basis for OFM, including the concept of causality used for attribution. Our framework clarifies the method's assumptions, advantages, and potential weaknesses. We use our theory to perform D&amp;A for prototypical climate change experiments performed on an energy balance model and on a low-resolution coupled climate model. We also explain the underpinnings of degenerate fingerprinting, which offers early warning indicators for tipping points. Finally, we extend the OFM to the nonlinear response regime. Our analysis shows that OFM has broad applicability across diverse stochastic systems influenced by time-dependent forcings, with potential relevance to ecosystems, quantitative social sciences, and finance, among others.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2305.18215v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: One-dimensional chains are used as a fundamental model of condensed matter, and have constituted the starting point for key developments in nonlinear physics and complex systems. The pioneering work in this field was proposed by Fermi, Pasta, Ulam and Tsingou in the 50s in Los Alamos. An intense and fruitful mathematical and physical research followed during these last 70 years. Recently, a fresh look at the mechanisms of thermalization in such systems has been provided through the lens of the Wave Turbulence approach. In this review, we give a critical summary of the results obtained in this framework. We also present a series of open problems and challenges that future work needs to address.</description>

      <title>Critical behaviors of non-stabilizerness in quantum spin chains</title>

      <description>arXiv:2309.00676v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Non-stabilizerness - commonly known as magic - measures the extent to which a quantum state deviates from stabilizer states and is a fundamental resource for achieving universal quantum computation. In this work, we investigate the behavior of non-stabilizerness around criticality in quantum spin chains. To quantify non-stabilizerness, we employ a monotone called mana, based on the negativity of the discrete Wigner function. This measure captures non-stabilizerness for both pure and mixed states. We introduce R\'enyi generalizations of mana, which are also measures of non-stabilizerness for pure states, and utilize it to compute mana in large quantum systems. We consider the three-state Potts model and its non-integrable extension and we provide strong evidence that the mutual mana exhibits universal logarithmic scaling with distance in conformal field theory, as is the case for entanglement.</description>

      <title>The Countoscope: Measuring Self and Collective Dynamics without Trajectories</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.00647</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.00647v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Driven by physical questions pertaining to quantifying particle dynamics, microscopy can now resolve complex systems at the single particle level, from cellular organisms to individual ions. Yet, available analysis techniques face challenges reconstructing trajectories in dense and heterogeneous systems where accurately labelling particles is difficult. Furthermore, the inescapable finite field of view of experiments hinders the measurement of collective effects. Inspired by Smoluchowski, we introduce a broadly applicable analysis technique that probes dynamics of interacting particle suspensions based on a remarkably simple principle: counting particles in finite observation boxes. Using colloidal experiments, advanced simulations and theory, we first demonstrate that statistical properties of fluctuating counts can be used to determine self-diffusion coefficients, so alleviating the hurdles associated with trajectory reconstruction. We also provide a recipe for practically extracting the diffusion coefficient from experimental data at variable particle densities, which is sensitive to steric and hydrodynamic interactions. Remarkably, by increasing the observation box size, counting naturally enables the study of collective dynamics in dense suspensions. Using our novel analysis of particle counts, we uncover a surprising enhancement of collective behaviour, as well as a new length scale associated with hyperuniform-like structure. Our counting framework, the Countoscope, thus enables efficient measurements of self and collective dynamics in dense suspensions and opens the way to quantifying dynamics and identifying novel physical mechanisms in diverse complex systems where single particles can be resolved.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2401.01877v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present a comprehensive study of hydrodynamic theories for superfluids with dipole symmetry. Taking diffusion as an example, we systematically construct a hydrodynamic framework that incorporates an intrinsic dipole degree of freedom in analogy to spin density in micropolar (spinful) fluids. Subsequently, we study a dipole condensed phase and propose a model that captures the spontaneous breaking of the $U(1)$ charge. The theory explains the role of the inverse Higgs constraint for this class of theories, and naturally generates the gapless field. Next, we introduce finite temperature theory using the Hamiltonian formalism and study the hydrodynamics of ideal fracton superfluids. Finally, we postulate a derivative counting scheme and incorporate dissipative effects using the method of irreversible thermodynamics. We verify the consistency of the dispersion relations and argue that our counting is systematic.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2401.04270v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The non-equilibrium physics of many-body quantum systems harbors various unconventional phenomena. In this study, we experimentally investigate one of the most puzzling of these phenomena -- the quantum Mpemba effect, where a tilted ferromagnet restores its symmetry more rapidly when it is farther from the symmetric state compared to when it is closer. We present the first experimental evidence of the occurrence of this effect in a trapped-ion quantum simulator. The symmetry breaking and restoration are monitored through entanglement asymmetry, probed via randomized measurements, and postprocessed using the classical shadows technique. Our findings are further substantiated by measuring the Frobenius distance between the experimental state and the stationary thermal symmetric theoretical state, offering direct evidence of subsystem thermalization.</description>

      <title>Operator Growth in Disordered Spin Chains: Indications for the Absence of Many-Body Localization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.08031</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.08031v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We consider the growth of a local operator $A$ in one-dimensional many-body systems with Hamiltonian $H$ by calculating the $k$-fold commutator $[H,[H,[...,[H,A]]]]$. We derive general bounds for the operator norm of this commutator in free and interacting fermionic systems with and without disorder thus directly connecting the {\it operator growth hypothesis} with questions of localization. We show, in particular, that in a localized system the norm does grow at most exponentially and that the contributions of operators to the total norm are exponentially suppressed with their length. We support our general results by considering one specific example, the XXZ chain with random magnetic fields. We solve the operator spreading in the XX case without disorder exactly. For the Anderson and Aubry-Andr\'e models we provide strict upper bounds. We support our results by symbolic calculations of the commutator up to high orders. For the XXX case with random magnetic fields, these symbolic calculations show a growth of the operator norm faster than exponential and consistent with the general bound for an ergodic system. Also, there is no exponential decay of the contribution of operators as function of their length. We conclude that there is no indication for a many-body localization transition. Finally, we also discuss the differences between the interacting and non-interacting cases when trying to perturbatively transform the microscopic to an effective Hamiltonian of local conserved charges by consecutive Schrieffer-Wolff transformations. We find that such an approach is not well-defined in the interacting case because the transformation generates $\sim 4^\ell$ terms connecting sites a distance $\ell$ apart which can overwhelm the exponential decay with $\ell$ of the amplitude of each individual term.</description>

      <title>Flocking by Turning Away</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.17153</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.17153v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Flocking, as paradigmatically exemplified by birds, is the coherent collective motion of active agents. As originally conceived, flocking emerges through alignment interactions between the agents. Here, we report that flocking can also emerge through interactions that turn agents away from each other. Combining simulations, kinetic theory, and experiments, we demonstrate this mechanism of flocking in self-propelled Janus colloids with stronger repulsion on the front than on the rear. The polar state is stable because particles achieve a compromise between turning away from left and right neighbors. Unlike for alignment interactions, the emergence of polar order from turn-away interactions requires particle repulsion. At high concentration, repulsion produces flocking Wigner crystals. Whereas repulsion often leads to motility-induced phase separation of active particles, here it combines with turn-away torques to produce flocking. Therefore, our findings bridge the classes of aligning and non-aligning active matter. Our results could help to reconcile the observations that cells can flock despite turning away from each other via contact inhibition of locomotion. Overall, our work shows that flocking is a very robust phenomenon that arises even when the orientational interactions would seem to prevent it.</description>

Abstract: We consider an open interacting particle system on a finite lattice. The particles perform asymmetric simple exclusion and are randomly created or destroyed at all sites, with rates that grow rapidly near the boundaries. We study the hydrodynamic limit for the particle density at the hyperbolic space-time scale and obtain the entropy solution to a boundary-driven quasilinear conservation law with a relaxation term. Different from the usual boundary conditions introduced in [Bardos, Roux, and Nedelec, (1979), Comm. Part. Diff. Equ], discontinuity (boundary layer) does not formulate at the boundaries due to the strong relaxation scheme.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2402.13154v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We introduce two disorder-free variants of the Sachdev-Ye-Kitaev (SYK) model, demonstrate their integrability, and study their static and dynamical properties. Unlike diagrammatic techniques, the integrability of these models allows us to obtain dynamical correlation functions even when the number of Majorana fermions is finite. From the solutions, we find that out-of-time-order correlators (OTOCs) in these models exhibit exponential growth at early times, resembling that of quantum chaotic systems such as those with disorder or external kick terms. Conversely, our analysis shows no evidence of random-matrix behavior in level statistics or the spectral form factor. Our findings illustrate that the clean versions of the SYK models represent simple but nontrivial examples of disorder-free quantum many-body systems displaying chaos-like behavior of OTOCs.</description>

      <title>High-harmonic generation in graphene under the application of a DC electric current: From perturbative to nonperturbative regimes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.03523</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.03523v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We theoretically investigate high-harmonic generation (HHG) in honeycomb-lattice graphene models when subjected to a DC electric field. By integrating the quantum master equation with the Boltzmann equation, we develop a numerical method to compute laser-driven dynamics in many-electron lattice systems under DC electric current. The method enables us to treat both the weak-laser (perturbative) and intense-laser (nonperturbative) regimes in a unified way, accounting for the experimentally inevitable dissipation effects. From it, we obtain the HHG spectra and analyze their dependence on laser frequency, laser intensity, laser-field direction, and DC current strength. We show that the dynamical and static symmetries are partially broken by a DC current or staggered potential term, and such symmetry breakings drastically change the shape of the HHG spectra, especially in terms of the presence or absence of $(2n+1)$th-, $2n$th-, or $3n$th-order harmonics ($n\in \mathbb Z$). The laser intensity, frequency, and polarization are also shown to affect the shape of the HHG spectra. Our findings indicate that HHG spectra in conducting electron systems can be quantitatively or qualitatively controlled by tuning various external parameters, and DC electric current is used as such an efficient parameter.</description>

      <title>Unscrambling of single-particle wave functions in systems localized through disorder and monitoring</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.10725v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In systems undergoing localization-delocalization quantum phase transitions due to disorder or monitoring, there is a crucial need for robust methods capable of distinguishing phases and uncovering their intrinsic properties. In this work, we develop a process of finding a Slater determinant representation of free-fermion wave functions that accurately characterizes localized particles, a procedure we dub "unscrambling". The central idea is to minimize the overlap between envelopes of single-particle wave functions or, equivalently, to maximize the inverse participation ratio of each orbital. This numerically efficient methodology can differentiate between distinct types of wave functions: exponentially localized, power-law localized, and conformal critical, also revealing the underlying physics of these states. The method is readily extendable to systems in higher dimensions. Furthermore, we apply this approach to a more challenging problem involving disordered monitored free fermions in one dimension, where the unscrambling process unveils the presence of a conformal critical phase and a localized area-law quantum Zeno phase. Importantly, our method can also be extended to free fermion systems without particle number conservation, which we demonstrate by estimating the phase diagram of $\mathbb{Z}_2$-symmetric disordered monitored free fermions. Our results unlock the potential of utilizing single-particle wave functions to gain valuable insights into the localization transition properties in systems such as monitored free fermions and disordered models.</description>

Abstract: Classical magnets exhibit exotic ground state properties such as spin liquids and fractionalization, promising a manifestation of superposition and projective symmetry construction in classical theory. While system-specific spin-ice or soft-spin models exist, a formal theory for general classical magnets remains elusive. Here, we introduce a generic symmetry group construction built from a vector field in a plaquette of classical spins, demonstrating how classical spins superpose in irreducible representations (irreps) of the symmetry group. The corresponding probability amplitudes serve as order parameters and local spins as fragmented excitations. The formalism offers a many-body vector field representation of diverse ground states, including spin liquids and fragmented phases described as degenerate ensembles of irreps. We apply the theory to a frustrated square Kagome lattice, where spin-ice or soft spin rules are inapt, to describe spin liquids and fragmented phases, all validated through irreps ensembles and unbiased Monte Carlo simulation. Our generic theory sheds light on previously unknown aspects of spin-liquid phases and fragmentation and broadens their applications to other branches of field theory.</description>

      <title>Theory of the inverse Faraday effect in dissipative Rashba electron systems: Floquet engineering perspective</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.20110</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.20110v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We theoretically study the inverse Faraday effect (IFE), i.e., photo-induced magnetization, in two-dimensional Rashba spin-orbit coupled electron systems irradiated by a circularly polarized light. The quantum master (Gorini-Kossakowski-Sudarshan-Lindblad) equation enables us to accurately compute the laser driven dynamics, taking inevitable dissipation effects into account. To find the universal features of laser-driven magnetization and its dynamics, we comprehensively investigate (i) the nonequilibrium steady state (NESS) driven by a continuous wave and (ii) ultrafast spin dynamics driven by short laser pulses. In the NESS (i), the laser-induced magnetization and its dependence of several parameters (laser frequency, laser field strength, temperature, dissipation strength, etc.) are shown to be in good agreement with the predictions from Floquet theory for dissipative systems in the high-frequency regime. In the case (ii), we focus on ferromagnetic metal states by introducing an effective magnetic field to the Rashba model as the mean field of electron-electron interaction. We find that a precession of the magnetic moment occurs due to the pulse-driven instantaneous magnetic field and the initial phase of the precession is controlled by changing the sign of light polarization. This is well consistent with the spin dynamics observed in experiments of laser-pulse-driven IFE. We discuss how the pulse-driven dynamics are captured by the Floquet theory. Our results %pave the way for computing provides a microscopic method to compute ultrafast dynamics in many electron systems irradiated by intense light.</description>

      <title>Deciding factor for detecting a particle within a subspace via dark and bright states</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.12677</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.12677v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In a measurement-induced continuous-time quantum walk, we address the problem of detecting a particle in a subspace, instead of a fixed position. In this configuration, we develop an approach of bright and dark states based on the unit and vanishing detection probability respectively for a particle-detection in the subspace. Specifically, by employing the rank-nullity theorem, we determine several properties of dark and bright states in terms of energy spectrum of the Hamiltonian used for a quantum walk and the projectors applied to detect the subspace. We provide certain conditions on the position and the rank of the subspace to be detected, resulting in the unit total detection probability, which has broad implications for quantum computing. Further, we illustrate the forms of dark as well as bright states and the dependence of detection probability on the number of dark states by considering a cyclic graph with nearest-neighbor and next nearest-neighbor hopping. Moreover, we observe that the divergence in the average number of measurements for detecting a particle successfully in a subspace can be reduced by performing high rank projectors.</description>

      <title>A quantum Monte Carlo algorithm to extract large-scale data of entanglement entropy and its derivative in high precision</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.05324</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.05324v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We propose a quantum Monte Carlo (QMC) scheme able to extract large-scale data of entanglement entropy (EE) and its derivative with high precision and low technical barrier. It opens a way to numerically detect the novel phases and phase transitions by scanning EE in a wide parameter-region in two and higher dimensional systems. In other words, in the same order of computational time, the previous methods could only get one EE data point, but we can obtain thousands (even more) of times EE data points along a physical parameter path. We then show the feasibility of using EE and its derivative to find phase transition points and to probe novel phases.</description>

      <title>Protect Measurement-Induced Phase Transition from Noise</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.14109</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.14109v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Measurement-induced phase transition (MIPT) is a novel non-equilibrium phase transition characterized by entanglement entropy. The scrambling dynamics induced by random unitary gates can protect information from low-rate measurements. However, common decoherence noises, such as dephasing, are detrimental to the volume law phase, posing a significant challenge for observing MIPT in current noisy intermediate-scale quantum devices. Here, we demonstrate that incorporating quantum-enhanced operations can effectively protect MIPT from environmental noise. The conditional entanglement entropy is associated with a statistical mechanics model wherein noise and quantum-enhanced operations act as two competing external random fields. Then we show that an average apparatus-environment exchange symmetry ensures the conditional entanglement entropy is a valid probe of entanglement. Furthermore, we provide numerical evidence on a (2+1)-d quantum circuit under dephasing noise, demonstrating that MIPT can indeed be observed with the aid of quantum-enhanced operations. This result not only serves as a concrete example of the power of quantum enhancement in combating noise but also holds experimental relevance, as the protocol is straightforward to implement in practice.</description>

      <title>Smectic-like bundle formation of planktonic bacteria upon nutrient starvation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.05031</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.05031v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Bacteria aggregate through various intercellular interactions to build biofilms, but the effect of environmental changes thereupon remains largely unexplored. Here, by using an experimental device that overcomes past difficulties, we observed the collective response of Escherichia coli aggregates against dynamic changes in the growth condition. We discovered that nutrient starvation caused bacterial cells to arrange themselves into bundle-shaped clusters, developing a structure akin to that of smectic liquid crystal. The degree of the smectic-like bundle order was evaluated by a deep learning approach. Our experiments suggest that both the depletion attraction by extracellular polymeric substances and the growth arrest are essential for the bundle formation. Since these effects of nutrient starvation at the single-cell level are common to many bacterial species, bundle formation might also be common collective behavior that bacterial cells may exhibit under harsh environments.</description>

      <title>Scaling limit of domino tilings on a pentagonal domain</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.07849v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We consider the six-vertex model at its free-fermion point with domain wall boundary conditions, which is equivalent to random domino tilings of the Aztec diamond. We compute the scaling limit of a particular non-local correlation function, essentially equivalent to the partition function for the domino tilings of a pentagon-shaped domain, obtained by cutting away a triangular region from a corner of the initial Aztec diamond. We observe a third-order phase transition when the geometric parameters of the obtained pentagonal domain are tuned to have the fifth side exactly tangent to the arctic ellipse of the corresponding initial model.</description>

      <title>Kekul\'e valence bond order in the honeycomb lattice optical Su-Schrieffer-Heeger Model and its relevance to Graphene</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.09366</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.09366v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We perform sign-problem-free determinant quantum Monte Carlo simulations of the optical Su-Schrieffer-Heeger (SSH) model on a half-filled honeycomb lattice. In particular, we investigate the model's semi-metal (SM) to Kekul{\'e} Valence Bond Solid (KVBS) phase transition at zero and finite temperatures as a function of phonon energy and interaction strength. Using hybrid Monte Carlo sampling methods we can simulate the model near the adiabatic regime, allowing us to access regions of parameter space relevant to graphene. Our simulations suggest that the SM-KVBS transition is weakly first-order at all temperatures, with graphene situated close to the phase boundary in the SM region of the phase diagram. Our results highlight the important role bond-stretching phonon modes play in the formation of KVBS order in strained graphene-derived systems.</description>
