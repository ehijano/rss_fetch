      <title>A Method for Evaluating the Interpretability of Machine Learning Models in Predicting Bond Default Risk Based on LIME and SHAP</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.19615</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.19615v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Interpretability analysis methods for artificial intelligence models, such as LIME and SHAP, are widely used, though they primarily serve as post-model for analyzing model outputs. While it is commonly believed that the transparency and interpretability of AI models diminish as their complexity increases, currently there is no standardized method for assessing the inherent interpretability of the models themselves. This paper uses bond market default prediction as a case study, applying commonly used machine learning algorithms within AI models. First, the classification performance of these algorithms in default prediction is evaluated. Then, leveraging LIME and SHAP to assess the contribution of sample features to prediction outcomes, the paper proposes a novel method for evaluating the interpretability of the models themselves. The results of this analysis are consistent with the intuitive understanding and logical expectations regarding the interpretability of these models.</description>

      <title>Graph Signal Processing for Global Stock Market Realized Volatility Forecasting</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.22706</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.22706v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper introduces an innovative realized volatility (RV) forecasting framework that extends the conventional Heterogeneous Auto-Regressive (HAR) model via integrating the Graph Signal Processing (GSP) technique. The volatility spillover effect is embedded and modeled in the proposed framework, which employs the graph Fourier transformation method to effectively analyze the global stock market dynamics in the spectral domain. In addition, convolution filters with learnable weights are applied to capture the historical mid-term and long-term volatility patterns. The empirical study is conducted with RV data of $24$ global stock market indices with around $3500$ common trading days from May 2002 to June 2022. The proposed model's short-term, middle-term and long-term RV forecasting performance is compared with various HAR type models and the graph neural network based HAR model. The results show that the proposed model consistently outperforms all other models considered in the study, demonstrating the effectiveness of integrating the GSP technique into the HAR model for RV forecasting.</description>
