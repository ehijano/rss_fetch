      <title>Assessing FAIRness of the Digital Shadow Reference Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.15715</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.15715v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Models play a critical role in managing the vast amounts of data and increasing complexity found in the IoT, IIoT, and IoP domains. The Digital Shadow Reference Model, which serves as a foundational metadata schema for linking data and metadata in these environments, is an example of such a model. Ensuring FAIRness (adherence to the FAIR Principles) is critical because it improves data findability, accessibility, interoperability, and reusability, facilitating efficient data management and integration across systems.
  This paper presents an evaluation of the FAIRness of the Digital Shadow Reference Model using a structured evaluation framework based on the FAIR Data Principles. Using the concept of FAIR Implementation Profiles (FIPs), supplemented by a mini-questionnaire, we systematically evaluate the model's adherence to these principles. Our analysis identifies key strengths, including the model's metadata schema that supports rich descriptions and authentication techniques, and highlights areas for improvement, such as the need for globally unique identifiers and consequent support for different Web standards. The results provide actionable insights for improving the FAIRness of the model and promoting better data management and reuse. This research contributes to the field by providing a detailed assessment of the Digital Shadow Reference Model and recommending next steps to improve its FAIRness and usability.</description>

      <title>Proving Cypher Query Equivalence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.15742</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.15742v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Graph database systems store graph data as nodes and relationships, and utilize graph query languages (e.g., Cypher) for efficiently querying graph data. Proving the equivalence of graph queries is an important foundation for optimizing graph query performance, ensuring graph query reliability, etc. Although researchers have proposed many SQL query equivalence provers for relational database systems, these provers cannot be directly applied to prove the equivalence of graph queries. The difficulty lies in the fact that graph query languages (e.g., Cypher) adopt significantly different data models (property graph model vs. relational model) and query patterns (graph pattern matching vs. tabular tuple calculus) from SQL.
  In this paper, we propose GraphQE, an automated prover to determine whether two Cypher queries are semantically equivalent. We design a U-semiring based Cypher algebraic representation to model the semantics of Cypher queries. Our Cypher algebraic representation is built on the algebraic structure of unbounded semirings, and can sufficiently express nodes and relationships in property graphs and complex Cypher queries. Then, determining the equivalence of two Cypher queries is transformed into determining the equivalence of the corresponding Cypher algebraic representations, which can be verified by SMT solvers. To evaluate the effectiveness of GraphQE, we construct a dataset consisting of 148 pairs of equivalent Cypher queries. Among them, we have successfully proven 138 pairs of equivalent Cypher queries, demonstrating the effectiveness of GraphQE.</description>

      <title>Efficient Discovery of Motif Transition Process for Large-Scale Temporal Graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.15979</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.15979v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Understanding the dynamic transition of motifs in temporal graphs is essential for revealing how graph structures evolve over time, identifying critical patterns, and predicting future behaviors, yet existing methods often focus on predefined motifs, limiting their ability to comprehensively capture transitions and interrelationships. We propose a parallel motif transition process discovery algorithm, PTMT, a novel parallel method for discovering motif transition processes in large-scale temporal graphs. PTMT integrates a tree-based framework with the temporal zone partitioning (TZP) strategy, which partitions temporal graphs by time and structure while preserving lossless motif transitions and enabling massive parallelism. PTMT comprises three phases: growth zone parallel expansion, overlap-aware result aggregation, and deterministic encoding of motif transitions, ensuring accurate tracking of dynamic transitions and interactions. Results on 10 real-world datasets demonstrate that PTMT achieves speedups ranging from 12.0$\times$ to 50.3$\times$ compared to the SOTA method.</description>

      <title>A Python Tool for Reconstructing Full News Text from GDELT</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.16063</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.16063v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: News data have become an essential resource across various disciplines, including economics, finance, management, social sciences, and computer science. Researchers leverage newspaper articles to study economic trends, market dynamics, corporate strategies, public perception, political discourse, and the evolution of public opinion. Additionally, news datasets have been instrumental in training large-scale language models, with applications in sentiment analysis, fake news detection, and automated news summarization. Despite their significance, access to comprehensive news corpora remains a key challenge. Many full-text news providers, such as Factiva and LexisNexis, require costly subscriptions, while free alternatives often suffer from incomplete data and transparency issues. This paper presents a novel approach to obtaining full-text newspaper articles at near-zero cost by leveraging data from the Global Database of Events, Language, and Tone (GDELT). Specifically, we focus on the GDELT Web News NGrams 3.0 dataset, which provides high-frequency updates of n-grams extracted from global online news sources. We provide Python code to reconstruct full-text articles from these n-grams by identifying overlapping textual fragments and intelligently merging them. Our method enables researchers to access structured, large-scale newspaper data for text analysis while overcoming the limitations of existing proprietary datasets. The proposed approach enhances the accessibility of news data for empirical research, facilitating applications in economic forecasting, computational social science, and natural language processing.</description>

      <title>ParquetDB: A Lightweight Python Parquet-Based Database</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.05311</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.05311v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Traditional data storage formats and databases often introduce complexities and inefficiencies that hinder rapid iteration and adaptability. To address these challenges, we introduce ParquetDB, a Python-based database framework that leverages the Parquet file format's optimized columnar storage. ParquetDB offers efficient serialization and deserialization, native support for complex and nested data types, reduced dependency on indexing through predicate pushdown filtering, and enhanced portability due to its file-based storage system. Benchmarks show that ParquetDB outperforms traditional databases like SQLite and MongoDB in managing large volumes of data, especially when using data formats compatible with PyArrow. We validate ParquetDB's practical utility by applying it to the Alexandria 3D Materials Database, efficiently handling approximately 4.8 million complex and nested records. By addressing the inherent limitations of existing data storage systems and continuously evolving to meet future demands, ParquetDB has the potential to significantly streamline data management processes and accelerate research development in data-driven fields.</description>

      <title>A user-friendly SPARQL query editor powered by lightweight metadata</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.02688</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.02688v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: SPARQL query editors often lack intuitive interfaces to aid SPARQL-savvy users to write queries. To address this issue, we propose an easy-to-deploy, triple store-agnostic and open-source query editor that offers three main features: (i) automatic query example rendering, (ii) precise autocomplete based on existing triple patterns including within SERVICE clauses, and (iii) a data-aware schema visualization. It can be easily set up with a custom HTML element. The tool has been successfully tested on various public endpoints, and is deployed online at https://sib-swiss.github.io/sparql-editor with open-source code available at https://github.com/sib-swiss/sparql-editor.</description>

      <title>A Conceptual Model for Attributions in Event-Centric Knowledge Graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.03563</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.03563v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The use of narratives as a means of fusing information from knowledge graphs (KGs) into a coherent line of argumentation has been the subject of recent investigation. Narratives are especially useful in event-centric knowledge graphs in that they provide a means to connect different real-world events and categorize them by well-known narrations. However, specifically for controversial events, a problem in information fusion arises, namely, multiple viewpoints regarding the validity of certain event aspects, e.g., regarding the role a participant takes in an event, may exist. Expressing those viewpoints in KGs is challenging because disputed information provided by different viewpoints may introduce inconsistencies. Hence, most KGs only feature a single view on the contained information, hampering the effectiveness of narrative information access. This paper is an extension of our original work and introduces attributions, i.e., parameterized predicates that allow for the representation of facts that are only valid in a specific viewpoint. For this, we develop a conceptual model that allows for the representation of viewpoint-dependent information. As an extension, we enhance the model by a conception of viewpoint-compatibility. Based on this, we deepen our original deliberations on the model's effects on information fusion and provide additional grounding in the literature.</description>
