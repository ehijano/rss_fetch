      <title>Structural optimization of lattice-matched Sc0.14Al0.86N/GaN superlattices for photonic applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.08951</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.08951v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: ScxAl1-xN is an emerging III-nitride material known for its high piezoelectric coefficient and ferroelectric properties. Integration of wide-bandgap ScxAl1-xN with GaN is particularly attractive for quantum photonic devices. Achieving low defect complex multilayers incorporating ScxAl1-xN, though, requires precise lattice-matching and carefully optimized growth parameters. This study systematically investigates the molecular-beam epitaxy of short-period ScxAl1-xN/GaN superlattices with total thicknesses of up to 600 nm on GaN templates. X-ray diffraction reciprocal space mapping confirmed lattice-matching at x = 0.14 Sc composition regardless of the thickness of GaN interlayers, as evidenced by symmetric superlattice satellites aligned in-plane with the underlying substrate peak. Superlattices with Sc compositions deviating from this lattice-matching condition exhibited strain-induced defects ranging from crack formation to partial relaxation. Scanning transmission electron microscopy (STEM) investigation of the ScxAl1-xN/GaN interfaces identified temperature-dependent intermixing as a major factor in setting the nitride composition variation and implicitly band structure profile along the growth direction. Energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy also revealed that Sc incorporation exhibits delays relative to Al at both onset and termination. Optimal growth conditions were observed at approximately 600{\deg}C and 550{\deg}C for superlattices with thick GaN layers (6 nm), and ultra-thin GaN layers (&lt; 2 nm), respectively.</description>

      <title>Surprisingly High Redundancy in Electronic Structure Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.09001</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.09001v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Machine Learning (ML) models for electronic structure rely on large datasets generated through expensive Kohn-Sham Density Functional Theory simulations. This study reveals a surprisingly high level of redundancy in such datasets across various material systems, including molecules, simple metals, and complex alloys. Our findings challenge the prevailing assumption that large, exhaustive datasets are necessary for accurate ML predictions of electronic structure. We demonstrate that even random pruning can substantially reduce dataset size with minimal loss in predictive accuracy, while a state-of-the-art coverage-based pruning strategy retains chemical accuracy and model generalizability using up to 100-fold less data and reducing training time by threefold or more. By contrast, widely used importance-based pruning methods, which eliminate seemingly redundant data, can catastrophically fail at higher pruning factors, possibly due to the significant reduction in data coverage. This heretofore unexplored high degree of redundancy in electronic structure data holds the potential to identify a minimal, essential dataset representative of each material class.</description>

      <title>Molecular Arrangements in the First Monolayer of Cu-Phthalocyanine on In$_2$O$_3$(111)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.09044</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.09044v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Well-ordered organic molecular layers on oxide surfaces are key for organic electronics. Using a combination of scanning tunneling microscopy (STM) and non-contact atomic force microscopy (nc-AFM) we probe the structures of copper phthalocyanine (CuPc) on In$_2$O$_3$, a model for a prototypical transparent conductive oxide (TCO). These scanning-probe images allow the direct determination of the adsorption site and distortions of the molecules, which are corroborated by DFT calculations. Isolated CuPc molecules adsorb in a flat, slightly tilted geometry in three symmetry-equivalent configurations on the stoichiometric In$_2$O$_3$(111) surface. Increasing the coverage leads to densely-packed 1D chains oriented along $\langle1\bar{1}0\rangle$ directions, which dissolve into a highly ordered (2$\times$2) superstructure upon increasing the CuPc density to 3/4 per surface unit cell. At a coverage of one CuPc per surface unit cell, a densely packed (1$\times$1) superstructure fully covers the surface. The molecules still assume the same site and orientation as before, but they partially overlap to accommodate the high packing density, leading to a bending of the molecules. These results are compared to the behavior of CoPc on In$_2$O$_3$(111). In summary, we demonstrate that a uniform first layer of metal-phthalocyanine molecules can be realized on the In$_2$O$_3$(111) surface when using the proper metal atom in the molecule.</description>

      <title>Large non-saturating Nernst thermopower and magnetoresistance in compensated semimetal ScSb</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.09056</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.09056v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Today, high-performance thermoelectric and thermomagnetic materials operating in the low-temperature regime, particularly below the boiling point of liquid nitrogen remain scarce. Most thermomagnetic materials reported to date exhibit a strong Nernst signal along specific crystallographic directions in their single-crystal form. However, their performance typically degrades significantly in the polycrystalline form. Here, we report an improved Nernst thermopower of $\sim$ 128 $\mu$V/K at 30 K and 14 T in polycrystalline compensated semimetal ScSb, in comparison to that was observed in single crystal ScSb previously. The magnetic field dependence of Nernst thermopower shows a linear and non-saturating behavior up to 14 T. The maximum Nernst power factor reaches to $\sim 240 \times 10^{-4}$ W m$^{-1}$ K$^{-2}$ and Nernst figure of merit reaches to $\sim 11 \times 10^{-4}$ K$^{-1}$. Polycrystalline ScSb also shows a large non-saturating magnetoresistance of $\sim 940 \%$ at 2 K and 14 T. These enhanced properties originate from better electron-hole compensation, as revealed by Hall resistivity measurements. The cubic symmetry and absence of anisotropy in ScSb allow its polycrystalline form to achieve similar enhanced thermomagnetic and electromagnetic performance comparable to that of the single crystal.</description>

      <title>Spin current generation driven by skyrmion dynamics under magnetic anisotropy and polarized microwaves</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.09126</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.09126v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We have investigated the spin-current pumped by the skyrmion-host material with the lack of inversion symmetry through the microwave resonance process. The effects of magnetic anisotropy and polarized microwaves are examined by micromagnetic simulations. Our results reveal two distinct skyrmion phases, designated as SkX type-I and II, which emerge at low ($K_z&lt;0.1$ meV) and high ($K_z&gt;0.1$ meV) magnetic anisotropy constants, respectively, having different characteristics of spin excitations. The SkX type-I exhibits spin dynamics where the resonant frequency of the breathing mode is lying in between the clockwise and counterclockwise gyration modes of Bloch-type skyrmion at a very low anisotropy, and is crossing over the counterclockwise mode at $K_z \sim 0.04$ meV. Meanwhile, the SkX type-II exhibits distinct spin excitations in which the clockwise mode is notably absent, while the counterclockwise modes exist at both low and high resonant frequencies. This suggests that the magnetic anisotropy plays an essential role in the spin dynamics. Furthermore, the resulting spin excitations induce spin currents with exotic features under the polarized microwaves. The spin currents induced, for instance, by low-lying in-plane excitations are strongly enhanced under the left-handed circularly polarized microwaves, but quenched by the right-handed circularly polarized microwaves regardless of the sign of the Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interaction. These results may pave the way for understanding the non-trivial interplay between magnetic anisotropy and polarized microwaves in the generation of spin currents by a resonant process.</description>

      <title>Quantum metric-based optical selection rules</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.09260</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.09260v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The optical selection rules dictate symmetry-allowed/forbidden transitions, playing a decisive role in engineering exciton quantum states and designing optoelectronic devices. While both the real (quantum metric) and imaginary (Berry curvature) parts of quantum geometry contribute to optical transitions, the conventional theory of optical selection rules in solids incorporates only Berry curvature. Here, we propose quantum metric-based optical selection rules. We unveil a universal quantum metric-oscillator strength correspondence for linear polarization of light and establish valley-contrasted optical selection rules that lock orthogonal linear polarizations to distinct valleys. Tight-binding and first-principles calculations confirm our theory in two models (altermagnet and Kane-Mele) and monolayer $d$-wave altermagnet $\mathrm{V_2SeSO}$. This work provides a quantum metric paradigm for valley-based spintronic and optoelectronic applications.</description>

      <title>$WSe_2$ Monolayers Grown by Molecular Beam Epitaxy on hBN</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.09275</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.09275v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A three-step process was developed for growing high-quality, optically uniform WSe2 monolayers by molecular beam epitaxy (MBE) with advantage of using hexagonal boron nitride (hBN). The process was optimized to maximize the efficiency of photoluminescence and promote formation of hexagonal WSe2 domains. Atomic force microscopy (AFM) was employed to estimate the dispersion of WSe2 hexagonal domains orientation. Monolayer character of the film was identified using optical methods and verified with high-resolution transmission electron microscopy (TEM) cross-section. Temperature-and-magnetic-field-dependent studies revealed the behaviour of exciton complexes to be analogical to that of exfoliated counterparts. Direct growth on hBN combined with uniform optical response proves this WSe2 superior to mechanically exfoliated WSe2 in terms of convenience of use and reproducibility. Provided results establish a significant progress in optical quality of epitaxially grown transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDs) monolayers and fabrication of large-scale functional devices.</description>

      <title>First-principles design for strain-tunable exciton dynamics in 2D materials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.09363</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.09363v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Controlling exciton motion in two-dimensional semiconductors is key to unlocking new optoelectronic and straintronic functionalities. Monolayer transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDs), with their tightly bound excitons, offer an ideal platform for such control due to their strong sensitivity to local strain. Here we present an ab initio framework for modeling exciton dynamics in inhomogeneously strained WS2, combining excitonic band structures derived from first principles with a semiclassical transport model operating in both real and momentum space. By analyzing idealized strain patterns, we reveal how excitons undergo drift, diffusion, and confinement without invoking empirical parameters. Our results uncover regimes of super-ballistic propagation and negative effective diffusion, governed entirely by the strain landscape. This work provides microscopic insight into strain-tunable exciton behavior and establishes design principles for engineering exciton flow in two-dimensional materials.</description>

      <title>Nanoscale friction of manganite superlattice films controlled by layer thickness and fluorine content</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.09429</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.09429v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate nanoscale friction in [LaMnO3]m/[SrMnO3]n superlattice films using lateral force microscopy, focusing on the effects of fluorine doping and top-layer thickness. For all samples, friction forces scale linearly with the sum of the applied normal and adhesion forces. While friction forces vary spatially due to local adhesion fluctuations, the friction coefficient remains position independent for each specimen. It is, however, systematically influenced by fluorine concentration and top-layer thickness. Our data indicates that frictional energy dissipation extends up to 5 nm beneath the surface, demonstrating a clear dependence on subsurface structure. We attribute this to viscoelastic dissipation within the stress field and evanescent waves generated by the sliding tip, which can quantitatively account for the observed friction coefficients. These results show that, once adhesion is properly accounted for, the friction coefficient is a reproducible material property that can be tuned via controlled modifications to surface and subsurface layers.</description>

      <title>Correlating synthesis, structure and thermal stability of CuBi nanowires for spintronic applications by electron microscopy and in situ scattering methods</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.09553</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.09553v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Bi-doped copper (Cu1-xBix) nanowires (NWs), promising candidates for spintronic applications due to their potential for a giant spin Hall effect (SHE), were synthesized and their structural properties and thermal stability were investigated. Using template-assisted electrodeposition, Cu1-xBix nanowires with varying bismuth (Bi) content (x=0, 2, 4, and 7%) and different crystalline domain sizes were fabricated. Structural analysis by advanced electron microscopy and X-ray scattering techniques revealed the influence of synthesis conditions on the resulting NW crystal structure and microstructure, including Bi localization (within the lattice or in the grain boundaries), crystallite domain dimensions, and lattice distortions. While NWs with larger crystalline domains allow homogeneous Bi incorporation into the Cu lattice, NWs with smaller crystalline domains exhibit noticeable Bi accumulation at grain boundaries. The thermal stability of the NWs was examined using variable temperature X-ray diffraction and total scattering. Upon heating, lattice distortions consistent with Bi diffusion out of the Cu lattice were observed, with subsequent crystallization of rhombohedral metallic Bi upon cooling. These findings establish a foundation for optimizing the SHE performance of Cu1-xBix nanowires for spintronic devices by correlating synthesis parameters with microstructural features and thermal behavior.</description>

      <title>How to Fix Silver for Plasmonics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.09569</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.09569v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Silver (Ag) is considered an ideal material for plasmonic applications in the visible wavelength regime due to its superior optical properties, but its use is limited by the poor chemical stability and structural quality of thermally evaporated thin films and resulting nanostructures. In this study, we present a simple approach to enhance the structural and optical quality as well as the chemical stability of Ag thin films by alloying with gold (Au) through thermal co-evaporation. We investigate Ag$_{100-x}$Au$_x$ thin films with Au contents ranging from 5 to 20 at% analyzing their surface morphology, crystallite structure, optical properties, and chemical stability. Our results show that low Au concentrations significantly reduce the roughness of co-evaporated thin films (down to 0.4 nm RMS), and significantly enhance the resistance to oxidation, while maintaining a defined crystallite growth. Importantly, these improvements are achieved without the need for template stripping, metallic wetting layers, or epitaxial substrates, enabling direct deposition on glass. Among the compositions studied, Ag$_{95}$Au$_5$ thin films exhibit the highest chemical stability, lowest optical losses in the visible spectral range, and excellent plasmonic properties even outcompeting pure Ag. As a proof-of-concept, we fabricate high-quality Ag$_{95}$Au$_5$ optical antennas that exhibit long-term durability under ambient conditions. Our approach provides a practical solution to overcome the limitations of Ag for plasmonic device applications.</description>

      <title>On-the-fly machine learning-augmented constrained AIMD to design new routes from glassy carbon to quenchable amorphous diamond with low pressure and temperature</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.09639</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.09639v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent advances in machine learning have enabled large-scale atomic simulations with first-principles accuracy, allowing precise modeling of disordered materials such as glassy carbon (GC). However, conventional ab initio molecular dynamics (AIMD) cannot effectively capture anisotropic stress effects, which are believed to play a key role in the transformation of GC into amorphous diamond under extreme conditions. In this work, we present an on-the-fly machine learning-augmented constrained AIMD (ML-augmented CAIMD) approach by modifying VASP 6.3.2. Our simulations not only reproduce major experimental features of GC but also provide restrictive synthesis conditions and microscopic insights. We show that GC exhibits unexpectedly high plasticity, with its compressive and shear strengths enhanced by large strains. Under pressure, increasing annealing temperature promotes the formation of quenchable amorphous diamond via enhanced sp3 preservation, but this trend reverses above 2900 K due to thermal graphitization. Under non-hydrostatic compression, GC transforms into a superhard structure sustaining large stress differences, which sharply increase when confining pressure exceeds 40 GPa. Finally, severe rotational shear at 30 GPa induces sp3 fractions up to 80 percent at 300 to 1000 K. A hardened amorphous carbon retaining 64 percent sp3 content is achieved by decompression at 300 K, marking the lowest pressure-temperature route ever predicted. Our ML-augmented CAIMD provides a general framework for modeling structural transformations in disordered materials under anisotropic stresses.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2507.09669v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Carbon nitride research has reached a promising point in today's research endeavours with diverse applications including photocatalysis, energy storage, and sensing due to their unique electronic and structural properties. Recent advances in machine learning (ML) have opened new avenues for exploring and optimizing the potential of these materials. This study presents a comprehensive review of the integration of ML techniques in carbon nitride research with an introduction to CN classifications and recent advancements. We discuss the methodologies employed, such as supervised learning, unsupervised learning, and reinforcement learning, in predicting material properties, optimizing synthesis conditions, and enhancing performance metrics. Key findings indicate that ML algorithms can significantly reduce experimental trial-and-error, accelerate discovery processes, and provide deeper insights into the structure-property relationships of carbon nitride.

      <title>Bulk Ferroelectric Heterostructures for High Temperature Lead-Free Piezoelectrics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.09673</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.09673v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Remarkable exploitation of valence and lattice mismatch in epitaxial ferroelectric heterostructures generates physical effects not classically expected for perovskite oxides, such as 2D electron gas and polar skyrmions. However the widespread application of these interfacial properties and functionalities is impeded by the ultrathin layered structure and essential presence of underlying lattice-matched substrates for the deposition of epitaxial thin films. Here, we report a bottom-up pathway to synthesize bulk ferroelectric heterostructures (BFH) with periodic composition fluctuation (8 nm in wavelength) using elemental partitioning by cation diffusion, providing opportunities to exploit novel characteristics of hetero-epitaxial oxide thin films in bulk materials. Exemplar monolithic BiFeO3-BaTiO3 BFH ceramics described herein share common features with their thin film heterostructure counterparts, which facilitates control and stabilisation of ferroelectric polarisation along with a significant enhancement in Curie temperature, Tc, and functionality. BFH ceramics exhibit a record Tc (up to 824 {\deg}C) and a piezoelectric coefficient (d33 = 115 pC N-1 ), in comparison with other perovskite or non-perovskite solid solutions, providing sustainable solutions for emergent high temperature piezoelectric sensing, actuation and energy conversion applications. By creating BFH ceramics using different electromechanical boundary conditions, distinct morphologies of aliovalent A-site cation segregated regions along with different types of ferroelectric order are achieved. This formation mechanism provides unprecedented control over local ferroelectric ordering and domain stabilisation in BFH ceramics; it also paves the way to explore new types of functionality, beyond those achievable in both bulk ferroelectrics and thin film heterostructures.</description>

      <title>Field-effect transistors based on charged domain walls in van der Waals ferroelectric {\alpha}-In$_2$Se$_3$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.09838</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.09838v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Charged domain walls (CDW) in ferroelectrics are emerging as functional interfaces with potential applications in nonvolatile memory, logic, and neuromorphic computing. However, CDWs in conventional ferroelectrics are vertical, buried, or electrically inaccessible interfaces that prevent their use in functional devices. Here, we overcome these challenges by stacking two opposite polar domains of van der Waals ferroelectric $\alpha$-In$_2$Se$_3$ to generate artificial head-head (H-H) CDWs and use edge contact to fabricate charged domain wall-based field-effect transistors (CDW-FET). We relate the atomic structure to the temperature-dependent electrical and magneto-transport of the CDW-FET. CDW-FETs exhibit a metal-to-insulator transition with decreasing temperature and enhanced conductance and field-effect mobility compared to single domain $\alpha$-In$_2$Se$_3$. We identify two regimes of transport: variable range hopping due to disorder in the band edge below 70 K and thermally activated interfacial trap-assisted transport above 70 K. The CDW-FETs show room-temperature resistance down to 3.1 k$\Omega$ which is 2-9 orders of magnitude smaller than the single CDW in thin-film ferroelectrics. These results resolve longstanding challenges with high CDW resistance and their device integration, opening opportunities for gigahertz memory and neuromorphic computing.</description>

      <title>An analytical model for the remote epitaxial potential</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.09913</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.09913v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose an analytical model for the remote bonding potential of the substrate that permeates through graphene during remote epitaxy. Our model, based on a Morse interatomic potential, includes the attenuation due to (1) the increased separation between film and substrate and (2) free carrier screening from graphene. Compared with previous slab density functional theory calculations, which use the electrostatic potential as a proxy for bonding, our analytical model provides a more direct description of bonding, explicitly includes screening (which is often ignored), and is based on simple, interpretable, and well benchmarked parameters. We show that the magnitude of $|\phi_{remote}|$ for typical semiconductor and oxide substrates is few meV, similar to the van der Waals potential of graphene. This suggests interference between the graphene and remote substrate potentials, plus interfacial reconstructions, must be considered when interpreting experiments on remote epitaxy. We use our model to interpret previous experiments from the remote epitaxy and related literature, highlighting connections to moire epitaxy and to the ordering of graphite intercalation compounds. Our model also points to tests, based on tunable screening and spatial extent of the substrate potential, that may increase the strength of the remote potential towards the more idealized picture.</description>

      <title>First-Principles Theory of Five- and Six-Phonon Scatterings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.09918</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.09918v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Higher-order phonon scatterings beyond fourth order remain largely unexplored despite their potential importance in strongly anharmonic materials at elevated temperatures. We develop a theoretical formalism for first-principles calculation of five- and six-phonon scatterings using Green's function techniques based on a diagrammatic formalism, and systematically investigate multi-phonon interactions in Si, MgO, and BaO from room temperature to near melting points. Our calculation reveals dramatically different material-dependent behaviors: while five- and six-phonon processes remain negligible in Si, they become increasingly important in MgO and dominant in BaO near its melting point, where they surpass three- and four-phonon scattering intensity and significantly reduce lattice thermal conductivity. We demonstrate that the strength of higher-order interactions is primarily governed by interatomic force constants, with BaO exhibiting five- and six-phonon scattering rates over one order of magnitude stronger than MgO despite identical crystal structures, due to large scattering phase space arising from softened harmonic interactions. Our work establishes the theoretical foundation for understanding lattice dynamics and thermal transport in strongly anharmonic materials and at elevated temperatures.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2507.10036v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: An optical phonon at 2.5 meV is observed in a thin film of the chiral metal halide (R-MBA)$_2$PbI$_4$, but is absent in the racemic counterpart, as revealed by femtosecond transient absorption spectroscopy. This experimental result indicates the chiral origin of the 2.5 meV mode and supports recent theoretical predictions of chirality transfer from the organic to the inorganic layers, with implications for the spin polarization properties of hybrid metal halides and perovskites.</description>

      <title>Quantum-Annealing Enhanced Machine Learning for Interpretable Phase Classification of High-Entropy Alloys</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.10237</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.10237v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: High entropy alloys (HEAs) offer unprecedented compositional flexibility for designing advanced materials, yet predicting their crystallographic phases remains a key bottleneck due to limited data and complex phase formation behavior. Here, we present a quantum-enhanced machine learning framework that leverages quantum annealing to enhance phase classification in HEAs. Our pipeline integrates Quantum Boosting (QBoost) for interpretable feature selection and classification, with Quantum Support Vector Machines (QSVM) that use quantum-enhanced kernels to capture nonlinear relationships between physical descriptors. By reformulating both models as Quadratic Unconstrained Binary Optimization (QUBO) problems, we exploit the efficient sampling capabilities of quantum annealers to achieve rapid training and robust generalization, demonstrating notable runtime reductions relative to classical baselines in our setup. We target six key phases: FCC, BCC, Sigma, Laves, Heusler, and AlXY B2, and benchmark model performance using both cross-validation and a rigorously curated test set of prior experimentally synthesized HEAs. The results confirm strong alignment between predicted and measured phases. Our findings demonstrate that quantum-enhanced classifiers match or exceed classical models in accuracy and offer insights grounded in interpretable physical descriptors. This work constitutes an important step toward practical quantum acceleration in materials discovery pipelines.</description>

      <title>Rigid-Body Anisotropy in Noncollinear Antiferromagnets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.10238</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.10238v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Characterizing the anisotropic structure in noncollinear antiferromagnets is essential for antiferromagnetic spintronics. In this work, we provide a microscopic theory linking the anisotropy effects induced by the rigid-body rotation of spin order to spin-orbit coupling. Our method goes beyond the conventional magnetic group theory, offering a concise yet powerful tool to characterize diverse anisotropy effects in complex magnetic systems. Using the group representation theory of the spin group, we obtain a set of basis functions formed from tensor elements of spin-orbit vector--which originates from spin-orbit coupling and is tied to the rigid-body rotation of the spin order--to systematically describe the structure of anisotropy effects. As a concrete example, we apply our framework to coplanar antiferromagnets Mn$_3$Sn and Mn$_3$Ir, demonstrating that the corresponding basis functions can well capture both the geometric and magnitude dependencies of the magnetic anisotropy energy and anomalous Hall conductivity. Finally, we discuss the generalization of our framework to broader classes of anisotropy phenomena in magnetic systems.</description>

      <title>Practical Crystallography with a Transmission Electron Microscope</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.10247</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.10247v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Three-dimensional electron diffraction (3DED) is a powerful technique providing for crystal structure solutions of sub-micron sized crystals too small for structure determination via X-ray techniques. The entry requirement, however, of a transmission electron microscope (TEM) adapted with bespoke software for coordinated sample stage rotation and continuous electron diffraction data acquisition has generally inhibited the wider uptake of 3DED. To address this limitation, we present novel software GiveMeED appropriate for controlled 3DED data acquisition. The collection of useable reflections beyond 0.8 {\AA} makes 3DED crystallographic processing effectively routine, using standard software and workflows derived from single-crystal X-ray diffraction (SCXRD) techniques. A full experimental workflow for 3DED on a conventional TEM is described in practical terms, in combination with direct imaging, and energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDS) and electron energy loss spectroscopy (EELS), for the return of comprehensive correlative descriptions of crystal morphologies and sample compositions, with due regard for the quantification of electron flux at each stage of the characterisation process. The accuracy and effectiveness of GiveMeED is demonstrated through structure solutions for case study paracetamol, copper(II) phthalocyanine, and percholorocoronene samples, characterised in their near-native states under controlled low dose conditions at either room or cryogenic temperatures, with determined unit cell parameters and atomic connectivity matching accepted literature X-ray structures for these compounds. To promote the wider adoption of 3DED, we make GiveMeED freely available for use and modification, in support of greater uptake and utilisation of structure solution procedures via electron diffraction.</description>

      <title>Dislocation-enhanced piezoelectric catalysis of KNbO3 crystal for water splitting</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.10277</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.10277v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Dislocations in oxides with ionic/covalent bonding hold the potential of harnessing versatile functionalities. Here, high-density dislocations in a large plastic zone in potassium niobate (KNbO3) crystals are mechanically introduced by room-temperature cyclic scratching to enhance piezocatalytic hydrogen production. Unlike conventional energy-intensive, time-consuming deformation at high temperature, this approach merits efficient dislocation engineering. These dislocations induce local strain and modify the electronic environment, thereby improving surface reactivity and charge separation, which are critical for piezocatalysis. This proof-of-concept offers a practical and sustainable alternative for functionalizing piezoelectric ceramics. Our findings demonstrate that surface-engineered dislocations can effectively improve the piezocatalysis, paving the way for efficient and scalable piezocatalytic applications.</description>

      <title>High Resolution Temperature-Resolved Spectroscopy of the Nitrogen Vacancy $^{1}E$ Singlet State Ionization Energy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.10291</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.10291v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The negatively charged diamond nitrogen-vacancy ($\mathrm{{NV}^-}$) center plays a central role in many cutting edge quantum sensing applications; despite this, much is still unknown about the energy levels in this system. The ionization energy of the $\mathrm{^{1}E}$ singlet state in the $\mathrm{{NV}^-}$ has only recently been measured at between 2.25 eV and 2.33 eV. In this work, we further refine this energy by measuring the $\mathrm{^{1}E}$ energy as a function of laser wavelength and diamond temperature via magnetically mediated spin-selective photoluminescence (PL) quenching; this PL quenching indicating at what wavelength ionization induces population transfer from the $\mathrm{^{1}E}$ into the neutral $\mathrm{{NV}^0}$ charge configuration. Measurements are performed for excitation wavelengths between 450 nm and 470 nm and between 540 nm and 566 nm in increments of 2 nm, and for temperatures ranging from about 50 K to 150 K in 5 K increments. We determine the $\mathrm{^{1}E}$ ionization energy to be between 2.29 and 2.33 eV, which provides about a two-fold reduction in uncertainty of this quantity. Distribution level: A.

      <title>High-throughput prediction of thermodynamically stable 1D magnetic transition-metal chalcogenides and halides</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.10370</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.10370v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The search for novel one-dimensional (1D) materials with exotic physical properties is crucial for advancing nanoelectronics and spintronics. Here, we perform a comprehensive high-throughput, first-principles study to explore the vast landscape of 1D transition-metal chalcogenides and halides. Starting with 6,832 candidate structures derived from 28 metals and 8 non-metals, we systematically evaluated their thermodynamic stability by comparing the formation energies of 1D chains against competing 2D phases, mimicking thermodynamic selectivity during nucleation. This screening identified 210 stable 1D magnetic chains. Furthermore, representation learning models revealed that chemical stoichiometry and the electron affinity of the non-metal element are key factors governing 1D stability. The stable materials exhibit a rich spectrum of properties, including diverse magnetic orders (FM, AFM) and Luttinger compensated antiferromagnetism in MnTe. We discovered 20 ferroelastic chains, with FeTe showing a giant magnetostriction of -5.57%. Other emergent phenomena include Charge Density Wave (CDW) chains in FeTe and NiSe. Finally, our findings propose concrete platforms for quantum applications, such as the predicted realization of Majorana zero modes in a ferromagnetic CrCl2 chain on a superconducting NbSe2 substrate.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2507.10428v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We employ several X-ray based techniques, including X-ray diffraction, absorption and resonant inelastic scattering, to disentangle the contributions of individual chemical species to the structural, electronic and magnetic properties of high-entropy oxides. In the benchmark compound Mg0.2Co0.2Ni0.2Cu0.2Zn0.2O and related systems, we unambiguously resolve a sizable Jahn-Teller distortion at the Cu sites, more pronounced in the absence of Ni2+ and Mg2+, suggesting that these ions promote positional order, whereas Cu2+ ions act to destabilize it. Moreover, we detect magnetic excitations and estimate the strength of the interactions between pairs of different magnetic elements. Our results provide valuable insights into the role of the various chemical species in shaping the physical properties of high-entropy oxides.</description>

      <title>Graphene Design with Parallel Cracks: Abnormal Crack Coalescence and Its Impact on Mechanical Properties</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.10433</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.10433v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Graphene is a material with potential applications in electric, thermal, and mechanical fields, and has seen significant advancements in growth methods that facilitate large-scale production. However, defects during growth and transfer to other substrates can compromise the integrity and strength of graphene. Surprisingly, the literature suggests that, in certain cases, defects can enhance or, at most, not affect the mechanical performance of graphene. Further research is necessary to explore how defects interact within graphene structure and affect its properties, especially in large-area samples. In this study, we investigate the interaction between two preexisting cracks and their effect on the mechanical properties of graphene using molecular dynamics simulations. The behavior of zigzag and armchair graphene structures with cracks separated by distances ($W_\text{gap}$) is analyzed under tensile loading. The findings reveal that crack coalescence, defined as the formation of a new crack from two existing crack tips, occurs for lower values of the distance between cracks, $W_\text{gap}$, resulting in a decline in the strength of structures. As $W_\text{gap}$ increases, the stress-strain curves shift upward, with the peak stress rising in the absence of crack coalescence. The effective stress intensity factor formulated in this study exhibits a clear upward trend with increasing $W_\text{gap}$. Furthermore, an increase in $W_\text{gap}$ induces a transition in fracture behavior from crack coalescence to independent propagation with intercrack undulation. This shift in fracture behavior demonstrates a brittle-to-ductile transition, as evidenced by increased energy absorption and delayed failure. A design guideline for the initial crack geometry is suggested by correlating peak stress with the $W_\text{gap}$, within a certain range.</description>

Abstract: The reduction of ferromanganese ores into metallic feedstock is an energy-intensive process with substantial carbon emissions, necessitating sustainable alternatives. Hydrogen-based pre-reduction of manganese-rich ores offers a low-emission pathway to augment subsequent thermic Fe-Mn alloy production. However, reduction dynamics and microstructure evolution under varying thermal conditions remain poorly understood. This study investigates the influence of heating rate on the hydrogen-based direct reduction of natural Nchwaning ferromanganese ore and a synthetic analog. Non-isothermal thermogravimetric analysis revealed a complex multistep reduction process with overlapping kinetic regimes. Isoconversional kinetic analysis showed increased activation energy with reduction degree, indicating a transition from surface-reaction to diffusion-controlled reduction mechanisms. Interrupted X-ray diffraction experiments suggested that slow heating enables complete conversion to MnO and metallic Fe, while rapid heating promotes Fe- and Mn-oxides intermixing. Thermodynamic calculations for the Fe-Mn-O system predicted the equilibrium phase evolution, indicating Mn stabilized Fe-containing spinel and halite phases. Microstructural analysis revealed that slow heating rate yields fine and dispersed Fe particles in a porous MnO matrix, while fast heating leads to sporadic Fe-rich agglomerates. These findings suggest heating rate as a critical parameter governing reduction pathway, phase distribution, and microstructure evolution, thus offering key insights for optimizing hydrogen-based pre-reduction strategies towards more efficient and sustainable ferromanganese production.</description>

      <title>Density Functional Theory Study of Th-doped LiCAF and LiSAF for Nuclear Clock Applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.10526</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.10526v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Thorium-doped LiCaAlF$_6$ and LiSrAlF$_6$ (Th:LiCAF and Th:LiSAF) are promising crystals for a solid-state nuclear clock based on the 8 eV transition in $^{229}$Th; however, their complex crystal structures complicate understanding the atomic arrangement of the thorium defects. In this work, density functional theory simulations are employed to systematically investigate these systems, including temperature-dependent effects and environmental conditions of fluorine saturation and deficiency. We investigated 20 distinct charge compensation schemes for each material, revealing lower defect formation energies in Th:LiSAF than in Th:LiCAF. This suggests that the former may attain a higher concentration of thorium nuclei. Furthermore, we calculated the electric field gradient for the lowest energy structure per compensation pathway. Our investigation shows that results previously reported in the literature apply only to a subset of experimental conditions.</description>

      <title>Anisotropic magnetism of polymorphic ErAl3</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.08984</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.08984v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: ErAl$_3$ can form in either a trigonal ($\alpha$) or cubic ($\beta$) polymorph and this paper investigates the physical properties of these polymorphs through characterizations of single crystals grown in an aluminum flux. We demonstrate that polymorph selection can be achieved based on the nominal composition of the crystal growth. Magnetic measurements confirm that both $\beta$-ErAl$_3$ and $\alpha$-ErAl$_3$ order antiferromagnetically at low temperatures. $\beta$-ErAl$_3$ undergoes AFM ordering at a N\'eel temperature T$_N$ = 5.1 K, and the transition is suppressed continually with applied field. $\alpha$-ErAl$_3$ displays more complex behavior, with successive magnetic transitions at T$_N$ = 5.7 K and T$_2$ = 4.6 K for zero field, where heat capacity and dilatometry measurements evidence that these transitions are second- and first-order, respectively. Under magnetic field, strong anisotropy is revealed in $\alpha$-ErAl$_3$, with several step-like metamagnetic transitions observed below T$_2$ for H$\parallel$c. These transitions produce sequential magnetization plateaus near one-half of the apparent saturation magnetization. The electrical resistivity of $\alpha$-ErAl$_3$ is strongly coupled to its magnetism. At $T$ = 2 K, we observe a positive magnetoresistance reaching 60\%, with distinct anomalies at the metamagnetic transitions. The results are summarized in $H$- $T$ phase diagrams that demonstrate complex magnetic behavior for $\alpha$-ErAl$_3$, suggesting an important role of competing interactions in this metallic system that possesses characteristics of Ising physics.</description>

Abstract: Programmable assembly of nanoparticles into structures other than hexagonal lattices remains challenging. Assembling an open checkerboard or square lattice is harder to achieve compared to a close-packed hexagonal structure. Here, we introduce a unified, robust approach to assemble nanoparticles into a diverse family of two-dimensional superlattices at the liquid-air interface. Gold nanoparticles are grafted with pH-responsive, water-soluble poly(ethylene glycol) chains terminating in -COOH or -NH2 end groups, enabling control over interparticle interactions, while the grafted polymer's molecular weight dictates its conformation. This combined control crystallizes checkerboard, simple-square, and body-centered honeycomb superlattices. We find that even for identical nanoparticle core sizes, the polymer's molecular weight dictates superlattice symmetry and stability. Furthermore, tuning pH induces structural transitions between different lattice types. This method opens new avenues for the programmable fabrication of colloidal superstructures with tailored architectures.</description>

      <title>On failure mechanisms and load-parallel cracking in confined elastomeric layers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.09042</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.09042v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Thin layers of elastomers bonded to two rigid plates demonstrate unusual failure response. Historically, it has been believed that strongly-bonded layers fail by two distinct mechanisms: (i) internal/external penny-shaped crack nucleation and propagation, and (ii) cavitation, that is, cavity growth leading to fibrillation and then failure. However, recent work has demonstrated that cavitation itself is predominantly a fracture process. While the equations describing cavitation from a macroscopic or top-down view are now known and validated with experiments, several aspects of the cavitation crack growth need to be better understood. Notably, cavitation often involves through-thickness crack growth parallel to the loading direction, raising questions about when it initiates instead of the more typical penny-shaped cracks perpendicular to the load. Understanding and controlling the two vertical and horizontal crack growth is key to developing tougher soft films and adhesives. The purpose of this Letter is to provide an explanation for the load-parallel crack growth through a comprehensive numerical analysis and highlight the role of various material and geometrical parameters.</description>

      <title>A General, Automated Method for Building Structural Tensors of Arbitrary Order for Anisotropic Function Representations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.09088</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.09088v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a general, constructive procedure to find the basis for tensors of arbitrary order subject to linear constraints by transforming the problem to that of finding the nullspace of a linear operator. The proposed method utilizes standard numerical linear algebra techniques that are highly optimized and well-behaved. Our primary applications are in mechanics where modulus tensors and so-called structure tensors can be used to characterize anisotropy of functional dependencies on other inputs such as strain. Like modulus tensors, structure tensors are defined by their invariance to transformations by symmetry group generators but have more general applicability. The fully automated method is an alternative to classical, more intuition-reliant methods such as the Pipkin-Rivlin polynomial integrity basis construction. We demonstrate the utility of the procedure by: (a) enumerating elastic modulus tensors for common symmetries, and (b) finding the lowest-order structure tensors that can represent all common point groups/crystal classes. Furthermore, we employ these results in two calibration problems using neural network models following classical function representation theory: (a) learning the symmetry class and orientation of a hyperelastic material given stress-strain data, and (b) representing strain-dependent anisotropy of the stress response of a soft matrix-stiff fiber composite in a sequence of uniaxial loadings. These two examples demonstrate the utility of the method in model selection and calibration by: (a) determining structural tensors of a selected order across multiple symmetry groups, and (b) determining a basis for a given group that allows the characterization of all subgroups. Using a common order in both cases allows sparse regression to operate on a common function representation to select the best-fit symmetry group for the data.</description>

      <title>Evidence for magnetoelastic coupling and chiral magnetic ground state in quasi-van der Waals tr-Cr$_{1.22}$Te$_{2}$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.09147</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.09147v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Trigonal tr-Cr$_{1+\delta}$Te$_{2}$ is a well-known ferromagnetic material that has recently drawn much attention due to the discovery of zero-field skyrmion state, unusual anomalous Hall effect, topological Hall effect, and topological Nernst effect. This quasi-van der Waals (vdW) layered material with intercalated Cr atoms possesses many peculiar features that depend on the amount of Cr intercalation, although the microscopic magnetic ground state is still elusive. We reveal the structural and magnetic properties of tr-Cr$_{1.22}$Te$_{2}$ by low-temperature x-ray diffraction, magnetization, temperature-dependent Raman spectroscopy, and single-crystal neutron diffraction studies. Magnetization measurements under small applied magnetic field indicate two successive magnetic transitions, one from a ferromagnetic (FM) state to an antiferromagnetic (AFM) state (T$_\mathrm{C}=197$ K), and second from AFM to a paramagnetic state (T$_\mathrm{N}=211$ K). The FM transition is sharp with a strong presence of magnetoelastic coupling, but is not accompanied by any structural phase transition. The magnetic structure obtained from zero-field single crystal neutron diffraction reveals that the Cr1 and Cr2 moments are ferromagnetically aligned along the c-axis, while the Cr3 and intercalated Cr4 atoms induce an AFM component in the ab-plane leading to an umbrella-like spin structure which possesses a finite spin chirality. The presence of a finite spin chirality is responsible for the observation of the topological Hall effect (THE).</description>

      <title>Dual-circular Raman optical activity of axial multipolar order</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.09237v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Multipolar order, such as octupolar order, is one of the key concepts of condensed matter physics, particularly in light of elusive hidden orders. However, its experimental identification remains challenging due to the absence of direct coupling to conventional external stimuli. In this study, we propose that dual-circular Raman scattering serves as a detection of multipolar anisotropies. By combining symmetry analysis with microscopic tight-binding calculations, we demonstrate that both time-reversal-even ($\theta$-even) and time-reversal-odd ($\theta$-odd) axial multipolar phases exhibit the Raman optical activity as a direct consequence of mirror symmetry breaking. Furthermore, we find that the Stokes and anti-Stokes spectra encode the time-reversal parity of the multipolar order, providing an all-optical means to distinguish multipolar phases. Our findings open a pathway for identifying multipolar orders in various materials through dual-circular Raman spectroscopy as a sensitive and versatile probe.</description>

      <title>Microscopic origin of shear bands in 2D amorphous solids from topological defects</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.09250</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.09250v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The formation of shear bands in amorphous solids such as glasses has remained an open question in our understanding of condensed matter and amorphous materials. Unlike in crystals, well-defined topological defects such as dislocations have been elusive due to the lack of a periodic ordered background at the atomic level. Recently, topological defects have been identified in the displacement field and in the eigenvectors of amorphous solids. Recent work has suggested that shear bands in amorphous solids coincide with an alignment of vortex-antivortex dipoles, with alternating topological charge +1/-1. Here we numerically confirm this hypothesis by means of well-controlled simulations in 2D. Surprisingly, we show that a chain of topological defects (TDs) pre-exists the shear band and is visible already in the non-affine displacement field of the elastic regime. This chain is activated into a flow band concomitantly with the disappearance and possibly annihilation of a dipole at a distance from the TDs chain. The possible underlying mechanism is reminiscent of a soliton-like rarefaction pulse remotely activated by dipole annihilation as observed in superfluid Bose-Einstein condensates.</description>

      <title>Bounds on the Uniaxial Effective Complex Permittivity of Two-phase Composites and Optimal or Near Optimal Microstructures</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.09398v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Electromagnetic materials with a uniaxial effective permittivity tensor, characterized by its transverse ($\epsilon_\perp$) and axial ($\epsilon_\parallel$) components, play a central role in the design of advanced photonic and electromagnetic materials including hyperbolic metamaterials, and biological imaging platforms. Tight bounds on the complex effective permittivity of such metamaterials are critical for predicting and optimizing their macroscopic electromagnetic response. While rigorous tight bounds exist for isotropic two-phase composites, corresponding results for uniaxial composites remain relatively unexplored. In this work, we systematically investigate the attainable range of $\epsilon_\perp$ and $\epsilon_\parallel$ in the quasistatic regime for two-phase metamaterials with isotropic homogeneous phases. By analyzing known microgeometries and constructing hierarchical laminates (HLs), we demonstrate that the classical bounds on $\epsilon_\perp$ are not optimal. We conjecture improved bounds based on numerically fitted circular arcs derived from convex hulls of $\epsilon_\perp$ values obtained from HLs, and we identify optimal rank-4 HL structures that achieve all points on the conjectured bounds. Additionally, we quantify the correlation between $\epsilon_\perp$ and $\epsilon_\parallel$ for fixed volume fractions, and propose a design algorithm to construct HL microstructures achieving prescribed values of $\epsilon_\perp$. Leveraging the Cherkaev-Gibiansky transformation and the translation method, we extend recent techniques developed for isotropic composites by Kern-Miller-Milton to derive translation bounds on the uniaxial complex effective permittivity tensor. Finally, bounds on the sensitivity of the effective permittivity tensor of low-loss composites are obtained and their optimality is shown in two-dimensions.</description>

      <title>Deciphering the Scattering of Polydisperse Hard Spheres using Deep Learning</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.09400v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce a deep learning approach for analyzing the scattering function of the polydisperse hard spheres system. We use a variational autoencoder-based neural network to learn the bidirectional mapping between the scattering function and the system parameters including the volume fraction and polydispersity. Such that the trained model serves both as a generator that produce scattering function from the system parameters, and an inferrer that extract system parameters from the scattering function. We first generate a scattering dataset by carrying out molecular dynamics simulation of the polydisperse hard spheres modeled by the truncated-shifted Lennard-Jones model, then analyze the scattering function dataset using singular value decomposition to confirm the feasibility of dimensional compression. Then we split the dataset into training and testing set and train our neural network on the training set only. Our generator model produce scattering function with significant higher accuracy comparing to the traditional Percus-Yevick approximation and $\beta$ correction, and the inferrer model can extract the volume fraction and polydispersity with much higher accuracy than traditional model functions.</description>

      <title>Electronic and magnetic ground states of {112} grain boundary in graphene in the extended Hubbard model</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.09502v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the ground state phase diagram of the extended Hubbard model in a half-filled 5/7 skewed ladder, which is topologically equivalent to a \{112\} grain boundary in graphene and related systems. Using the mean-field method, we identify various electronic and magnetic phases in the U-V plane, by calculating the site charge and spin densities. The electronic phases include partially charge-ordered metal or insulator, and fully charge-ordered insulator. The different magnetic phases of the model are non-magnet, spin density wave, spin split compensated ferrimagnet or partial antiferromagnet. Analysis of the electronic band structure reveals that the partially charge-ordered compensated ferrimagnetic phase exhibits spin polarisation, which can be quite interesting for spintronics applications. We also compute the polarisation as a function of $U$ using the Berry phase formalism and show that the system exhibits multiferroicity with coexisting compensated ferrimagnetic spin order alongside electronic polarisations.</description>

Abstract: The analytical model of a glass-forming system is formulated within the formalism analogous to gauge theory constructions in quantum field theory. This work explores the scope of the proposed approach and investigates the equilibrium behavior of the model under the mean-field approximation. The analysis reveals three possible equilibrium scenarios, only one of which exhibits strong glass-forming ability. Additionally, an upper limit for the initial temperature is identified, beyond which quenching into the glassy state becomes impossible.</description>

      <title>Tunable Nanophotonic Devices and Cavities based on a Two-Dimensional Magnet</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.09720v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Central to the field of nanophotonics is the ability to engineer the flow of light through nanoscale structures. These structures often have permanent working spectral ranges and optical properties that are fixed during fabrication. Quantum materials, with their correlated and intertwined degrees of freedom, offer a promising avenue for dynamically controlling photonic devices without altering their physical structure. Here, we fabricate photonic crystal slabs from CrSBr, a van der Waals antiferromagnetic semiconductor, and demonstrate unprecedented in situ control over their optical properties. Leveraging the combination of the exceptionally large refractive index of CrSBr near its excitonic resonances and its tunability via external fields, we achieve precise manipulation of photonic modes at near-visible and infrared wavelengths, showcasing a new paradigm for nanophotonic device design. The resulting guided resonances of the photonic crystal are tightly packed in the spectrum with very small mode volumes, are highly tunable via external magnetic fields, and exhibit high Q-factors exceeding 500. These resonances self-hybridize with the excitonic degrees of freedom, resulting in intrinsic strong light-matter coupling. Our findings underscore the potential of quantum materials for developing in situ tunable photonic elements and cavities.</description>

      <title>Distinct Uniaxial Stress and Pressure Fingerprint of Superconductivity in the 3D Kagome Lattice Compound CeRu2</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.09779</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.09779v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The exploration of tunable superconductivity in strongly correlated electron systems is a central pursuit in condensed matter physics, with implications for both fundamental understanding and potential applications. The Laves phase CeRu$_{2}$, a pyrochlore compound, exhibits a three-dimensional (3D) Kagome lattice type geometry giving rise to flat bands and degenerate Dirac points, where band structure features intertwine with strong multi-orbital interaction effects deriving from its correlated electronic structure. Here, we combine muon spin rotation ($\mu$SR), uniaxial in-plane stress, and hydrostatic pressure to probe the superconducting state of CeRu$_{2}$. Uniaxial stress up to 0.22 GPa induces a dome-shaped evolution of the critical temperature $T_{\rm c}$, with an initial plateau, successively followed by enhancement and suppression without any structural phase transition. Stress is further found to drive a crossover from anisotropic to isotropic $s$-wave pairing. In contrast, hydrostatic pressure up to 2.2 GPa leaves $T_{\rm c}$ largely unchanged but alters the superfluid density from exponential to linear behavior at low temperatures, indicative of nodal superconductivity under hydrostatic pressure. Taken together, these results indicate that CeRu$_{2}$ occupies an ideal position in parameter space, enabling highly responsive and multifold tunability of superconductivity in this three-dimensional correlated electronic system. This warrants further quantitative analysis of the interplay between lattice geometry, electronic correlations, and pairing symmetry.</description>

      <title>Learning a potential formulation for rate-and-state friction</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.09796v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Empirical rate-and-state friction laws are widely used in geophysics and engineering to simulate interface slip. They postulate that the friction coefficient depends on the local slip rate and a state variable that reflects the history of slip. Depending on the parameters, rate-and-state friction can be either rate-strengthening, leading to steady slip, or rate-weakening, leading to unsteady stick-slip behavior modeling earthquakes. Rate-and-state friction does not have a potential or variational formulation, making implicit solution approaches difficult and implementation numerically expensive. In this work, we propose a potential formulation for the rate-and-state friction. We formulate the potentials as neural networks and train them so that the resulting behavior emulates the empirical rate-and-state friction. We show that this potential formulation enables implicit time discretization leading to efficient numerical implementation.</description>

      <title>DLPNO-MP2 with Periodic Boundary Conditions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.09810v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present domain-based local pair natural orbital M{\o}ller--Plesset second order perturbation theory (DLPNO-MP2) with Born--von K{\'a}rm{\'a}n boundary (BvK) conditions. The approach is based on well-localised Wannier functions in a LCAO formalism and extends the molecular DLPNO-MP2 implementation Tubromole program package to periodic systems. The PNOs are formed through a PAO-OSV-PNO cascade, using BvK projected atomic orbitals and orbital specific virtuals as intermediaries in an analogous manner to the molecular scheme. Our chargeless and surface-dipole corrected local density fitting approach is shown to be numerically stable and to ensure convergent lattice summations over the periodic images for the two- and three-index Coulomb integrals. Through careful benchmarking, we show that the DLPNO approximations in the BvK-DLPNO-MP2 methods are entirely consistent with those of molecular DLPNO-MP2 calculations, and with an alternative periodic approach Megacell-DLPNO-MP2, reported in Paper II of this series. Smooth convergence to the canonical correlation energy with tightening PNO threshold is observed. Reference MP2 correlation energies are provided for a set of 2D and 3D periodic systems using a triple-zeta basis and supercell sizes up to 11$\times$11 and 7$\times$7$\times$7.</description>

      <title>DLPNO-MP2 for Periodic Systems using Megacell Embedding</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.09814v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a domain-based local pair natural orbital M{\o}ller--Plesset second order perturbation theory (DLPNO-MP2) for periodic systems, working within an LCAO formalism within the Tubromole program package. This approach, Megacell-DLPNO-MP2, embeds a supercell correlation treatment within a megacell and does not involve periodic image summation for the Coulomb integrals. Working in a basis of well-localised Wannier functions, periodicity is instead imposed through rigorous translational symmetry of Hamiltonian integrals and wavefunction parameters. The accuracy of the method is validated through comparison with a complementary periodic DLPNO-MP2 method that employs Born--von K{\'a}rm{\'a}n boundary conditions, described in paper I of this series. The PNO approximations are shown to be equivalent in the two approaches and entirely consistent with molecular DLPNO-MP2 calculations. The Megacell-DLPNO-MP2 method displays sub-linear scaling with respect to supercell size at the asymptotic limit and example calculations are presented with up to 15000 basis functions in the correlation treatment.</description>

      <title>Emerging kinetic-exchange for the enhanced metallic ferromagnetism in CrGeTe$_3$ under pressure</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.09877</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.09877v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The microscopic origin of ferromagnetism in correlated materials remains heavily debated, particularly for the competing mechanisms governing insulating versus metallic phases. In this work, we theoretically study the electronic structure evolution of CrGeTe$_{3}$ under pressure and provide a consistent explanation to three unique features of this system, i.e. the semiconducting ferromagnetism at low pressure, the metallic ferromagnetism at high pressure, and the enhanced Curie temperature in the metallic phase. We propose that it is the reduced electronic correlation and enhanced $d$-$p$ hybridization that universally drive the continuous evolution of CrGeTe$_{3}$ under pressure and glue the three distinct experimental observations. Central to our discovery is the dual role of metallicity -- it simultaneously establishes kinetically driven exchange via $d$-$p$ hybridization and enables Stoner-type magnetic instability, with the contribution also from the residual super-exchange. Our analyses reveal that {\it intraband} excitations dominate the pressure-enhanced $\omega_p^2$ and $T_c$ correlation. These findings establish $d$-$p$ hybridization and electronic correlation as the bridge between localized and itinerant magnetism, at least, in CrGeTe$_{3}$.</description>

      <title>Observation of Integer and Fractional Chern insulators in high Chern number flatbands</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.09908v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The intertwined electron correlation and topology give birth to emergent quantum phenomena with fractionalized phases in condensed matter physics. Recently, Chern insulators and fractional ones with C smaller than one have been observed in twisted MoTe2 and rhombohedral pentalayer graphene-hBN moire systems at zero magnetic fields, resembling the fractional quantum Hall phases at high magnetic fields. Here, we target topological phases with high Chern number C &gt; 1 by designing a new moire system, i.e. twisted rhombohedral trilayer-bilayer graphene. We observe Chern insulators with C = 3 at both v = 1 and v = 3. In particular, quantized anomalous Hall effect with C = -3 is observed at v = 3 for device D2. Most importantly, by fractionally filling the high Chern number flat band, we observe evidence of a fractional Chern insulator with C = -3/2 developing from even-denominator fractional filling v = 5/2 at zero magnetic fields, which reaches a fractionally quantized Hall effect with C = -3/2 (a quantization accuracy of 96%) at B = 4T. We have observed another FCI with C = -6/5 at v = 12/5, supported by the Streda formula and anomalous Hall effects induced time reversal symmetry breakings. In addition, we observe Chern insulators with C = 1 and 2 at even-denominator fractional filling v = 1/2 and 3/2, respectively, and strikingly, the signatures of anomalous Hall crystal phases with high Chern numbers (C &gt; 1) that develops continuously from v = 1 to the even-denominator v = 3/2 at zero magnetic fields in device D1 and D3. Our results demonstrate the tRTBG, which can be naturally extended to other twisted graphene moire superlattices based on rhombohedral graphene multilayers, as a novel platform for hosting unconventional high Chern number correlated topology in the ultra-strong correlated regime that is beyond the paradigm of the fractional phases with C &lt; 1.</description>

      <title>Non-smooth optimization meets automated material model discovery</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.10196v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Automated material model discovery disrupts the tedious and time-consuming cycle of iteratively calibrating and modifying manually designed models. Non-smooth L1-norm regularization is the backbone of automated model discovery; however, the current literature on automated material model discovery offers limited insights into the robust and efficient minimization of non-smooth objective functions. In this work, we examine the minimization of functions of the form f(w) + a ||w||_1, where w are the material model parameters, f is a metric that quantifies the mismatch between the material model and the observed data, and a is a regularization parameter that determines the sparsity of the solution. We investigate both the straightforward case where f is quadratic and the more complex scenario where it is non-quadratic or even non-convex. Importantly, we do not only focus on methods that solve the sparse regression problem for a given value of the regularization parameter a, but propose methods to efficiently compute the entire regularization path, facilitating the selection of a suitable a. Specifically, we present four algorithms and discuss their roles for automated material model discovery in mechanics: First, we recapitulate a well-known coordinate descent algorithm that solves the minimization problem assuming that f is quadratic for a given value of a, also known as the LASSO. Second, we discuss the algorithm LARS, which automatically determines the critical values of a, at which material parameters in w are set to zero. Third, we propose to use the proximal gradient method ISTA for automated material model discovery if f is not quadratic, and fourth, we suggest a pathwise extension of ISTA for computing the regularization path. We demonstrate the applicability of all algorithms for the discovery of hyperelastic material models from uniaxial tension and simple shear data.</description>

      <title>Strain and Correlation Modulated Magnetic Anisotropy and Dzyaloshinskii--Moriya Interaction in 2D H-FeTe$_2$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.10477</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.10477v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In the ongoing research on two-dimensional (2D) ferromagnetic materials with strong intrinsic Dzyaloshinskii--Moriya interaction (DMI), most efforts have focused on doping, Janus engineering, or heterostructure formation to break inversion symmetry and enhance spin--orbit coupling (SOC). Here, we demonstrate that a pristine 2D material, monolayer H-FeTe$_2$, can naturally host robust DMI and magnetic anisotropy due to its intrinsic broken inversion symmetry and the strong SOC of Te atoms. We explore the effect of biaxial strain and electron correlation on H-FeTe$_2$ using first-principles DFT+$U$ calculations. We systematically investigate the Heisenberg exchange interaction, magnetic anisotropy, and DMI in the space spanned by strain and correlation. Our results reveal a distinct, non-monotonic strain dependence of both magnetic anisotropy energy (MAE) and DMI, including a strain-tunable crossover between in-plane and out-of-plane magnetic easy axes. A remarkable enhancement of the in-plane DMI is observed under the combined influence of strain and strong correlations, which is unusual for pristine 2D materials and suggests a favorable regime for spintronic applications.Notably, even in the absence of strain, H-FeTe$_2$ exhibits finite DMI and considerable anisotropy, which is rare for a pure 2D material. Through these findings, we present H-FeTe$_2$ as a unique pristine 2D system with robust and tunable spin interactions for exploring fundamental spin--orbit-driven magnetic phenomena.</description>

      <title>Modeling the Behavior of Complex Aqueous Electrolytes Using Machine Learning Interatomic Potentials: The Case of Sodium Sulfate</title>

Abstract: Understanding the structure and thermodynamics of solvated ions is essential for advancing applications in electrochemistry, water treatment, and energy storage. While ab initio molecular dynamics methods are highly accurate, they are limited by short accessible time and length scales whereas classical force fields struggle with accuracy. Herein, we explore the structure and thermodynamics of complex monovalent-divalent ion pairs using Na2SO4(aq) as a case study by applying a machine learning interatomic potential (MLIP) trained on density functional theory (DFT) data. Our MLIP-based approach reproduces key bulk properties such as density and radial distribution functions of water. We provide the hydration structure of the sodium and sulfate ions in 0.1-2 M concentration range and the one-dimensional and two-dimensional potentials of mean force for the sodium-sulfate ion pairing at the low concentration limit (0.1 M) which are inaccessible to DFT. At low concentrations, the sulfate ion is strongly solvated, leading to the stabilization of solvent-separated ion pairs over contact ion pairs. Minimum energy pathway analysis revealed that coordinating two sodium ions with a sulfate ion is a multistep process whereby the sodium ions coordinate to the sulfate ion sequentially. We demonstrate that MLIPs allow the study of solvated ions beyond simple monovalent pairs with DFT-level accuracy in their low concentration limit (0.1 M) via statistically converged properties from ns long simulations.</description>

Abstract: Nodal line semimetals feature topologically protected band crossings between the bulk valence and conduction bands that extend along a finite dimension in the form of a line or a loop. While ZrSiS and similar materials have attracted extensive research as hosts for the nodal line semimetallic phase, an alternative avenue has emerged in the form of isostructural rare-earth (RE) based RESbTe materials. Such systems possess intriguing potentialities for harboring elements of magnetic ordering and electronic correlations owing to the presence of 4f electrons intrinsic to the RE elements. In this study, we have carried out angle resolved photoemission spectroscopy (ARPES) and thermodynamic measurements in conjunction with first principles computations on PrSbTe to elucidate its electronic structure and topological characteristics. Magnetic and thermal characterizations indicate the presence of well-localized 4f states with the absence of any discernible phase transition down to 2 K. The ARPES results reveal the presence of gapless Dirac crossings that correspond to a nodal-line along the XR direction in the three-dimensional Brillouin zone. Furthermore, Dirac crossing that makes up nodal line, which forms a diamond-shaped nodal plane centered at the center of the Brillouin zone is also identified within the experimental resolution. This study on the electronic structure of PrSbTe contributes to the understanding of the pivotal role played by spin-orbit coupling in the context of the RESbTe family of materials</description>

Abstract: The CoSi-family of materials (CoSi, CoGe, RhSi and RhGe) forms a cubic chiral structure and hosts unconventional multifold chiral fermions, such as spin-1 and spin-3/2 fermions, leading to intriguing phenomena like long Fermi arc surface states and exotic transport properties. Recent interest on the phonon behavior in chiral materials is growing due to their unique characteristics, including topological phonons, protected surface states and the chiral phonons with non-zero angular momentums. In this study, we explore the topological and chiral phonon behavior in RhGe, using first-principles density functional theory calculations as well as the symmetry and topological analysis. In particular, we uncover six spin-1 triply degenerate nodal points at the $\Gamma$ point and six charge-2 double Weyl points at the R point in the Brillouin zone (BZ). Interestingly, these topological features are identical to that in the electronic band structure without the electron spin-orbit coupling, of the same material. We expect that this finding not only applies to the CoSi family but also is universal. Secondly, we find that chiral crystal RhGe hosts chiral phonon modes with a phonon angular momentum (PAM) and an associated phonon magnetic moment (PMM), everywhere in the BZ except at high symmetry points such as $\Gamma$, R, X and M. The PAM and PMM are large along the chiral rotation axis and also in the vicinity of the topological nodes. Our study also reveals that all the topological phonon modes are chiral. However, the reverse is not always true. Among other things, our finding of the coexistence of topological and chiral phonon modes in chiral RhGe not only deepens our understanding of the phonon behavior in the CoSi-family but also opens new pathways for developing advanced materials and devices.</description>

Abstract: The elastic tensor provides valuable insight into the mechanical behavior of a material with lattice strain, such as disordered binary alloys. Traditional stress-strain methods have made it possible to compute elastic constants for ordered structures and individually tailored alloy compositions. However, this approach depends on predetermined or iteratively-chosen strain tensors. This poses a significant challenge for systematic, composition-dependent studies of disordered materials with low symmetry. DFPT provides a compelling alternative to stress-strain methods: it allows for an unbiased determination of the elastic tensor, as well as access to local field data derived from the underlying general response function framework. Despite its intrinsic flexibility and efficiency, DFPT has seen limited application to the study of disordered systems. At the same time, there is a growing need for expanded quantum mechanical data to improve predictive modeling of complex disordered material properties. Here we present results for the rigid-ion and relaxed-ion elastic tensors computed using DFPT, for a comprehensive set of structural refractory BCC binary alloys of Mo, Nb, Ta, and W. We map the quantum-driven heterogeneity in elastic constants and shear modulus, and associated relaxation fields at each disordered structure lattice site, by computing the force response internal strain tensor and displacement response internal strain tensors. Derived properties -- the bulk modulus ($B$), shear modulus ($G$), Young's modulus ($E$), Poisson's ratio ($\nu$), Pugh's ratio ($B/G$), Cauchy pressure and elastic anisotropy -- are reported as a function of composition for all refractory binaries. The DFPT-computed mechanical properties data for the refractory binary alloys at systematically-varied Mo, Nb, Ta, and W compositions are in excellent agreement with available experimental data.</description>

Abstract: Wide-band gap oxides such as ZnO offer a favorable environment for spin defect qubits due to their dilute nuclear spin background and potential for ultra-high purity. Identifying deep-level defect qubits is essential for room-temperature optical initialization and quantum emission, robust against environmental noise. In this work, we theoretically design deep-level point defects in ZnO with optimal physical properties for optically-addressable spin qubits. By employing first-principles calculations, we predict that the molybdenum-vacancy complex has promising spin and optical properties, including a spin-triplet ground state, optically-allowable transition in the visible range with a high quantum yield, and an exceptionally small Huang-Rhys factor around 5, compared to 10-30 in known defects in ZnO. In particular, we found a long spin decoherence T2 time at 4 ms after considering both nuclear spin baths and paramagnetic impurity baths' interactions, with the latter dominant at impurity concentration above 0.035 ppm. Finally, we predict the energy diagram with spin-selective intersystem crossing for a spin-photon interface, and suggest the protocols for efficient optical readout. With a strong spin-orbit coupling and the absence of Jahn-Teller distortion in the proposed defect, we reveal that it supports high-fidelity single-shot readout of electron-spin at high temperature and a wide range of magnetic field.</description>

      <title>Sliding ferroelectric control of unconventional magnetism in stacked bilayers</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.17095v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The control of unconventional magnetism, which displays ferromagnetism-like properties with compensated magnetization, has drawn intense attention for advancing antiferromagnetic spintronics. Here, through symmetry analysis, we propose a general stacking rule, characterized by a connection operator linking two stacked bilayers, for controlling unconventional magnetism via sliding ferroelectricity. Such rule enables the simultaneous switching of both electric polarization and nonrelativistic spin splitting or anomalous Hall effect in altermagnets, a class of collinear unconventional magnets. By comprehensively surveying the 80 layer groups, we identify all the stacking orders that allow for such two types of simultaneous switching. Furthermore, we extend the stacking rule to collinear compensated ferrimagnets, where the opposite-spin sublattices are not connected by any symmetry operator, yet the net magnetization remains zero. Combined with first-principles calculations, we demonstrate the sliding ferroelectric control of spin polarization and anomalous Hall effect in the altermagnetic AgF2 and Fe2MoSe4 bilayers. Our work provides a symmetry strategy for achieving ferroelectric control of unconventional magnetism in bilayer systems and opens avenues for exploring new types of magnetoelectric coupling.</description>

      <title>Antiferromagnetic resonance in $\alpha$-MnTe</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.18933</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.18933v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Antiferromagnetic resonance in a bulk $\alpha$-MnTe crystal is investigated using both frequency-domain and time-domain THz spectroscopy techniques. At low temperatures, an excitation at the photon energy of $(3.5\pm 0.1)$~meV is observed and identified as a magnon mode through its distinctive dependence on temperature and magnetic field. This behavior is reproduced using a simplified model for antiferromagnetic resonance in an easy-plane antiferromagnet. The results of our experiments, when compared to exchange constants established in the literature, allow us to extract the out-of-plane component of the single-ion magnetic anisotropy reaching $(40\pm10)$~$\mu$eV.</description>

Abstract: Synergizing altermagnetism and other ferroic orders, such as ferroelectric switchable altermagnetism [Phys. Rev. Lett. 134, 106801 (2025) and ibid. 106802 (2025)], offers an effective route to achieve nonvolatile switching of altermagnetic spin splitting. In this work, by synergizing altermagnetism and ferroelasticity, we propose the concept of ferroelastic altermagnets in which the ferroelastic crystal reorientation can drive multistate nonvolatile switching of the altermagnetic spin splitting via altermagnetoelastic effect. Using monolayers RuF4 and CuF2 as material candidates, we demonstrate 2-state and 3-state altermagnetic spin splitting switching as driven by ferroelastic strain states. Transport calculation shows that multistate spin conductivities can be ferroelastically encoded in an ferroelastic altermagnet, thus suggesting the potential of ferroelastic altermagnetic as nonvolatile nanomechanical spin switches. The proposed concept of ferroelastic altermagnetism enriches the emerging landscape of multiferroic altermagnetism, paving a way towards altermagnetic-based straintronic device applications.</description>

      <title>Reducing Self-Interaction Error in Transition-Metal Oxides with Different Exact-Exchange Fractions for Energy and Density</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.20635</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.20635v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: DFT is vital for materials discovery, materials databases, chemical reaction predictions, and machine learning potentials. The widespread use of DFT in materials science aims for "chemical accuracy," but this is limited by the unknown exchange and correlation (XC) functional. A meta-GGA, the restored regularized strongly constrained and appropriately normed, r$^2$SCAN XC functional, fulfils 17 exact constraints of the XC energy. r$^2$SCAN still appears inadequate at predicting material properties of strongly correlated compounds. Inaccuracies of r$^2$SCAN arise from functional and density-driven errors, linked to the self-interaction error. We introduce a new method, r$^2$SCANY@r$^2$SCANX, for simulating transition metal oxides accurately. r$^2$SCANY@r$^2$SCANX uses different fractions of exact exchange: X to set the electronic density, and Y to set the energy density functional approximation. r2SCANY@r2SCANX addresses functional-driven and density-driven inaccuracies. Using just one or two universal parameters, r$^2$SCANY@r$^2$SCANX enhances the r$^2$SCAN predictions of the properties of 18 correlated oxides, outperforming the highly parameterized DFT+$U$. The O$_2$ overbinding in r$^2$SCAN (~0.3 eV/O$_2$) reduces to just ~0.03 eV/O$_2$ with any X in r$^2$SCAN10@r$^2$SCANX. Uncertainties for oxide oxidation energies and magnetic moments are reduced by r$^2$SCAN10@r$^2$SCAN50, minimizing r$^2$SCAN density-driven errors. The computationally efficient r$^2$SCAN10@r$^2$SCAN is nearly as accurate as the hybrid r$^2$SCAN10 for oxidation energies. Thus, accurate energy differences can be achieved by rate-limiting self-consistent iterations and geometry optimizations with the efficient r$^2$SCAN. Subsequently, expensive hybrid functionals can be applied in a fast-to-execute single post-self-consistent calculation, as in r$^2$SCAN10@r$^2$SCAN, which is 10 to 300x faster than r$^2$SCAN10.</description>

      <title>Searching for evidence of strengthening from short-range order in the CrCoNi medium entropy alloy</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.01147v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The coupling of strength to short-range order (SRO) in the CrCoNi medium entropy alloy remains debated, with conflicting reports supporting and opposing SRO-induced strengthening continuing to emerge. A direct observation of this effect is elusive, due to difficulties in the quantification of SRO. Here, we deliver a structurally agnostic analysis that instead searches for unusual patterns in crystal size effects as evidence of SRO-induced strengthening. For this purpose, we assemble a large dataset of strengthening measurements drawn from a range of thermomechanical processing conditions known to produce SRO. Based on a comparative analysis with pure metal benchmarks, we find no evidence for significant coupling of SRO to strengthening in CrCoNi, and that patterns suggesting a positive finding may be explained by cross-study measurement scatter. Nevertheless, we leverage our analysis to provide an upper bound estimate of SRO-induced strengthening in the unlikely scenario where other sources of scatter are negligible.</description>

      <title>Revealing the intrinsic electronic structure and complex fermiology of YRu2Si2 using angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy</title>

      <description>arXiv:2304.07871v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We performed a detailed study of the intrinsic electronic structure of YRu2Si2 employing angleresolved photoemission spectroscopy (ARPES) and density-functional theory (DFT) based firstprinciples calculations. Electrical and magnetic measurements were conducted on well-oriented highquality single crystals. Bulk physical measurements indicate that the compound exhibits slightly enhanced Pauli paramagnetic behavior, accompanied by electrical transport properties reminiscent of metals. Our ARPES data reveal four fold symmetric Fermi surface with weakly-dispersing bands around the N point originating from Ru d orbitals. We observed the anisotropic characteristics of the band near the N point, showing weak dispersion in the XNX direction and minimal dispersion along the NGN direction. The electronic band structure near the Fermi level is primarily governed by the Ru d orbital, with minor contributions from the Y d and Si p orbitals. Polarization-dependent ARPES results indicate the multi-band and multi-orbital band-character of YRu2Si2. Due to the negligible correlation effect, the observed ARPES data is found to be in good agreement with the DFT results.</description>

      <title>Order in disorder: increased carrier mobility of downscaled amorphous semiconductors for high-speed thin film transistors in flexible electronics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.06439</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.06439v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Amorphous semiconductors are important channel semiconductors in thin film transistors (TFTs) which serve not only active-matrix displays, but also flexible electronics for Internet of Things (IoT) applications. Nevertheless, a great limitation of amorphous semiconductors is their low carrier mobilities relative to their monocrystalline counterparts. Based on a recently established band fluctuation framework [Y. Luo and A. Flewitt, Phys. Rev. B 109, 104203 (2024)], this paper shows that the intrinsic carrier mobility of amorphous semiconductors can significantly increase simply through device downscaling, without any material-level optimizations. Specifically, it is revealed that the intrinsic electron mobility of hydrogenated amorphous silicon in a 10-nm long gap can increase by around 12 times, and does not compromise device-to-device uniformity. This mobility improvement is a result of reduced localized band tail states due to the ultra-short gap length relative to the band fluctuation length scale before downscaling; the latter is determined by the short- and medium-range structural order of the amorphous semiconductor.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.08800v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Quantum transport simulations are essential for understanding and designing nanoelectronic devices, yet the long-standing trade-off between accuracy and computational efficiency has limited their practical applications. We present DeePTB-NEGF, an integrated framework combining deep learning tight-binding Hamiltonian prediction with non-equilibrium Green's Function methodology to enable accurate quantum transport simulations in open boundary conditions with 2-3 orders of magnitude acceleration. We demonstrate DeePTB-NEGF through two challenging applications: comprehensive break junction simulations with over $10^4$ snapshots, showing excellent agreement with experimental conductance histograms; and carbon nanotube field-effect transistors (CNT-FET) at experimental dimensions, reproducing measured transfer characteristics for a 41 nm channel CNT-FET ($\sim 8000$ atoms, $3\times10^4$ orbitals) and predicting zero-bias transmission spectra for a 180 nm CNT ($\sim 3\times 10^4$ atoms, $10^5$ orbitals), showcasing the framework's capability for large-scale device simulations. Our systematic studies across varying geometries confirm the necessity of simulating realistic experimental structures for precise predictions. DeePTB-NEGF bridges the longstanding gap between first-principles accuracy and computational efficiency, providing a scalable tool for high-throughput and large-scale quantum transport simulations that enables previously inaccessible nanoscale device investigations.</description>

      <title>Hydrodynamics of fault gouges from constitutive modelling to the physics of friction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.14660</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.14660v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The development of rate- and state-dependent friction laws offered important insights into the key physical mechanisms of the frictional behaviour of fault gouges and their seismic cycle. However, past approaches were specifically tailored to address the problem of fault shearing, leaving questions about their ability to comprehensively represent the gouge material under general loading conditions. This work establishes an alternative approach for developing a physical friction law for fault gouges that is grounded on the rigour of the hydrodynamic procedure with two-scale temperatures through Terracotta, a thoroughly robust constitutive model for clay in triaxial loading conditions. By specifying the model for direct shearing, the approach yields an alternative friction law that readily captures the frictional dynamics of fault gouges, including explicit dependencies on gouge layer thickness, normal stress, and solid fraction. Validated against available laboratory experiments, the friction law retains the original predictive capabilities of Terracotta in triaxial conditions and explains the rate-and-state, dilatational behaviour of fault gouges in direct shear conditions. Finally, when the Terracotta friction law is connected to a spring-dashpot representation of the host rock, the combined model predicts an elastic buildup precursor to the onset of and subsequent seismicity, with results closely reflecting experimental evidence and field observations. While this study focuses on clay-rich gouges, the approach and findings are expected to offer much wider implications to a variety of materials.</description>

      <title>Interface Energy and Phase Transformations: A Comparative Analysis of Cahn-Hilliard and CALPHAD-based Models in Ternary Substitutional Alloys</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.16430v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: There are various methods for modeling phase transformations in materials science, including general classes of phase-field methods and reactive diffusion methodologies, which most importantly differ in their treatment of interface energy. These methodologies appear mutually exclusive since the respective numerical schemes only allow for their primary use case. To address this issue, a novel methodology for modeling phase transformations in multi-phase, multi-component systems, with particular emphasis on applications in materials science and the study of substitutional alloys is introduced. The fundamental role of interface energy in the evolution of a material's morphology will be studied by example of binary and ternary systems. Allowing full control over the interface energy quantity enables more detailed investigations and bridges the gaps between known methods. We prove the thermodynamic consistency of the derived method and discuss several use cases, such as vacancy-mediated diffusion. Furthermore a scheme for relating Onsager and Diffusion coefficients is proposed, which allows us to study the intricate coupling that is observed in multicomponent systems. We hope to contribute to the development of new mathematical tools for modeling complex phase transformations in materials science.</description>

      <title>Anisotropic, multiband, and strong-coupling superconductivity of the Pb0.64Bi0.36 alloy</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.18315v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper presents theoretical and experimental studies on the superconductivity of Pb${_{0.64}}$Bi$_{0.36}$ alloy, which is a prototype of strongly coupled superconductors and exhibits one of the strongest coupling under ambient pressure among the materials studied so far. The critical temperature, the specific heat in the superconducting state, and the magnetic critical fields are experimentally determined. Deviations from the single-gap s-wave BCS-like behavior are observed. The electronic structure, phonons and electron-phonon interactions are analyzed in relation to the metallic Pb, explaining why the Pb-Bi alloy exhibits such a large value of the electron-phonon coupling parameter $\lambda \simeq 2$. Superconductivity is studied using the isotropic Eliashberg formalism as well as the anisotropic density functional theory for superconductors. We find that while Pb is a two-gap superconductor with well-defined separate superconducting gaps, in the Pb-Bi alloy an overlapped three-gap-like structure is formed with a strong anisotropy. Furthermore, the chemical disorder, inherent to this alloy, leads to strong electron scattering, which is found to reduce the critical temperature.</description>

      <title>Three-Dimensional Hieratical Twists in Polar Fluids: Chirality Regulation by Ultra-Low Electric Field</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.24628v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recently discovered helical polar fluid adopts a spontaneous chiral symmetry breaking (CSB) driven by polarization escape and conformational chirality. Ferroelectric nematic and smectic phases are intrinsically chiral in the ground state and can be stabilized in an extrinsic twisted configuration through surface anchoring. Herein, we introduce extrinsic CSB as a novel technique in chiral engineering. To demonstrate this concept, we constructed the extrinsic structure of a helielectric conical mesophase (HEC)-three-dimensional chiral system. Considering the challenges of controlling chirality at the macroscopic scale owing to magnetic fields, light, and fluid vortex motion, the proposed three-dimensional chiral system enables chirality (twist) modulation through an ultralow electric field, thereby controlling unique diffraction pattern and circular polarized light-switching capabilities.</description>
