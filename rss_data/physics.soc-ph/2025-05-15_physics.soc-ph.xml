      <title>Monotone three-dimensional surface and equivalent formulations of the generalized bathtub model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.10014</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.10014v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the Lighthill-Whitham-Richards (LWR) model for single-lane traffic, vehicle trajectories follow the first-in-first-out (FIFO) principle and can be represented by a monotone three-dimensional surface of cumulative vehicle count. In contrast, the generalized bathtub model, which describes congestion dynamics in transportation networks using relative space, typically violates the FIFO principle, making its representation more challenging.
  Building on the characteristic distance ordering concept, we observe that trips in the generalized bathtub model can be ordered by their characteristic distances (remaining trip distance plus network travel distance). We define a new cumulative number of trips ahead of a trip with a given remaining distance at a time instant, showing it forms a monotone three-dimensional surface despite FIFO violations. Using the inverse function theorem, we derive equivalent formulations with different coordinates and dependent variables, including special cases for Vickrey's bathtub model and the basic bathtub model.
  We demonstrate numerical methods based on these formulations and discuss trip-based approaches for discrete demand patterns. This study enhances understanding of the generalized bathtub model's properties, facilitating its application in network traffic flow modeling, congestion pricing, and transportation planning.</description>

      <title>Reproducing the first and second moment of empirical degree distributions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.10373</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.10373v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The study of probabilistic models for the analysis of complex networks represents a flourishing research field. Among the former, Exponential Random Graphs (ERGs) have gained increasing attention over the years. So far, only linear ERGs have been extensively employed to gain insight into the structural organisation of real-world complex networks. None, however, is capable of accounting for the variance of the empirical degree distribution. To this aim, non-linear ERGs must be considered. After showing that the usual mean-field approximation forces the degree-corrected version of the two-star model to degenerate, we define a fitness-induced variant of it. Such a `softened' model is capable of reproducing the sample variance, while retaining the explanatory power of its linear counterpart, within a purely canonical framework.</description>

      <title>Can a Referendum Solve Problems of Shared Sovereignty on Mars?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.10434</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.10434v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Space exploration technology continues to expand humanity's reach beyond Earth, and even more ambitious efforts are striving to establish long-duration human settlements on Mars. The dependence of martian settlers on life-support infrastructure and on resupply missions from the host nation could create conditions for tyranny or lead to other extreme and uncontrollable situations, but such risks could be reduced by thinking about the possibilities for effective decision making on Mars before any settlement efforts actually occur. This paper examines the extent to which referendums could be used on Mars as a means of political decision-making and sovereignty adjudication. Our approach draws on three terrestrial case studies -- the Great Idaho Movement in the United States, the Catalan Independence Movement in Spain, and the Quebec Independence Movement in Canada -- as potential analogs for Mars governance. We recommend advance determination of the conditions under which a martian referendum would be recognized as a best practice for any agency seeking to establish a long-duration settlement on Mars. We suggest that referendums can reduce the likelihood of multiple authoritative political entities existing on Mars, which could provide a more procedural approach toward resolving governance issues between Earth and Mars. However, if Mars settlement is successful in establishing settlements on the scale of cities or larger, then other uniquely martian tools may evolve as a supplement or replacement to referendums.</description>

      <title>AAS Graduate Admissions Task Force: Final report and recommendations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.09759</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.09759v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In March of 2024 the AAS formed our Graduate Admissions Task Force (GATF), asking us to produce recommendations aimed at improving the state of graduate admissions in astronomy. The task was a timely one, as the past decade has seen dramatic shifts that are currently being exacerbated by rapidly-shifting funding and policy challenges. The GATF surveyed recent applicants to astronomy graduate school and admissions leaders in degree-granting graduate programs, held in-depth conversations with select programs, and explored how other fields approach admissions. Based on this work, we have quantified recent changes in the astronomy graduate admissions landscape, addressed mismatches between perception and reality, and identified several key ways to address some of our current challenges. In this report we summarize the results of this work and the four main recommendations we believe the AAS should take to make lasting positive changes. We emphasize that the goal of our report, and the GATF's work, is not to help programs select students, or to help applicants get into graduate school. Instead, we have focused on ways to make the admissions process itself more streamlined, fair, and efficient for everyone involved.</description>

      <title>Provably safe and human-like car-following behaviors: Part 1. Analysis of phases and dynamics in standard models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.09987</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.09987v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Trajectory planning is essential for ensuring safe driving in the face of uncertainties related to communication, sensing, and dynamic factors such as weather, road conditions, policies, and other road users. Existing car-following models often lack rigorous safety proofs and the ability to replicate human-like driving behaviors consistently. This article applies multi-phase dynamical systems analysis to well-known car-following models to highlight the characteristics and limitations of existing approaches. We begin by formulating fundamental principles for safe and human-like car-following behaviors, which include zeroth-order principles for comfort and minimum jam spacings, first-order principles for speeds and time gaps, and second-order principles for comfort acceleration/deceleration bounds as well as braking profiles. From a set of these zeroth- and first-order principles, we derive Newell's simplified car-following model. Subsequently, we analyze phases within the speed-spacing plane for the stationary lead-vehicle problem in Newell's model and its extensions, which incorporate both bounded acceleration and deceleration. We then analyze the performance of the Intelligent Driver Model and the Gipps model. Through this analysis, we highlight the limitations of these models with respect to some of the aforementioned principles. Numerical simulations and empirical observations validate the theoretical insights. Finally, we discuss future research directions to further integrate safety, human-like behaviors, and vehicular automation in car-following models, which are addressed in Part 2 of this study \citep{jin2025WA20-02_Part2}, where we develop a novel multi-phase projection-based car-following model that addresses the limitations identified here.</description>

      <title>Provably safe and human-like car-following behaviors: Part 2. A parsimonious multi-phase model with projected braking</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.09988</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.09988v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Ensuring safe and human-like trajectory planning for automated vehicles amidst real-world uncertainties remains a critical challenge. While existing car-following models often struggle to consistently provide rigorous safety proofs alongside human-like acceleration and deceleration patterns, we introduce a novel multi-phase projection-based car-following model. This model is designed to balance safety and performance by incorporating bounded acceleration and deceleration rates while emulating key human driving principles. Building upon a foundation of fundamental driving principles and a multi-phase dynamical systems analysis (detailed in Part 1 of this study \citep{jin2025WA20-02_Part1}), we first highlight the limitations of extending standard models like Newell's with simple bounded deceleration. Inspired by human drivers' anticipatory behavior, we mathematically define and analyze projected braking profiles for both leader and follower vehicles, establishing safety criteria and new phase definitions based on the projected braking lead-vehicle problem. The proposed parsimonious model combines an extended Newell's model for nominal driving with a new control law for scenarios requiring projected braking. Using speed-spacing phase plane analysis, we provide rigorous mathematical proofs of the model's adherence to defined safe and human-like driving principles, including collision-free operation, bounded deceleration, and acceptable safe stopping distance, under reasonable initial conditions. Numerical simulations validate the model's superior performance in achieving both safety and human-like braking profiles for the stationary lead-vehicle problem. Finally, we discuss the model's implications and future research directions.</description>

      <title>Random Walks Performed by Topologically-Specific Agents on Complex Networks</title>

      <description>arXiv:2312.00859v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Random walks by single-node agents have been systematically conducted on various types of complex networks in order to investigate how their topologies can affect the dynamics of the agents. However, by fitting any network node, these agents do not engage in topological interactions with the network. In the present work, we describe random walks on complex networks performed by agents that are actually small graphs. These agents can only occupy admissible portions of the network onto which they fit topologically, hence their name being taken as topologically-specific agents. These agents are also allowed to move to adjacent subgraphs in the network, which have each node adjacent to a distinct original respective node of the agent. Given a network and a specific agent, it is possible to obtain a respective associated network, in which each node corresponds to a possible instance of the agent and the edges indicate adjacent positions. Associated networks are obtained and studied respectively to three types of topologically-specific agents (triangle, square, and slashed square) considering three types of complex networks (geometrical, Erd\H{o}s-R\'enyi, and Barab\'asi-Albert). Uniform random walks are also performed on these structures, as well as networks respectively obtained by removing the five nodes with the highest degree, and studied in terms of the number of covered nodes along the walks. Several results are reported and discussed, including the fact that substantially distinct associated networks can be obtained for each of the three considered agents and for varying average node degrees. Respectively to the coverage of the networks by uniform random walks, the square agent led to the most effective coverage of the nodes, followed by the triangle and slashed square agents. In addition, the geometric network turned out to be less effectively covered.</description>

      <title>Scalar embedding of temporal network trajectories</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.02715</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.02715v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A temporal network -- a collection of snapshots recording the evolution of a network whose links appear and disappear dynamically -- can be interpreted as a trajectory in graph space. In order to characterize the complex dynamics of such trajectory via the tools of time series analysis and signal processing, it is sensible to preprocess the trajectory by embedding it in a low-dimensional Euclidean space. Here we argue that, rather than the topological structure of each network snapshot, the main property of the trajectory that needs to be preserved in the embedding is the relative graph distance between snapshots. This idea naturally leads to dimensionality reduction approaches that explicitly consider relative distances, such as Multidimensional Scaling (MDS) or identifying the distance matrix as a feature matrix in which to perform Principal Component Analysis (PCA). This paper provides a comprehensible methodology that illustrates this approach. Its application to a suite of generative network trajectory models and empirical data certify that nontrivial dynamical properties of the network trajectories are preserved already in their scalar embeddings, what enables the possibility of performing time series analysis in temporal networks.</description>

      <title>Modeling Human Behavior in a Strategic Network Game with Complex Group Dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.03795</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.03795v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Human networks greatly impact important societal outcomes, including wealth and health inequality, poverty, and bullying. As such, understanding human networks is critical to learning how to promote favorable societal outcomes. As a step toward better understanding human networks, we compare and contrast several methods for learning, from a small data set, models of human behavior in a strategic network game called the Junior High Game (JHG). These modeling methods differ with respect to the assumptions they use to parameterize human behavior (behavior vs. community-aware behavior) and the moments they model (mean vs. distribution). Results show that the highest-performing method, called hCAB, models the distribution of human behavior rather than the mean and assumes humans use community-aware behavior rather than behavior matching. When applied to small societies (6-11 individuals), the hCAB model closely mirrors the population dynamics of human groups (with notable differences). Additionally, in a user study, human participants were unable to distinguish individual hCAB agents from other humans, thus illustrating that the hCAB model also produces plausible (individual) human behavior in this strategic network game.</description>
