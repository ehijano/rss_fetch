      <title>Numerical investigation of a family of solitary-wave solutions for the nonlinear Schr\"odinger equation perturbed by third-, and fourth-order dispersion</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.10449v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study solitary wave solutions for the nonlinear Schr\"odinger equation perturbed by the effects of third-, and fourth-order dispersion, maintaining a wavenumber gap between the solitary waves and the propagation constant. We numerically construct members of a family of such solitary waves, including Kruglov and Harvey's exact solution, using the spectral renormalization method and establish empirical relations between the pulse parameters. A deeper insight into the properties of solitary waves and solitons can be obtained through collisions. Therefore we perform pulse propagation simulations demonstrating different collision regimes. Depending on the pulses initial phase difference, this can lead to the formation of short-lived two-pulse bound states. While these collisions are generally inelastic, singular phase values exist at which they are elastic. Finally, we detail the properties of Kruglov and Harvey's soliton solution under loss, verifying earlier predictions of perturbation theory and suggesting a convergence to the soliton solution of the standard nonlinear Schr\"odinger equation in the limit of large propagation distances.</description>

      <title>Active pattern formation emergent from single-species nonreciprocity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.10093</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.10093v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Nonreciprocal forces violating Newton's third law are common in a plethora of nonequilibrium situations ranging from predator-prey systems to the swarming of birds and effective colloidal interactions under flow. While many recent studies have focused on two species with nonreciprocal coupling, much less is examined for the basic single-component system breaking the actio and reactio equality of force within the same species. Here, we systematically derive the fundamental field theory of single-species nonreciprocal interactions from microscopic dynamics, leading to a generic framework termed Active Model N (N denoting nonreciprocity). We explore the rich dynamics of pattern formation in this intrinsic nonreciprocal system and the emergence of self-traveling states with persistent variation and flowing of active branched patterns. One particular new characteristic pattern is an interwoven self-knitting "yarn" structure with a unique feature of simultaneous development of micro- and bulk phase separations. The growth dynamics of a "ball-of-wool" active droplet towards these self-knitted yarn or branched states exhibits a crossover between different scaling behaviors. The mechanism underlying this distinct class of active phase separation is attributed to the interplay between force nonreciprocity and competition. Our predictions can be applied to various biological and artificial active matter systems controlled by single-species nonreciprocity.</description>
