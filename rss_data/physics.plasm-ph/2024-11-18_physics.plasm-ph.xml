      <title>Indication of p + 11B Reaction in Laser Induced Nanofusion Experiment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.09796</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.09796v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The NanoPlasmonic Laser Induced Fusion Energy (NAPLIFE) project proposed fusion by regulating the laser light absorption via resonant nanorod antennas implanted into hydrogen rich urethane acrylate methacrylate (UDMA) and triethylene glycol dimethylacrylate (TEGDMA) copolymer targets. In part of the tests, boron-nitride (BN) was added to the polymer. Our experiments with resonant nanoantennas accelerated protons up to 225 keV energy. Some of these protons then led to p + 11B fusion, indicated by the sharp drop of observed backward proton emission numbers at the 150 keV resonance energy of the reaction. The generation of alpha particles was verified by CR-39 (Columbia Resin #39) nuclear plastic track detectors.</description>

      <title>Solvated Electrons and Hydroxyl Radicals at the Plasma-Liquid Interface</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.09991</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.09991v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: While hydroxyl radicals ($\cdot$OH) play an important role as potent oxidizing agents in various plasma applications, their high reactivity confines them to a thin layer at the plasma-liquid interface, posing challenges in comprehending the intricate generation and transport processes. Similarly, solvated electrons ($\mathrm{e_{aq}}$), highly reactive reducing agents, are expected to exhibit distribution beneath the liquid surface and interact with $\cdot$OH in the thin layer. In this study, we have determined the penetration depth and concentration of ($\mathrm{e_{aq}}$) at the interface between an atmospheric argon plasma plume and an electrolyte anode via a lock-in amplification absorbance measurement. With bias voltages from 1000 to 2500 V, the penetration depth remains approximately 10 nm, and the peak concentration near the surface reaches 1 mM. Diffusion is the primary mechanism for $\cdot$OH generation in the electrolyte, with most $\cdot$OH reacting with ($\mathrm{e_{aq}}$) at the interface, thus influencing the ($\mathrm{e_{aq}}$) distribution. In contrast, the electrolyte cathode significantly boosts $\cdot$OH generation, leading to rapid recombination into hydrogen peroxide.</description>

      <title>Thermal Conductivity and Thermal Hall Effect in Dense Electron-Ion Plasma</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.01304</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.01304v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this study, we examine thermal conductivity and the thermal Hall effect in electron-ion plasmas relevant to hot neutron stars, white dwarfs, and binary neutron star mergers, focusing on densities found in the outer crusts of neutron stars and the interiors of white dwarfs. We consider plasma consisting of single species of ions, which could be either iron $\isotope[56]{Fe}$ or carbon $\isotope[12]{C}$ nuclei. The temperature range explored is from the melting temperature of the solid $T\sim10^9$~K up to $10^{11}$~K. This covers both degenerate and non-degenerate electron regimes. We find that thermal conductivity increases with density and temperature for which we provide analytical scaling relations valid in different regimes. The impact of magnetic fields on thermal conductivity is also analyzed, showing anisotropy in low-density regions and the presence of the thermal Hall effect characterized by the Righi--Leduc coefficient. The transition from a degenerate to non-degenerate regime is characterized by a minimum ratio of thermal conductivity to temperature, which is analogous to the minimum observed already in the case of electrical conductivity. We provide also formulas fit to our numerical results, which can be used in dissipative magneto-hydrodynamics simulations of warm compact stars.</description>

      <title>Origin of spectral bands in the Crab pulsar radio emission</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.12992</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.12992v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The model explaining the spectral "zebra" pattern of the high-frequency interpulse (HFIP) of the Crab pulsar radio emission is proposed. The observed emission bands are diffraction fringes in the spectral domain. The pulsar's own plasma-filled magnetosphere plays a role of a frequency-dependent "diffraction screen". The observed features such as the proportional band spacing, high polarization, constant position angle, and others are explained. The model allows one to perform "tomography" of the pulsar magnetosphere. Indeed, we have obtained the plasma density profile directly from observations, without assuming a particular magnetosphere. Our model is testable and several predictions are made. The two "high-frequency components" observed at the same frequencies as the HFIP are proposed to be related to HFIP.</description>

      <title>Simulation of Solar Wind Charged Particle Energy Deposited and Particle Identification by $\Delta$E-E Discrimination in the SNAPPY Cubesat Detector</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.08170</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.08170v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The Solar Neutrino and Astro-Particle PhYsics (SNAPPY) Cubesat is expected to launch in 2025 and it will carry into a polar orbit a prototype test detector for solar neutrino background studies while over the Earth's poles for the neutrino Solar Orbiting Laboratory future project ($\nu$SOL). During this flight it is possible to do other science measurements. One of these is an improved study of the solar wind particles through better particle identification and energy measurements. This study aimed to understand how well could the solar wind particles be identified using the planned detector but instead of using the veto array as an anti-coincidence it would be used as a $\Delta$E energy sampling of a phoswich particle ID system.</description>
