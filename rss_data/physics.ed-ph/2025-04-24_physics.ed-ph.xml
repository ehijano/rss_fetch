      <title>The Flight Physics Concept Inventory: Development of a research-based assessment instrument to enhance learning and teaching</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.16975</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.16975v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This work frames the first three publications around the development of the Flight Physics Concept Inventory (FliP-CoIn), and elaborates on many aspects in more detail. FliP-CoIn is a multiple-choice conceptual assessment instrument for improving fluid dynamics learning and teaching. I give insights into why and how FliP-CoIn was developed and how it is best used for improving conceptual learning. Further, this work presents evidence for several dimensions of FliP-CoIn's validity and reliability. Finally, I discuss key insights from the development process, the data analysis, and give recommendations for future research.

      <title>Computational Physics in the Advanced Lab: Experiment and Simulation of Thermal Diffusion in Metal Rods</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.17108</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.17108v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Computational physics is integrated throughout the current undergraduate physics curriculum, though there are surprisingly few resources for computational physics in the advanced lab courses. This is despite the fact that a comparison of numerical simulations to experimental results is common practice in modern physics research. In this paper we present a simple experiment in thermal diffusion in metal rods. An analytical solution exists for the transient heat conduction in an infinite rod with a delta function heat input, but no analytical solution exists for short rods or for long duration heat inputs. Our apparatus is a copper rod with a heater and thermometers attached to the rod. The temperature difference on the metal rods due to transient heat conduction can be modeled using a simple numerical simulation using the finite centered difference method. Using a 22 cm long copper rod with the ends thermally sunk in aluminum blocks, we show poor agreement between the experimental results and the infinite-rod analytical model, but excellent agreement between the experimental results and our numerical simulation. Repeating the experiment with only one end of the rod sunk into an aluminum block (the other floating), we get good qualitative agreement between the experimental results and the numerical model. This experiment shows the power of a numerical simulation but also the limitations of the chosen model, which can be used as motivation for further exploration.</description>

      <title>Using multiple representations to improve student understanding of quantum states</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.17472</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.17472v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: One hallmark of expertise in physics is the ability to translate between different representations of knowledge and use the representations that make the problem-solving process easier. In quantum mechanics, students learn about several ways to represent quantum states, e.g., as state vectors in Dirac notation and as wavefunctions in position and momentum representation. Many advanced students in upper-level undergraduate and graduate quantum mechanics courses have difficulty translating state vectors in Dirac notation to wavefunctions in the position or momentum representation and vice versa. They also struggle when translating the wavefunction between the position and momentum representations. The research presented here describes the difficulties that students have with these issues and how research was used as a guide in the development, validation, and evaluation of a Quantum Interactive Learning Tutorial (QuILT) to help students develop a functional understanding of these concepts. The QuILT strives to help students with different representations of quantum states as state vectors in Dirac notation and as wavefunctions in position and momentum representation and with translating between these representations. We discuss the effectiveness of the QuILT from in-class implementation and evaluation.</description>

      <title>Investigation of student and faculty problem solving: An example from quantum mechanics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.17487</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.17487v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We describe a study focusing on students' and faculty members' reasoning about problems of differing cognitive complexity related to the double-slit experiment (DSE) with single particles. In the first phase of the study, students in advanced quantum mechanics courses were asked these questions in written form. Additionally, individual interviews were conducted with ten students in which they were asked follow-up questions to make their thought processes explicit on the challenging problems. Students did well on the straightforward problem, showing they had some knowledge of the DSE after traditional instruction, but they struggled on the more complex ones. Even if explicitly asked to do so in interviews, students were often uncomfortable performing calculations or making approximations and simplifications, instead preferring to stick with their gut feeling. In the second phase of the study, the problems were broken down into more pointed questions to investigate whether students had knowledge of relevant concepts, whether they would do calculations as part of their solution approach if explicitly asked, and whether they explicitly noted using their gut feeling. While the faculty members' responses suggest that they could seamlessly move between conceptual and quantitative reasoning, most students were unable to combine concepts represented by different equations to solve the problems quantitatively. We conclude with instructional implications.</description>
