      <title>Data-Driven Bifurcation Handling in Physics-Based Reduced-Order Vascular Hemodynamic Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.21165</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.21165v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Three-dimensional (3D) finite-element simulations of cardiovascular flows provide high-fidelity predictions to support cardiovascular medicine, but their high computational cost limits clinical practicality. Reduced-order models (ROMs) offer computationally efficient alternatives but suffer reduced accuracy, particularly at vessel bifurcations where complex flow physics are inadequately captured by standard Poiseuille flow assumptions. We present an enhanced numerical framework that integrates machine learning-predicted bifurcation coefficients into zero-dimensional (0D) hemodynamic ROMs to improve accuracy while maintaining computational efficiency. We develop a resistor-resistor-inductor (RRI) model that uses neural networks to predict pressure-flow relationships from bifurcation geometry, incorporating linear and quadratic resistances along with inductive effects. The method employs non-dimensionalization to reduce training data requirements and apriori flow split prediction for improved bifurcation characterization. We incorporate the RRI model into a 0D model using an optimization-based solution strategy. We validate the approach in isolated bifurcations and vascular trees, across Reynolds numbers from 0 to 5,500, defining ROM accuracy by comparison to 3D finite element simulation. Results demonstrate substantial accuracy improvements: averaged across all trees and Reynolds numbers, the RRI method reduces inlet pressure errors from 54 mmHg (45%) for standard 0D models to 25 mmHg (17%), while a simplified resistor-inductor (RI) variant achieves 31 mmHg (26%) error. The enhanced 0D models show particular effectiveness at high Reynolds numbers and in extensive vascular networks. This hybrid numerical approach enables accurate, real-time hemodynamic modeling for clinical decision support, uncertainty quantification, and digital twins in cardiovascular biomedical engineering.</description>

      <title>A hyperreduced manifold learning approach to nonlinear model order reduction for the homogenisation of hyperelastic RVEs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.21527</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.21527v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In a recent work, we proposed a graph-based manifold learning scheme for the nonlinear Galerkin-reduction of quasi-static solid mechanical problems [1]. The resulting nonlinear approximation spaces can closely and flexibly represent nonlinear solution manifolds. The present work discusses how this nonlinear model order reduction (MOR) approach can be employed to reduce online computational costs by multiple orders of magnitude while retaining high levels of accuracy. We integrate two popular hyperreduction methods into the nonlinear MOR framework and discuss how we achieve an algorithmic complexity which is independent from the original system size. Furthermore, improvements are made to the local online linearisation scheme for the sake of performance and robustness. On an example RVE problem, the MOR scheme accelerates computations by more than two orders of magnitude with little training data and negligible loss of accuracy. Additionally, the algorithm Pareto-dominates alternative approaches in the trade-off between accuracy and runtime on the considered example.</description>

      <title>GIPPO: A Graph-based, Iterative, Printing-Path Optimization Slicer for Architected Lattices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.21694</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.21694v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Architected materials of significant geometric complexity offer exceptional mechanical properties that often surpass those of their constituent materials. However, their fabrication through extrusion-based 3D printing remains hindered by suboptimal printing trajectories, which is inherent to commercial slicing software. They produce multiple non-continuous paths that compromise fabrication time, shape fidelity, and structural integrity, particularly for thin-walled lattice structures. To address this issue, we introduce GIPPO (Graph-based, Iterative, Printing-Path Optimization), an open-source slicing platform that transforms complex lattice designs into optimized printing trajectories. Lattices are converted to graph networks to derive the optimal printing trajectories through a modified version of Prim's algorithm. The resulting paths are translated back to Euclidean coordinates and exported as a ready-to-use G-code. We validated GIPPO's performance against conventional slicing software across six architected lattice geometries fabricated from thermoplastic polyurethane using fused deposition modeling. GIPPO-optimized constructs demonstrated superior shape fidelity with reduced local thickness deviations, no missing struts, and minimized excess material deposition compared to conventionally printed controls. Mechanical testing revealed that printing path optimization directly influences both uniaxial and out-of-plane mechanical responses, with different optimization strategies yielding distinct performance characteristics suited to specific loading conditions. Moreover, the platform accommodates both planar and non-planar printing geometries and enables fabrication of objects with varying infill patterns per layer. Our work addresses critical limitations in commercial slicing software and opens new opportunities for high-fidelity fabrication of complex architected materials.</description>

      <title>A Financial Brain Scan of the LLM</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.21285</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.21285v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Emerging techniques in computer science make it possible to "brain scan" large language models (LLMs), identify the plain-English concepts that guide their reasoning, and steer them while holding other factors constant. We show that this approach can map LLM-generated economic forecasts to concepts such as sentiment, technical analysis, and timing, and compute their relative importance without reducing performance. We also show that models can be steered to be more or less risk-averse, optimistic, or pessimistic, which allows researchers to correct or simulate biases. The method is transparent, lightweight, and replicable for empirical research in the social sciences.</description>

      <title>MicroLabVR: Interactive 3D Visualization of Simulated Spatiotemporal Microbiome Data in Virtual Reality</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.21736</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.21736v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Microbiomes are a vital part of the human body, engaging in tasks like food digestion and immune defense. Their structure and function must be understood in order to promote host health and facilitate swift recovery during disease. Due to the difficulties in experimentally studying these systems in situ, more research is being conducted in the field of mathematical modeling. Visualizing spatiotemporal data is challenging, and current tools that simulate microbial communities' spatial and temporal development often only provide limited functionalities, often requiring expert knowledge to generate useful results. To overcome these limitations, we provide a user-friendly tool to interactively explore spatiotemporal simulation data, called MicroLabVR, which transfers spatial data into virtual reality (VR) while following guidelines to enhance user experience (UX). With MicroLabVR, users can import CSV datasets containing population growth, substance concentration development, and metabolic flux distribution data. The implemented visualization methods allow users to evaluate the dataset in a VR environment interactively. MicroLabVR aims to improve data analysis for the user by allowing the exploration of microbiome data in their spatial context.</description>

      <title>Equivariant Hypergraph Diffusion for Crystal Structure Prediction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.18850</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.18850v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Crystal Structure Prediction (CSP) remains a fundamental challenge with significant implications for the development of new materials and the advancement of various scientific disciplines. Recent developments have shown that generative models, particularly diffusion models, hold great promise for CSP. However, traditional graph-based representations, where atomic bonds are modeled as pairwise graph edges, fail to fully capture the intricate high-order interactions essential for accurately representing crystal structures. In this work, we propose a novel approach that utilizes hypergraphs to represent crystal structures, providing a more expressive abstraction for modeling multi-way atomic interactions. By adopting hypergraphs, we can effectively capture complex high-order relationships and symmetries, such as permutation and periodic translation invariance, which are crucial for characterizing crystal structures. In this work, we propose the \textbf{E}quivariant \textbf{H}ypergraph \textbf{Diff}usion Model (\textbf{EH-Diff}), a generative model designed to take advantage of the symmetry-preserving properties of hypergraphs. EH-Diff exploits these features to offer an efficient and accurate method for predicting crystal structures with a strong theoretical justification to preserve invariance properties. Empirically, we conduct extensive experiments on four benchmark datasets, and the results demonstrate that EH-Diff outperforms state-of-the-art CSP methods with only one sample.</description>

      <title>Simulating many-engine spacecraft: Exceeding 1 quadrillion degrees of freedom via information geometric regularization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.07392</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.07392v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present an optimized implementation of the recently proposed information geometric regularization (IGR) for unprecedented scale simulation of compressible fluid flows applied to multi-engine spacecraft boosters. We improve upon state-of-the-art computational fluid dynamics (CFD) techniques along computational cost, memory footprint, and energy-to-solution metrics. Unified memory on coupled CPU--GPU or APU platforms increases problem size with negligible overhead. Mixed half/single-precision storage and computation on well-conditioned numerics is used. We simulate flow at 200 trillion grid points and 1 quadrillion degrees of freedom, exceeding the current record by a factor of 20. A factor of 4 wall-time speedup is achieved over optimized baselines. Ideal weak scaling is seen on OLCF Frontier, LLNL El Capitan, and CSCS Alps using the full systems. Strong scaling is near ideal at extreme conditions, including 80% efficiency on CSCS Alps with an 8-node baseline and stretching to the full system.</description>
