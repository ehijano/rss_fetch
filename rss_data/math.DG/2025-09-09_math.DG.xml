      <title>Linear stability of the blowdown Ricci shrinker in 4D</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.05470</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.05470v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We prove that the four-dimensional blowdown shrinking Ricci soliton constructed by Feldman-Ilmanen-Knopf is linearly stable in the sense of Cao-Hamilton-Ilmanen. This provides the first known example of a non-cylindrical linearly stable shrinking Ricci soliton. This offers new insights into the topological behavior of generic solutions to the Ricci flow in four dimensions: on top of reversing connected sums and handle surgeries, they should also undo complex blow-ups.
  The proof starts from an explicit description of the metric and develops a tensor harmonic analysis, adapted to its weighted Lichnerowicz Laplacian and based on its $U(2)$-invariance. It further exploits the K\"ahler structure of the blowdown shrinking soliton and insights from four-dimensional selfduality. The main difficulty is that the weighted Lichnerowicz Laplacian of the soliton admits a $9$-dimensional set of eigentensors associated with nonnegative eigenvalues. We show that they correspond to the Ricci tensor and gauge transformations.</description>

      <title>Regularity of harmonic maps into Teichm\"uller space</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.05506</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.05506v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We prove a regularity theorem for harmonic maps into Teichm\"uller space. More specifically, if $u$ is a harmonic map from a Riemannian domain to the metric completion of Teichm\"uller space with respect to the Weil-Petersson metric, and the image of $u$ intersects a stratum of the augmented Teichm\"uller space, then $u$ is entirely contained in this stratum. This extends Wolpert's result on the geodesic convexity of the augmented Teichm\"uller space to higher dimensions and generalizes the regularity result of Daskalopoulos and Mese by showing that the singular set of $u$ is empty.</description>

      <title>A generalized Cheeger inequality and the Steklov Problem on finite graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.05667</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.05667v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We prove generalized Cheeger inequalities for eigenvalues of Laplacians for reversible Markov chains. Then we apply Hassannezhad and Miclo's convergence result to obtain Jammes Cheeger inequalities for Steklov eigenvalues. In particular, we get a sharp estimate for the first non-trivial Steklov eigenvalue via Escobar Cheeger constant. At the end, we extend Hassannezhad and Miclo's convergence result to non-reversible Markov chains via a different method based on resolvent convergence, answering one of their questions.</description>

      <title>A note on a diffeomorphism criterion via long-time Ricci flow</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.05802</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.05802v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this note, we give a diffeomorphism (to $\mathbb{R}^n$) criterion via long-time Ricci flow and show some applications. In particular, we provide an affirmative answer that the conclusion in [Manifolds with small curvature concentration, Ann. PDE, 2024] by Chan, Lee and the first named author and [Removing scalar curvature assumption for Ricci flow smoothing, Bull. Lond. Math. Soc., 2025] by A. Martens about manifolds with small curvature concentration can be improved to diffeomorphism in dimension $4$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2509.05912v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We determine the polar and the maximal antipodal set $P$ for the outer 3-symmetric space $\mathbb{S}^7 \times \mathbb{S}^7 = \mathrm{Spin}_8/G_2$ where the 3-symmetric structure is given by the triality automorphism $\tau$ on $\mathrm{Spin}_8$. It turns out that $P$ has three elements. The 3-symmetric structure extends to a (non-abelian) $S_3$-structure which we also investigate.</description>

      <title>Classification of biharmonic Riemannian submersions from manifolds with constant sectional curvature</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.05939</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.05939v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In 2011, Wang and Ou (Math. Z. 269:917-925, 2011) showed that any biharmonic Riemannian submersion from a 3-dimensional Riemannian manifold with constant sectional curvature to a surface is harmonic. In this paper, we generalize the 3-dimensional setting to arbitrary dimensions. By constructing an adapted orthonormal frame, we simplify the biharmonic equation for Riemannian submersions and analyze the curvature properties of Riemannian manifolds with constant sectional curvature. As a result, we prove that a Riemannian submersion from an $(n+1)$-dimensional Riemannian manifold with constant sectional curvature to an $n$-dimensional Riemannian manifold is biharmonic if and only if it is harmonic.</description>

      <title>Degeneration of Riemann surfaces and small eigenvalues of the Laplacian</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.06151</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.06151v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: For a one-parameter degeneration of compact Riemann surfaces endowed with the K\"ahler metric induced from the K\"ahler metric on the total space of the family, we determine the exact magnitude of the small eigenvalues of the Laplacian as a function on the parameter space, under the assumption that the singular fiber is reduced. The novelty in our approach is that we compute the asymptotic behavior of certain difference of (logarithm of) analytic torsions in the degeneration in two ways. On the one hand, via heat kernel estimates, it is shown that the leading asymptotic is determined by the product of the small eigenvalues. On the other hand, using Quillen metrics, the leading asymptotic is connected with the period integrals, which we explicitly evaluate.</description>

      <title>The quantitative behavior of $\alpha$-Yang-Mills-Higgs fields on surfaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.06380</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.06380v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the blow-up behavior of $\alpha$-Yang--Mills--Higgs ($\alpha$-YMH) fields over closed Riemannian surfaces with the target fiber $F = S^{K-1} \subset \mathbb{R}^K$ being the round sphere, focusing on the establishment of the $\alpha$-energy identity and the no-neck property during the bubbling process. A central innovation is the identification of a hidden Jacobian structure through Hodge decomposition and a new conservation law. Furthermore, we derive a Pohozaev-type identity for $\alpha$-YMH fields, which enables refined control of the energy density. Together, these advances ensure the validity of the $\alpha$-energy identity as $\alpha \to 1$. Our analysis further sharpens the Lorentz space estimates from the $L^{2,\infty}$ to the optimal $L^{2,1}$ scale, ultimately yielding the no-neck property in the blow-up regime. These results provide a unified and quantitative framework for understanding singularity formation in variational gauge theories.</description>

      <title>Diffusion-Shock PDEs for Deep Learning on Position-Orientation Space</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.06405</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.06405v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We extend Regularised Diffusion-Shock (RDS) filtering from Euclidean space R2 [1] to position-orientation space $\mathbb{M}_2 \cong \mathbb{R}^2 \times S^1$. This has numerous advantages, e.g. making it possible to enhance and inpaint crossing structures, since they become disentangled when lifted to $\mathbb{M}_2$. We create a version of the algorithm using gauge frames to mitigate issues caused by lifting to a finite number of orientations. This leads us to study generalisations of diffusion, since the gauge frame diffusion is not generated by the Laplace-Beltrami operator. RDS filtering compares favourably to existing techniques such as Total Roto-Translational Variation (TR-TV) flow, NLM, and BM3D when denoising images with crossing structures, particularly if they are segmented. Furthermore, we see that $\mathbb{M}_2$ RDS inpainting is indeed able to restore crossing structures, unlike $\mathbb{R}^2$ RDS inpainting. In addition to the contributions of our SSVM submission "Diffusion-Shock Filtering on the Space of Positions and Orientations", in this extended work we provide new theorical results and automate RDS filtering by integrating it into a geometric deep learning framework. Regarding our theoretical contributions, we prove that our generalised diffusions are still well-posed, smoothing, and analytic. We developed an RDS filtering PDE layer for the PDE-CNN and PDE-G-CNN deep learning frameworks, using a novel gating mechanism. We show that these new RDS PDE layers can be beneficial in various impainting and denoising tasks.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2509.06441v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We prove that the spacetime Brakke flow constructed by Buet et al. is non-trivial as long as the initial varifold is a union of boundaries of domains of finite perimeter. In the codimension 1 setting, we show that, starting from a smooth boundary, the support of the mass measure of the spacetime Brakke flow coincides with the support of the classical mean curvature flow.</description>

      <title>Hausdorff dimension and failure of synthetic curvature bounds in the sub-Lorentzian Heisenberg group</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.06563</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.06563v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the geodesics, Hausdorff dimension, and curvature bounds of the sub-Lorentzian Heisenberg group. Through an elementary variational approach, we provide a new proof of the structure of its maximizing geodesics, showing that they are lifts of hyperbolae coming from a Lorentzian isoperimetric problem in the Minkowski plane. We prove that the Lorentzian Hausdorff dimension of the space is $4$ and that the corresponding measure coincides with the Haar measure. We further establish a novel result in the spirit of the Ball-Box theorem, giving a uniform estimate of causal diamonds by anisotropic boxes. Finally, we show that the Heisenberg group satisfies neither the timelike curvature-dimension condition $\mathsf{TCD}(K,N)$ nor the timelike measure contraction property $\mathsf{TMCP}(K,N)$ for any values of the parameters $K$ and $N$, in sharp contrast with its sub-Riemannian counterpart.</description>

      <title>Hodge theoretic results for nearly K\"ahler manifolds in all dimensions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.06664</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.06664v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We generalize to nearly K\"ahler manifolds of arbitrary dimensions most of the Hodge-theoretic results for nearly K\"ahler $6$-manifolds that were established by Verbitsky. In particular, for a compact nearly K\"ahler manifold of any dimension, the (appropriately defined) Hodge numbers are related to the Betti numbers in the same way as on a compact K\"ahler manifold. In the $6$-dimensional case, Verbitsky was able to say slightly more using the induced $\mathrm{SU}(3)$ structure. We discuss potential extensions of this to twistor spaces over positive scalar curvature quaternionic-K\"ahler manifolds, which are a particular class of $(4n+2)$-dimensional nearly K\"ahler manifolds equipped with a special $\mathrm{SU}(n) \! \cdot \! \mathrm{U}(1)$ structure.</description>

      <title>The linearized translator equation and applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.06667</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.06667v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we consider the linearized translator equation $L_\phi u=f$, around entire convex translators $M=\textrm{graph}(\phi)\subset\mathbb{R}^4$, i.e. in the first dimension where the Bernstein property fails. Here, $L_\phi u=\mathrm{div} (a_\phi D u)+ b_\phi\cdot Du$ is a mean curvature type elliptic operator, whose coefficients degenerate as the slope tends to infinity. We derive two fundamental barrier estimates, specifically an upper-lower estimate and an inner-outer estimate, which allow to propagate $L^\infty$-control between different regions. Packaging these and further estimates together we then develop a Fredholm theory for $L_\phi$ between carefully designed weighted function spaces. Combined with Lyapunov-Schmidt reduction we infer that the space $\mathcal{S}$ of noncollapsed translators in $\mathbb{R}^4$ is a finite dimensional analytic variety and that the tip-curvature map $\kappa:\mathcal{S}\to\mathbb{R}$ is analytic. Together with the main result from our prior paper (Camb. J. Math. '23) this allows us to complete the classification of noncollapsed translators in $\mathbb{R}^4$. In particular, we conclude that the one-parameter family of translators constructed by Hoffman-Ilmanen-Martin-White is uniquely determined by the smallest principal curvature at the tip.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2509.06748v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce an alternative formalization of curved spaces in which the concept of a pointwise affine space, as defined here, replaces that of a manifold. New or modified definitions of familiar notions from differential geometry such as connections, torsion, Riemann curvature, vector fields and differentiation of vector fields are presented, and examples of applications of the resulting framework are given. In general, the notions and results considered receive simpler and more transparent forms than in conventional approaches.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2509.05707v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the deformation behavior of compact hyperbolic complex manifolds. Let $\pi:\mathcal{X}\rightarrow \Delta$ be a smooth family of compact complex manifolds over the unit disk in $\mathbb{C}$, and $H$ a compact hyperbolic complex manifold. Then the $H$-locus $\{t\in\Delta: X_t\cong H\}$ is either at most a discrete subset of $\Delta$ or the whole $\Delta$. For a smooth family over a compact Riemann surface $Y$, its $H$-locus is either at most finite or the whole $Y$. Furthermore, if $Y$ is isomorphic to $\mathbb{P}^1$ or an elliptic curve, then we conjecture that the $H$-locus is empty or the whole $Y$.</description>

Abstract: We find a relation between the ADM mass and a generalized Komar energy in asymptotically-flat spacetime. We do not need to assume the existence of either a Killing or even asymptotically-Killing vector field. Instead, our generalized Komar energy is constructed from the normal evolution vector (the lapse function times the future-directed unit normal to the spacelike hypersurfaces on which the ADM mass is measured). We find equality between the ADM mass and this generalized Komar energy even for dynamical asymptotically-flat spacetimes provided the 3-dimensional Einstein tensor drops off quickly enough at spatial infinity, in particular, whenever ${}^{(3)}G_{ij}=o(r^{-3})$. No additional assumptions are required for equality. As this generalized energy is fully covariant, it may provide a powerful tool for analyzing energy content in dynamical spacetimes containing compact objects.</description>

Abstract: We study the long-time existence and asymptotic behavior of a class of anisotropic capillary Gauss curvature flows. As an application, we provide a flow approach to the existence of smooth solutions to the capillary even $L_p$ Minkowski problem in the Euclidean half-space for all $p \in (-n-1, \infty)$ and capillary $L_p$ Minkowski problem for $p &gt; n+1$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2509.06811v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Graev introduced the construction of a convex polytope associated with a symmetric ternary relation. He showed that the number of left-invariant Einstein metrics on a homogeneous space under some conditions is no more than the normalized volume of certain polytope of such form. It happens that the construction of a cosmological polytope introduced by Arkani-Hamed, Benincasa and Postnikov for computation of the wave function of the Universe is the special case of the Graev construction. The paper is devoted to unification of these two theories from combinatorial perspective.</description>

Abstract: We consider the linearised vacuum Einstein equations around a Kerr exterior solution and present a scheme to prove elliptic $L^2(\mathbb{S}^2)$-estimates for the linearised curvature quantities in the equations. The scheme employs the linearised system of equations derived in the first author's doctoral thesis and applies to the full sub-extremal range of Kerr parameters $0\leq |a|&lt;M$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2108.07560v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: To classify a group action on a manifold, the data associated with the fixed point set is essential. In this paper, we classify the fixed point data of a circle action on a 6-dimensional compact connected oriented manifold with isolated fixed points, where the fixed point data consists of the collection of signs and weights at the fixed points. We show that this fixed point data can be reduced to the empty collection by performing a sequence of operations. Specifically, we prove that one can successively take equivariant connected sums at fixed points with $S^6$, $\mathbb{CP}^3$, or 6-dimensional analogues of the Hirzebruch surfaces (and their oppositely oriented counterparts), resulting in a fixed-point-free action on a compact connected oriented 6-manifold.</description>

      <title>Reduction principles for proper actions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2212.06715v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Let $G$ be a Lie group acting properly on a smooth manifold $M$. If $M/G$ is connected, then we exhibit some simple and basic constructions for proper actions. In particular, we prove that the reduction principle in compact transformation groups holds for proper actions. As an application, we prove that a reduction principle holds for polar actions and for the integral invariant for isometric actions of Lie groups, called copolarity, which measures how far from being polar the action is. We also investigate symplectic actions. Hence we assume that $(M,\omega)$ is a symplectic manifold and the $G$ action on $M$ preserves $\omega$. %If $G$ is Abelian, we generalize results proved in \cite{Ben,DP1,DP2} The main result is the Equivalence Theorem for coisotropic actions, generalizing \cite[Theorem 3 p.267]{HW}. Finally, we completely characterize asystatic actions generalizing results proved in \cite{pg}.</description>

      <title>Variations of metric that preserve a Riemannian submersion and geometry of its fibers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.00969</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.00969v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: On the domain of a Riemannian submersion, we consider variations (i.e., smooth one-parameter families) of Riemannian metrics, for which the submersion is Riemannian and which all keep the metric induced on its fibers fixed. We obtain a formula for the variation of the second fundamental form of the fibers with respect to such changes of metric. We find a choice of parameters defining the variations, that allows to easily formulate the necessary and sufficient conditions for preserving particular geometry of the fibers, i.e., keeping them totally geodesic, totally umbilical, or minimal. These conditions are related to the existence of Killing, conformal Killing and divergence-free vector fields on the fibers. We find conditions for metric to be a critical point of integrated squared norms of the mean curvature and the second fundamental form of the fibers, with respect to the considered variations, and prove that at all critical points of these functionals the second variation is non-negative. We also examine variations of sectional curvatures of planes defined by the horizontal lifts of vectors from the image of the submersion. In particular, we find that some variations preserving Riemannian submersions with totally geodesic fibers can make vertizontal curvatures not constant on the fibers.</description>

      <title>On Surfaces in R^n via Gauss Map, Caustics, Duality and Pseudo Euclidean Geometry of Quadratic Forms</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.14104v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We get new results (and rederive some know ones) on smooth surfaces in $\mathbb{R}^n$ by unifying several view points into a coherent general view. Namely, we show and use new relations of the evolute (caustic) with the curvature ellipse, the Gauss map and the pseudo-Euclidean geometry of the $3$-space of quadratic forms on $\mathbb{R}^2$. A key result (Th.3.3.1): for a surface $M$ in $\mathbb{R}^n$ the intersection of its caustic with the normal space $N_pM$ is the polar dual hypersurface (in $N_pM$) of the curvature ellipse at $p$. Moreover, all local objects $X$ (cf. the invariants and their relations) have a "paired" version $X^*$ (with ${X^*}^*=X$) -- this provides new results on the original objects.</description>

      <title>A Riemannian Characterization of Compact Affine Manifolds with Parallel Volume</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.14778</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.14778v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We establish that any affine manifold $(M,\nabla)$ endowed with a parallel volume form $\omega,$ admits, in any conformal class of Riemannian metrics, a representative $H$ for which $\nabla$ is the Levi-Civita connection. This provides a constructive proof that such manifolds are necessarily complete, generalizing the "if" direction of Markus' conjecture \cite{markus1962}. Moreover, our result demonstrates that these structures are intrinsically Riemannian-flat, a stronger conclusion than the affine completeness asserted by Markus. The metric $H$ arises naturally from the Hessian of volume-normalized distance functions and is shown to be globally smooth and $\nabla$-parallel, extending results of \cite{goldman1982} and \cite{benzecri1955} to higher dimensions with additional geometric structure. The construction proceeds through three technically novel steps: (1) local parallel metric normalization using the given volume form, (2) explicit Hessian calculations in adapted coordinates, and (3) gluing via affine transition maps that preserve the volumetric geometry. This approach reveals an unexpected rigidity in flat affine manifolds with compatible volume that goes beyond the topological constraints studied in \cite{fried1980}.</description>

      <title>The Hasse Principle for Geometric Variational Problems: An Illustration via Area-minimizing Submanifolds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.21045</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.21045v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The Hasse principle in number theory states that information about integral solutions to Diophantine equations can be pieced together from real solutions and solutions modulo prime powers. We show that the Hasse principle holds for area-minimizing submanifolds: information about area-minimizing submanifolds in integral homology can be fully recovered from those in real homology and mod $n$ homology for all $n\in \mathbb{Z}_{\ge 2}.$ As a consequence we derive several surprising conclusions, including: area-minimizing submanifolds in mod $n$ homology are asymptotically much smoother than expected and area-minimizing submanifolds are not generically calibrated. We conjecture that the Hasse principle holds for all geometric variational problems that can be formulated on chain space over different coeffiicients, e.g., Almgren-Pitts min-max, mean curvature flow, Song's spherical Plateau problem, minimizers of elliptic and other general functionals, etc.</description>

Abstract: In this paper, we consider the Minkowski problem associated with the solution to the anisotropic $p$-Laplacian (or Finsler $p$-Laplacian) equation, namely, the Minkowski problem of anisotropic $p$-torsional rigidity. The sufficient and necessary conditions for the existence of a solution to the Minkowski problem of anisotropic $p$-torsional rigidity are presented. Meanwhile, the existence of a solution to the log-Minkowski problem of anisotropic $p$-torsional rigidity without symmetry assumptions is solved.</description>

Abstract: A new notion of quasilocal mass is defined for generic, compact, two dimensional, spacelike surfaces in four dimensional spacetimes with negative cosmological constant. The definition is spinorial and based on work for vanishing cosmological constant by Penrose and Dougan &amp; Mason. Furthermore, this mass is non-negative, equal to the Misner-Sharp mass in spherical symmetry, equal to zero for every generic surface in AdS, has an appropriate form for gravity linearised about AdS and has an appropriate limit for large spheres in asymptotically AdS spacetimes.</description>

      <title>Levi Flat Structures via Structure Sheaves: Differential Complexes, Convexity, and Global Solvability</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.18341v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper investigates Levi flat structures from the perspective of structure sheaves. We employ formal integrability to construct a class of differential complexes, thereby providing a resolution for the structure sheaf of a basic vector bundle. Drawing inspiration from Morse theory and Grauert's convexity, we introduce a notion of convexity that fully exploits Levi flatness, which ensures the global exactness of the differential complex and demonstrates Sobolev regularity in the compact case. As applications, we establish the global solvability of the Treves complex, and derive results on singular cohomology, as well as the extension problem for canonical forms in the elliptic case.</description>
