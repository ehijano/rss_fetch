      <title>Simultaneous Music Separation and Generation Using Multi-Track Latent Diffusion Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.12346</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.12346v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Diffusion models have recently shown strong potential in both music generation and music source separation tasks. Although in early stages, a trend is emerging towards integrating these tasks into a single framework, as both involve generating musically aligned parts and can be seen as facets of the same generative process. In this work, we introduce a latent diffusion-based multi-track generation model capable of both source separation and multi-track music synthesis by learning the joint probability distribution of tracks sharing a musical context. Our model also enables arrangement generation by creating any subset of tracks given the others. We trained our model on the Slakh2100 dataset, compared it with an existing simultaneous generation and separation model, and observed significant improvements across objective metrics for source separation, music, and arrangement generation tasks. Sound examples are available at https://msg-ld.github.io/.</description>

      <title>Channel-Aware Domain-Adaptive Generative Adversarial Network for Robust Speech Recognition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.12386</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.12386v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: While pre-trained automatic speech recognition (ASR) systems demonstrate impressive performance on matched domains, their performance often degrades when confronted with channel mismatch stemming from unseen recording environments and conditions. To mitigate this issue, we propose a novel channel-aware data simulation method for robust ASR training. Our method harnesses the synergistic power of channel-extractive techniques and generative adversarial networks (GANs). We first train a channel encoder capable of extracting embeddings from arbitrary audio. On top of this, channel embeddings are extracted using a minimal amount of target-domain data and used to guide a GAN-based speech synthesizer. This synthesizer generates speech that faithfully preserves the phonetic content of the input while mimicking the channel characteristics of the target domain. We evaluate our method on the challenging Hakka Across Taiwan (HAT) and Taiwanese Across Taiwan (TAT) corpora, achieving relative character error rate (CER) reductions of 20.02% and 9.64%, respectively, compared to the baselines. These results highlight the efficacy of our channel-aware data simulation method for bridging the gap between source- and target-domain acoustics.</description>

      <title>A Lightweight and Real-Time Binaural Speech Enhancement Model with Spatial Cues Preservation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.12444</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.12444v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Binaural speech enhancement (BSE) aims to jointly improve the speech quality and intelligibility of noisy signals received by hearing devices and preserve the spatial cues of the target for natural listening. Existing methods often suffer from the compromise between noise reduction (NR) capacity and spatial cues preservation (SCP) accuracy and a high computational demand in complex acoustic scenes. In this work, we present a learning-based lightweight binaural complex convolutional network (LBCCN), which excels in NR by filtering low-frequency bands and keeping the rest. Additionally, our approach explicitly incorporates the estimation of interchannel relative acoustic transfer function to ensure the spatial cues fidelity and speech clarity. Results show that the proposed LBCCN can achieve a comparable NR performance to state-of-the-art methods under various noise conditions, but with a much lower computational cost and a better SCP. The reproducible code and audio examples are available at https://github.com/jywanng/LBCCN.</description>

      <title>AudioEditor: A Training-Free Diffusion-Based Audio Editing Framework</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.12466</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.12466v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Diffusion-based text-to-audio (TTA) generation has made substantial progress, leveraging latent diffusion model (LDM) to produce high-quality, diverse and instruction-relevant audios. However, beyond generation, the task of audio editing remains equally important but has received comparatively little attention. Audio editing tasks face two primary challenges: executing precise edits and preserving the unedited sections. While workflows based on LDMs have effectively addressed these challenges in the field of image processing, similar approaches have been scarcely applied to audio editing. In this paper, we introduce AudioEditor, a training-free audio editing framework built on the pretrained diffusion-based TTA model. AudioEditor incorporates Null-text Inversion and EOT-suppression methods, enabling the model to preserve original audio features while executing accurate edits. Comprehensive objective and subjective experiments validate the effectiveness of AudioEditor in delivering high-quality audio edits. Code and demo can be found at https://github.com/NKU-HLT/AudioEditor.</description>

      <title>ViolinDiff: Enhancing Expressive Violin Synthesis with Pitch Bend Conditioning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.12477</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.12477v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Modeling the natural contour of fundamental frequency (F0) plays a critical role in music audio synthesis. However, transcribing and managing multiple F0 contours in polyphonic music is challenging, and explicit F0 contour modeling has not yet been explored for polyphonic instrumental synthesis. In this paper, we present ViolinDiff, a two-stage diffusion-based synthesis framework. For a given violin MIDI file, the first stage estimates the F0 contour as pitch bend information, and the second stage generates mel spectrogram incorporating these expressive details. The quantitative metrics and listening test results show that the proposed model generates more realistic violin sounds than the model without explicit pitch bend modeling. Audio samples are available online: daewoung.github.io/ViolinDiff-Demo.</description>

      <title>SoundBeam meets M2D: Target Sound Extraction with Audio Foundation Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.12528</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.12528v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Target sound extraction (TSE) consists of isolating a desired sound from a mixture of arbitrary sounds using clues to identify it. A TSE system requires solving two problems at once, identifying the target source and extracting the target signal from the mixture. For increased practicability, the same system should work with various types of sound. The duality of the problem and the wide variety of sounds make it challenging to train a powerful TSE system from scratch. In this paper, to tackle this problem, we explore using a pre-trained audio foundation model that can provide rich feature representations of sounds within a TSE system. We chose the masked-modeling duo (M2D) foundation model, which appears especially suited for the TSE task, as it is trained using a dual objective consisting of sound-label predictions and improved masked prediction. These objectives are related to sound identification and the signal extraction problems of TSE. We propose a new TSE system that integrates the feature representation from M2D into SoundBeam, which is a strong TSE system that can exploit both target sound class labels and pre-recorded enrollments (or audio queries) as clues. We show experimentally that using M2D can increase extraction performance, especially when employing enrollment clues.</description>

      <title>FruitsMusic: A Real-World Corpus of Japanese Idol-Group Songs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.12549</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.12549v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study presents FruitsMusic, a metadata corpus of Japanese idol-group songs in the real world, precisely annotated with who sings what and when. Japanese idol-group songs, vital to Japanese pop culture, feature a unique vocal arrangement style, where songs are divided into several segments, and a specific individual or multiple singers are assigned to each segment. To enhance singer diarization methods for recognizing such structures, we constructed FruitsMusic as a resource using 40 music videos of Japanese idol groups from YouTube. The corpus includes detailed annotations, covering songs across various genres, division and assignment styles, and groups ranging from 4 to 9 members. FruitsMusic also facilitates the development of various music information retrieval techniques, such as lyrics transcription and singer identification, benefiting not only Japanese idol-group songs but also a wide range of songs featuring single or multiple singers from various cultures. This paper offers a comprehensive overview of FruitsMusic, including its creation methodology and unique characteristics compared to conversational speech. Additionally, this paper evaluates the efficacy of current methods for singer embedding extraction and diarization in challenging real-world conditions using FruitsMusic. Furthermore, this paper examines potential improvements in automatic diarization performance through evaluating human performance.</description>

      <title>Exploring bat song syllable representations in self-supervised audio encoders</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.12634</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.12634v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: How well can deep learning models trained on human-generated sounds distinguish between another species' vocalization types? We analyze the encoding of bat song syllables in several self-supervised audio encoders, and find that models pre-trained on human speech generate the most distinctive representations of different syllable types. These findings form first steps towards the application of cross-species transfer learning in bat bioacoustics, as well as an improved understanding of out-of-distribution signal processing in audio encoder models.</description>

      <title>$\text{M}^\text{6}(\text{GPT})^\text{3}$: Generating Multitrack Modifiable Multi-Minute MIDI Music from Text using Genetic algorithms, Probabilistic methods and GPT Models in any Progression and Time signature</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.12638</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.12638v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This work introduces the $\text{M}^\text{6}(\text{GPT})^\text{3}$ Composer system, capable of generating complete, multi-minute musical compositions with complex structures in any time signature, in the MIDI domain from input descriptions in natural language. The system utilizes an autoregressive transformer language model to map natural language prompts to composition parameters in JSON format. The defined structure includes time signature, scales, chord progressions, and valence-arousal values, from which accompaniment, melody, bass, motif, and percussion tracks are created. We propose a genetic algorithm for the generation of melodic elements. The algorithm incorporates mutations with musical significance and a fitness function based on normal distribution and predefined musical feature values. The values adaptively evolve, influenced by emotional parameters and distinct playing styles. The system for generating percussion in any time signature utilises probabilistic methods, including Markov chains. Through both human and objective evaluations, we demonstrate that our music generation approach outperforms baselines on specific, musically meaningful metrics, offering a valuable alternative to purely neural network-based systems.</description>

      <title>Enhancing Synthetic Training Data for Speech Commands: From ASR-Based Filtering to Domain Adaptation in SSL Latent Space</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.12745</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.12745v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The use of synthetic speech as data augmentation is gaining increasing popularity in fields such as automatic speech recognition and speech classification tasks. Despite novel text-to-speech systems with voice cloning capabilities, that allow the usage of a larger amount of voices based on short audio segments, it is known that these systems tend to hallucinate and oftentimes produce bad data that will most likely have a negative impact on the downstream task. In the present work, we conduct a set of experiments around zero-shot learning with synthetic speech data for the specific task of speech commands classification. Our results on the Google Speech Commands dataset show that a simple ASR-based filtering method can have a big impact in the quality of the generated data, translating to a better performance. Furthermore, despite the good quality of the generated speech data, we also show that synthetic and real speech can still be easily distinguishable when using self-supervised (WavLM) features, an aspect further explored with a CycleGAN to bridge the gap between the two types of speech material.</description>

      <title>Measuring Sound Symbolism in Audio-visual Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.12306</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.12306v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Audio-visual pre-trained models have gained substantial attention recently and demonstrated superior performance on various audio-visual tasks. This study investigates whether pre-trained audio-visual models demonstrate non-arbitrary associations between sounds and visual representations$\unicode{x2013}$known as sound symbolism$\unicode{x2013}$which is also observed in humans. We developed a specialized dataset with synthesized images and audio samples and assessed these models using a non-parametric approach in a zero-shot setting. Our findings reveal a significant correlation between the models' outputs and established patterns of sound symbolism, particularly in models trained on speech data. These results suggest that such models can capture sound-meaning connections akin to human language processing, providing insights into both cognitive architectures and machine learning strategies.</description>

      <title>Large Language Models Are Strong Audio-Visual Speech Recognition Learners</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.12319</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.12319v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have recently become a focal point of research due to their formidable multimodal understanding capabilities. For example, in the audio and speech domains, an LLM can be equipped with (automatic) speech recognition (ASR) abilities by just concatenating the audio tokens, computed with an audio encoder, and the text tokens to achieve state-of-the-art results. On the contrary, tasks like visual and audio-visual speech recognition (VSR/AVSR), which also exploit noise-invariant lip movement information, have received little or no attention. To bridge this gap, we propose Llama-AVSR, a new MLLM with strong audio-visual speech recognition capabilities. It leverages pre-trained audio and video encoders to produce modality-specific tokens which, together with the text tokens, are processed by a pre-trained LLM (e.g., Llama3.1-8B) to yield the resulting response in an auto-regressive fashion. Llama-AVSR requires a small number of trainable parameters as only modality-specific projectors and LoRA modules are trained whereas the multi-modal encoders and LLM are kept frozen. We evaluate our proposed approach on LRS3, the largest public AVSR benchmark, and we achieve new state-of-the-art results for the tasks of ASR and AVSR with a WER of 0.81% and 0.77%, respectively. To bolster our results, we investigate the key factors that underpin the effectiveness of Llama-AVSR: the choice of the pre-trained encoders and LLM, the efficient integration of LoRA modules, and the optimal performance-efficiency trade-off obtained via modality-aware compression rates.</description>

      <title>META-CAT: Speaker-Informed Speech Embeddings via Meta Information Concatenation for Multi-talker ASR</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.12352</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.12352v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose a novel end-to-end multi-talker automatic speech recognition (ASR) framework that enables both multi-speaker (MS) ASR and target-speaker (TS) ASR. Our proposed model is trained in a fully end-to-end manner, incorporating speaker supervision from a pre-trained speaker diarization module. We introduce an intuitive yet effective method for masking ASR encoder activations using output from the speaker supervision module, a technique we term Meta-Cat (meta-information concatenation), that can be applied to both MS-ASR and TS-ASR. Our results demonstrate that the proposed architecture achieves competitive performance in both MS-ASR and TS-ASR tasks, without the need for traditional methods, such as neural mask estimation or masking at the audio or feature level. Furthermore, we demonstrate a glimpse of a unified dual-task model which can efficiently handle both MS-ASR and TS-ASR tasks. Thus, this work illustrates that a robust end-to-end multi-talker ASR framework can be implemented with a streamlined architecture, obviating the need for the complex speaker filtering mechanisms employed in previous studies.</description>

      <title>Robust Audiovisual Speech Recognition Models with Mixture-of-Experts</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.12370</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.12370v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Visual signals can enhance audiovisual speech recognition accuracy by providing additional contextual information. Given the complexity of visual signals, an audiovisual speech recognition model requires robust generalization capabilities across diverse video scenarios, presenting a significant challenge. In this paper, we introduce EVA, leveraging the mixture-of-Experts for audioVisual ASR to perform robust speech recognition for ``in-the-wild'' videos. Specifically, we first encode visual information into visual tokens sequence and map them into speech space by a lightweight projection. Then, we build EVA upon a robust pretrained speech recognition model, ensuring its generalization ability. Moreover, to incorporate visual information effectively, we inject visual information into the ASR model through a mixture-of-experts module. Experiments show our model achieves state-of-the-art results on three benchmarks, which demonstrates the generalization ability of EVA across diverse video domains.</description>

      <title>Disentangling Speakers in Multi-Talker Speech Recognition with Speaker-Aware CTC</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.12388</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.12388v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Multi-talker speech recognition (MTASR) faces unique challenges in disentangling and transcribing overlapping speech. To address these challenges, this paper investigates the role of Connectionist Temporal Classification (CTC) in speaker disentanglement when incorporated with Serialized Output Training (SOT) for MTASR. Our visualization reveals that CTC guides the encoder to represent different speakers in distinct temporal regions of acoustic embeddings. Leveraging this insight, we propose a novel Speaker-Aware CTC (SACTC) training objective, based on the Bayes risk CTC framework. SACTC is a tailored CTC variant for multi-talker scenarios, it explicitly models speaker disentanglement by constraining the encoder to represent different speakers' tokens at specific time frames. When integrated with SOT, the SOT-SACTC model consistently outperforms standard SOT-CTC across various degrees of speech overlap. Specifically, we observe relative word error rate reductions of 10% overall and 15% on low-overlap speech. This work represents an initial exploration of CTC-based enhancements for MTASR tasks, offering a new perspective on speaker disentanglement in multi-talker speech recognition.</description>

      <title>DeFT-Mamba: Universal Multichannel Sound Separation and Polyphonic Audio Classification</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.12413</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.12413v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper presents a framework for universal sound separation and polyphonic audio classification, addressing the challenges of separating and classifying individual sound sources in a multichannel mixture. The proposed framework, DeFT-Mamba, utilizes the dense frequency-time attentive network (DeFTAN) combined with Mamba to extract sound objects, capturing the local time-frequency relations through gated convolution block and the global time-frequency relations through position-wise Hybrid Mamba. DeFT-Mamba surpasses existing separation and classification networks by a large margin, particularly in complex scenarios involving in-class polyphony. Additionally, a classification-based source counting method is introduced to identify the presence of multiple sources, outperforming conventional threshold-based approaches. Separation refinement tuning is also proposed to improve performance further. The proposed framework is trained and tested on a multichannel universal sound separation dataset developed in this work, designed to mimic realistic environments with moving sources and varying onsets and offsets of polyphonic events.</description>

      <title>Multichannel-to-Multichannel Target Sound Extraction Using Direction and Timestamp Clues</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.12415</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.12415v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose a multichannel-to-multichannel target sound extraction (M2M-TSE) framework for separating multichannel target signals from a multichannel mixture of sound sources. Target sound extraction (TSE) isolates a specific target signal using user-provided clues, typically focusing on single-channel extraction with class labels or temporal activation maps. However, to preserve and utilize spatial information in multichannel audio signals, it is essential to extract multichannel signals of a target sound source. Moreover, the clue for extraction can also include spatial or temporal cues like direction-of-arrival (DoA) or timestamps of source activation. To address these challenges, we present an M2M framework that extracts a multichannel sound signal based on spatio-temporal clues. We demonstrate that our transformer-based architecture can successively accomplish the M2M-TSE task for multichannel signals synthesized from audio signals of diverse classes in different room environments. Furthermore, we show that the multichannel extraction task introduces sufficient inductive bias in the DNN, allowing it to directly handle DoA clues without utilizing hand-crafted spatial features.</description>

      <title>Speech-Declipping Transformer with Complex Spectrogram and Learnerble Temporal Features</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.12416</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.12416v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a transformer-based speech-declipping model that effectively recovers clipped signals across a wide range of input signal-to-distortion ratios (SDRs). While recent time-domain deep neural network (DNN)-based declippers have outperformed traditional handcrafted and spectrogram-based DNN approaches, they still struggle with low-SDR inputs. To address this, we incorporate a transformer-based architecture that operates in the time-frequency (TF) domain. The TF-transformer architecture has demonstrated remarkable performance in the speech enhancement task for low-SDR signals but cannot be optimal for the time-domain artifact like clipping. To overcome the limitations of spectrogram-based DNNs, we design an extra convolutional block that directly extracts temporal features from time-domain waveforms. The joint analysis of complex spectrogram and learned temporal features allows the model to improve performance on both high- and low-SDR inputs. Our approach also preserves the unclipped portions of the speech signal during processing, preventing degradation typically seen when only spectral information is used. In evaluations on the VoiceBank-DEMAND and DNS challenge datasets, the proposed model consistently outperformed state-of-the-art (SOTA) declipping models across various metrics, demonstrating its robustness and generalizability.</description>

      <title>AutoMode-ASR: Learning to Select ASR Systems for Better Quality and Cost</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.12476</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.12476v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present AutoMode-ASR, a novel framework that effectively integrates multiple ASR systems to enhance the overall transcription quality while optimizing cost. The idea is to train a decision model to select the optimal ASR system for each segment based solely on the audio input before running the systems. We achieve this by ensembling binary classifiers determining the preference between two systems. These classifiers are equipped with various features, such as audio embeddings, quality estimation, and signal properties. Additionally, we demonstrate how using a quality estimator can further improve performance with minimal cost increase. Experimental results show a relative reduction in WER of 16.2%, a cost saving of 65%, and a speed improvement of 75%, compared to using a single-best model for all segments. Our framework is compatible with commercial and open-source black-box ASR systems as it does not require changes in model codes.</description>

      <title>Geometry-Constrained EEG Channel Selection for Brain-Assisted Speech Enhancement</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.12520</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.12520v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Brain-assisted speech enhancement (BASE) aims to extract the target speaker in complex multi-talker scenarios using electroencephalogram (EEG) signals as an assistive modality, as the auditory attention of the listener can be decoded from electroneurographic signals of the brain. This facilitates a potential integration of EEG electrodes with listening devices to improve the speech intelligibility of hearing-impaired listeners, which was shown by the recently-proposed BASEN model. As in general the multichannel EEG signals are highly correlated and some are even irrelevant to listening, blindly incorporating all EEG channels would lead to a high economic and computational cost. In this work, we therefore propose a geometry-constrained EEG channel selection approach for BASE. We design a new weighted multi-dilation temporal convolutional network (WDTCN) as the backbone to replace the Conv-TasNet in BASEN. Given a raw channel set that is defined by the electrode geometry for feasible integration, we then propose a geometry-constrained convolutional regularization selection (GC-ConvRS) module for WD-TCN to find an informative EEG subset. Experimental results on a public dataset show the superiority of the proposed WD-TCN over BASEN. The GC-ConvRS can further refine the useful EEG subset subject to the geometry constraint, resulting in a better trade-off between performance and integration cost.</description>

      <title>Hidden in Plain Sound: Environmental Backdoor Poisoning Attacks on Whisper, and Mitigations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.12553</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.12553v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Thanks to the popularisation of transformer-based models, speech recognition (SR) is gaining traction in various application fields, such as industrial and robotics environments populated with mission-critical devices. While transformer-based SR can provide various benefits for simplifying human-machine interfacing, the research on the cybersecurity aspects of these models is lacklustre. In particular, concerning backdoor poisoning attacks. In this paper, we propose a new poisoning approach that maps different environmental trigger sounds to target phrases of different lengths, during the fine-tuning phase. We test our approach on Whisper, one of the most popular transformer-based SR model, showing that it is highly vulnerable to our attack, under several testing conditions. To mitigate the attack proposed in this paper, we investigate the use of Silero VAD, a state-of-the-art voice activity detection (VAD) model, as a defence mechanism. Our experiments show that it is possible to use VAD models to filter out malicious triggers and mitigate our attacks, with a varying degree of success, depending on the type of trigger sound and testing conditions.</description>

      <title>AudioComposer: Towards Fine-grained Audio Generation with Natural Language Descriptions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.12560</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.12560v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Current Text-to-audio (TTA) models mainly use coarse text descriptions as inputs to generate audio, which hinders models from generating audio with fine-grained control of content and style. Some studies try to improve the granularity by incorporating additional frame-level conditions or control networks. However, this usually leads to complex system design and difficulties due to the requirement for reference frame-level conditions. To address these challenges, we propose AudioComposer, a novel TTA generation framework that relies solely on natural language descriptions (NLDs) to provide both content specification and style control information. To further enhance audio generative modeling, we employ flow-based diffusion transformers with the cross-attention mechanism to incorporate text descriptions effectively into audio generation processes, which can not only simultaneously consider the content and style information in the text inputs, but also accelerate generation compared to other architectures. Furthermore, we propose a novel and comprehensive automatic data simulation pipeline to construct data with fine-grained text descriptions, which significantly alleviates the problem of data scarcity in the area. Experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of our framework using solely NLDs as inputs for content specification and style control. The generation quality and controllability surpass state-of-the-art TTA models, even with a smaller model size.</description>

      <title>NDVQ: Robust Neural Audio Codec with Normal Distribution-Based Vector Quantization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.12717</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.12717v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Built upon vector quantization (VQ), discrete audio codec models have achieved great success in audio compression and auto-regressive audio generation. However, existing models face substantial challenges in perceptual quality and signal distortion, especially when operating in extremely low bandwidth, rooted in the sensitivity of the VQ codebook to noise. This degradation poses significant challenges for several downstream tasks, such as codec-based speech synthesis. To address this issue, we propose a novel VQ method, Normal Distribution-based Vector Quantization (NDVQ), by introducing an explicit margin between the VQ codes via learning a variance. Specifically, our approach involves mapping the waveform to a latent space and quantizing it by selecting the most likely normal distribution, with each codebook entry representing a unique normal distribution defined by its mean and variance. Using these distribution-based VQ codec codes, a decoder reconstructs the input waveform. NDVQ is trained with additional distribution-related losses, alongside reconstruction and discrimination losses. Experiments demonstrate that NDVQ outperforms existing audio compression baselines, such as EnCodec, in terms of audio quality and zero-shot TTS, particularly in very low bandwidth scenarios.</description>

      <title>WaveletGPT: Wavelets Meet Large Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.12924</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.12924v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have ushered in a new wave of artificial intelligence advancements impacting every scientific field and discipline. They are trained on a simple objective: to predict the next token given the previous context. We live in a world where most of the data around us, e.g., text, audio, and music, has a multi-scale structure associated with it. This paper infuses LLMs with traditional signal processing ideas, namely wavelets, during pre-training to take advantage of the structure. Without adding \textbf{any extra parameters} to a GPT-style LLM architecture, we achieve the same pre-training performance almost twice as fast in text, raw audio, and symbolic music. This is achieved by imposing a structure on intermediate embeddings. When trained for the same number of training steps, we achieve significant gains in performance, which is comparable to pre-training a larger neural architecture. Our architecture allows every next token prediction access to intermediate embeddings at different temporal resolutions in every Transformer decoder block. This work will hopefully pave the way for incorporating multi-rate signal processing ideas into traditional LLM pre-training. Further, we showcase pushing model performance by improving internal structure instead of just going after scale.</description>

      <title>CLAIR-A: Leveraging Large Language Models to Judge Audio Captions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.12962</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.12962v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Automated Audio Captioning (AAC) task asks models to generate natural language descriptions of an audio input. Evaluating these machine-generated audio captions is a complex task that requires considering diverse factors, among them, auditory scene understanding, sound-object inference, temporal coherence, and the environmental context of the scene. While current methods focus on specific aspects, they often fail to provide an overall score that aligns well with human judgment. In this work, we propose CLAIR-A, a simple and flexible method that leverages the zero-shot capabilities of large language models (LLMs) to evaluate candidate audio captions by directly asking LLMs for a semantic distance score. In our evaluations, CLAIR-A better predicts human judgements of quality compared to traditional metrics, with a 5.8% relative accuracy improvement compared to the domain-specific FENSE metric and up to 11% over the best general-purpose measure on the Clotho-Eval dataset. Moreover, CLAIR-A offers more transparency by allowing the language model to explain the reasoning behind its scores, with these explanations rated up to 30% better by human evaluators than those provided by baseline methods. CLAIR-A is made publicly available at https://github.com/DavidMChan/clair-a.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2309.04156v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Speech synthesis systems powered by neural networks hold promise for multimedia production, but frequently face issues with producing expressive speech and seamless editing. In response, we present the Cross-Utterance Conditioned Variational Autoencoder speech synthesis (CUC-VAE S2) framework to enhance prosody and ensure natural speech generation. This framework leverages the powerful representational capabilities of pre-trained language models and the re-expression abilities of variational autoencoders (VAEs). The core component of the CUC-VAE S2 framework is the cross-utterance CVAE, which extracts acoustic, speaker, and textual features from surrounding sentences to generate context-sensitive prosodic features, more accurately emulating human prosody generation. We further propose two practical algorithms tailored for distinct speech synthesis applications: CUC-VAE TTS for text-to-speech and CUC-VAE SE for speech editing. The CUC-VAE TTS is a direct application of the framework, designed to generate audio with contextual prosody derived from surrounding texts. On the other hand, the CUC-VAE SE algorithm leverages real mel spectrogram sampling conditioned on contextual information, producing audio that closely mirrors real sound and thereby facilitating flexible speech editing based on text such as deletion, insertion, and replacement. Experimental results on the LibriTTS datasets demonstrate that our proposed models significantly enhance speech synthesis and editing, producing more natural and expressive speech.</description>

      <title>Flow-TSVAD: Target-Speaker Voice Activity Detection via Latent Flow Matching</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.04859v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Speaker diarization is typically considered a discriminative task, using discriminative approaches to produce fixed diarization results. In this paper, we explore the use of neural network-based generative methods for speaker diarization for the first time. We implement a Flow-Matching (FM) based generative algorithm within the sequence-to-sequence target speaker voice activity detection (Seq2Seq-TSVAD) diarization system. Our experiments reveal that applying the generative method directly to the original binary label sequence space of the TS-VAD output is ineffective. To address this issue, we propose mapping the binary label sequence into a dense latent space before applying the generative algorithm and our proposed Flow-TSVAD method outperforms the Seq2Seq-TSVAD system. Additionally, we observe that the FM algorithm converges rapidly during the inference stage, requiring only two inference steps to achieve promising results. As a generative model, Flow-TSVAD allows for sampling different diarization results by running the model multiple times. Moreover, ensembling results from various sampling instances further enhances diarization performance.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.09214v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We introduce Seed-Music, a suite of music generation systems capable of producing high-quality music with fine-grained style control. Our unified framework leverages both auto-regressive language modeling and diffusion approaches to support two key music creation workflows: controlled music generation and post-production editing.

      <title>Simulating Native Speaker Shadowing for Nonnative Speech Assessment with Latent Speech Representations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.11742</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.11742v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Evaluating speech intelligibility is a critical task in computer-aided language learning systems. Traditional methods often rely on word error rates (WER) provided by automatic speech recognition (ASR) as intelligibility scores. However, this approach has significant limitations due to notable differences between human speech recognition (HSR) and ASR. A promising alternative is to involve a native (L1) speaker in shadowing what nonnative (L2) speakers say. Breakdowns or mispronunciations in the L1 speaker's shadowing utterance can serve as indicators for assessing L2 speech intelligibility. In this study, we propose a speech generation system that simulates the L1 shadowing process using voice conversion (VC) techniques and latent speech representations. Our experimental results demonstrate that this method effectively replicates the L1 shadowing process, offering an innovative tool to evaluate L2 speech intelligibility. Notably, systems that utilize self-supervised speech representations (S3R) show a higher degree of similarity to real L1 shadowing utterances in both linguistic accuracy and naturalness.</description>

      <title>Neural Speech Coding for Real-time Communications using Constant Bitrate Scalar Quantization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.08417</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.08417v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Neural audio coding has emerged as a vivid research direction by promising good audio quality at very low bitrates unachievable by classical coding techniques. Here, end-to-end trainable autoencoder-like models represent the state of the art, where a discrete representation in the bottleneck of the autoencoder is learned. This allows for efficient transmission of the input audio signal. The learned discrete representation of neural codecs is typically generated by applying a quantizer to the output of the neural encoder. In almost all state-of-the-art neural audio coding approaches, this quantizer is realized as a Vector Quantizer (VQ) and a lot of effort has been spent to alleviate drawbacks of this quantization technique when used together with a neural audio coder. In this paper, we propose and analyze simple alternatives to VQ, which are based on projected Scalar Quantization (SQ). These quantization techniques do not need any additional losses, scheduling parameters or codebook storage thereby simplifying the training of neural audio codecs. For real-time speech communication applications, these neural codecs are required to operate at low complexity, low latency and at low bitrates. We address those challenges by proposing a new causal network architecture that is based on SQ and a Short-Time Fourier Transform (STFT) representation. The proposed method performs particularly well in the very low complexity and low bitrate regime.</description>

      <title>Sequential Editing for Lifelong Training of Speech Recognition Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.17935</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.17935v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) traditionally assumes known domains, but adding data from a new domain raises concerns about computational inefficiencies linked to retraining models on both existing and new domains. Fine-tuning solely on new domain risks Catastrophic Forgetting (CF). To address this, Lifelong Learning (LLL) algorithms have been proposed for ASR. Prior research has explored techniques such as Elastic Weight Consolidation, Knowledge Distillation, and Replay, all of which necessitate either additional parameters or access to prior domain data. We propose Sequential Model Editing as a novel method to continually learn new domains in ASR systems. Different than previous methods, our approach does not necessitate access to prior datasets or the introduction of extra parameters. Our study demonstrates up to 15% Word Error Rate Reduction (WERR) over fine-tuning baseline, and superior efficiency over other LLL techniques on CommonVoice English multi-accent dataset.</description>

      <title>Codec Does Matter: Exploring the Semantic Shortcoming of Codec for Audio Language Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.17175</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.17175v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recent advancements in audio generation have been significantly propelled by the capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs). The existing research on audio LLM has primarily focused on enhancing the architecture and scale of audio language models, as well as leveraging larger datasets, and generally, acoustic codecs, such as EnCodec, are used for audio tokenization. However, these codecs were originally designed for audio compression, which may lead to suboptimal performance in the context of audio LLM. Our research aims to address the shortcomings of current audio LLM codecs, particularly their challenges in maintaining semantic integrity in generated audio. For instance, existing methods like VALL-E, which condition acoustic token generation on text transcriptions, often suffer from content inaccuracies and elevated word error rates (WER) due to semantic misinterpretations of acoustic tokens, resulting in word skipping and errors. To overcome these issues, we propose a straightforward yet effective approach called X-Codec. X-Codec incorporates semantic features from a pre-trained semantic encoder before the Residual Vector Quantization (RVQ) stage and introduces a semantic reconstruction loss after RVQ. By enhancing the semantic ability of the codec, X-Codec significantly reduces WER in speech synthesis tasks and extends these benefits to non-speech applications, including music and sound generation. Our experiments in text-to-speech, music continuation, and text-to-sound tasks demonstrate that integrating semantic information substantially improves the overall performance of language models in audio generation. Our code and demo are available (Demo: https://x-codec-audio.github.io Code: https://github.com/zhenye234/xcodec)</description>
