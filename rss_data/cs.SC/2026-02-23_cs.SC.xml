      <title>Ontology-Guided Neuro-Symbolic Inference: Grounding Language Models with Mathematical Domain Knowledge</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.17826</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.17826v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Language models exhibit fundamental limitations -- hallucination, brittleness, and lack of formal grounding -- that are particularly problematic in high-stakes specialist fields requiring verifiable reasoning. I investigate whether formal domain ontologies can enhance language model reliability through retrieval-augmented generation. Using mathematics as proof of concept, I implement a neuro-symbolic pipeline leveraging the OpenMath ontology with hybrid retrieval and cross-encoder reranking to inject relevant definitions into model prompts. Evaluation on the MATH benchmark with three open-source models reveals that ontology-guided context improves performance when retrieval quality is high, but irrelevant context actively degrades it -- highlighting both the promise and challenges of neuro-symbolic approaches.</description>

      <title>Hilbert's Nullstellensatz is in the Counting Hierarchy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.17904</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.17904v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We show that Hilbert's Nullstellensatz, the problem of deciding if a system of multivariate polynomial equations has a solution in the algebraic closure of the underlying field, lies in the counting hierarchy. More generally, we show that the number of solutions to a system of equations can be computed in polynomial time with oracle access to the counting hierarchy. Our results hold in particular for polynomials with coefficients in either the rational numbers or a finite field. Previously, the best-known bounds on the complexities of these problems were PSPACE and FPSPACE, respectively. Our main technical contribution is the construction of a uniform family of constant-depth arithmetic circuits that compute the multivariate resultant.</description>

      <title>Exploiting the Structure in Tensor Decompositions for Matrix Multiplication</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.11041</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.11041v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present a new algorithm for fast matrix multiplication using tensor decompositions which have special features. Thanks to these features we obtain exponents lower than what the rank of the tensor decomposition suggests. In particular for $6\times 6$ matrix multiplication we reduce the exponent of the recent algorithm by Moosbauer and Poole from $2.8075$ to $2.8016$, while retaining a reasonable leading coefficient.</description>

      <title>Two Constraint Compilation Methods for Lifted Planning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.10164</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.10164v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study planning in a fragment of PDDL with qualitative state-trajectory constraints, capturing safety requirements, task ordering conditions, and intermediate sub-goals commonly found in real-world problems. A prominent approach to tackle such problems is to compile their constraints away, leading to a problem that is supported by state-of-the-art planners. Unfortunately, existing compilers do not scale on problems with a large number of objects and high-arity actions, as they necessitate grounding the problem before compilation. To address this issue, we propose two methods for compiling away constraints without grounding, making them suitable for large-scale planning problems. We prove the correctness of our compilers and outline their worst-case time complexity. Moreover, we present a reproducible empirical evaluation on the domains used in the latest International Planning Competition. Our results demonstrate that our methods are efficient and produce planning specifications that are orders of magnitude more succinct than the ones produced by compilers that ground the domain, while remaining competitive when used for planning with a state-of-the-art planner.</description>
