      <title>The Evolution of Probabilistic Price Forecasting Techniques: A Review of the Day-Ahead, Intra-Day, and Balancing Markets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.05523</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.05523v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Electricity price forecasting has become a critical tool for decision-making in energy markets, particularly as the increasing penetration of renewable energy introduces greater volatility and uncertainty. Historically, research in this field has been dominated by point forecasting methods, which provide single-value predictions but fail to quantify uncertainty. However, as power markets evolve due to renewable integration, smart grids, and regulatory changes, the need for probabilistic forecasting has become more pronounced, offering a more comprehensive approach to risk assessment and market participation. This paper presents a review of probabilistic forecasting methods, tracing their evolution from Bayesian and distribution based approaches, through quantile regression techniques, to recent developments in conformal prediction. Particular emphasis is placed on advancements in probabilistic forecasting, including validity-focused methods which address key limitations in uncertainty estimation. Additionally, this review extends beyond the Day-Ahead Market to include the Intra-Day and Balancing Markets, where forecasting challenges are intensified by higher temporal granularity and real-time operational constraints. We examine state of the art methodologies, key evaluation metrics, and ongoing challenges, such as forecast validity, model selection, and the absence of standardised benchmarks, providing researchers and practitioners with a comprehensive and timely resource for navigating the complexities of modern electricity markets.</description>

      <title>Bitcoin Forecasting with Classical Time Series Models on Prices and Volatility</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.06224</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.06224v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper evaluates the performance of classical time series models in forecasting Bitcoin prices, focusing on ARIMA, SARIMA, GARCH, and EGARCH. Daily price data from 2010 to 2020 were analyzed, with models trained on the first 90 percent and tested on the final 10 percent. Forecast accuracy was assessed using MAE, RMSE, AIC, and BIC. The results show that ARIMA provided the strongest forecasts for short-run log-price dynamics, while EGARCH offered the best fit for volatility by capturing asymmetry in responses to shocks. These findings suggest that despite Bitcoin's extreme volatility, classical time series models remain valuable for short-run forecasting. The study contributes to understanding cryptocurrency predictability and sets the stage for future work integrating machine learning and macroeconomic variables.</description>

      <title>Push-response anomalies in high-frequency S&amp;P 500 price series</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.06177</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.06177v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We test the hypothesis that consecutive intraday price changes in the most liquid U.S. equity ETF (SPY) are conditionally nonrandom. Using NBBO event-time data for about 1,500 regular trading days, we form for every lag L ordered pairs of a backward price increment ("push") and a forward price increment ("response"), standardize them, and estimate the expected responses on a fine grid of push magnitudes. The resulting lag-by-magnitude maps reveal a persistent structural shift: for short lags (1-5,000 ticks), expected responses cluster near zero across most push magnitudes, suggesting high short-term efficiency; beyond that range, pronounced tails emerge, indicating that larger historical pushes increasingly correlate with nonzero conditional responses. We also find that large negative pushes are followed by stronger positive responses than equally large positive pushes, consistent with asymmetric liquidity replenishment after sell-side shocks. Decomposition into symmetric and antisymmetric components and the associated dominance curves confirm that short-horizon efficiency is restored only partially. The evidence points to an intraday, lag-resolved anomaly that is invisible in unconditional returns and that can be used to define tradable pockets and risk controls.</description>

      <title>Towards Competent AI for Fundamental Analysis in Finance: A Benchmark Dataset and Evaluation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.07315</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.07315v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Generative AI, particularly large language models (LLMs), is beginning to transform the financial industry by automating tasks and helping to make sense of complex financial information. One especially promising use case is the automatic creation of fundamental analysis reports, which are essential for making informed investment decisions, evaluating credit risks, guiding corporate mergers, etc. While LLMs attempt to generate these reports from a single prompt, the risks of inaccuracy are significant. Poor analysis can lead to misguided investments, regulatory issues, and loss of trust. Existing financial benchmarks mainly evaluate how well LLMs answer financial questions but do not reflect performance in real-world tasks like generating financial analysis reports. In this paper, we propose FinAR-Bench, a solid benchmark dataset focusing on financial statement analysis, a core competence of fundamental analysis. To make the evaluation more precise and reliable, we break this task into three measurable steps: extracting key information, calculating financial indicators, and applying logical reasoning. This structured approach allows us to objectively assess how well LLMs perform each step of the process. Our findings offer a clear understanding of LLMs current strengths and limitations in fundamental analysis and provide a more practical way to benchmark their performance in real-world financial settings.</description>

      <title>The Shape of Markets: Machine learning modeling and Prediction Using 2-Manifold Geometries</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.05030</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.05030v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We introduce a Geometry Informed Model for financial forecasting by embedding high dimensional market data onto constant curvature 2manifolds. Guided by the uniformization theorem, we model market dynamics as Brownian motion on spherical S2, Euclidean R2, and hyperbolic H2 geometries. We further include the torus T, a compact, flat manifold admissible as a quotient space of the Euclidean plane anticipating its relevance for capturing cyclical dynamics. Manifold learning techniques infer the latent curvature from financial data, revealing the torus as the best performing geometry. We interpret this result through a macroeconomic lens, the torus circular dimensions align with endogenous cycles in output, interest rates, and inflation described by IS LM theory. Our findings demonstrate the value of integrating differential geometry with data-driven inference for financial modeling.</description>
