      <title>Learning Linear Regression with Low-Rank Tasks in-Context</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.04548</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.04548v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In-context learning (ICL) is a key building block of modern large language models, yet its theoretical mechanisms remain poorly understood. It is particularly mysterious how ICL operates in real-world applications where tasks have a common structure. In this work, we address this problem by analyzing a linear attention model trained on low-rank regression tasks. Within this setting, we precisely characterize the distribution of predictions and the generalization error in the high-dimensional limit. Moreover, we find that statistical fluctuations in finite pre-training data induce an implicit regularization. Finally, we identify a sharp phase transition of the generalization error governed by task structure. These results provide a framework for understanding how transformers learn to learn the task structure.</description>

      <title>Ground state and excitations of quasiperiodic 1D narrow-band moir\'e systems: a mean field approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.04132</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.04132v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We demonstrate that a mean field approximation can be confidently employed in quasiperiodic moir\'e systems to treat interactions and quasiperiodicity on equal footing. We obtain the mean field phase diagram for an illustrative one-dimensional moir\'e system that exhibits narrow bands and a regime with non-interacting multifractal critical states. By systematically comparing our findings with existing exact results, we identify the regimes where the mean field approximation provides an accurate description. Interestingly, in the critical regime, we obtain a quasifractal charge density wave, consistent with the exact results. To complement this study, we employ a real-space implementation of the time-dependent Hartree-Fock, enabling the computation of the excitation spectrum and response functions at the RPA level. These findings indicate that a mean field approximation to treat systems hosting multifractal critical states, as found in two-dimensional quasiperiodic moir\'e systems, is an appropriate methodology.</description>

      <title>Directed percolation transition to active turbulence driven by non-reciprocal forces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.04575</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.04575v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We numerically study the collective dynamics of dense particle assemblies driven by non-reciprocal pairwise forces of amplitude $\kappa$. At a critical value $\kappa_{\rm c}$, the system undergoes a dynamical phase transition from an absorbing state ($\kappa &lt; \kappa_{\rm c}$) to a chaotic steady state ($\kappa &gt; \kappa_{\rm c}$). The chaotic phase is marked by nontrivial spatiotemporal velocity correlations and mixing, reminiscent of active turbulence in self-propelled systems. The sharp onset of chaos shows critical scaling consistent with the universality class of directed percolation. We argue that this transition is generic to a broad class of locally-driven, dense disordered materials.</description>

      <title>Gumbel statistics for entanglement spectra of many-body localized eigenstates</title>

      <description>arXiv:1907.11582v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: An entanglement spectrum encodes statistics beyond the entanglement entropy, of which several have been studied in the context of many-body localization. We numerically study the extreme value statistics of entanglement spectra of many-body localized eigenstates. The physical information encoded in these spectra is almost fully carried by the few smallest elements, suggesting the extreme value statistics to have physical significance. We report the surprising observation of Gumbel statistics. Our result provides an analytical, parameter-free characterization of many-body localized eigenstates.</description>

      <title>Sensitivity of the spectral form factor to short-range level statistics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2009.02249</link>
      <description>arXiv:2009.02249v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The spectral form factor is a dynamical probe for level statistics of quantum systems. The early-time behaviour is commonly interpreted as a characterization of two-point correlations at large separation. We argue that this interpretation can be too restrictive by indicating that the self-correlation imposes a constraint on the spectral form factor integrated over time. More generally, we indicate that each expansion coefficient of the two-point correlation function imposes a constraint on the properly weighted time-integrated spectral form factor. We discuss how these constraints can affect the interpretation of the spectral form factor as a probe for ergodicity. We propose a new probe, which eliminates the effect of the constraint imposed by the self-correlation. The use of this probe is demonstrated for a model of randomly incomplete spectra and a Floquet model supporting many-body localization.</description>

      <title>Beyond holography: the entropic quantum gravity foundations of image processing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.14048</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.14048v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Recently, thanks to the development of artificial intelligence (AI) there is increasing scientific attention in establishing the connections between theoretical physics and AI. Traditionally, these connections have been focusing mostly on the relation between string theory and image processing and involve important theoretical paradigms such as holography. Recently G. Bianconi has formulated the Gravity from Entropy (GfE) approach to quantum gravity in which gravity is derived from the geometric quantum relative entropy (GQRE) between two metrics associated with the Lorentzian spacetime. Here it is demonstrated that the famous Perona-Malik algorithm for image processing is the gradient flow that maximizes the GfE action in its simple warm-up scenario. Specifically, this algorithm is the outcome of the maximization of the GfE action calculated between two Euclidean metrics: the one of the support of the image and the one induced by the image. As the Perona-Malik algorithm is known to preserve sharp contours, this implies that the GfE action, does not in general lead to uniform images upon iteration of the gradient flow dynamics as it would be intuitively expected from entropic actions maximising classical entropies. Rather, the outcome of the maximization of the GfE action is compatible with the preservation of complex structures. These results provide the geometrical and information theory foundations for the Perona-Malik algorithm and might contribute to establish deeper connections between GfE, machine learning and brain research.</description>

      <title>Solution of the Critical Dynamics of the Mean-Field Kob-Andersen Model</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.16451v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We analytically solve the critical dynamics of the Kob-Andersen kinetically constrained model of supercooled liquids on the Bethe lattice, employing a combinatorial argument based on the cavity method. For arbitrary values of graph connectivity z and facilitation parameter m, we demonstrate that the critical behavior of the order parameter is governed by equations of motion equivalent to those found in Mode-Coupling Theory. The resulting predictions for the dynamical exponents are validated through direct comparisons with numerical simulations that include both continuous and discontinuous transition scenarios.</description>

      <title>Quantum Annealing in SK Model Employing Suzuki-Kubo-deGennes Quantum Ising Mean Field Dynamics</title>

      <description>arXiv:2508.01004v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study a quantum annealing approach for estimating the ground state energy of the Sherrington-Kirpatrick mean field spin glass model using the Suzuki-Kubo dynamics applied for individual local magnetization components. The solutions of the coupled differential equations, in discretized state, give a fast annealing algorithm (cost $N^3$) in estimating the ground state of the model: Classical ($E^0= -0.7629 \pm 0.0002$), Quantum ($E^0=-0.7623 \pm 0.0001$) and Mixed ($E^0=-0.7626 \pm 0.0001$), all of which are to be compared with the best known estimate $E^0= -0.763166726 \dots$ . We infer that the continuous nature of the magnetization variable used in the dynamics here is the reason for reaching close to the ground state quickly and also the reason for not observing the de-Almeida-Thouless line in this approach.</description>

      <title>Variational Gaussian Approximation in Replica Analysis of Parametric Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.11780</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.11780v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We revisit the replica method for analyzing inference and learning in parametric models, considering situations where the data-generating distribution is unknown or analytically intractable. Instead of assuming idealized distributions to carry out quenched averages analytically, we use a variational Gaussian approximation for the replicated system in grand canonical formalism in which the data average can be deferred and replaced by empirical averages, leading to stationarity conditions that adaptively determine the parameters of the trial Hamiltonian for each dataset. This approach clarifies how fluctuations affect information extraction and connects directly with the results of mathematical statistics or learning theory such as information criteria. As a concrete application, we analyze linear regression and derive learning curves. This includes cases with real-world datasets, where exact replica calculations are not feasible.</description>

      <title>Localization structure of electronic states in the quantum Hall effect</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.04528</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.04528v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate the localization of electronic states in the integer quantum Hall effect using a magnetic localization landscape (MLL) approach. By studying a continuum Schr\"odinger model with disordered electrostatic potential, we demonstrate that the MLL, defined via a modified landscape function incorporating magnetic effects, captures key features of quantum state localization. The MLL effective potential reveals the spatial confinement regions and provides predictions of eigenstate energies, particularly in regimes where traditional semiclassical approximations break down. Numerical simulations show that below a critical energy, states localize around minima of the effective potential, while above it, they cluster around maxima-with edge effects becoming significant near boundaries. Bridging the gap between semiclassical intuition and full quantum models, the MLL offers a robust framework to understand transport and localization in disordered quantum Hall systems, and extends the applicability of landscape theory to magnetic systems.</description>

      <title>Nonreciprocal random networks and their percolation properties</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.05253</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.05253v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the effects of nonreciprocity and network structure on percolation. To this end, we investigate nonreciprocal random networks - directed networks for which the probability of a link occurring from node i to node j differs from the probability of the reverse link occurring from node j to node i. We analytically determine the degree and percolation properties of such networks with exactly two types of link probability, demonstrating that whether the networks are structured such that the nodes are not statistically indistinguishable has profound effects on these measures, both quantitively and in how such networks need to be approached. In particular, we develop a technique for solving the percolation problem which can be applied to both structured and unstructured networks. The method entails writing self-consistent integral and differential equations for the probability that each node will belong to the network's giant component. Exact solutions to these equations are obtained and simulations which confirm our analytic predictions are presented.</description>
