      <title>Fudan Multi-purpose Active TArget Time Projection Chamber (fMeta-TPC) for Photonnuclear Reaction Experiments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.18599</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.18599v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Active Target Time Projection Chambers (AT-TPCs) are state-of-the-art tools in the field of low-energy nuclear physics, particularly suitable for experiments using low-intensity radioactive ion beams or gamma rays. The Fudan Multi-purpose Active Target Time Projection Chamber (fMeta-TPC) with 2048 channels has been developed to study $\alpha$-clustering nuclei. {\fcb In this work, the focus is on the study of the photonuclear reaction with the Laser Compton Scattering (LCS) gamma source, especially for the decay of the highly excited $\alpha$-cluster state.} The design of fMeta-TPC is described and a comprehensive evaluation of its offline performance is performed by ultraviolet (UV) laser and $^{241}$Am $\alpha$ source. The result shows that the intrinsic angular resolution of the detector is within 0.30$^{\circ}$ and has an energy resolution of 6.85\% for 3.0 MeV $\alpha$ particles. The gain uniformity of the detector is about 10\% (RMS/Mean), tested by the $^{55}$Fe X-ray source.</description>

      <title>Neutrino emission in cold neutron stars: Bremsstrahlung and modified urca rates reexamined</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.18640</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.18640v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Neutrino emission in cold neutron stars is dominated by the modified urca (murca) process and nucleon-nucleon bremsstrahlung. The standard emission rates were provided by Friman and Maxwell in 1979, effectively based on a chiral Lagrangian framework with pion and rho meson exchange, supplemented by Landau parameters to describe short-range interactions. We reevaluate these rates within the same framework, correcting several errors and removing unnecessary simplifications, notably the triangular approximation -- Fermi momenta of protons and leptons negligible compared to the neutrons one -- in MURCA, and quantify their importance. The impact of rho meson exchange, previously argued to cancel with interference effects, is actually quite relevant. Altogether, the cooling rates are reduced by as much as a factor 2. We provide comprehensive analytical formulas encompassing all contributions, designed for straightforward numerical implementation. Our results are particularly relevant for astrophysical studies of neutron stars evolution and for studies of physics beyond the standard model, where the emission of new particles -- such as axions -- is typically computed within the same framework we adopt here.</description>

      <title>Two-gluon one-photon vertex in a magnetic field and its explicit one-loop approximation in the intermediate field strength regime</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.18673</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.18673v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We find the general structure for the two-gluon one-photon vertex in the presence of a constant magnetic field. We show that, when accounting for the symmetries satisfied by the strong and electromagnetic interactions under parity, charge conjugation and gluon interchange, and for gluons and photons on mass-shell, there exist only three possible tensor structures that span the vertex. These correspond to external products of the polarization vectors for each of the particles in the vertex. We also explicitly compute the one-loop approximation to this vertex in the intermediate field strength regime, which is the most appropriate one to describe possible effects of the presence of a magnetic field to enhance photon emission during pre-equilibrium in peripheral relativistic heavy-ion collisions. We show that the most favored direction for the photon to propagate is in the plane transverse to the field, which is consistent with a positive contribution to $\nu_2$ and may help to understand the larger than expected elliptic flow coefficient measured in this kind of reactions.</description>

      <title>Scattering Neutrinos, Spin Models, and Permutations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.18677</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.18677v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider a class of Heisenberg all-to-all coupled spin models inspired by neutrino interactions in a supernova with $N$ degrees of freedom. These models are characterized by a coupling matrix that is relatively simple in the sense that there are only a few, relative to $N$, non-trivial eigenvalues, in distinction to the classic Heisenberg spin-glass models, leading to distinct behavior in both the high-temperature and low-temperature regimes. When the momenta of the neutrinos are uniform and random in directions, we can calculate the large-$N$ partition function for the quantum Heisenberg model. In particular, the high-temperature partition function predicts a non-Gaussian density of states, providing interesting counter-examples showing the limits of general theorems on the density of states for quantum spin models. We can repeat the same argument for classical Heisenberg models, also known as rotor models, and we find the high-temperature expansion is completely controlled by the eigenvalues of the coupling matrix, and again predicts non-Gaussian behavior for the density of states as long as the number of eigenvalues does not scale linearly with $N$. Indeed, we derive the amusing fact that these \emph{thermodynamic} partition functions are essentially the generating function for counting permutations in the high-temperature regime. Finally, for the case relevant to neutrinos in a supernova, we identify the low-temperature phase as a unique state with the direction of the momenta of the neutrino dictating its coherent state in flavor-space, a state we dub the "flavor-momentum-locked" state.</description>

      <title>New Spin Structure Constraints on Hyperfine Splitting and Proton Size</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.18738</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.18738v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The 1S hyperfine splitting in hydrogen is measured to an impressive ppt precision and will soon be measured to ppm precision in muonic hydrogen. The latter measurement will rely on theoretical predictions, which are limited by knowledge of the proton polarizability effect $\Delta_\text{pol}$. Data-driven evaluations of $\Delta_\text{pol}$ have long been in significant tension with baryon chiral perturbation theory. Here we present improved results for $\Delta_\text{pol}$ driven by new spin structure data, reducing the long-standing tension between theory and experiment and halving the dominating uncertainty in hyperfine splitting calculations.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.18878v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the role of a dynamical gluon in the pion within the Basis Light-Front Quantization (BLFQ) framework and compare it with the solution of the Minkowski space Bethe-Salpeter equation, focusing on contributions beyond the valence state. Particularly in BLFQ, we identify the effect on the pion structure of the dynamical chiral symmetry breaking by the enhancement of the spin-flip matrix element, through the $|q\bar qg\rangle$ component of the light-front wave function and associated gluon parton distribution function (PDF). We explicitly show an enhancement of the low-$x$ contribution in the quark PDF associated with the large spin-flip matrix element, necessary to provide the $\pi-\rho$ mass splitting.</description>

      <title>Study of the $\Omega_{ccc}\Omega_{ccc}$ and $\Omega_{bbb}\Omega_{bbb}$ dibaryons in constituent quark model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.19208</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.19208v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Dibaryons are the simplest system in which the baryon-baryon interaction, and hence the underlying quark-quark interaction, can be studied in a clear way. Although the only dibaryon known today is the deuteron (and possibly the $d^*$), fully heavy dibaryons are good candidates for bound states because in such systems the kinetic energy is small and the high symmetry of the wave function favours binding. In this study, the possible existence of $\Omega_{ccc}\Omega_{ccc}$ and $\Omega_{bbb}\Omega_{bbb}$ dibaryons is investigated in the framework of a constituent quark model that satisfactorily describes the deuteron, the $d^*(2380)$ and the $NN$ interaction. $J^P=0^+$ candidates are found in both systems with binding energies of the order of MeV.</description>

Abstract: Background: Nuclear reactions are complex, with a large number of possible channels. Understanding how different channels contribute to a given reaction is investigated by perturbing the continuous spectrum.
  Purpose: To develop tools to investigate reaction mechanisms by identifying the contributions from each reaction channel.
  Method: Cluster decomposition methods, along with the spectral theory of proper subsystem problems, is used to identify the part of the nuclear Hamiltonian responsible for scattering into each channel.
  Results: The result is an expression of the nuclear Hamiltonian as a sum over all scattering channels of channel Hamiltonians. Each channel Hamiltonian is constructed from solutions of proper subsystem problems. Retaining any subset of channel Hamiltonians results in a truncated Hamiltonian where the scattering wave functions for the retained channels differ from the wave functions of the full Hamiltonian by $N$-body correlations. The scattering operator for the truncated Hamiltonian satisfies an optical theorem in the retained channels. Because different channel Hamiltonians do not commute, how they interact determines their contribution to the full dynamics.</description>

      <title>Chiral Analysis of the Nucleon Mass and Sigma Commutator</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.12564</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.12564v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Schemes for describing the light quark mass dependence of the nucleon mass calculated in lattice QCD are compared. The three schemes in consideration include a fully relativistic and Lorentz covariant scheme, one that is fully relativistic but not Lorentz covariant, and a semirelativistic scheme utilizing the heavy baryon approximation. Calculations of observables involving pseudoscalar meson loop diagrams generate nonanalytic terms proportional to square roots and logarithms of the quark mass. The three schemes all yield the correct model independent leading and next-to-leading nonanalytic terms of the chiral expansion of the baryon mass. Results for the masses of the other members of the octet are also presented. Here, low-energy coefficients of the analytic terms of the expansion for the nucleon and hyperons are constrained by lattice QCD results and are demonstrated to be independent of the renormalization scheme used. The differences in the leading coefficient of the chiral expansions are found to be consistent with strange quark counting. Using the schemes examined herein, we report results for the pion-nucleon sigma commutator based upon recent lattice results from the CLS Collaboration. We find $\sigma_{\pi N}=51.7 \pm 3.2 \pm 1.4$ MeV where the uncertainties are statistical and systematic respectively.</description>

      <title>Relaxation time for the alignment between quark spin and angular velocity in a rotating QCD medium</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.07859</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.07859v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We compute the relaxation times for massive quarks and anti-quarks to align their spins with the angular velocity in a rigidly rotating medium at finite temperature and baryon density. The rotation effects are implemented using a fermion propagator immersed in a cylindrical rotating environment. The relaxation time is computed as the inverse of the interaction rate to produce an asymmetry between the quark (anti-quark) spin components along and opposite to the angular velocity. For conditions resembling heavy-ion collisions, the relaxation times for quarks are smaller than for anti-quarks. For semi-central collisions the relaxation time is within the possible life-time of the QGP for all collision energies. However, for anti-quarks this happens only for collision energies $\sqrt{s_{NN}}\gtrsim 50$ GeV. The results are quantified in terms of the intrinsic quark and anti-quark polarizations, namely, the probability to build the spin asymmetry as a function of time. Our results show that these intrinsic polarizations tend to 1 with time at different rates given by the relaxation times with quarks reaching a sizable asymmetry at a faster pace. These are key results to further elucidate the mechanisms of hyperon polarization in relativistic heavy-ion collisions.</description>

      <title>Parameter optimisation using Bayesian inference for spallation models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.01993</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.01993v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The accuracy and precision of high-energy spallation models are key issues for the design and development of new applications and experiments. We present a method to estimate model parameters and associated uncertainties by leveraging the Bayesian version of the Generalised Least Squares method, which enables us to incorporate prior knowledge on the parameter values. This approach is designed to adjust parameters based on experimental data, accounting for experimental uncertainty information, and providing uncertainties for all adjusted parameters. This approach is designed in order both to improve the accuracy of models through the modification of free parameters of these models, which results in a better reproduction of experimental data, and to estimate the uncertainties of these parameters and, by extension, their impacts on the model output. We aim at demonstrating the Generalised Least Square method can be applied in the case of Monte Carlo models. We present a proof-of-concept for Monte Carlo models in the specific case of nuclear physics with the model combination INCL/ABLA. We discuss the challenges in the application of this method to high-energy spallation models, notably the large runtime and the stochasticity of the models. Our results indicate this framework can also be applied to analogous situations where parameters of a computationally expensive Monte Carlo code should be inferred/improved.</description>

      <title>Damping of density oscillations from bulk viscosity in quark matter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.06595</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.06595v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the damping of density oscillations in the quark matter phase that might occur in compact stars. To this end we compute the bulk viscosity and the associated damping time in three-flavor quark matter, considering both nonleptonic and semileptonic electroweak processes. We use two different equations of state of quark matter, more precisely, the MIT bag model and perturbative QCD, including the leading-order corrections in the strong coupling constant. We analyze the dependence of our results on the density, temperature and value of strange quark mass in each case. We then find that the maximum of the bulk viscosity is in the range of temperature from 0.01 to 0.1 MeV for frequencies around 1 kHz, while the associated minimal damping times of the density oscillations at those temperatures might be in the range of few to hundreds milliseconds. Our results suggest that bulk viscous damping might be relevant in the postmerger phase after the collision of two neutron stars if deconfined matter is achieved in the process.</description>

      <title>Entanglement suppression and low-energy scattering of heavy mesons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.05958</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.05958v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recently entanglement suppression was proposed to be one possible origin of emergent symmetries. Here we test this conjecture in the context of heavy meson scatterings. The low-energy interactions of $D^{(*)}\bar D^{(*)}$ and $D^{(*)} D^{(*)}$ are closely related to the hadronic molecular candidates $X(3872)$ and $T_{cc}(3875)^+$, respectively, and can be described by a nonrelativistic effective Lagrangian manifesting heavy-quark spin symmetry, which includes only constant contact potentials at leading order. We explore entanglement suppression in a tensor-product framework to treat both the isospin and spin degrees of freedom. Using the $X(3872)$ and $T_{cc}(3875)^+$ as inputs, we find that entanglement suppression indeed leads to an emergent symmetry, namely, a light-quark spin symmetry, and as such the $D^{(*)}\bar D^{(*)}$ or $D^{(*)} D^{(*)}$ interaction strengths for a given total isospin do not depend on the total angular momentum of light (anti)quarks. The $X(3872)$ and $T_{cc}(3875)^+$ are predicted to have five and one isoscalar partner, respectively, while the corresponding partner numbers derived solely from heavy-quark spin symmetry are three and one, respectively. The predictions need to be confronted with experimental data and lattice quantum chromodynamics results to further test the entanglement suppression conjecture.</description>
