      <title>Fuk-Nagaev inequality in smooth Banach spaces: Optimum bounds for distributions of heavy-tailed martingales</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.10012</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.10012v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We derive a Fuk-Nagaev inequality for the maxima of norms of martingale sequences in smooth Banach spaces which allow for a finite number of higher conditional moments. The bound is obtained by combining an optimization approach for a Chernoff bound due to Rio (2017) with a classical bound for moment generating functions of smooth Banach space norms by Pinelis (1994). Our result improves comparable infinite-dimensional bounds in the literature by removing unnecessary centering terms and giving precise constants. As an application, we propose a McDiarmid-type bound for vector-valued functions which allow for a uniform bound on their conditional higher moments.</description>

      <title>Towards a Mathematical Theory of Adaptive Memory: From Time-Varying to Responsive Fractional Brownian Motion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.10057</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.10057v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This work develops a comprehensive mathematical theory for a class of stochastic processes whose local regularity adapts dynamically in response to their own state. We first introduce and rigorously analyze a time-varying fractional Brownian motion (TV-fBm) with a deterministic, H\"older-continuous Hurst exponent function. Key properties are established, including its exact variance scaling law, precise local increment asymptotics, local non-determinism, large deviation asymptotics for its increments, and a covariance structure that admits a closed-form hypergeometric representation. We then define a novel class of processes termed Responsive Fractional Brownian Motion (RfBm). Here,the Hurst exponent is governed by a Lipschitz-H\"older response function depending on the process state itself, creating an intrinsic feedback mechanism between state and memory. We establish the well-posedness of this definition, prove pathwise H\"older regularity of the induced instantaneous scaling exponent, and analyze associated cumulative memory processes along with their asymptotic convergence. The mathematical structure of RfBm naturally gives rise to a continuous-time, pathwise attention mechanism. We show that its kernel induces a well-defined attention weight distribution, derive fundamental bounds for these weights, and quantify the stability of attentional allocation through residence measures and volatility functionals. This work develops a stochastic-process-theoretic framework for concepts central to adaptive memory and content-sensitive information processing, offering a mathematically grounded perspective that may complement existing empirical approaches.</description>

      <title>Large Deviation inequalities for sums of positive correlated variables with clustering</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.10085</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.10085v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large deviation inequalities for ergodic sums is an important subject since the seminal contribution of Bernstein for independent random variables with finite variances, followed by the Chernoff method and the Hoefding result for independent bounded variables. Very few results appears in the literature for the non independent case. Here we consider the, barely treated in the literature, case of positively correlated Bernoulli variables. This case represents the appearance in clusters of a certain fixed phenomena in the overlying stochastic process. Under a very mild condition we prove several upper deviation inequalities. The results follow by a spectral decomposition of an appropriated recursive operator. We illustrate with examples.</description>

      <title>Conformal Invariance of the FK-Ising Model on Lorentz-Maximal S-Embeddings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.10142</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.10142v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We show on non-flat but critical s-embeddings the celebrated convergence of the interface curves of the critical FK Ising model to an $\operatorname{SLE}_{16/3}$ curve, using discrete complex analytic techniques first used in arXiv:0708.0039, arXiv:1312.0533 and subsequently extended to more lattice settings including isoradial graphs arXiv:0910.2045, circle packings arXiv:1712.08736, and flat s-embeddings arXiv:2006.14559. In our setting, the s-embedding approximates a maximal surface in the Minkowski space $\mathbb R^{2,1}$, an `exact' criticality condition identified in arXiv:2006.14559, which is stronger than the percolation-theoretic `near-critical' setup studied in, e.g., arXiv:2309.08470. The proof relies on a careful discretisation of the Laplace-Beltrami operator on the s-embedding, which is crucial in identifying the limit of the martingale observable.</description>

      <title>The Frog Model on $\mathbb{Z}$ with General Random Survival Parameter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.10171</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.10171v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the frog model on $\mathbb{Z}$ with particle-wise random geometric lifetimes: each particle has a survival parameter $\pi\in(0,1)$ sampled i.i.d., whose density near $1$ satisfies $f_\pi(u)\sim (1-u)^{\beta-1}L\big((1-u)^{-1}\big)$ with $\beta&gt;0$, and $L$ slowly varying. This strictly extends the $\mathrm{Beta}(\alpha,\beta)$ case. Let $\eta$ denote the common law of the i.i.d.\ initial number of particles $\{\eta_x\}_{x\in\mathbb{Z}}$. Using a percolation comparison and sharp one-particle displacement tails, we obtain a universal threshold at $\beta=\tfrac12$. If $\beta&gt;\tfrac12$ and $E(\eta)&lt;\infty$, extinction occurs almost surely. If $\beta&lt;\tfrac12$ and $\mathbb{P}(\eta=0)&lt;1$, survival has positive probability. At the boundary $\beta=\tfrac12$ we give sharp criteria: extinction if $E(\eta)&lt;\infty$ and $8\,\limsup_{n\to\infty}L(n^2)&lt;1/E(\eta)$; survival if $\mathbb{P}(\eta=0)&lt;1$ and $\sqrt{2}\,\liminf_{n\to\infty}L(n^2)&gt;1/E(\eta)$. These results recover the Carvalho-Machado threshold for Beta laws and show that only the exponent $\beta$ governs the phase transition, while $L$ impacts the critical regime.</description>

      <title>Explicit correlation functions for the six-vertex model in the free-fermion regime</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.10199</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.10199v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this article, we show that, in the free-fermion regime of the six-vertex model, all $k$-point correlation functions of vertex types admit a determinantal representation: \begin{align*} \mathbb{P}\Bigg( \bigcap_{p=1}^k \{ \text{vertex at } v^p \text{ has type } t_p \} \Bigg) = \left( \prod_{p=1}^k a_{t_p} \right)
  \det\big[ L(x^i,y^j) \big]_{i,j=1}^{2k}, \end{align*} where $t_1,\ldots,t_k \in \{1,\ldots,6\}$ label the six possible vertex types, and $\{a_t : 1 \leq t \leq 6\}$ are the corresponding six-vertex weights. For each $1 \leq p \leq k$, the four points $x^{2p-1}, x^{2p}, y^{2p-1}, y^{2p} \in (\mathbb{Z}/2)^2$ are $t_p$-dependent choices among the midpoints of the edges incident to $v^p$. The correlation kernel $L$ has the contour integral representation \begin{align*} L(x,y) = \oint_{|w_1|=1} \oint_{|w_2|=1}
  \frac{dw_1}{2\pi i\, w_1}\,
  \frac{dw_2}{2\pi i\, w_2}\,
  w_1^{\,y_1 - x_1}\, w_2^{\,y_2 - x_2}\,
  h\big(c(x),c(y);w_1,w_2\big), \end{align*} where $h\big(c(x),c(y);w_1,w_2\big)$ is a simple rational function of $(w_1,w_2)$ that depends on $x$ and $y$ only through their orientations $c(x)$ and $c(y)$. Our proof is fully self-contained: we construct a determinantal point process on $\mathbb{Z}^2$ and identify the six-vertex model as its pushforward under an explicit mapping.</description>

      <title>Large deviation principles for fully coupled multiscale multivalued stochastic systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.10311</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.10311v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study focuses on large deviation principles for fully coupled multiscale multivalued stochastic systems, in which the slow component is governed by a multivalued stochastic differential equation and the fast component is described by a general stochastic differential equation. First, we establish the large deviation principle for the slow component at any fixed time by leveraging viscosity solutions of second-order Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman equations involving multivalued operators. Subsequently, we illustrate the theoretical results through a concrete example.</description>

      <title>The dynamic saddle-node bifurcation with noise on the slow variable</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.10460</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.10460v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, we analyse the effect of adding Gaussian white noise to the slow variable of a slow--fast system passing through a saddle--node (or fold) bifurcation. This problem is mainly motivated by applications to non-equilibrium energy sinks. While the effect of adding noise to the fast variable, which is important for noise-induced tipping, has been previously analysed in detail, the case where the slow variable is perturbed by noise has not been considered before. Our main result is that the noise increases the slow variable on average. We compute the effect of the noise, to lowest order, on the expectation and variance of the slow variable after the bifurcation. The contribution of the noise can be explicitly expressed in terms of Airy functions. We also provide numerical simulations, which show that the expansion to lowest order matches the observations for fairly large values of the noise intensity.</description>

      <title>Large deviations for invariant measure of stochastic Allen-Cahn equation with inhomogeneous boundary conditions and multiplicative noise</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.10536</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.10536v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We prove the validity of a small noise large deviation principle for the family of invariant measures $\{\mu_\epsilon\}_{\epsilon&gt;0} $ associated to the one dimensional stochastic Allen-Cahn equation with inhomogeneous Dirichlet boundary conditions, perturbed by unbounded multiplicative noise. The main difficulty is that the system is not strongly dissipative. Using L. Simon's convergence theorem, we show that the dynamics of the noiseless system converge in large time to the minimizer of the Ginzburg-Landau energy functional, which is unique due to the boundary condition. We obtain an estimate of the invariant measure on the bounded set in the Sobolev space $W^{k^\star,p^\star} $, where $k^\star p^\star&gt;1$, and $p^\star$ is large. As a corollary of the main result, we show that $\mu_\epsilon$ concentrates around the unique minimizer with such boundary conditions exponentially fast when $\epsilon$ is sufficiently small.</description>

      <title>Local convergence in $t$-PNG</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.10550</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.10550v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We prove local convergence of the $t$-PNG model with zero boundary to the stationary $t$-PNG model, confirming a recent conjecture of Drillick and Lin (2024). The stationary $t$-PNG model is the one with both left and bottom boundaries of Poisson nucleations with rate parameters $\frac{1}{\lambda(1-t)}$ and $\lambda$, respectively, for some $\lambda&gt;0$. In the proof, we consider the trajectories of certain second class particles via a basic monotone coupling of three $t$-PNG processes, and adapt microscopic concavity ideas used in particle models (e.g., Bal\'azs and Sepp\"al\"ainen (2009)), as well as blocking measure bounds like in Ferrari, Kipnis and Saada (1991).</description>

      <title>Bessel and Dunkl processes with drift</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.10625</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.10625v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: For some discrete parameters $k\ge0$, multivariate (Dunkl-)Bessel processes on Weyl chambers $C$ associated with root systems appear as projections of Brownian motions without drift on Euclidean spaces $V$, and the associated transition densities can be described in terms of multivariate Bessel functions; the most prominent examples are Dyson Brownian motions. The projections of Brownian motions on $V$ with drifts are also Feller diffusions on $C$, and their transition densities and their generators can be again described via these Bessel functions. These processes are called Bessel processes with drifts. In this paper we construct these Bessel processes processes with drift for arbitrary root systems and parameters $k\ge 0$. Moreover, this construction works also for Dunkl processes. We study some features of these processes with drift like their radial parts, a Girsanov theorem, moments and associated martingales, strong laws of large numbers, and central limit theorems.</description>

      <title>Maximal rigidity of random measure and uniqueness pairs: stealthy processes, quasicrystals and periodicity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.10686</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.10686v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This article investigates the phenomenon of maximal rigidity in spatial processes, where perfect interpolation of the process is possible from partial information, specifically, from its restriction to a strict subdomain, often resulting in a trivial tail $\sigma$algebra. A classical example known since the 1930's is that a time series is fully determined by its values on the negative integers if its spectrum has a gap, or at least a sufficiently deep zero. We extend such results to higher dimensions and continuous settings by establishing a connection with the concept of uniqueness pairs, rooted in the uncertainty principle of harmonic analysis. We present several other manifestations of this principle, unify and strengthen seemingly unrelated results across different models: quasicrystals and stealthy processes are shown to be maximally rigid on cones, and discrete integer-valued processes are necessarily periodic when they have a simply connected spectrum. Finally, we identify a surprising class of continuous fields with seemingly standard behavior, such as linear variance and finite dependency range, that undergo a phase transition: they are perfectly interpolable on B(0, $\rho$) for $\rho$ ___ 2 $\pi$ but exhibit no rigidity for $\rho$ &gt; 2.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2512.10754v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A gambler with an initial fortune $x$ starts by betting a dollar, then doubles the bet after every win and halves the bet after every loss. Let $p\in (0,1)$ be the probability of winning for each round. We show that the gambler survives with positive probability if and only if $p &lt; 1/2$ and $x &gt; 2$. Moreover, the ruin probability is increasing and real-analytic in $p$, but a singular, H\"older continuous function of $x$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2512.10848v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We survey the localization method for proving inequalities in high dimension, pioneered by Lov\'asz and Simonovits (1993), and its stochastic extension developed by Eldan (2012). The method has found applications in a surprising wide variety of settings, ranging from its original motivation in isoperimetric inequalities to optimization, concentration of measure, and bounding the mixing rate of Markov chains. At heart, the method converts a given instance of an inequality (for a set or distribution in high dimension) into a highly structured instance, often just one-dimensional.</description>

      <title>Anomalous scaling law for the two-dimensional Gaussian free field</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.10933</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.10933v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider the Gaussian free field $\varphi$ on $\mathbb{Z}^2$ at large spatial scales $N$ and give sharp bounds on the probability $\theta(a,N)$ that the radius of a finite cluster in the excursion set $\{\varphi \geq a\}$ on the corresponding metric graph is macroscopic. We prove a scaling law for this probability, by which $\theta(a,N)$ transitions from fractional logarithmic decay for near-critical parameters $(a,N)$ to polynomial decay in the off-critical regime. The transition occurs across a certain scaling window determined by a correlation length scale $\xi$, which is such that $\theta(a,N) \sim \theta(0,\xi)(\tfrac{N}{\xi})^{-\tau}$ for typical heights $a$ as $N/\xi$ diverges, with an explicit exponent $\tau$ that we identify in the process. This is in stark contrast with recent results from arXiv:2101.02200 and arXiv:2312.10030 in dimension three, where similar observables are shown to follow regular scaling laws, with polynomial decay at and near criticality, and rapid decay in ${N}/\xi$ away from it.</description>

      <title>Approximate Counting in Local Lemma Regimes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.10134</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.10134v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We establish efficient approximate counting algorithms for several natural problems in local lemma regimes. In particular, we consider the probability of intersection of events and the dimension of intersection of subspaces. Our approach is based on the cluster expansion method. We obtain fully polynomial-time approximation schemes for both the probability of intersection and the dimension of intersection for commuting projectors. For general projectors, we provide two algorithms: a fully polynomial-time approximation scheme under a global inclusion-exclusion stability condition, and an efficient affine approximation under a spectral gap assumption. As corollaries of our results, we obtain efficient algorithms for approximating the number of satisfying assignments of conjunctive normal form formulae and the dimension of satisfying subspaces of quantum satisfiability formulae.</description>

      <title>The supercooled Stefan problem: fractal freezing and the fine structure of maximal solutions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.10138</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.10138v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the supercooled Stefan problem in arbitrary dimensions. First, we study general solutions and their irregularities, showing generic fractal freezing and nucleation, based on a novel Markovian gluing principle. In contrast, we then establish regularity properties of maximal solutions, which are obtained by maximizing a suitable notion of "average" freezing time. Unexpectedly, we show that maximal solutions have a transition zone that is open modulo a low-dimensional set: this allows us to apply obstacle problem theory for a finer regularity analysis. We further show that maximal solutions are in general non-universal, and we obtain sharp stability results under perturbation of each maximal solution. Lastly, we study maximal solutions in both the radial and the one-dimensional setting. We show that in these cases the maximal solution is universal and minimizes nucleation, in agreement with phenomena observed in the physics literature.</description>

      <title>PANDAExpress: a Simpler and Faster PANDA Algorithm</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.10217</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.10217v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: PANDA is a powerful generic algorithm for answering conjunctive queries (CQs) and disjunctive datalog rules (DDRs) given input degree constraints. In the special case where degree constraints are cardinality constraints and the query is Boolean, PANDA runs in $\tilde O (N^{subw})$-time, where $N$ is the input size, and $subw$ is the submodular width of the query, a notion introduced by Daniel Marx (JACM 2013). When specialized to certain classes of sub-graph pattern finding problems, the $\tilde O(N^{subw})$ runtime matches the optimal runtime possible, modulo some conjectures in fine-grained complexity (Bringmann and Gorbachev (STOC 25)). The PANDA framework is much more general, as it handles arbitrary input degree constraints, which capture common statistics and integrity constraints used in relational database management systems, it works for queries with free variables, and for both CQs and DDRs.
  The key weakness of PANDA is the large $polylog(N)$-factor hidden in the $\tilde O(\cdot)$ notation. This makes PANDA completely impractical, and fall short of what is achievable with specialized algorithms. This paper resolves this weakness with two novel ideas. First, we prove a new probabilistic inequality that upper-bounds the output size of DDRs under arbitrary degree constraints. Second, the proof of this inequality directly leads to a new algorithm named PANDAExpress that is both simpler and faster than PANDA. The novel feature of PANDAExpress is a new partitioning scheme that uses arbitrary hyperplane cuts instead of axis-parallel hyperplanes used in PANDA. These hyperplanes are dynamically constructed based on data-skewness statistics carefully tracked throughout the algorithm's execution. As a result, PANDAExpress removes the $polylog(N)$-factor from the runtime of PANDA, matching the runtimes of intricate specialized algorithms, while retaining all its generality and power.</description>

      <title>Error Analysis of Generalized Langevin Equations with Approximated Memory Kernels</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.10256</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.10256v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We analyze prediction error in stochastic dynamical systems with memory, focusing on generalized Langevin equations (GLEs) formulated as stochastic Volterra equations. We establish that, under a strongly convex potential, trajectory discrepancies decay at a rate determined by the decay of the memory kernel and are quantitatively bounded by the estimation error of the kernel in a weighted norm. Our analysis integrates synchronized noise coupling with a Volterra comparison theorem, encompassing both subexponential and exponential kernel classes. For first-order models, we derive moment and perturbation bounds using resolvent estimates in weighted spaces. For second-order models with confining potentials, we prove contraction and stability under kernel perturbations using a hypocoercive Lyapunov-type distance. This framework accommodates non-translation-invariant kernels and white-noise forcing, explicitly linking improved kernel estimation to enhanced trajectory prediction. Numerical examples validate these theoretical findings.</description>

      <title>Curvature-Weighted Contact Networks: Spectral Reduction and Global Stability in a Markovian SIR Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.10331</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.10331v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose a new network-based SIR epidemic model in which transmission is modulated by a curvature-weighted contact matrix that encodes structural and geometric features of the underlying graph. The formulation encompasses both adjacency-driven and Markovian mixing, allowing heterogeneous interactions to be shaped by curvature-sensitive topological properties. We prove that the basic reproduction number satisfies \[ R_0=\frac{\beta}{\gamma}\lambda_{\max}(M), \] where $M$ is the curvature-weighted transmission operator. Using Perron--Frobenius theory together with linear and nonlinear Lyapunov functionals, we establish: (i) global asymptotic stability of the disease-free equilibrium when $R_0&lt;1$, and (ii) existence and global asymptotic stability of a unique endemic equilibrium when $R_0&gt;1$. Our results show that curvature acts as a geometric regularizer of connectivity, lowering spectral radii, raising effective epidemic thresholds, and organizing the long-term dynamics through monotone contraction toward the endemic state. This framework generalizes classical network epidemiology by integrating geometric information directly into transmission operators, providing a rigorous foundation for epidemic dynamics on structurally heterogeneous networks.</description>

      <title>A tree bijection for cusp-less planar hyperbolic surfaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.10673</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.10673v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recently, a tree bijection has been found for planar hyperbolic surfaces, which allows for an easy computation of the Weil--Petersson volumes, and opens the path to get distance statistic on random hyperbolic surfaces and to find scaling limits when the number of boundaries becomes large. Crucially, this tree bijection requires the hyperbolic surface to have at least one cusp as origin, from which point distances are measured. In this paper we will extend this tree bijection, such that having a cusp is no longer required. We will first extend the bijection to half-tight cylinders. Since general planar hyperbolic surfaces can be naturally decomposed in two half-tight cylinders, this general case is also covered. In the half-tight cylinder the distances to the origin are replaced by the so-called Busemann function. This Busemann function is not well-defined on the surface, but it is on the cylinder cover.</description>

      <title>Polymer Dynamics via Cliques: New Conditions for Approximations</title>

      <description>arXiv:2007.08293v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Abstract polymer models are systems of weighted objects, called polymers, equipped with an incompatibility relation. An important quantity associated with such models is the partition function, which is the weighted sum over all sets of compatible polymers. Various approximation problems reduce to approximating the partition function of a polymer model. Central to the existence of such approximation algorithms are weight conditions of the respective polymer model. Such conditions are derived either via complex analysis or via probabilistic arguments. We follow the latter path and establish a new condition -- the clique dynamics condition -- , which is less restrictive than the ones in the literature. We introduce a new Markov chain where the clique dynamics condition implies rapid mixing by utilizing cliques of incompatible polymers that naturally arise from the translation of algorithmic problems into polymer models. This leads to improved parameter ranges for several approximation algorithms, such as a factor of at least $2^{1/\alpha}$ for the hard-core model on bipartite $\alpha$-expanders.</description>

Abstract: In this paper we show that the random degree constrained process (a time-evolving random graph model with degree constraints) has a local weak limit, provided that the underlying host graphs are high degree almost regular. We, moreover, identify the limit object as a multi-type branching process, by combining coupling arguments with the analysis of a certain recursive tree process. Using a spectral characterization, we also give an asymptotic expansion of the critical time when the giant component emerges in the so-called random $d$-process, resolving a problem of Warnke and Wormald for large $d$.</description>

Abstract: The goal of this note is twofold: first, we explain the relation between the isomorphism theorems in the context of vertex reinforced jump process discovered in [BHS19, BHS21] and the standard Markovian isomorphism theorems for Markovian jump processes; second, we introduce the vertex reinforced counterpart of the standard Poissonian loop soup developed by Le Jan [LJ10]. To this end, we propose an algorithm that can be viewed as a variant of Wilson's algorithm with reinforcement. We establish the isomorphism theorems for the erased loops and the random walk from this algorithm, and in particular provide a concrete construction of the reinforced loop soup via a random process with a reinforcement mechanism.</description>

Abstract: Let $\{(X_t)_{t\geq 0}, \mathbb{P}_{\delta_x}, x\in E\}$ be a supercritical branching Markov process (which is not necessary symmetric) on a locally compact metric measure space $(E,\mu)$ with spatially dependent local branching mechanism. Under some assumptions on the semigroup of the spatial motion, we first prove law of iterated logarithm type results for $\langle f, X_t\rangle$ under the second moment condition on the branching mechanism, where $f$ is a linear combination of eigenfunctions of the mean semigroup $\{T_t, t\geq0\}$ of $X$. Then we prove law of iterated logarithm type results for $\langle f, X_t\rangle$ under the fourth moment condition, where $f$ belongs to a larger class of functions.</description>

Abstract: We study the singularity probability of n*n random matrices with i.i.d. entries from highly biased discrete distributions. We obtain sharp non-asymptotic bounds for this probability and derive estimates on the least singular values. Our method combines combinatorial, geometric, and probabilistic techniques such as sphere decomposition and anticoncentration inequalities. The results extend classical invertibility theory to biased discrete settings and resolve an open problem by characterizing the dominant causes of singularity in biased discrete random matrices, namely the presence of zero columns or linearly dependent column pairs.</description>

Abstract: We consider a long-range percolation model on homogeneous oriented trees with several lengths. We obtain the critical surface as the set of zeros of a specific polynomial with coefficients depending explicitly on the lengths and the degree of the tree. Restricting to the case of two lengths, we obtain new bounds on the critical parameters, monotonicity properties, as well as continuity of the critical curve, plus some partial results concerning its convexity. Our proofs rely on the study of the properties of the characteristic polynomial of the transition matrix of a multi-step Markov chain related to the model.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2510.05383v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study a stochastic model of a copolymerization process that has been extensively investigated in the physics literature. The main questions of interest include: (i) what are the criteria for transience, null recurrence, and positive recurrence in terms of the system parameters; (ii) in the transient regime, what are the limiting fractions of the different monomer types; and (iii) in the transient regime, what is the speed of growth of the polymer? Previous studies in the physics literature have addressed these questions using heuristic methods. Here, we utilize rigorous mathematical arguments to derive the results from the physics literature. Moreover, the techniques developed allow us to generalize to the copolymerization process with finitely many monomer types. We expect that the mathematical methods used and developed in this work will also enable the study of even more complex models in the future.</description>

      <title>On the risk levels of distributionally robust chance constrained problems</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.01177v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we discuss the utilization of perturbed risk levels (PRLs) for the solution of chance-constrained problems via sampling-based approaches. PRLs allow the consideration of distributional ambiguity by rescaling the risk level of the nominal chance constraint. Explicit expressions of the PRL exist for some discrepancy-based ambiguity sets.
  We propose a discrepancy functional not included in previous comparisons of different PRLs based on the likelihood ratio, which we term ,,relative variation distance" (RVD). If the ambiguity set can be described by the RVD, the rescaling of the risk level with the PRL is in contrast to other discrepancy functionals possible even for very low risk levels. We derive distributionally robust one- and two-level guarantees for the solution of chance-constrained problems with randomized methods. We demonstrate the viability of the derived guarantees for a randomized MPC under distributional ambiguity.</description>

Abstract: We establish the analogue of Khintchine's theorem for all self-similar probability measures on the real line. When specified to the case of the Hausdorff measure on the middle-thirds Cantor set, the result is already new and provides an answer to an old question of Mahler. The proof consists in showing effective equidistribution in law of expanding upper-triangular random walks on $\text{SL}_{2}(\mathbb{R})/\text{SL}_{2}(\mathbb{Z})$, a result of independent interest.</description>

      <title>Deep Operator BSDE: a Numerical Scheme to Approximate Solution Operators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.03405</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.03405v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Motivated by dynamic risk measures and conditional $g$-expectations, in this work we propose a numerical method to approximate the solution operator given by a Backward Stochastic Differential Equation (BSDE). The main ingredients for this are the Wiener chaos decomposition and the classical Euler scheme for BSDEs. We show convergence of this scheme under very mild assumptions, and provide a rate of convergence in more restrictive cases. We then implement it using neural networks, and we present several numerical examples where we can check the accuracy of the method.</description>

      <title>Exponential dimensional dependence in high-dimensional Hermite method of moments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.17431</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.17431v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: It is numerically well known that moment-based tests for Gaussianity and estimators become increasingly unreliable at higher moment orders; however, this phenomenon has lacked rigorous mathematical justification. In this work, we establish quantitative bounds for Hermite-based moment tests, with matching exponential upper and lower bounds. Our results show that, even under ideal conditions with i.i.d. standard normal data, the sample size must grow exponentially with the highest moment order $d$ used in the test. These bounds, derived under both the convex distance and the Kolmogorov-Smirnov distance, are applied to classical procedures, such as the Shenton-Bowman test.</description>

      <title>Random Lie bracket on $\mathfrak{sl}_2(\mathbf{F}_p)$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.16175</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.16175v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study a random walk on the Lie algebra $\mathfrak{sl}_2(\mathbf{F}_p)$ where new elements are produced by randomly applying adjoint operators of two generators. Focusing on the generic case where the generators are selected at random, we analyze the limiting distribution of the random walk and the speed at which it converges to this distribution. These questions reduce to the study of a random walk on a cyclic group. We show that, with high probability, the walk exhibits a pre-cutoff phenomenon after roughly $p$ steps. Notably, the limiting distribution need not be uniform and it depends on the prime divisors of $p-1$. Furthermore, we prove that by incorporating a simple random twist into the walk, we can embed a well-known affine random walk on $\mathbf{F}_p$ into the modified random Lie bracket, allowing us to show that the entire Lie algebra is covered in roughly $\log p$ steps in the generic case.</description>
