      <title>Quasi-local Frustration-Free Free Fermions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.01010</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.01010v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recent studies have revealed that frustration-free models, expressed as sums of finite-range interactions or hoppings, exhibit several properties markedly different from those of frustrated models. In this work, we demonstrate that, by relaxing the finite-range condition to allow for exponentially decaying hoppings, one can build gapped frustration-free systems that realize Chern insulators as well as quasi-degenerate ground states with finite-size splittings. Moreover, by permitting power-law decaying hoppings, we also construct a gapless band metal whose finite-size gap scales inversely with the system size $L$. These findings serve as an important step toward clarifying the general properties of frustration-free systems and those represented by tensor network states.</description>

      <title>Superfluidity of quasi-2D He-4 droplets on graphite</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.18911</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.18911v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The superfluid response of nanoscale size quasi-2D He-4 droplets adsorbed on a graphite substrate is investigated by computer simulations. It is found that clusters comprising as few as 7 atoms are stable at temperatures lower than &lt; 0.15 K. Clusters of ~20 atoms or less are liquid-like and ~100% superfluid. As the size is increased, the central region crystallizes, forming the commensurate C_1/3 phase, with a surface sliver of superfluidity evolving into a perimetral 1D Luttinger liquid with increasing cluster size. The relevance to quasi-2D molecular spectroscopy and to transverse quantum superfluidity is discussed.</description>

      <title>Cavity-enhanced spectroscopy of individual nuclear spins in a dense bath</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.12957</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.12957v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Echo-based spectroscopy of the superhyperfine interaction of an electronic spin with nuclear spins in its surroundings enables detailed insights into the microscopic magnetic environment of spins in solids. Still, it is an outstanding challenge to resolve individual nuclear spins in a dense bath, in which many of them exhibit a comparable coupling strength. This simultaneously requires a high spectral resolution and a large signal-to-noise ratio. However, when probing spin ensembles, dipolar interactions between the dopants can lead to a concentration-dependent trade-off between resolution and signal. Here, we fully eliminate this limitation of previous optical-echo-envelope-modulation spectroscopy experiments by integrating the emitters into a high-finesse resonator, which allows for strong optical echoes even at very low concentrations. To demonstrate its potential, the technique is applied to erbium dopants in yttrium-orthosilicate (Er:YSO). Achieving an unprecedented spectral resolution enables precise measurements of the superhyperfine interaction with four of the Y nuclear spins densely surrounding each emitter. The achieved boost of the signal, enabled by the resonator, allows for extending the approach to the lowest concentration possible -- to the level of single dopants, thereby providing a tool for detecting and studying individual nuclear spins. Thus, our technique paves the way for an improved understanding of dense nuclear spin baths in solids.</description>
