      <title>Oral Tradition-Encoded NanyinHGNN: Integrating Nanyin Music Preservation and Generation through a Pipa-Centric Dataset</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.26817</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.26817v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose NanyinHGNN, a heterogeneous graph network model for generating Nanyin instrumental music. As a UNESCO-recognized intangible cultural heritage, Nanyin follows a heterophonic tradition centered around the pipa, where core melodies are notated in traditional notation while ornamentations are passed down orally, presenting challenges for both preservation and contemporary innovation. To address this, we construct a Pipa-Centric MIDI dataset, develop NanyinTok as a specialized tokenization method, and convert symbolic sequences into graph structures using a Graph Converter to ensure that key musical features are preserved. Our key innovation reformulates ornamentation generation as the creation of ornamentation nodes within a heterogeneous graph. First, a graph neural network generates melodic outlines optimized for ornamentations. Then, a rule-guided system informed by Nanyin performance practices refines these outlines into complete ornamentations without requiring explicit ornamentation annotations during training. Experimental results demonstrate that our model successfully generates authentic heterophonic ensembles featuring four traditional instruments. These findings validate that integrating domain-specific knowledge into model architecture can effectively mitigate data scarcity challenges in computational ethnomusicology.</description>

      <title>GACA-DiT: Diffusion-based Dance-to-Music Generation with Genre-Adaptive Rhythm and Context-Aware Alignment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.26818</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.26818v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Dance-to-music (D2M) generation aims to automatically compose music that is rhythmically and temporally aligned with dance movements. Existing methods typically rely on coarse rhythm embeddings, such as global motion features or binarized joint-based rhythm values, which discard fine-grained motion cues and result in weak rhythmic alignment. Moreover, temporal mismatches introduced by feature downsampling further hinder precise synchronization between dance and music. To address these problems, we propose \textbf{GACA-DiT}, a diffusion transformer-based framework with two novel modules for rhythmically consistent and temporally aligned music generation. First, a \textbf{genre-adaptive rhythm extraction} module combines multi-scale temporal wavelet analysis and spatial phase histograms with adaptive joint weighting to capture fine-grained, genre-specific rhythm patterns. Second, a \textbf{context-aware temporal alignment} module resolves temporal mismatches using learnable context queries to align music latents with relevant dance rhythm features. Extensive experiments on the AIST++ and TikTok datasets demonstrate that GACA-DiT outperforms state-of-the-art methods in both objective metrics and human evaluation.

      <title>Cross-Corpus Validation of Speech Emotion Recognition in Urdu using Domain-Knowledge Acoustic Features</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.26823</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.26823v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Speech Emotion Recognition (SER) is a key affective computing technology that enables emotionally intelligent artificial intelligence. While SER is challenging in general, it is particularly difficult for low-resource languages such as Urdu. This study investigates Urdu SER in a cross-corpus setting, an area that has remained largely unexplored. We employ a cross-corpus evaluation framework across three different Urdu emotional speech datasets to test model generalization. Two standard domain-knowledge based acoustic feature sets, eGeMAPS and ComParE, are used to represent speech signals as feature vectors which are then passed to Logistic Regression and Multilayer Perceptron classifiers. Classification performance is assessed using unweighted average recall (UAR) whilst considering class-label imbalance. Results show that Self-corpus validation often overestimates performance, with UAR exceeding cross-corpus evaluation by up to 13%, underscoring that cross-corpus evaluation offers a more realistic measure of model robustness. Overall, this work emphasizes the importance of cross-corpus validation for Urdu SER and its implications contribute to advancing affective computing research for underrepresented language communities.</description>

      <title>Audio-Visual Speech Enhancement In Complex Scenarios With Separation And Dereverberation Joint Modeling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.26825</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.26825v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Audio-visual speech enhancement (AVSE) is a task that uses visual auxiliary information to extract a target speaker's speech from mixed audio. In real-world scenarios, there often exist complex acoustic environments, accompanied by various interfering sounds and reverberation. Most previous methods struggle to cope with such complex conditions, resulting in poor perceptual quality of the extracted speech. In this paper, we propose an effective AVSE system that performs well in complex acoustic environments. Specifically, we design a "separation before dereverberation" pipeline that can be extended to other AVSE networks. The 4th COGMHEAR Audio-Visual Speech Enhancement Challenge (AVSEC) aims to explore new approaches to speech processing in multimodal complex environments. We validated the performance of our system in AVSEC-4: we achieved excellent results in the three objective metrics on the competition leaderboard, and ultimately secured first place in the human subjective listening test.</description>

      <title>Expressive Range Characterization of Open Text-to-Audio Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.27102</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.27102v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Text-to-audio models are a type of generative model that produces audio output in response to a given textual prompt. Although level generators and the properties of the functional content that they create (e.g., playability) dominate most discourse in procedurally generated content (PCG), games that emotionally resonate with players tend to weave together a range of creative and multimodal content (e.g., music, sounds, visuals, narrative tone), and multimodal models have begun seeing at least experimental use for this purpose. However, it remains unclear what exactly such models generate, and with what degree of variability and fidelity: audio is an extremely broad class of output for a generative system to target.
  Within the PCG community, expressive range analysis (ERA) has been used as a quantitative way to characterize generators' output space, especially for level generators. This paper adapts ERA to text-to-audio models, making the analysis tractable by looking at the expressive range of outputs for specific, fixed prompts. Experiments are conducted by prompting the models with several standardized prompts derived from the Environmental Sound Classification (ESC-50) dataset. The resulting audio is analyzed along key acoustic dimensions (e.g., pitch, loudness, and timbre). More broadly, this paper offers a framework for ERA-based exploratory evaluation of generative audio models.</description>

      <title>Representing Classical Compositions through Implication-Realization Temporal-Gestalt Graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.27530</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.27530v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Understanding the structural and cognitive underpinnings of musical compositions remains a key challenge in music theory and computational musicology. While traditional methods focus on harmony and rhythm, cognitive models such as the Implication-Realization (I-R) model and Temporal Gestalt theory offer insight into how listeners perceive and anticipate musical structure. This study presents a graph-based computational approach that operationalizes these models by segmenting melodies into perceptual units and annotating them with I-R patterns. These segments are compared using Dynamic Time Warping and organized into k-nearest neighbors graphs to model intra- and inter-segment relationships.
  Each segment is represented as a node in the graph, and nodes are further labeled with melodic expectancy values derived from Schellenberg's two-factor I-R model-quantifying pitch proximity and pitch reversal at the segment level. This labeling enables the graphs to encode both structural and cognitive information, reflecting how listeners experience musical tension and resolution.
  To evaluate the expressiveness of these graphs, we apply the Weisfeiler-Lehman graph kernel to measure similarity between and within compositions. Results reveal statistically significant distinctions between intra- and inter-graph structures. Segment-level analysis via multidimensional scaling confirms that structural similarity at the graph level reflects perceptual similarity at the segment level. Graph2vec embeddings and clustering demonstrate that these representations capture stylistic and structural features that extend beyond composer identity.
  These findings highlight the potential of graph-based methods as a structured, cognitively informed framework for computational music analysis, enabling a more nuanced understanding of musical structure and style through the lens of listener perception.</description>

      <title>See the Speaker: Crafting High-Resolution Talking Faces from Speech with Prior Guidance and Region Refinement</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.26819</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.26819v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Unlike existing methods that rely on source images as appearance references and use source speech to generate motion, this work proposes a novel approach that directly extracts information from the speech, addressing key challenges in speech-to-talking face. Specifically, we first employ a speech-to-face portrait generation stage, utilizing a speech-conditioned diffusion model combined with statistical facial prior and a sample-adaptive weighting module to achieve high-quality portrait generation. In the subsequent speech-driven talking face generation stage, we embed expressive dynamics such as lip movement, facial expressions, and eye movements into the latent space of the diffusion model and further optimize lip synchronization using a region-enhancement module. To generate high-resolution outputs, we integrate a pre-trained Transformer-based discrete codebook with an image rendering network, enhancing video frame details in an end-to-end manner. Experimental results demonstrate that our method outperforms existing approaches on the HDTF, VoxCeleb, and AVSpeech datasets. Notably, this is the first method capable of generating high-resolution, high-quality talking face videos exclusively from a single speech input.</description>

      <title>Multi-Representation Attention Framework for Underwater Bioacoustic Denoising and Recognition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.26838</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.26838v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Automated monitoring of marine mammals in the St. Lawrence Estuary faces extreme challenges: calls span low-frequency moans to ultrasonic clicks, often overlap, and are embedded in variable anthropogenic and environmental noise. We introduce a multi-step, attention-guided framework that first segments spectrograms to generate soft masks of biologically relevant energy and then fuses these masks with the raw inputs for multi-band, denoised classification. Image and mask embeddings are integrated via mid-level fusion, enabling the model to focus on salient spectrogram regions while preserving global context. Using real-world recordings from the Saguenay St. Lawrence Marine Park Research Station in Canada, we demonstrate that segmentation-driven attention and mid-level fusion improve signal discrimination, reduce false positive detections, and produce reliable representations for operational marine mammal monitoring across diverse environmental conditions and signal-to-noise ratios. Beyond in-distribution evaluation, we further assess the generalization of Mask-Guided Classification (MGC) under distributional shifts by testing on spectrograms generated with alternative acoustic transformations. While high-capacity baseline models lose accuracy in this Out-of-distribution (OOD) setting, MGC maintains stable performance, with even simple fusion mechanisms (gated, concat) achieving comparable results across distributions. This robustness highlights the capacity of MGC to learn transferable representations rather than overfitting to a specific transformation, thereby reinforcing its suitability for large-scale, real-world biodiversity monitoring. We show that in all experimental settings, the MGC framework consistently outperforms baseline architectures, yielding substantial gains in accuracy on both in-distribution and OOD data.</description>

      <title>Beamforming in the Reproducing Kernel Domain Based on Spatial Differentiation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.27143</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.27143v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper proposes a novel beamforming framework in the reproducing kernel domain, derived from a unified interpretation of directional response as spatial differentiation of the sound field. By representing directional response using polynomial differential operators, the proposed method enables the formulation of arbitrary beam patterns including non-axisymmetric. The derivation of the reproducing kernel associated with the interior fields is mathematically supported by Hobson's theorem, which allows concise analytical expressions. Furthermore, the proposed framework generalizes conventional spherical harmonic domain beamformers by reinterpreting them as spatial differential operators, thereby clarifying their theoretical structure and extensibility. Three numerical simulations conducted in two-dimensional space confirm the validity of the method.</description>

      <title>Reference Microphone Selection for Guided Source Separation based on the Normalized L-p Norm</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.27198</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.27198v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Guided Source Separation (GSS) is a popular front-end for distant automatic speech recognition (ASR) systems using spatially distributed microphones. When considering spatially distributed microphones, the choice of reference microphone may have a large influence on the quality of the output signal and the downstream ASR performance. In GSS-based speech enhancement, reference microphone selection is typically performed using the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR), which is optimal for noise reduction but may neglect differences in early-to-late-reverberant ratio (ELR) across microphones. In this paper, we propose two reference microphone selection methods for GSS-based speech enhancement that are based on the normalized $\ell_p$-norm, either using only the normalized $\ell_p$-norm or combining the normalized $\ell_p$-norm and the SNR to account for both differences in SNR and ELR across microphones. Experimental evaluation using a CHiME-8 distant ASR system shows that the proposed $\ell_p$-norm-based methods outperform the baseline method, reducing the macro-average word error rate.</description>

      <title>UTI-LLM: A Personalized Articulatory-Speech Therapy Assistance System Based on Multimodal Large Language Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.13145</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.13145v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Speech therapy is essential for rehabilitating speech disorders caused by neurological impairments such as stroke. However, traditional manual and computer-assisted systems are limited in real-time accessibility and articulatory motion feedback. Recent advances in multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have demonstrated significant potential in healthcare, especially through their adaptive assessment and therapeutic feedback capabilities. Nevertheless, challenges including insufficient acquisition and fusion of articulatory information, inadequate parsing of articulatory organ motion trajectories, and the scarcity of domain-specific datasets hinder the application of MLLMs in speech therapy. To address these limitations, we propose an MLLM-based speech rehabilitation assistance system that leverages ultrasound tongue imaging and speech signals to deliver precise, interactive articulatory feedback. We construct a high-quality domain-specific dataset comprising ultrasound-speech dialogue pairs. This dataset facilitates fine-tuning to enhance the model's clinical adaptability. Furthermore, our method develops spatiotemporal fusion training strategy of ultrasound videos and speech signals, enabling fine-grained articulatory impairment analysis and ultimately generating actionable feedback. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of our model in articulatory analysis and clinical assessment.</description>

      <title>'Studies for': A Human-AI Co-Creative Sound Artwork Using a Real-time Multi-channel Sound Generation Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.25228</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.25228v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper explores the integration of AI technologies into the artistic workflow through the creation of Studies for, a generative sound installation developed in collaboration with sound artist Evala (https://www.ntticc.or.jp/en/archive/works/studies-for/). The installation employs SpecMaskGIT, a lightweight yet high-quality sound generation AI model, to generate and playback eight-channel sound in real-time, creating an immersive auditory experience over the course of a three-month exhibition. The work is grounded in the concept of a "new form of archive," which aims to preserve the artistic style of an artist while expanding beyond artists' past artworks by continued generation of new sound elements. This speculative approach to archival preservation is facilitated by training the AI model on a dataset consisting of over 200 hours of Evala's past sound artworks.
  By addressing key requirements in the co-creation of art using AI, this study highlights the value of the following aspects: (1) the necessity of integrating artist feedback, (2) datasets derived from an artist's past works, and (3) ensuring the inclusion of unexpected, novel outputs. In Studies for, the model was designed to reflect the artist's artistic identity while generating new, previously unheard sounds, making it a fitting realization of the concept of "a new form of archive." We propose a Human-AI co-creation framework for effectively incorporating sound generation AI models into the sound art creation process and suggest new possibilities for creating and archiving sound art that extend an artist's work beyond their physical existence.
