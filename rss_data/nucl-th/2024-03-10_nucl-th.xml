      <title>Electrical conductivity and shear viscosity of a pion gas in a thermo-magnetic medium</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.05165</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.05165v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We evaluate the electrical conductivity and shear viscosity of a interacting pion gas in a thermo-magnetic medium using the kinetic theory. The collision term of the relativistic Boltzmann transport equation in presence of background magnetic field is solved using the relaxation time approximation. The medium modified relaxation time is obtained from the corresponding in-medium $\pi\pi\rightarrow \pi\pi$ scattering cross-section calculated using the thermo-magnetic $\rho$ propagator. It is observed that the average relaxation time shows a $1/T^4$ variation with temperature for a fixed value of magnetic field. The relaxation time shows a mild oscillatory variation with respect to the magnetic field. It is also observed that the medium dependent scattering cross-section causes a considerable amount of influence on the electrical conductivity and shear viscosity compared to its vacuum counterpart.</description>

      <title>Shape of 12C</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.05287</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.05287v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We have examined the hypothesis by Bijker and Iachello who asserted that 12C has an internal structure with three alpha particles arranged in a triangular shape, leading to the formation of the ground rotational band consisting of 0+, 2+, 3-, 4$^\pm$ and 5- states. Following this idea, we reconstructed the intrinsic shape of 12C using experimental electron scattering data with minimal theoretical assumption. Our sole assumption was that the observed 0+, 2+, 3-, and 4+ states share a common internal structure, forming a rotational spectrum. The reconstructed intrinsic density showed a beautiful triangular shape with three peaks implying alpha cluster formation in the ground band.</description>

      <title>Confronting the Lippmann-Schwinger equation and the $N/D$ method for coupled-wave separable potentials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.05486</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.05486v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study a family of separable potentials with and without added contact interactions by solving the associated Lippmann-Schwinger equation with two coupled partial waves. The matching of the resulting amplitude matrix with the effective-range expansion is studied in detail. When a counterterm is included in the potential we also carefully discuss its renormalization. Next, we use the matrix $N/D$ method and study whether the amplitude matrices from the potentials considered admit an $N/D$ representation in matrix form. As a novel result we show that it is typically not possible to find such matrix representation for the coupled partial-wave case. However, a separate $N/D$ representation for each coupled partial wave, a valid option known in the literature, is explicitly implemented and numerically solved in cases where the matrix $N/D$ method is unavailable.</description>

      <title>Scaling of pre-equilibrium dilepton production in QCD Kinetic Theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.04846</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.04846v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We use QCD kinetic theory to compute dilepton production coming from the pre-equilibrium phase of the Quark-Gluon Plasma created in high-energy heavy-ion collisions. We demonstrate that the dilepton spectrum exhibits a simple scaling in terms of the specific shear viscosity $\eta/s$ and entropy density $dS/d\zeta \sim {\scriptstyle \left(T\tau^{1/3}\right)_\infty^{3/2}}$, which can be derived from dimensional analysis in the presence of a pre-equilibrium attractor. Based on this scaling we perform event-by-event calculations of in-medium dilepton production and determine the invariant mass range where the pre-equilibrium yield is the leading contribution.</description>

      <title>Phenomenological model for $\gamma\gamma^* \to K\bar{K}^*(892)$ constraining the $f_1(1420)$ transition form factor</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.05091</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.05091v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: To empirically evaluate the axial vector meson's contribution to the hadronic light-by-light contribution to the muon $g-2$, we present a phenomenological study of the $\gamma\gamma^*\to K\bar{K}^*(892)$ process by including the $s$-channel production of the $\eta(1475)$ and $f_1(1420)$ resonances. The non-resonant channel via $K$- and $K^*$-exchanges is investigated carefully by performing the Lorentz tensor decomposition and is constructed to yield a correct high-energy Regge behavior. The transition form factor of $f_1(1420)$ is adjusted to achieve a reasonable description of the existing L3 data. We estimate the polarized $\gamma\gamma^*\to K\bar{K}^*(892)$ cross sections, which serve as predictions for the forthcoming BESIII data. We also demonstrate the possibility to model-independently extract the transition form factors of $f_1(1420)$ from the polarized cross sections.</description>

      <title>Probabilistic neural networks for improved analyses with phenomenological models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.02623</link>
      <description>arXiv:2305.02623v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Physics models typically contain adjustable parameters to reproduce measured data. While some parameters correspond directly to measured features in the data, others are unobservable. These unobservables can, in some cases, cause ambiguities in the extraction of observables from measured data, or lead to questions on the physical interpretation of fits that require these extra parameters. We propose a method based on deep learning to extract values of observables directly from the data without the need for unobservables. The key to our approach is to label the training data for the deep learning model with only the observables. After training, the deep learning model can determine the values of observables from measured data with no ambiguities arising from unobservables. We demonstrate this method on the phenomenological R-matrix that is widely utilized in nuclear physics to extract resonance parameters from cross section data. Our deep learning model based on Transformers successfully predicts nuclear properties from measurements with no need for the channel radius and background pole parameters required in traditional R-matrix analyses. Details and limitations of this method, which may be useful for studies of a wide range of phenomena, are discussed.</description>

      <title>Asymptotic normalization coefficients for $\alpha+ {}^{12}{\rm C}$ synthesis and the $S$-factor for ${}^{12}{\rm C}(\alpha, \,\gamma){}^{16}{\rm O}$ radiative capture</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.20255</link>

Abstract: The $^{12}{\rm C}(\alpha,\gamma)^{16}$O reaction, determining the survival of carbon in red giants, is of interest for nuclear reaction theory and nuclear astrophysics. A specific feature of the $^{16}$O nuclear structure is the presence of two subthreshold bound states, (6.92 MeV, 2$^+$) and (7.12 MeV, 1$^-$), that dominate the behavior of the low-energy $S$-factor. The strength of these subthreshold states is determined by their asymptotic normalization coefficients (ANCs), which need to be known with high accuracy. Recently, using a model-independent extrapolation method, Blokhintsev {\it et al.} [Eur. Phys. J. A {\bf 59} (2023) 162] determined the ANCs for the $\alpha$-particle removal taking into account three subthreshold states in $^{16}$O. The goal of this paper is to address four main problems elucidating the impact of the subthreshold ANCs on the low-energy $S$-factor. Firstly, we analyse the connection between variations of the subthreshold ANCs and the low-energy $S$-factor, in particular, at the most effective energy of $300$ keV. Secondly, we calculate contributions to the $S(300\,{\rm keV})$-factor from the subthreshold $1^{-}$ and $2^{+}$ resonances, that are controlled by the subthreshold ANCs. We also evaluate the contribution of the uncertainties of the subthreshold ANCs to the budget of the low-energy $S$-factor uncertainty, especially, the $S(300\,{\rm keV})$-factor. Thirdly, we analyse interference of the subthreshold resonances (SRs) with higher resonances and with the $E1$ and $E2$ direct captures to the ground state. Finally, we investigate a correlated effect of the subthreshold and ground-state ANCs on the low-energy $S$-factor and, in particular, on the $S(300\,{\rm keV})$-factor.</description>

      <title>Effects of phase transition in hybrid stars from quark-meson coupling hadronic matter to deconfined quark matter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.08758</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.08758v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Different types of phase transition from hadron to quark at high density near zero temperature may occur in the inner core of hybrid stars. We investigate the impacts of phase transition types and quark models on properties of hybrid star and quark cores. The quark-meson coupling (QMC) model is used to describe hadronic matter, and the MIT bag model as well as the Nambu-Jona-Lasinio (NJL) model are employed to describe quark matter for comparison. From the mass-radius curves obtained by using equations of state (EOS), we find that EOSs of hadron matter have a decisive influence on the maximum mass of a hybrid star in the first-order phase transition case, while quark matter EOSs have more impacts on results in the crossover transition case. It is also found in the present work that the thermodynamic correction arising from an interpolation scheme considerably stiffens the EOSs. Therefore the crossover type phase transition generally leads to hybrid stars with higher masses. In particular, by using the QMC model and the NJL model to construct crossover EOSs with thermodynamic correction, we discover that the maximum masses of hybrid stars can meet the recent observational constraint on mass from PSR J0952-0607, i.e., $2.35\pm0.17M_\odot$.</description>

      <title>Non-equilibrium Green's function approach to low-energy fission dynamics</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.04255v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The concept of a compound nucleus was proposed by Bohr in 1936 to explain narrow resonances in neutron scattering off a nucleus. While a compound nucleus has been understood in terms of statistical mechanics, its description based on a many-body Hamiltonian has yet to be developed. Here we present a microscopic modeling of a compound nucleus starting from a nucleonic degree of freedom. We focus in particular on a decay of a heavy compound nucleus, that is, fission and radiative capture. To this end, we develop an approach based on a non-equilibrium Green's function, which is combined with a configuration interaction (CI) approach based on a constrained density-functional theory (DFT). We apply this approach to a barrier-top fission of $^{236}$U, restricting the model space to seniority zero configurations of neutrons and protons. Our calculation with a Skyrme energy functional yields the fission-to-capture branching ratio of around 0.07. While this value is still reasonable, the calculation underestimates the branching ratio by about a factor of 40 as compared to the empirical value, indicating a necessity of seniority non-zero configurations in the model space. We also find that the distribution of the fission probability approximately follows the chi-squared distribution with the number of degrees of freedom of the order of 1, which is consistent with the experimental finding.</description>

      <title>Towards three-dimensional nucleon structures at the Electron-Ion Collider in China: A study of the Sivers function</title>

Abstract: Transverse momentum-dependent parton distribution functions (TMDs) provide three-dimensional imaging of the nucleon in the momentum space. With its fundamental importance in understanding the spin structure of the nucleon, the precise measurement of TMDs is considered as one of the main physics topics of the proposed Electron-Ion Collider in China (EicC). In this paper, we investigate the impact of future semi-inclusive deep inelastic scattering (SIDIS) data from EicC on the extraction of TMDs. Taking the Sivers function as an example, we revisited the world SIDIS data, which serves as the input for the simulated EicC data. By performing a combined analysis of the world data and the EicC simulated data, we quantitatively demonstrate that the Sivers functions can be precisely determined for various quark flavors, especially for sea quarks, in the region, $x&gt;0.005$, directly covered by the EicC.</description>

Abstract: We study the heavy quark energy loss in the presence of a background magnetic field. The analysis considers the high magnetic field generated by spectators from initial hard collisions that were incorporated using the medium-modified Debye mass, determined from quark condensates at finite temperature and magnetic field via recent lattice quantum chromodynamics (LQCD) calculations. We analyse the impact of medium polarization on the heavy quark propagation in a quark-gluon plasma formed in relativistic heavy-ion colliders like RHIC and LHC. For simplification, we considered the static medium with constant temperature and magnetic field values. Then, we explore the nuclear modification factor ($R_{AA}$) at different magnitudes of magnetic field strengths at fixed temperatures. The energy loss of heavy quarks significantly increases, leading to $R_{AA}$ suppression at higher magnetic field values</description>

      <description>arXiv:2307.07021v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We show that volume-preserving diffomorphisms and the chemical shift symmetry defining relativistic lagrangian ideal fluid dynamics can be derived as an emerging symmetry when ergodicity is assumed to apply locally in a way that is invariant under smooth spacetime foliations. This can be used as a way to derive the ideal hydrodynamic limit in a strongly coupled but strongly fluctuating medium.
  We comment on the connection with thermalization in small systems, the Eigenstate thermalization hypothesis and deviations from the ideal limit.</description>

      <title>State-Specific Coupled-Cluster Methods for Excited States</title>

      <description>arXiv:2401.05048v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We reexamine $\Delta$CCSD, a state-specific coupled-cluster (CC) with single and double excitations (CCSD) approach that targets excited states through the utilization of non-Aufbau determinants. This methodology is particularly efficient when dealing with doubly excited states, a domain where the standard equation-of-motion CCSD (EOM-CCSD) formalism falls short. Our goal here is to evaluate the effectiveness of $\Delta$CCSD when applied to other types of excited states, comparing its consistency and accuracy with EOM-CCSD. To this end, we report a benchmark on excitation energies computed with the $\Delta$CCSD and EOM-CCSD methods, for a set of molecular excited-state energies that encompasses not only doubly excited states but also doublet-doublet transitions and (singlet and triplet) singly-excited states of closed-shell systems. In the latter case, we rely on a minimalist version of multireference CC known as the two-determinant CCSD method to compute the excited states. Our dataset, consisting of 276 excited states stemming from the \textsc{quest} database [V\'eril \textit{et al.}, \textit{WIREs Comput. Mol. Sci.} \textbf{2021}, 11, e1517], provides a significant base to draw general conclusions concerning the accuracy of $\Delta$CCSD. Except for the doubly-excited states, we found that $\Delta$CCSD underperforms EOM-CCSD. For doublet-doublet transitions, the difference between the mean absolute errors (MAEs) of the two methodologies (of \SI{0.10}{\eV} and \SI{0.07}{\eV}) is less pronounced than that obtained for singly-excited states of closed-shell systems (MAEs of \SI{0.15}{\eV} and \SI{0.08}{\eV}). This discrepancy is largely attributed to a greater number of excited states in the latter set exhibiting multiconfigurational characters, which are more challenging for $\Delta$CCSD.</description>

Abstract: Despite its role in the continuing evolution of the Universe, only a small fraction of the mass of visible material can be attributed to the Higgs boson alone. The overwhelmingly dominant share may/should arise from the strong interactions that act in the heart of nuclear matter; namely, those described by quantum chromodynamics. This contribution describes how studying and explaining the attributes of pseudoscalar mesons can open an insightful window onto understanding the origin of mass in the Standard Model and how these insights inform our knowledge of hadron structure. The survey ranges over distribution amplitudes and functions, electromagnetic and gravitational form factors, light-front wave functions, and generalized parton distributions. Advances made using continuum Schwinger function methods and their relevance for experimental efforts are highlighted.</description>

      <title>Dynamical tidal response of non-rotating relativistic stars</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.03254</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.03254v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Accurately modeling the tidal response of neutron stars is crucial to connecting gravitational wave observations of binaries to ultra-dense nuclear physics. Most current models of the tidal response of relativistic stars either assume a static response model, or use phenomenological models inspired by Newtonian gravity. In this work, we present a general formalism for computing the linear dynamical tidal response function of relativistic, spherically symmetric stars. Our formalism incorporates stratification due to thermal and chemical imbalances, allowing one to study the effects of g modes on the tidal response function. We also describe how to incorporate sources of dissipation due to shear and bulk viscosity. To showcase the utility of our approach, we present several applications for polytropic stars in general relativity. We show how our formalism can capture the dynamical tidal resonance due to the f and g modes of inviscid stars and explore the sensitivity of the dynamical tidal response to the compactness of the star. We also compute the dissipative tidal deformability due to bulk and shear viscous dissipation. We find that, for the same viscous profile, the shear viscous tidal lag parameter is 100-1000 times larger than the dimensionless bulk viscous tidal lag parameter.</description>
