      <title>High temperature transport in the one dimensional mass-imbalanced Fermi-Hubbard model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.08076</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.08076v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study transport in the one-dimensional mass-imbalanced Fermi-Hubbard model at infinite temperature, focusing on the case of strong interactions. Prior theoretical and experimental investigations have revealed unconventionally long transport timescales, with complications due to strong finite size effects. We compute the dynamical current-current correlation function directly in the thermodynamic limit using infinite tensor network techniques. We show that transport in the strong-imbalance limit is dominated by AC resonances, which we compute with an analytic expansion. We study the dephasing of these resonances with mass imbalance, $\eta$. In the small-imbalance limit, the model is nearly integrable. We connect these unusual limits by computing the DC conductivity and transport decay time as a function of $\eta$ and the interaction strength $U/t$. We propose an experimental protocol to measure these correlation functions in cold atom experiments.</description>

      <title>Probing spontaneously symmetry-broken phases with spin-charge separation through noise correlation measurements</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.08374</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.08374v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Spontaneously symmetry-broken (SSB) phases are locally ordered states of matter characterizing a large variety of physical systems. Because of their specific ordering, their presence is usually witnessed by means of local order parameters. Here, we propose an alternative approach based on statistical correlations of noise after the ballistic expansion of an atomic cloud. We indeed demonstrate that probing such noise correlators allows one to discriminate among different SSB phases characterized by spin-charge separation. As a particular example, we test our prediction on a 1D extended Fermi-Hubbard model, where the competition between local and nonlocal couplings gives rise to three different SSB phases: a charge density wave, a bond-ordering wave, and an antiferromagnet. Our numerical analysis shows that this approach can accurately capture the presence of these different SSB phases, thus representing an alternative and powerful strategy to characterize strongly interacting quantum matter.</description>

      <title>Floquet-driven crossover from density-assisted tunneling to enhanced pair tunneling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.08482</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.08482v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the experimental control of pair tunneling in a double-well potential using Floquet engineering. We demonstrate a crossover from a regime with density-assisted tunneling to dominant pair tunneling by tuning the effective interactions. Furthermore, we show that the pair tunneling rate can be enhanced not only compared to the Floquet-reduced single-particle tunneling but even beyond the static superexchange rate, while keeping the effective interaction in a relevant range. This opens possibilities to realize models with explicit pair tunneling in ultracold atomic systems.</description>

      <title>Dissecting Quantum Many-body Chaos in the Krylov Space</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.08207</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.08207v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The growth of simple operators is essential for the emergence of chaotic dynamics and quantum thermalization. Recent studies have proposed different measures, including the out-of-time-order correlator and Krylov complexity. It is established that the out-of-time-order correlator serves as the signature of quantum many-body chaos, while the Krylov complexity provides its upper bound. However, there exist non-chaotic systems in which Krylov complexity grows exponentially, indicating that the Krylov complexity itself is not a witness of many-body chaos. In this letter, we introduce the missing ingredient, named as the Krylov metric $K_{mn}$, which probes the size of the Krylov basis. We propose that the universal criteria for fast scramblers include (i) the exponential growth of Krylov complexity, (ii) the diagonal elements $K_{nn}\sim n^h$ with $h\in(0,1]$, and (iii) the negligibility of off-diagonal elements $K_{mn}$ with $m\neq n$. We further show that $h=\varkappa / 2\alpha$ is a ratio between the quantum Lyapunov exponent $\varkappa$ and the Krylov exponent $\alpha$. This proposal is supported by both generic arguments and explicit examples, including solvable SYK models, Luttinger Liquids, and many-body localized systems. Our results provide a refined understanding of how chaotic dynamics emerge from the Krylov space perspective.</description>

      <title>Fractal spectrum in twisted bilayer optical lattice</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.08211</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.08211v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The translation symmetry of a lattice is greatly modified when subjected to a perpendicular magnetic field [Zak, Phys. Rev. \textbf{134}, A1602 (1964)]. This change in symmetry can lead to magnetic unit cells that are substantially larger than the original ones. Similarly, the translation properties of a double-layered lattice alters drastically while two monolayers are relatively twisted by a small angle, resulting in large-scale moir\'{e} unit cells. Intrigued by the resemblance, we calculate the complete band structures of a twisted bilayer optical lattice and show that the geometric moir\'{e} effect can induce fractal band structures. The fractals are controlled by the twist angle between two monolayers and are closely connected to the celebrated butterfly spectrum of two-dimensional Bloch electrons in a magnetic field [Hofstadter, Phys. Rev. B \textbf{14}, 2239 (1976)]. We demonstrate this by proving that the twisted bilayer optical lattice can be mapped to a generalized Hofstadter's model with long-range hopping. Furthermore, we provide numerical evidence on the infinite recursive structures of the spectrum and give an algorithm for computing these structures.</description>

      <title>Scaling regimes of the one-dimensional phase turbulence in the deterministic complex Ginzburg-Landau equation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.08530</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.08530v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the phase turbulence of the one-dimensional complex Ginzburg-Landau equation, in which the defect-free chaotic dynamics of the order parameter maps to a phase equation well approximated by the Kuramoto-Sivashinsky model. In this regime, the behaviour of the large wavelength modes is captured by the Kardar-Parisi-Zhang equation, determining universal scaling and statistical properties. We present numerical evidence of the existence of an additional scale-invariant regime, with dynamical scaling exponent $z=1$, emerging at scales which are intermediate between the microscopic, intrinsic to the modulational instability, and the macroscopic ones. We argue that this new regime is a signature of the universality class corresponding to the inviscid limit of the Kardar-Parisi-Zhang equation.</description>

      <title>Magnetism in the two-dimensional dipolar XY model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.03673</link>
      <description>arXiv:2305.03673v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Motivated by a recent experiment on a square-lattice Rydberg atom array realizing a long-range dipolar XY model [Chen et al., Nature (2023)], we numerically study the model's equilibrium properties. We obtain the phase diagram, critical properties, entropies, variance of the magnetization, and site-resolved correlation functions. We consider both ferromagnetic and antiferromagnetic interactions and apply quantum Monte Carlo and pseudo-Majorana functional renormalization group techniques, generalizing the latter to a U(1) symmetric setting. Our simulations perform extensive thermometry for the first time in dipolar Rydberg atom arrays and establish conditions for adiabaticity and thermodynamic equilibrium. On the ferromagnetic side of the experiment, we determine the entropy per particle S/N~0.5, close to the one at the critical temperature, S_c/N = 0.585(15). The simulations suggest the presence of an out-of-equilibrium plateau at large distances in the correlation function, thus motivating future studies on the non-equilibrium dynamics of the system.</description>

      <title>Coherence measurements of polaritons in thermal equilibrium reveal a power law for two-dimensional condensates</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.05100</link>
      <description>arXiv:2308.05100v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We have created a spatially homogeneous polariton condensate in thermal equilibrium, up to very high condensate fraction. Under these conditions, we have measured the coherence as a function of momentum, and determined the total coherent fraction of this boson system from very low density up to density well above the condensation transition. These measurements reveal a consistent power law for the coherent fraction as a function of the total density over nearly three orders of its magnitude. The same power law is seen in numerical simulations solving the two-dimensional Gross-Pitaevskii equation for the equilibrium coherence. This power law has not been predicted by prior analytical theories.</description>

      <title>Emergence of new optical resonances in single-layer transition metal dichalcogenides with atomic-size phase patterns</title>

      <description>arXiv:2209.12873v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Atomic-scale control of light-matter interactions represent the ultimate frontier for many applications in photonics and quantum technology. Two-dimensional semiconductors, including transition metal dichalcogenides, are a promising platform to achieve such control due to the combination of an atomically thin geometry and convenient photophysical properties. Here, we demonstrate that a variety of durable polymorphic structures can be combined to generate additional optical resonances beyond the standard excitons. We theoretically predict and experimentally show that atomic-sized patches of 1T phase within the 1H matrix form unique electronic bands that give rise to new and robust optical resonances with strong absorption, circularly polarized emission and long radiative lifetime. The atomic manipulation of two-dimensional semiconductors opens unexplored scenarios for light harvesting devices and exciton-based photonics.</description>

      <title>Volume-entangled exact eigenstates in the PXP and related models in any dimension</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.05515</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.05515v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this work, we report first exact volume-entangled Einstein-Podolsky-Rosen (EPR) type scar states hosted by PXP and related Hamiltonians corresponding to various geometric configurations of Rydberg-blockaded atom systems, including the most extensively studied ones such as the chain with periodic boundary conditions (PBC) and square lattice. We start by introducing a new zero-energy eigenstate of the PBC chain and proceed by generalizing it to a wide variety of geometries and Hamiltonians. We point out the experimental relevance of such states by providing a concrete and feasible protocol for their preparation on near-term Rydberg quantum devices, which relies only on strictly local measurements and evolution under native Hamiltonians. We also demonstrate the utility of these states for the study of quantum dynamics by describing a simple protocol for measuring infinite-temperature out-of-time-order correlator (OTOC) functions.</description>
