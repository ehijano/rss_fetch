      <title>Stability of dipolar bosons in a quasiperiodic potential</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.04429</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.04429v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quasiperiodic potentials and dipolar interactions each impose long-range order in quantum systems, but their interplay unlocks a rich landscape of unexplored quantum phases. In this work, we investigate how dipolar bosonic crystals respond to correlated disorder in the form of quasiperiodic potentials. Using exact numerical simulations and a suite of observables - including order parameters, energy, density distributions, and two-body coherence measures - we explore one-dimensional dipolar bosons in quasiperiodic lattices at both commensurate and incommensurate fillings. Our results reveal a complex competition between superfluid, Mott insulator, density-wave, and crystalline phases, governed by the intricate balance of dipolar interactions, kinetic energy, and disorder strength. Crucially, we identify mechanisms that influence dipolar crystals, showing their surprising robustness even in the presence of strong quasiperiodic disorder. Strikingly, we challenge previous claims by demonstrating that a kinetic crystal phase - expected to precede full crystallization - does not emerge in the ground state. Instead, its traits appear only under moderate disorder, but never fully develop, giving way to a direct transition from a charge density wave to a crystal state. These findings provide new insights into the resilience of many-body quantum phases in complex environments and pave the way for engineering exotic quantum states in ultracold atomic systems.</description>

      <title>Dipole-Mode Spectrum and Hydrodynamic Crossover in a Resonantly Interacting Two-Species Fermion Mixture</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.05006</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.05006v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Ultracold quantum-gas mixtures of fermionic atoms with resonant control of interactions offer a unique test-bed to explore few- and many-body quantum states with unconventional properties. The emergence of such strongly correlated systems, as for instance symmetry-broken superfluids, is usually accompanied by hydrodynamic collective behavior. Thus, experimental progress in this field naturally requires a deep understanding of hydrodynamic regimes. Here, we report on experiments employing a tunable Fermi-Fermi mixture of $^{161}$Dy and $^{40}$K near quantum degeneracy. We investigate the full spectrum of dipole modes across a Feshbach resonance and characterize the crossover from collisionless to deep hydrodynamic behavior in measurements of frequencies and damping rates. We compare our results with a theoretical model that considers the motion of the mass centers of the two species and we identify the contributions of friction and mean-field interaction. We show that one oscillating mode exists over the whole range of interactions, exhibiting striking changes of frequency and damping in the deep hydrodynamic regime. We observe the second oscillating mode to split into two purely exponential damping modes. One of these exponential modes shows very fast damping, faster than any other relevant timescale, and is largely insensitive against experimental imperfections. It provides an accurate measure for the interspecies drag effect, which generalizes the concept of spin drag explored in other experiments. We characterize the interspecies drag locally in terms of a microscopic friction coefficient and we discuss its unitarity-limited universal behavior on top of the resonance.</description>

      <title>Fluctuation thermometry of an atom-resolved quantum gas: Beyond the fluctuation-dissipation theorem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.05132</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.05132v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Thermometry is essential for studying many-body physics with ultracold atoms. Accurately measuring low temperatures in these systems, however, remains a significant challenge due to the absence of a universal thermometer. Most widely applicable methods, such as fitting of in-situ density profiles or standard fluctuation thermometry, are limited by the requirement of global thermal equilibrium and inapplicability to homogeneous systems. In this work, we introduce a novel in-situ thermometry for quantum gases, leveraging single-atom resolved measurements via quantum gas microscopy, and demonstrate it on an ideal Fermi gas. By analyzing number fluctuations in probe volumes with approximately one atom on average, we extract both global and local temperatures over a broad dynamic range. Unlike traditional fluctuation thermometry, our method does not rely on the fluctuation-dissipation theorem and is based instead on the exact relationship between number fluctuations and density-density correlations. In the low-temperature regime, it allows us to observe significant deviations from fluctuation-dissipation predictions, uncovering sub-extensive fluctuations. Our method is applicable to systems with arbitrary trapping potentials, requiring neither precise trap calibration nor global thermal equilibrium. This nearly universal thermometer for quantum gases overcomes key limitations of existing techniques, paving the way for more accurate and versatile temperature measurements in ultracold quantum systems.</description>

      <title>Vibrationally Assisted Exciton Transfer in Open Quantum Systems with Long-Range Interactions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.04383</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.04383v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The interplay between coherence and system-environment interactions is at the basis of a wide range of phenomena, from quantum information processing to charge and energy transfer in molecular systems, biomolecules, and photochemical materials. In this work, we use a Frenkel-exciton model with long-range interacting qubits coupled to a damped collective bosonic mode to investigate vibrationally assisted transfer processes in donor-acceptor systems featuring internal substructures analogous to light-harvesting complexes. We find that certain delocalized excitonic states maximize the transfer rate and that the entanglement is preserved during the dissipative transfer over a wide range of parameters. We investigate the transfer reduction by static disorder and by finite temperature and study how transfer efficiency scales as a function of the number of dimerized monomers and the component number of each monomer, finding which excitonic states lead to optimal transfer. Finally, we provide a realistic experimental setting to realize this model in analog trapped-ion quantum simulators. Analog quantum simulation of systems comprising many and increasingly complex monomers could offer valuable insights into the design of light-harvesting materials, particularly in the non-perturbative intermediate parameter regime examined in this study, where classical simulation methods are resource-intensive.</description>

      <title>Chiral Instabilities in Driven-Dissipative Quantum Liquids</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.04443</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.04443v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the nonequilibrium dynamics of periodically driven Tomonaga-Luttinger liquids (TLLs) coupled to a thermal bath using a Floquet-Lindblad approach. When the coupling to the bath satisfies detailed balance, we obtain a condition for parametric instabilities to be suppressed, symmetrically for both chiralities. Remarkably, by designing a purely chiral coupling to the bath, instead of instability suppression, we uncover a driven-dissipative phase transition between the former symmetric parametric instability and a new chiral parametric instability. In the latter, a single chirality of bosonic quasiparticles gets exponentially amplified, leading to a dynamical chiral imbalance within the TLL, reminiscent of the non-Hermitian skin effect.</description>

      <title>Generalized $\eta$-pairing theory and anomalous localization in non-Hermitian systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.04559</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.04559v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: By generalizing the eta-pairing theory to non-Hermitian Hubbard models on arbitrary lattices, we obtain the sufficient and necessary condition for the eta-pairing operator to be an eigenoperator of the Hamiltonian $H$, and find unique eta-pairing phenomena without Hermitian analogs. For instance, the Hermitian conjugate of an eta-pairing eigenoperator may not be an eigenoperator, eta-pairing eigenoperators can be spatially modulated, and the $SU(2)$ pseudospin symmetry may not be respected even if $H$ commutes with the eta-pairing operators. Remarkably, these novel non-Hermitian phenomena are closely related to each other by several theorems we establish and can lead to, e.g., the notion of non-Hermitian angular-momentum operators and the anomalous localization of eta-pairing eigenstates. Some issues on the $SO(4)$ and particle-hole symmetries are clarified. Our general eta-pairing theory also reveals a previously unnoticed unification of these symmetries of the Hubbard model. To exemplify these findings, we propose the Hatano-Nelson-Hubbard model. In this interacting non-Hermitian system without even the bulk translation invariance, the right and left two-particle eta-pairing eigenstates are exponentially localized at opposite boundaries of the chain. We then generalize this model to two dimensions and find that the eta-pairing eigenstate can exhibit the first- or second-order skin effect. Thus, eta-pairing may represent a new mechanism for skin effects in interacting non-Hermitian systems, even in higher dimensions and without the bulk translation symmetry. To realize all of the non-Hermitian eta-pairing phenomena, we construct a general two-sublattice model defined on an arbitrary lattice, which can exhibit anomalous localization of eta-pairing eigenstates; besides, this model can reveal the eta-pairing structure [e.g., the $SO(4)$ symmetry] in systems with Hermitian hoppings.</description>

      <title>Experimental realization of a SU(3) color-orbit coupling in an ultracold gas</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.04714</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.04714v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Spin-orbit interaction couples the spin of a particle to its motion and leads to spin-induced transport phenomena such as spin-Hall effects and Chern insulators. In this work, we extend the concept of internal-external state coupling to higher internal symmetry, exploring features beyond the established spin-orbit regime. We couple suitable resonant laser beams to a gas of ultracold atoms, thereby inducing artificial SU(3) non-Abelian gauge fields that act on a degenerate ground state manifold comprised of three dark states. We demonstrate the inherent all-state connectivity of SU(3) systems by performing targeted geometric transformations. Then, we investigate color-orbit coupling, an extension of SU(2) spin-orbit coupling to SU(3) systems. We reveal a rich dynamical interplay between three distinct oscillation frequencies, which possesses interesting analogies with neutrino oscillations and quark mixing mechanisms. In the future, the system should provide a testbed for exploring topological properties of SU(3) systems.</description>

      <title>Geometric origin of self-intersection points in non-Hermitian energy spectra</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.04755</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.04755v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Unlike Hermitian systems, non-Hermitian energy spectra under periodic boundary conditions can form closed loops in the complex energy plane, a phenomenon known as point gap topology. In this paper, we investigate the self-intersection points of such non-Hermitian energy spectra and reveal their geometric origins. We rigorously demonstrate that these self-intersection points result from the intersection of the auxiliary generalized Brillouin zone and the Brillouin zone in one-band systems, as confirmed by an extended Hatano-Nelson model. This finding is further generalized to multi-band systems, illustrated through a non-Hermitian Su-Schrieffer-Heeger model. Moreover, we address multiple self-intersection points and derive the geometric conditions for general n-fold self-intersection points. Our results enhance the fundamental understanding of generic non-Hermitian quantum systems and provide theoretical support for further experimental investigations of energy self-intersection points.</description>

      <title>Anomalous Knudsen effect signaling long-lived modes in 2D electron gases</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.04880</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.04880v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Proper analysis of electron collisions in two spatial dimensions leads to the conclusion, that the odd harmonics of the electron distribution function decay much slower than the even ones at finite temperatures. The number of long-lived odd harmonics quickly shrinks with increasing temperature. Focusing on a channel geometry with boundary scattering, we show that such behavior of the odd decay rates leads to a characteristic behaviour of the conductance that we dub anomalous Knudsen effect: it initially grows with temperature but then starts to decrease, forming a peak. Further increase of the temperature forces the conductance to grow again due to the Gurzhi effect, associated with the crossover from ballistic to hydrodynamic transport. The simultaneous observation of the Gurzhi dip preceded by the anomalous Knudsen peak constitutes a particular signature of the long-lived modes in 2D electron transport at low temperatures.</description>

      <title>Programming optical-lattice Fermi-Hubbard quantum simulators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.05067</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.05067v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Fermionic atoms in optical lattices provide a native implementation of Fermi-Hubbard (FH) models that can be used as analog quantum simulators of many-body fermionic systems. Recent experimental advances include the time-dependent local control of chemical potentials and tunnelings, and thus enable to operate this platform digitally as a programmable quantum simulator. Here, we explore these opportunities and develop ground-state preparation algorithms for different fermionic models, based on the ability to implement both single-particle and many-body, high-fidelity fermionic gates, as provided by the native FH Hamiltonian. In particular, we first design variational, pre-compiled quantum circuits to prepare the ground state of the natively implemented FH model, with significant speedups relative to competing adiabatic protocols. Besides, the versatility of this variational approach enables to target extended FH models, i.e., including terms that are not natively realized on the platform. As an illustration, we include next-nearest-neighbor tunnelings at finite dopings, relevant in the context of $d$-wave superconductivity. Furthermore, we discuss how to approximate the imaginary-time evolution using variational fermionic circuits, both as an alternative state-preparation strategy, and as a subroutine for the Quantum Lanczos algorithm to further improve the energy estimation. We benchmark our protocols for ladder geometries, though they can be readily applied to 2D experimental setups to address regimes beyond the capabilities of current classical methods. These results pave the way for more efficient and comprehensive explorations of relevant many-body phases with existing programmable fermionic quantum simulators.</description>
