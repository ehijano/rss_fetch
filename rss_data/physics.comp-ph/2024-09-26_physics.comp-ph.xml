      <title>High-Performance Implementation of the Optimized Event Generator for Strong-Field QED Plasma Simulations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.17299</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.17299v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Numerical simulation of strong-field quantum electrodynamics (SFQED) processes is an essential step towards current and future high-intensity laser experiments. The complexity of SFQED phenomena and their stochastic nature make them extremely computationally challenging, requiring the use of supercomputers for realistic simulations. Recently, we have presented a novel approach to numerical simulation of SFQED processes based on an accurate approximation of precomputed rates, which minimizes the number of rate calculations per QED event. The current paper is focused on the high-performance implementation of this method, including vectorization of resource-intensive kernels and improvement of parallel computing efficiency. Using two codes, PICADOR and hi-$\chi$ (the latter being free and publicly available), we demonstrate significant reduction in computation time due to these improvements. We hope that the proposed approach can be applied in other codes for the numerical simulation of SFQED processes.</description>

      <title>Generalised tangent stabilised nonlinear elasticity: An automated framework for controlling material and geometric instabilities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.17822</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.17822v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Tangent stabilised large strain isotropic elasticity was recently proposed by Poya et al. [1] wherein by working directly with principal stretches the entire eigenstructure of constitutive and geometric/initial stiffness terms were found in closed-form, giving fresh insights into exact convexity conditions of highly non-convex functions in discrete settings. Consequently, owing to these tangent eigenvalues an analytic tangent stabilisation was proposed bypassing incumbent numerical approaches routinely used in nonlinear finite element analysis. This formulation appears to be extremely robust for quasi-static simulation of complex deformations even with no load increments and time stepping while still capturing instabilities automatically in ways that are infeasible for path-following techniques in practice. In this work, we generalise the notion of tangent stabilised elasticity to virtually all known invariant formulations of nonlinear elasticity. We show that, closed-form eigen-decomposition of tangents is easily available irrespective of invariant formulation or integrity basis. In particular, we work out closed-form tangent eigensystems for isotropic Total Lagrangian deformation gradient (F )-based and right Cauchy-Green (C)-based as well as Updated Lagrangian left Cauchy-Green (b)-based formulations and present their exact convexity conditions postulated in terms of their corresponding tangent and initial stiffness eigenvalues. In addition, we introduce the notion of geometrically stabilised polyconvex large strain elasticity for models that are materially stable but exhibit geometric instabilities for whom we construct their initial stiffness in a spectrally-decomposed form analytically. We further extend this framework to the case of transverse isotropy where once again, closed-form tangent eigensystems are found for common transversely isotropic invariants.</description>

      <title>X-ray multiple-beam (n-baem) dynamical diffraction theories, numerical methods to solve them and experimental verification by using the synchrotron X-rays</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.17211</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.17211v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Behavior of X-rays diffracted in a perfect or quasi-perfect crystal can be described by the dynamical theory of X-ray diffraction. Study on the two-beam cases in which only transmitted and one reflected X-ray beams are strong has a history of one hundred years. However, the population of researchers who study on the multiple-beam cases (n-beam cases) in which more than two beams are simultaneously strong is small. The present author has derived the Takagi-Taupin (T-T) dynamical theory that can be applied to the n-beam cases, coded the computer programs to solve it and experimentally verified them by using the synchrotron X-rays. The equivalence between the Ewald-Laue (E-L) and the T-T dynamical theories described by the Fourier transform also for the n-beam cases is explicitly verified in the present paper. Further, the methods of the computer simulations and the experiments are also described.
  Furthermore, a hypothesis concerning the too large values of R-factor in protein crystallography is also described. This might be extremely important in protein crystallography in the future.</description>

      <title>Boundary layer stability and transition analysis using the nonlinear One-Way Navier-Stokes approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.17274</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.17274v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We extend the One-Way Navier Stokes (OWNS) approach to support nonlinear interactions between waves of different frequencies, which will enable nonlinear analysis of instability and transition. In OWNS, the linearized Navier-Stokes equations are parabolized and solved in the frequency domain as a spatial initial-value (marching) problem. OWNS yields a reduced computational cost compared to direct numerical simulation (DNS), while also conferring numerous advantages over the parabolized stability equations (PSE), despite its higher computational cost relative to PSE, that we seek to extend to nonlinear analysis. We validate the nonlinear OWNS (NOWNS) method by examining nonlinear evolution of two- and three-dimensional disturbances in a low-speed Blasius boundary layer compared to nonlinear PSE (NPSE) and DNS results from the literature. We demonstrate that NOWNS supports non-modal instabilities, is more robust to numerical noise, and converges for stronger nonlinearities, as compared to NPSE.</description>

      <title>Linear stability analysis of wall-bounded high-pressure transcritical fluids</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.17310</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.17310v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Mixing and heat transfer rates are typically enhanced when operating at high-pressure transcritical turbulent flow regimes. The rapid variation of thermophysical properties in the vicinity of the pseudo-boiling region can be leveraged to significantly increase the Reynolds numbers and destabilize the flow. The underlying physical mechanism responsible for this destabilization is the presence of a baroclinic torque mainly driven by large localized density gradients across the pseudo-boiling line. As a result, the enstrophy levels are enhanced compared to equivalent low-pressure cases, and the flow physics behavior deviates from standard wall turbulence characteristics. In this work, the nature of this instability is carefully analyzed and characterized by means of linear stability theory. It is found that, at isothermal wall-bounded transcritical conditions, the non-linear thermodynamics exhibited near the pseudo-boiling region propitiates the laminar-to-turbulent transition with respect to sub- and super-critical thermodynamic states. This transition is further exacerbated for non-isothermal flows even at low Brinkman numbers. Particularly, neutral curve sensitivity to Brinkman numbers and perturbation profiles of dynamic and thermodynamic unstable modes based on modal and non-modal analysis, which trigger the early flow destabilization, confirm this phenomenon. Nonetheless, a non-isothermal setup is a necessary condition for transition when operating at low-Mach/Reynolds-number regimes. In detail, on equal Brinkman number, turbulence transition is accelerated and algebraic growth enhanced in comparison to isothermal cases. Consequently, high-pressure transcritical setups result in larger kinetic energy budgets due to larger production rates and lower viscous dissipation.</description>

      <title>Efficient and stable time integration of Cahn-Hilliard equations: explicit, implicit and explicit iterative schemes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.17736</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.17736v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: To solve the Cahn-Hilliard equation numerically, a new time integration algorithm is proposed, which is based on a combination of the Eyre splitting and the local iteration modified (LIM) scheme. The latter is employed to tackle the implicit system arising each time integration step. The proposed method is gradient-stable and allows to use large time steps, whereas, regarding its computational structure, it is an explicit time integration scheme. Numerical tests are presented to demonstrate abilities of the new method and to compare it with other time integration methods for Cahn-Hilliard equation.</description>

Abstract: All-atom molecular simulations offer detailed insights into macromolecular phenomena, but their substantial computational cost hinders the exploration of complex biological processes. We introduce Advanced Machine-learning Atomic Representation Omni-force-field (AMARO), a new neural network potential (NNP) that combines an O(3)-equivariant message-passing neural network architecture, TensorNet, with a coarse-graining map that excludes hydrogen atoms. AMARO demonstrates the feasibility of training coarser NNP, without prior energy terms, to run stable protein dynamics with scalability and generalization capabilities.</description>

      <title>Theoretical and numerical comparison between the pseudopotential and the free energy lattice Boltzmann methods</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.11167</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.11167v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The pseudopotential and free energy models are two popular extensions of the lattice Boltzmann method for multiphase flows. Until now, they have been developed apart from each other in the literature. However, important questions about whether each method performs better needs to be solved. In this work, we perform a theoretical and numerical comparison between both methods. This comparison is only possible because we developed a novel approach for controlling the interface thickness in the pseudopotential method independently on the equation of state. In this way, it is possible to compare both methods maintaining the same equilibrium densities, interface thickness, surface tension and equation of state parameters. The well-balanced approach was selected to represent the free energy. We found that the free energy one is more practical to use, as it is not necessary to carry out previous simulations to determine simulation parameters (interface thickness, surface tension, etc). In addition, the tests proofed that the free energy model is more accurate than the pseudopotential model. Furthermore, the pseudopotential method suffers from a lack of thermodynamic consistency even when applying the corrections proposed in the literature. On the other hand, for both static and dynamic tests we verified that the pseudopotential method is more stable than the free energy one, allowing simulations with lower reduced temperatures. We hope that these results will guide authors in the use of each method.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.14897v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the influence of analytical regularization used in the generalized function (distribution) space to the Tikhonov regularization procedure utilized in the different versions of Moore-Penrose's inversion. By introducing a new analytical term to the Tikhonov regularization of Moore-Penrose's inversion procedure, we derive new optimization conditions that extend the Tikhonov regularization framework and influence the fitting parameter. This enhancement yields a more robust and accurate reconstruction of physical quantities, demonstrating its potential impact on various studies. We illustrate the significance of new term through schematic examples of physical applications, highlighting its relevance to diverse fields. Our findings provide a valuable tool for improving inversion methods and their applications in physics and beyond.</description>

      <title>2D hydrodynamic simulation of TeraFETs beyond the gradual-channel approximation for transient, large-signal or ultrahigh-frequency simulations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.18764</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.18764v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In the past decade, detection of THz radiation by plasma-wave-assisted frequency mixing in antenna-coupled field-effect transistors (TeraFETs) -- implemented in various semiconductor material systems (Si CMOS, GaN/AlGaN, GaAs/AlGaAs, graphene, etc.) -- has matured and led to a practically applied detector technology. This has been supported by the development of powerful device simulation tools which take into account relevant collective carrier dynamics and mixing processes in various approximations. These tools mostly model carrier transport in 1D and they are usually geared towards continuous-wave illumination of the device and small-signal response. Depending on their implementation, it may not be possible readily to simulate large-signal and pulsed operation. Another approximation which may lead to unsatisfactory results is the 1D restriction to calculate only the longitudinal electric field components. Especially at the edges of the gate electrode, solving of the 2D Poisson equation promises better results. This contribution introduces a stable way to solve the 2D Poisson equation self-consistently with the hydrodynamic transport equations including the numerically challenging convection term. We employ a well-balanced approximate Harten-Lax-van-Leer-Contact Riemann solver. The approach is well suited for a future treatment of transient and large-signal cases as well as the Dyakonov-Shur instability. The 2D treatment also generically extends the model beyond the gradual-channel approximation and allows to calculate the FET's response at high THz frequencies where the gate-to-channel potential acquires a non-local character. Model calculations are performed for the exemplary case of a 65-nm Si CMOS TeraFET in the isothermal approximation.</description>

      <title>A new transient higher order compact scheme for computation of flow and heat transfer in nonuniform polar grids</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.02293</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.02293v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this work, a higher order compact (HOC) discretization is developed on the nonuniform polar grid. The discretization conceptualized using the unsteady convection-diffusion equation (CDE) is further extended to flow problems governed by the Navies-Stokes (N-S) equations as well as the Boussinesq equations. The scheme developed here combines the advantages of body-fitted mesh with grid clustering, thereby making it efficient to capture flow gradients on polar grids. The scheme carries a spatial convergence of order three with temporal order of convergence being almost two. Diverse flow problems are being investigated using the scheme. Apart from two verification studies we validate the scheme by time marching simulation for the benchmark problem of driven polar cavity and the problem of natural convection in the horizontal concentric annulus. In the process, a one-sided approximation for the Neumann boundary condition for vorticity is also presented. Finally, the benchmark problem of forced convection around a circular cylinder is tackled. The results obtained in this study are analyzed and compared with the well-established numerical and experimental data wherever available in the literature. The newly developed scheme is found to generate accurate solutions in each case.</description>

      <title>Understanding Dynamics in Coarse-Grained Models: IV. Connection of Fine-Grained and Coarse-Grained Dynamics with the Stokes-Einstein and Stokes-Einstein-Debye Relations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.07156</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.07156v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Applying an excess entropy scaling formalism to the coarse-grained (CG) dynamics of liquids, we discovered that missing rotational motions during the CG process are responsible for artificially accelerated CG dynamics. In the context of the dynamic representability between the fine-grained (FG) and CG dynamics, this work introduces the well-known Stokes-Einstein and Stokes-Einstein-Debye relations to unravel the rotational dynamics underlying FG trajectories, thereby allowing for an indirect evaluation of the effective rotations based only on the translational information at the reduced CG resolution. Since the representability issue in CG modeling limits a direct evaluation of the shear stress appearing in the Stokes-Einstein and Stokes-Einstein-Debye relations, we introduce a translational relaxation time as a proxy to employ these relations, and we demonstrate that these relations hold for the ambient conditions studied in our series of work. Additional theoretical links to our previous work are also established. First, we demonstrate that the effective hard sphere radius determined by the classical perturbation theory can approximate the complex hydrodynamic radius value reasonably well. Also, we present a simple derivation of an excess entropy scaling relationship for viscosity by estimating the elliptical integral of molecules. In turn, since the translational and rotational motions at the FG level are correlated to each other, we conclude that the "entropy-free" CG diffusion only depends on the shape of the reference molecule. Our results and analyses impart an alternative way of recovering the FG diffusion from the CG description by coupling the translational and rotational motions at the hydrodynamic level.</description>

      <title>Force-Guided Bridge Matching for Full-Atom Time-Coarsened Dynamics of Peptides</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.15126v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Molecular Dynamics (MD) is crucial in various fields such as materials science, chemistry, and pharmacology to name a few. Conventional MD software struggles with the balance between time cost and prediction accuracy, which restricts its wider application. Recently, data-driven approaches based on deep generative models have been devised for time-coarsened dynamics, which aim at learning dynamics of diverse molecular systems over a long timestep, enjoying both universality and efficiency. Nevertheless, most current methods are designed solely to learn from the data distribution regardless of the underlying Boltzmann distribution, and the physics priors such as energies and forces are constantly overlooked. In this work, we propose a conditional generative model called Force-guided Bridge Matching (FBM), which learns full-atom time-coarsened dynamics and targets the Boltzmann-constrained distribution. With the guidance of our delicately-designed intermediate force field, FBM leverages favourable physics priors into the generation process, giving rise to enhanced simulations. Experiments on two datasets consisting of peptides verify our superiority in terms of comprehensive metrics and demonstrate transferability to unseen systems.</description>

Abstract: Developing robust representations of chemical structures that enable models to learn topological inductive biases is challenging. In this manuscript, we present a representation of atomistic systems. We begin by proving that our representation satisfies all structural, geometric, efficiency, and generalizability constraints. Afterward, we provide a general algorithm to encode any atomistic system. Finally, we report performance comparable to state-of-the-art methods on numerous tasks. We open-source all code and datasets. The code and data are available at https://github.com/rahulkhorana/PolyatomicComplexes.</description>
