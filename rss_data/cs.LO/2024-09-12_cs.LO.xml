      <title>A GLR-like Parsing Algorithm for Three-Valued Interpretations of Boolean Grammars with Strong Negation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.06966</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.06966v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Boolean grammars generalize context-free rewriting by extending the possibilities when dealing with different rules for the same nonterminal symbol. By allowing not only disjunction (as in the case of usual context-free grammars), but also conjunction and negation as possible connections between different rules with the same left-hand side, they are able to simplify the description of context-free languages and characterize languages that are not context-free. The use of negation, however, leads to the possibility of introducing rules that interplay in such a way which is problematic to handle in the classical, two-valued logical setting. Here we define a three valued interpretation to deal with such contradictory grammars using a method introduced originally in the context of logic programming, and present an algorithm to determine the membership status of strings with respect to the resulting three valued languages.</description>

      <title>Credibility-Limited Revision for Epistemic Spaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.07119</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.07119v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider credibility-limited revision in the framework of belief change for epistemic spaces, permitting inconsistent belief sets and inconsistent beliefs. In this unrestricted setting, the class of credibility-limited revision operators does not include any AGM revision operators. We extend the class of credibility-limited revision operators in a way that all AGM revision operators are included while keeping the original spirit of credibility-limited revision. Extended credibility-limited revision operators are defined axiomatically. A semantic characterization of extended credibility-limited revision operators that employ total preorders on possible worlds is presented.</description>

      <title>Exploring New Topologies for the Theory of Clones</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.05471</link>
      <description>arXiv:2303.05471v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Clones of operations of arity omega (referred to as omega-operations) have been employed by Neumann to represent varieties of infinitary algebras defined by operations of at most arity omega. More recently, clone algebras have been introduced to study clones of functions, including omega-operations, within the framework of one-sorted universal algebra. Additionally, polymorphisms of arity omega, which are omega-operations preserving the relations of a given first-order structure, have recently been used to establish model theory results with applications in the field of complexity of CSP problems.
  In this paper, we undertake a topological and algebraic study of polymorphisms of arity omega and their corresponding invariant relations. Given a set A and a Boolean ideal X on the set of omega-sequences of elements of A, we propose a method to endow the set of omega-operations on A with a topology, which we refer to as X-topology. Notably, the topology of pointwise convergence can be retrieved as a special case of this approach. Polymorphisms and invariant relations are then defined parametrically, with respect to the X-topology. We characterise the X-closed clones of omega-operations in terms of polymorphisms and invariant relations of arity omega, and present a method to relate those infinitary invariant relation and polymorphisms to the classical (finitary) Inv-Pol.</description>

      <title>On the Complexity of Proving Polyhedral Reductions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.01466</link>
      <description>arXiv:2306.01466v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We propose an automated procedure to prove polyhedral abstractions (also known as polyhedral reductions) for Petri nets. Polyhedral abstraction is a new type of state space equivalence, between Petri nets, based on the use of linear integer constraints between the marking of places. In addition to defining an automated proof method, this paper aims to better characterize polyhedral reductions, and to give an overview of their application to reachability problems.
  Our approach relies on encoding the equivalence problem into a set of SMT formulas whose satisfaction implies that the equivalence holds. The difficulty, in this context, arises from the fact that we need to handle infinite-state systems. For completeness, we exploit a connection with a class of Petri nets, called flat nets, that have Presburger-definable reachability sets. We have implemented our procedure, and we illustrate its use on several examples.</description>

      <title>Taking Complete Finite Prefixes To High Level, Symbolically</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.11443</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.11443v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Unfoldings are a well known partial-order semantics of P/T Petri nets that can be applied to various model checking or verification problems. For high-level Petri nets, the so-called symbolic unfolding generalizes this notion. A complete finite prefix of a P/T Petri net's unfolding contains all information to verify, e.g., reachability of markings. We unite these two concepts and define complete finite prefixes of the symbolic unfolding of high-level Petri nets. For a class of safe high-level Petri nets, we generalize the well-known algorithm by Esparza et al. for constructing small such prefixes. We evaluate this extended algorithm through a prototype implementation on four novel benchmark families. Additionally, we identify a more general class of nets with infinitely many reachable markings, for which an approach with an adapted cut-off criterion extends the complete prefix methodology, in the sense that the original algorithm cannot be applied to the P/T net represented by a high-level net.</description>

      <title>Non-Rigid Designators in Modal and Temporal Free Description Logics (Extended Version)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.07656</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.07656v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Definite descriptions, such as 'the General Chair of KR 2024', are a semantically transparent device for object identification in knowledge representation. In first-order modal logic, definite descriptions have been widely investigated for their non-rigidity, which allows them to designate different objects (or none at all) at different states. We propose expressive modal description logics with non-rigid definite descriptions and names, and investigate decidability and complexity of the satisfaction problem. We first systematically link satisfiability for the one-variable fragment of first-order modal logic with counting to our modal description logics. Then, we prove a promising NEXPTIME-completeness result for concept satisfiability for the fundamental epistemic multi-agent logic $\mathbf{S5}^{n}$ and its neighbours, and show that some expressive logics that are undecidable with constant domain become decidable (but Ackermann-hard) with expanding domains. Finally, we conduct a fine-grained analysis of decidability of temporal logics.</description>
