      <title>Upper Mid-Band Channel Measurements and Characterization at 6.75 GHz FR1(C) and 16.95 GHz FR3 in an Indoor Factory Scenario</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.03565</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.03565v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper presents detailed radio propagation measurements for an indoor factory (InF) environment at 6.75 GHz and 16.95 GHz using a 1 GHz bandwidth channel sounder. Conducted at the NYU MakerSpace in the NYU Tandon School of Engineering campus in Brooklyn, NY, USA, our measurement campaign characterizes a representative small factory with diverse machinery and open workspaces across 12 locations, comprising 5 line-of-sight (LOS) and 7 non-line-of-sight (NLOS) scenarios. Analysis using the close-in (CI) path loss model with a 1 m reference distance reveals path loss exponents (PLE) below 2 in LOS at 6.75 GHz and 16.95 GHz, while in NLOS PLE is similar to free-space propagation. The RMS delay spread (DS) decreases at higher frequencies with a clear frequency dependence. Similarly, RMS angular spread (AS) measurements show wider spreads in NLOS compared to LOS at both frequency bands, with a decreasing trend as frequency increases. These observations in a dense-scatterer environment demonstrate frequency-dependent behavior that deviate from existing industry-standard models. Our findings provide crucial insights into complex propagation mechanisms in factory environments, essential for designing robust industrial wireless networks at upper mid-band frequencies.</description>

      <title>Beam Tracking for Full-Duplex User Terminals in Low Earth Orbit Satellite Communication Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.03606</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.03606v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper introduces a novel beam tracking scheme for full-duplex ground user terminals aiming to transmit uplink and receive downlink from two low Earth orbit (LEO) satellites at the same time and same frequency. Our proposed technique leverages observed phenomena from a recent measurement campaign to strategically select transmit and receive beams which couple low self-interference across the satellites' trajectories, thereby enabling in-band full-duplex operation. Our scheme takes a measurement-driven approach, meaning it does not rely on explicit knowledge of the self-interference channel and can inherently account for hardware impairments or other nonidealities. We show that our proposed scheme reliably selects beams which spatially cancel self-interference to below the noise floor, circumventing the need for digital/analog cancellation. Simulation results using satellite and orbital parameters published in 3GPP and FCC filings show that this substantial reduction in self-interference does not prohibitively compromise beamforming gain, allowing the user terminal to attain near-maximal SINRs, thus unlocking full-duplex operation.</description>

      <title>Multi-bit Distributed Detection of Sparse Stochastic Signals over Error-Prone Reporting Channels</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.03612</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.03612v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider a distributed detection problem within a wireless sensor network (WSN), where a substantial number of sensors cooperate to detect the existence of sparse stochastic signals. To achieve a trade-off between detection performance and system constraints, multi-bit quantizers are employed at local sensors. Then, two quantization strategies, namely raw quantization (RQ) and likelihood ratio quantization (LQ), are examined. The multi-bit quantized signals undergo encoding into binary codewords and are subsequently transmitted to the fusion center via error-prone reporting channels. Upon exploiting the locally most powerful test (LMPT) strategy, we devise two multi-bit LMPT detectors in which quantized raw observations and local likelihood ratios are fused respectively. Moreover, the asymptotic detection performance of the proposed quantized detectors is analyzed, and closed-form expressions for the detection and false alarm probabilities are derived. Furthermore, the multi-bit quantizer design criterion, considering both RQ and LQ, is then proposed to achieve near-optimal asymptotic performance for our proposed detectors. The normalized Fisher information and asymptotic relative efficiency are derived, serving as tools to analyze and compensate for the loss of information introduced by the quantization. Simulation results validate the effectiveness of the proposed detectors, especially in scenarios with low signal-to-noise ratios and poor channel conditions.</description>

      <title>Domain Generalization for Cross-Receiver Radio Frequency Fingerprint Identification</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.03636</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.03636v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Radio Frequency Fingerprint Identification (RFFI) technology uniquely identifies emitters by analyzing unique distortions in the transmitted signal caused by non-ideal hardware. Recently, RFFI based on deep learning methods has gained popularity and is seen as a promising way to address the device authentication problem for Internet of Things (IoT) systems. However, in cross-receiver scenarios, where the RFFI model is trained over RF signals from some receivers but deployed at a new receiver, the alteration of receivers' characteristics would lead to data distribution shift and cause significant performance degradation at the new receiver. To address this problem, we first perform a theoretical analysis of the cross-receiver generalization error bound and propose a sufficient condition, named Separable Condition (SC), to minimize the classification error probability on the new receiver. Guided by the SC, a Receiver-Independent Emitter Identification (RIEI)model is devised to decouple the received signals into emitter-related features and receiver-related features and only the emitter-related features are used for identification. Furthermore, by leveraging federated learning, we also develop a FedRIEI model to eliminate the need for centralized collection of raw data from multiple receivers. Experiments on two real-world datasets demonstrate the superiority of our proposed methods over some baseline methods.</description>

      <title>Analog Beamforming Codebooks for Wideband Full-Duplex Millimeter-Wave Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.03691</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.03691v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In full-duplex millimeter-wave (mmWave) systems, the effects of beam squint and the frequency-selectivity of self-interference exacerbate over wide bandwidths. This complicates the use of beamforming to cancel self-interference when communicating over bandwidths on the order of gigahertz. In this work, we present the first analog beamforming codebooks tailored to wideband full-duplex mmWave systems, designed to both combat beam squint and cancel frequency-selective self-interference. Our proposed design constructs such codebooks by minimizing self-interference across the entire band of interest while constraining the coverage provided by these codebooks across that same band. Simulation results using computational electromagnetics to model self-interference suggest that a full-duplex 60 GHz system with our design enjoys lower self-interference and delivers better coverage across bandwidths as wide as 6 GHz, when compared to similar codebook designs that ignore beam squint and/or frequency-selectivity. This allows our design to sustain higher SINRs and spectral efficiencies across wide bandwidths, unlocking the potentials of wideband full-duplex mmWave systems.</description>

      <title>Multi-Modal Intelligent Channel Modeling: A New Modeling Paradigm via Synesthesia of Machines</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.03711</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.03711v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the future sixth-generation (6G) era, to support accurate localization sensing and efficient communication link establishment for intelligent agents, a comprehensive understanding of the surrounding environment and proper channel modeling are indispensable. The existing method, which solely exploits radio frequency (RF) communication information, is difficult to accomplish accurate channel modeling. Fortunately, multi-modal devices are deployed on intelligent agents to obtain environmental features, which could further assist in channel modeling. Currently, some research efforts have been devoted to utilizing multi-modal information to facilitate channel modeling, while still lack a comprehensive review. To fill this gap, we embark on an initial endeavor with the goal of reviewing multi-modal intelligent channel modeling (MMICM) via Synesthesia of Machines (SoM). Compared to channel modeling approaches that solely utilize RF communication information, the utilization of multi-modal information can provide a more in-depth understanding of the propagation environment around the transceiver, thus facilitating more accurate channel modeling. First, this paper introduces existing channel modeling approaches from the perspective of the channel modeling evolution. Then, we have elaborated and investigated recent advances in the topic of capturing typical channel characteristics and features, i.e., channel non-stationarity and consistency, by characterizing the mathematical, spatial, coupling, and mapping relationships. In addition, applications that can be supported by MMICM are summarized and analyzed. To corroborate the superiority of MMICM via SoM, we give the simulation result and analysis. Finally, some open issues and potential directions for the MMICM are outlined from the perspectives of measurements, modeling, and applications.</description>

      <title>Integrating RIS into HAP Networks for Improved Connectivity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.03886</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.03886v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper investigates a high-altitude platform (HAP) network enhanced with reconfigurable intelligent surfaces (RISs). The arbitrary placement of HAPs and RISs is modeled using stochastic geometry, specifically as homogeneous Poisson point processes. The HAP--RIS links are assumed to follow Rician fading, while the RIS--user links experience shadowed-Rician fading. The system's coverage probability and ergodic capacity are derived analytically and validated through Monte Carlo simulations. The results highlight significant performance gains and demonstrate the influence of various system parameters and fading conditions. The proposed system has potential for enhancing connectivity and data offloading in practical scenarios.</description>

      <title>WiP: Towards a Secure SECP256K1 for Crypto Wallets: Hardware Architecture and Implementation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.03910</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.03910v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The SECP256K1 elliptic curve algorithm is fundamental in cryptocurrency wallets for generating secure public keys from private keys, thereby ensuring the protection and ownership of blockchain-based digital assets. However, the literature highlights several successful side-channel attacks on hardware wallets that exploit SECP256K1 to extract private keys. This work proposes a novel hardware architecture for SECP256K1, optimized for side-channel attack resistance and efficient resource utilization. The architecture incorporates complete addition formulas, temporary registers, and parallel processing techniques, making elliptic curve point addition and doubling operations indistinguishable. Implementation results demonstrate an average reduction of 45% in LUT usage compared to similar works, emphasizing the design's resource efficiency.</description>

      <title>Towards Resource-Efficient Federated Learning in Industrial IoT for Multivariate Time Series Analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.03996</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.03996v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Anomaly and missing data constitute a thorny problem in industrial applications. In recent years, deep learning enabled anomaly detection has emerged as a critical direction, however the improved detection accuracy is achieved with the utilization of large neural networks, increasing their storage and computational cost. Moreover, the data collected in edge devices contain user privacy, introducing challenges that can be successfully addressed by the privacy-preserving distributed paradigm, known as federated learning (FL). This framework allows edge devices to train and exchange models increasing also the communication cost. Thus, to deal with the increased communication, processing and storage challenges of the FL based deep anomaly detection NN pruning is expected to have significant benefits towards reducing the processing, storage and communication complexity. With this focus, a novel compression-based optimization problem is proposed at the server-side of a FL paradigm that fusses the received local models broadcast and performs pruning generating a more compressed model. Experiments in the context of anomaly detection and missing value imputation demonstrate that the proposed FL scenario along with the proposed compressed-based method are able to achieve high compression rates (more than $99.7\%$) with negligible performance losses (less than $1.18\%$ ) as compared to the centralized solutions.</description>

      <title>Age of Gossip With Time-Varying Topologies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.04114</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.04114v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider a gossiping network, where a source node sends updates to a network of $n$ gossiping nodes. Meanwhile, the connectivity topology of the gossiping network changes over time, among a finite number of connectivity ''states,'' such as the fully connected graph, the ring graph, the grid graph, etc. The transition of the connectivity graph among the possible options is governed by a finite state continuous time Markov chain (CTMC). When the CTMC is in a particular state, the associated graph topology of the gossiping network is in the way indicated by that state. We evaluate the impact of time-varying graph topologies on the freshness of information for nodes in the network. We use the version age of information metric to quantify the freshness of information at the nodes. Using a method similar to the first passage percolation method, we show that, if one of the states of the CTMC is the fully connected graph and the transition rates of the CTMC are constant, then the version age of a typical node in the network scales logarithmically with the number of nodes, as in the case if the network was always fully connected. That is, there is no loss in the age scaling, even if the network topology deviates from full connectivity, in this setting. We perform numerical simulations and analyze more generally how having different topologies and different CTMC rates (that might depend on the number of nodes) affect the average version age scaling of a node in the gossiping network.</description>

Abstract: Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis (ALS) and Myopathy are debilitating neuromuscular disorders that demand accurate and efficient diagnostic approaches. In this study, we harness the power of deep learning techniques to detect ALS and Myopathy. Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) have emerged as powerful tools in this context. We present ResEMGNet, designed to identify ALS and Myopathy directly from raw electromyography (EMG) signals. Unlike traditional methods that require intricate handcrafted feature extraction, ResEMGNet takes raw EMG data as input, reducing computational complexity and enhancing practicality. Our approach was rigorously evaluated using various metrics in comparison to existing methods. ResEMGNet exhibited exceptional subject-independent performance, achieving an impressive overall three-class accuracy of 94.43\%.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.02101v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider a novel algorithm, for the completion of partially observed low-rank matrices in a structured setting where each entry can be chosen from a finite discrete alphabet set, such as in common recommender systems. The proposed low-rank matrix completion (MC) method is an improved variation of state-of-the-art (SotA) discrete aware matrix completion method which we previously proposed, in which discreteness is enforced by an $\ell_0$-norm regularizer, not by replaced with the $\ell_1$-norm, but instead approximated by a continuous and differentiable function normalized via fractional programming (FP) under a proximal gradient (PG) framework. Simulation results demonstrate the superior performance of the new method compared to the SotA techniques as well as the earlier $\ell_1$-norm-based discrete-aware matrix completion approach.</description>

      <title>CSI-Free Position Optimization for Movable Antenna Communication Systems: A Black-Box Optimization Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.04951</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.04951v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Movable antenna (MA) is a new technology which leverages local movement of antennas to improve channel qualities and enhance the communication performance. Nevertheless, to fully realize the potential of MA systems, complete channel state information (CSI) between the transmitter-MA and the receiver-MA is required, which involves estimating a large number of channel parameters and incurs an excessive amount of training overhead. To address this challenge, in this paper, we propose a CSI-free MA position optimization method. The basic idea is to treat position optimization as a black-box optimization problem and calculate the gradient of the unknown objective function using zeroth-order (ZO) gradient approximation techniques. Simulation results show that the proposed ZO-based method, through adaptively adjusting the position of the MA, can achieve a favorable signal-to-noise-ratio (SNR) using a smaller number of position measurements than the CSI-based approach. Such a merit makes the proposed algorithm more adaptable to fast-changing propagation channels.</description>

      <title>Urban Outdoor Propagation Measurements and Channel Models at 6.75 GHz FR1(C) and 16.95 GHz FR3 Upper Mid-Band Spectrum for 5G and 6G</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.17539v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Global allocations in the upper mid-band spectrum (4--24 GHz) necessitate a comprehensive exploration of the propagation behavior to meet the promise of coverage and capacity. This paper presents an extensive Urban Microcell (UMi) outdoor propagation measurement campaign at 6.75 GHz and 16.95 GHz conducted in Downtown Brooklyn, USA, using a 1 GHz bandwidth sliding correlation channel sounder over 40--880 m propagation distance, encompassing 7 Line of Sight (LOS) and 13 Non-Line of Sight (NLOS) locations. Analysis of the path loss (PL) reveals lower directional and omnidirectional PL exponents compared to mmWave and sub-THz frequencies in the UMi environment, using the close-in PL model with a 1 m reference distance. Additionally, a decreasing trend in root mean square (RMS) delay spread (DS) and angular spread (AS) with increasing frequency was observed. The NLOS RMS DS and RMS AS mean values are obtained consistently lower compared to 3GPP model predictions. Point data for all measured statistics at each TX-RX location are provided to supplement the models and results. The spatio-temporal statistics evaluated here offer valuable insights for the design of next-generation wireless systems and networks.</description>

Abstract: In this work, we statistically analyze the radar cross section (RCS) of different test targets present in an indoor factory (InF) scenario specified by 3rd Generation Partnership Project considering bistatic configuration. The test targets that we consider are drones, humans, quadruped robot and a robotic arm. We consider two drones of different sizes and five human subjects for RCS characterization. For the drones, we measure the RCS when they are are flying over a given point and while they are rotating over the same point. For human subjects, we measure the RCS while standing still, sitting still and walking. For quadruped robot and robotic arm, we consider a continuous random motion emulating different tasks which they are supposed to perfom in typical InF scenario. We employ different distributions, such as Normal, Lognormal, Gamma, Rician, Weibull, Rayleigh and Exponential to fit the measurement data. From the statistical analysis, we gather that Lognormal distribution can fit all the considered targets in the InF scenario.</description>

      <title>Codebook Configuration for RIS-aided Systems via Implicit Neural Representations</title>

Abstract: Reconfigurable Intelligent Surface (RIS) is envisioned to be an enabling technique in 6G wireless communications. By configuring the reflection beamforming codebook, RIS focuses signals on target receivers to enhance signal strength. In this paper, we investigate the codebook configuration for RIS-aided communication systems. We formulate an implicit relationship between user's coordinates information and the codebook from the perspective of signal radiation mechanisms, and introduce a novel learning-based method, implicit neural representations (INRs), to solve this implicit coordinates-to-codebook mapping problem. Our approach requires only user's coordinates, avoiding reliance on channel models. Additionally, given the significant practical applications of the 1-bit RIS, we formulate the 1-bit codebook configuration as a multi-label classification problem, and propose an encoding strategy for 1-bit RIS to reduce the codebook dimension, thereby improving learning efficiency. Experimental results from simulations and measured data demonstrate significant advantages of our method.</description>

      <title>Nonparametric Evaluation of Noisy ICA Solutions</title>

Abstract: Independent Component Analysis (ICA) was introduced in the 1980's as a model for Blind Source Separation (BSS), which refers to the process of recovering the sources underlying a mixture of signals, with little knowledge about the source signals or the mixing process. While there are many sophisticated algorithms for estimation, different methods have different shortcomings. In this paper, we develop a nonparametric score to adaptively pick the right algorithm for ICA with arbitrary Gaussian noise. The novelty of this score stems from the fact that it just assumes a finite second moment of the data and uses the characteristic function to evaluate the quality of the estimated mixing matrix without any knowledge of the parameters of the noise distribution. In addition, we propose some new contrast functions and algorithms that enjoy the same fast computability as existing algorithms like FASTICA and JADE but work in domains where the former may fail. While these also may have weaknesses, our proposed diagnostic, as shown by our simulations, can remedy them. Finally, we propose a theoretical framework to analyze the local and global convergence properties of our algorithms.</description>

      <title>Model-based Deep Learning for Wireless Resource Allocation in RSMA Communications Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.01515</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.01515v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Rate-splitting multiple access (RSMA) has been proven as an effective communication scheme for 5G and beyond. However, current approaches to RSMA resource management require complicated iterative algorithms, which cannot meet the stringent latency requirement by users with limited resources. Recently, data-driven methods are explored to alleviate this issue. However, they suffer from poor generalizability and scarce training data to achieve satisfactory performance. In this paper, we propose a fractional programming (FP) based deep unfolding (DU) approach to address resource allocation problem for a weighted sum rate optimization in RSMA. By carefully designing the penalty function, we couple the variable update with projected gradient descent algorithm (PGD). Following the structure of PGD, we embed a few learnable parameters in each layer of the DU network. Through extensive simulation, we have shown that the proposed model-based neural networks can yield similar results compared to the traditional optimization algorithm for RSMA resource management but with much lower computational complexity, less training data, and higher resilience to out-of-distribution (OOD) data.</description>

      <title>Reconfigurable Massive MIMO: Precoding Design and Channel Estimation in the Electromagnetic Domain</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.02823</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.02823v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Reconfigurable massive multiple-input multiple-output (RmMIMO), as an electronically-controlled fluid antenna system, offers increased flexibility for future communication systems by exploiting previously untapped degrees of freedom in the electromagnetic (EM) domain. The representation of the traditional spatial domain channel state information (sCSI) limits the insights into the potential of EM domain channel properties, constraining the base station's (BS) utmost capability for precoding design. This paper leverages the EM domain channel state information (eCSI) for antenna radiation pattern design at the BS. We develop an orthogonal decomposition method based on spherical harmonic functions to decompose the radiation pattern into a linear combination of orthogonal bases. By formulating the radiation pattern design as an optimization problem for the projection coefficients over these bases, we develop a manifold optimization-based method for iterative radiation pattern and digital precoder design. To address the eCSI estimation problem, we capitalize on the inherent structure of the channel. Specifically, we propose a subspace-based scheme to reduce the pilot overhead for wideband sCSI estimation. Given the estimated full-band sCSI, we further employ parameterized methods for angle of arrival estimation. Subsequently, the complete eCSI can be reconstructed after estimating the equivalent channel gain via the least squares method. Simulation results demonstrate that, in comparison to traditional mMIMO systems with fixed antenna radiation patterns, the proposed RmMIMO architecture offers significant throughput gains for multi-user transmission at a low channel estimation overhead.</description>

      <title>R-NeRF: Neural Radiance Fields for Modeling RIS-enabled Wireless Environments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.11541</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.11541v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recently, ray tracing has gained renewed interest with the advent of Reflective Intelligent Surfaces (RIS) technology, a key enabler of 6G wireless communications due to its capability of intelligent manipulation of electromagnetic waves. However, accurately modeling RIS-enabled wireless environments poses significant challenges due to the complex variations caused by various environmental factors and the mobility of RISs. In this paper, we propose a novel modeling approach using Neural Radiance Fields (NeRF) to characterize the dynamics of electromagnetic fields in such environments. Our method utilizes NeRF-based ray tracing to intuitively capture and visualize the complex dynamics of signal propagation, effectively modeling the complete signal pathways from the transmitter to the RIS, and from the RIS to the receiver. This two-stage process accurately characterizes multiple complex transmission paths, enhancing our understanding of signal behavior in real-world scenarios. Our approach predicts the signal field for any specified RIS placement and receiver location, facilitating efficient RIS deployment. Experimental evaluations using both simulated and real-world data validate the significant benefits of our methodology.</description>

      <title>Interpretable Lightweight Transformer via Unrolling of Learned Graph Smoothness Priors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.04090</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.04090v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We build interpretable and lightweight transformer-like neural networks by unrolling iterative optimization algorithms that minimize graph smoothness priors -- the quadratic graph Laplacian regularizer (GLR) and the $\ell_1$-norm graph total variation (GTV) -- subject to an interpolation constraint. The crucial insight is that a normalized signal-dependent graph learning module amounts to a variant of the basic self-attention mechanism in conventional transformers. Unlike "black-box" transformers that require learning of large key, query and value matrices to compute scaled dot products as affinities and subsequent output embeddings, resulting in huge parameter sets, our unrolled networks employ shallow CNNs to learn low-dimensional features per node to establish pairwise Mahalanobis distances and construct sparse similarity graphs. At each layer, given a learned graph, the target interpolated signal is simply a low-pass filtered output derived from the minimization of an assumed graph smoothness prior, leading to a dramatic reduction in parameter count. Experiments for two image interpolation applications verify the restoration performance, parameter efficiency and robustness to covariate shift of our graph-based unrolled networks compared to conventional transformers.</description>

      <title>One-Shot Distributed Node-Specific Signal Estimation with Non-Overlapping Latent Subspaces in Acoustic Sensor Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.03752</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.03752v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A one-shot algorithm called iterationless DANSE (iDANSE) is introduced to perform distributed adaptive node-specific signal estimation (DANSE) in a fully connected wireless acoustic sensor network (WASN) deployed in an environment with non-overlapping latent signal subspaces. The iDANSE algorithm matches the performance of a centralized algorithm in a single processing cycle while devices exchange fused versions of their multichannel local microphone signals. Key advantages of iDANSE over currently available solutions are its iterationless nature, which favors deployment in real-time applications, and the fact that devices can exchange fewer fused signals than the number of latent sources in the environment. The proposed method is validated in numerical simulations including a speech enhancement scenario.</description>

      <title>New Bounds on Spherical Antenna Bandwidth and Directivity: Updates to the Chu-Harrington Limits</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.07085</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.07085v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The Chu circuit model provides the basis for analyzing the minimum radiation quality factor, Q, of a given spherical mode. However, examples of electrically large spherical radiators readily demonstrate that this Q limit has limitations in predicting bandwidth. Spherical mode radiation is reexamined and an equivalent 1D transmission line model is derived that exactly models the fields. This model leads to a precise cutoff frequency of the spherical waveguide, which provides a clear boundary between propagating and evanescent fields. A new delineation of 'stored' and 'radiated' electromagnetic energy is postulated, which leads to a new definition of spherical mode Q. Next, attention is turned to the Harrington bound on the directivity-bandwidth tradeoff of an antenna with an arbitrary size. Harrington derived the maximum directivity for a specified number of spherical harmonics such that the Q is not 'large'. Here, the method of Lagrange multipliers is used to quantify the maximum directivity for a given bandwidth. It is shown that optimally exciting all spherical harmonics (including n&gt;ka) enables both larger directivity and bandwidth than Harrington's previous limit. While Chu and Harrington's analyses are generally good approximations for most situations, the new self-consistent theory that defines fundamental antenna limits leads to updated results.</description>
