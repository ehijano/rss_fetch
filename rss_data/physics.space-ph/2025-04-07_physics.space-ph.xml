      <title>Evolution of interacting coronal mass ejections driving the great geomagnetic storm on 10 May 2024</title>

Abstract: The arrival of a series of coronal mass ejections (CMEs) at the Earth resulted in a great geomagnetic storm on 10 May 2024, the strongest storm in the last two decades. We investigate the kinematic and thermal evolution of the successive CMEs to understand their interaction en route to Earth. We attempt to find the dynamics, thermodynamics, and magnetic field signatures of CME-CME interactions. Our focus is to compare the thermal state of CMEs near the Sun and in their post-interaction phase at 1 AU. The 3D kinematics of six identified Earth-directed CMEs were determined using the GCS model. The flux rope internal state (FRIS) model is implemented to estimate the CMEs' polytropic index and temperature evolution from their measured kinematics. The thermal states of the interacting CMEs are examined using in-situ at 1 AU. Our study determined the interaction heights of selected CMEs and confirmed their interaction that led to the formation of complex ejecta identified at 1 AU. The plasma, magnetic field, and thermal characteristics of magnetic ejecta (ME) within the complex ejecta and other substructures, such as interaction regions (IRs) within two ME and double flux rope-like structures within a single ME, show the possible signatures of CME-CME interaction in in-situ observations. The FRIS-model-derived thermal states for individual CMEs reveal their diverse thermal evolution near the Sun, with most CMEs transitioning to an isothermal state at 6-9 Rsun, except for CME4, which exhibits an adiabatic state due to a slower expansion rate. The complex ejecta at 1 AU shows a predominant heat-release state in electrons, while the ions show a bimodal distribution of thermal states. On comparing the characteristics of CMEs near the Sun and at 1 AU, we suggest that such one-to-one comparison is difficult due to CME-CME interactions significantly influencing their post-interaction characteristics.</description>

      <title>A Kinetic Model of Solar Wind Acceleration Driven by Ambipolar Electric Potential and Velocity-Space Diffusion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.18132</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.18132v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Parker Solar Probe (PSP) observations revealed that most of the solar wind acceleration occurs very close to the Sun. This acceleration is partly due to the global electric potential originating from the mass disparity between electrons and protons, coupled with the constraints of charge quasi-neutrality and zero-current conditions in the solar wind plasma. However, the exact mechanism that accounts for the remaining acceleration is still not identified. We aim to provide a framework incorporating the electric field-driven component of the acceleration while also introducing an additional acceleration mechanism via velocity-space diffusion of the particles. This will help us determine the extent of extra acceleration, beyond the electric field-driven component, required to fully reproduce the acceleration of the solar wind in theoretical models. We modified an existing kinetic exospheric model to account for the unexplained solar wind acceleration by including velocity-space diffusion. We compared the electric field derived from the sunward deficit of velocity distribution functions observed by PSP between 13.3 and 50 solar radii ($R_s$) with the electric field found self-consistently by the kinetic exospheric model. The effect of velocity-space diffusion is found to reduce the temperature anisotropy and impact the solar wind acceleration while maintaining the electric potential unchanged. It is found that, even without diffusion, the model can reproduce the anticorrelation between the electric potential and the solar wind terminal velocity found by PSP. This suggests that the electric potential might still be of major importance in explaining the solar wind acceleration.</description>
