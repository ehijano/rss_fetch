      <title>Calculating the sequences behind a hexagonal lattice based equal circle packing in the Euclidian plane</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.10530</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.10530v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The article presents the mathematical sequences describing circle packing densities in four different geometric configurations involving a hexagonal lattice based equal circle packing in the Euclidian plane. The calculated sequences take form of either polynomials or rational functions. If the circle packing area is limited with a circle, the packing densities tend to decrease with increasing number of the packed circles and converge to values lower than {\pi}/(2\sqrt{3}). In cases with packing areas limited by equilateral triangles or equilateral hexagons the packing densities tend to increase with increasing number of the packed circles and converge to {\pi}/(2\sqrt{3}). The equilateral hexagons are shown to be the preferred equal circle packing surface areas with practical applications searching for high equal circle packing densities, since the packing densities with circle packing inside equilateral hexagons converge faster to {\pi}/(2\sqrt{3}) than in the case of equilateral triangle packing surface areas.</description>

Abstract: A convex body $R$ in the hyperbolic plane is reduced if any convex body $K\subset R$ has a smaller minimal width than $R$. We examine the area of a family of hyperbolic reduced $n$-gons, and prove that, within this family, regular $n$-gons have minimal area.</description>

      <title>The distance problem on measured metric spaces</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.10926v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: What distributions arise as the distribution of the distance between two typical points in some measured metric space? This seems to be a surprisingly subtle problem. We conjecture that every distribution with a density function whose support contains $0$ does arise in this way, and give some partial results in that direction.</description>

Abstract: Let $M$ be a compact oriented 3-manifold with non-empty boundary consisting of surfaces of genii $&gt;1$ such that the interior of $M$ is hyperbolizable. We show that for each spherical cone-metric $d$ on $\partial M$ such that all cone-angles are greater than $2\pi$ and the lengths of all closed geodesics that are contractible in $M$ are greater than $2\pi$ there exists a unique strictly polyhedral hyperbolic metric on $M$ such that $d$ is the induced dual metric on $\partial M$.</description>

      <title>Dowker-type theorems for disk-polygons in normed planes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.04026</link>
      <description>arXiv:2307.04026v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A classical result of Dowker (Bull. Amer. Math. Soc. 50: 120-122, 1944) states that for any plane convex body $K$ in the Euclidean plane, the areas of the maximum (resp. minimum) area convex $n$-gons inscribed (resp. circumscribed) in $K$ is a concave (resp. convex) sequence. It is known that this theorem remains true if we replace area by perimeter, the Euclidean plane by an arbitrary normed plane, or convex $n$-gons by disk-$n$-gons, obtained as the intersection of $n$ closed Euclidean unit disks. The aim of our paper is to investigate these problems for $C$-$n$-gons, defined as intersections of $n$ translates of the unit disk $C$ of a normed plane. In particular, we show that Dowker's theorem remains true for the areas and the perimeters of circumscribed $C$-$n$-gons, and the perimeters of inscribed $C$-$n$-gons. We also show that in the family of origin-symmetric plane convex bodies, for a typical element $C$ with respect to Hausdorff distance, Dowker's theorem for the areas of inscribed $C$-$n$-gons fails.</description>

      <title>Strong almost finiteness</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.14554</link>
      <description>arXiv:2308.14554v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A countable, bounded degree graph is almost finite if it has a tiling with isomorphic copies of finitely many F\o lner sets, and we call it strongly almost finite, if the tiling can be randomized so that the probability that a vertex is on the boundary of a tile is uniformly small. We give various equivalents for strong almost finiteness. In particular, we prove that Property A together with a uniform version of amenability is equivalent to strong almost finiteness. Using these characterizations, we show that graphs of subexponential growth and Schreier graphs of amenable groups are always strongly almost finite, generalizing the celebrated result of Downarowicz, Huczek and Zhang about amenable Cayley graphs, based on graph theoretic rather than group theoretic principles. We give various equivalents to Property A for graphs, and show that if a sequence of graphs of Property A (in a uniform sense) converges to a graph $G$ in the neighborhood distance (a purely combinatorial analogue of the classical Benjamini-Schramm distance), then their Laplacian spectra converge to the Laplacian spectrum of $G$ in the Hausdorff distance. We apply the previous theory to construct a new and rich class of classifiable $C^{\star}$-algebras. Namely, we show that for any minimal strong almost finite graph $G$ there are naturally associated simple, nuclear, stably finite $C^{\star}$-algebras that are classifiable by their Elliott invariants.</description>

      <title>Asymptotic order of the quantization error for a class of self-similar measures with overlaps</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.01103</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.01103v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Let $\{f_i\}_{i=1}^N$ be a set of equi-contractive similitudes on $\mathbb{R}^1$ satisfying the finite-type condition. We study the asymptotic quantization error for self-similar measures $\mu$ associated with $\{f_i\}_{i=1}^N$ and a positive probability vector. With a verifiable assumption, we prove that the upper and lower quantization coefficient for $\mu$ are both bounded away from zero and infinity. This can be regarded as an extension of Graf and Luschgy's result on self-similar measures with the open set condition. Our result is applicable to a significant class of self-similar measures with overlaps, including Erd\"{o}s measure, the $3$-fold convolution of the classical Cantor measure and the self-similar measures on some $\lambda$-Cantor sets.</description>

      <title>Isoperimetric Inequalities on Slabs with applications to Cubes and Gaussian Slabs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.06602</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.06602v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study isoperimetric inequalities on "slabs", namely weighted Riemannian manifolds obtained as the product of the uniform measure on a finite length interval with a codimension-one base. As our two main applications, we consider the case when the base is the flat torus $\mathbb{R}^2 / 2 \mathbb{Z}^2$ and the standard Gaussian measure in $\mathbb{R}^{n-1}$.
  The isoperimetric conjecture on the three-dimensional cube predicts that minimizers are enclosed by spheres about a corner, cylinders about an edge and coordinate planes. This has only been established for relative volumes close to $0$, $1/2$ and $1$ by compactness arguments. Our analysis confirms the isoperimetric conjecture on the three-dimensional cube with side lengths $(\beta,1,1)$ in a new range of relatives volumes $\bar v \in [0,1/2]$. In particular, we confirm the conjecture for the standard cube ($\beta=1$) for all $\bar v \leq 0.120582$, when $\beta \leq 0.919431$ for the entire range where spheres are conjectured to be minimizing, and also for all $\bar v \in [0,1/2] \setminus (\frac{1}{\pi} - \frac{\beta}{4},\frac{1}{\pi} + \frac{\beta}{4})$. When $\beta \leq 0.919431$ we reduce the validity of the full conjecture to establishing that the half-plane $\{ x \in [0,\beta] \times [0,1]^2 \; ; \; x_3 \leq \frac{1}{\pi} \}$ is an isoperimetric minimizer. We also show that the analogous conjecture on a high-dimensional cube $[0,1]^n$ is false for $n \geq 10$.
  In the case of a slab with a Gaussian base of width $T&gt;0$, we identify a phase transition when $T = \sqrt{2 \pi}$ and when $T = \pi$. In particular, while products of half-planes with $[0,T]$ are always minimizing when $T \leq \sqrt{2 \pi}$, when $T &gt; \pi$ they are never minimizing, being beaten by Gaussian unduloids. In the range $T \in (\sqrt{2 \pi},\pi]$, a potential trichotomy occurs.</description>
