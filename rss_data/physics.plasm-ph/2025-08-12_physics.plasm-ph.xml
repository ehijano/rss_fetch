      <title>Polywell Revisited</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.06761</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.06761v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Polywell fusion concept, originally proposed by Robert W. Bussard in 1985, has been investigated for over four decades as a potential solution for achieving net fusion energy in a compact and economically viable reactor. It combines two distinct approaches: high-beta magnetic cusp confinement of electrons using polyhedral coil configurations and electrostatic ion confinement via a potential well formed by injected electron beams. While the hybrid nature of the Polywell system offers advantages in plasma stability and engineering simplicity, previous efforts have been limited by persistent challenges in achieving sufficient plasma confinement required to generate a net energy gain. In this study, we examine previous work and identify limitations of several Polywell embodiments that have historically impeded progress. We present an updated Polywell physics model incorporating experimental findings and recent first-principles particle-in-cell simulations. This updated model outlines a credible path toward overcoming confinement losses and achieving net energy gain using deuterium-tritium (D-T) fuels. Our findings provide a renewed scientific basis for the continued development of the Polywell fusion concept as a practical and scalable approach to fusion energy.</description>

      <title>Ionization rate vs. laser intensity determined from ion count vs. peak intensity due to neutral gas exposure to an 800 nm ultrashort pulsed laser</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.07500</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.07500v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The optical cycle-averaged ionization rate of Ar, O$_{2}$, and N$_{2}$ vs. local instantaneous laser intensity $I$ for linear polarized $800$ nm light is determined up to approx. $300$ TW/cm$^{2}$ by numerically inverting published time-of-flight ion spectrometer data. The published Ar$^{+}$ collection efficiency of the microchannel plate (MCP) at the end of the spectrometer and its $I_{0}$ scale are recalibrated by fitting it to its high $I_{0}$ solution. The relative collection efficiencies of the other species are determined by published MCP cathode data. Results for O$_2$ are consistent with a reevaluation of published data used to determine its cross section $\sigma_8$ in the multiphoton (low $I$) regime.</description>

      <title>Spatiotemporal optical vortex (STOV) polariton</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.17413v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We confirm the existence of a new bulk medium quasiparticle with transverse orbital angular momentum (tOAM) and elucidate its physical origin. The tOAM structure is driven by torques induced by the ponderomotive force of the light in the medium, originating from the magnetic Lorentz force, even for weak light fields. There are two contributions to the material tOAM: one part depends on the pulse spatial shape change as it passes through an interface, and the other part depends on dispersion. The results, from first principles particle-in-cell simulations of a simple plasma, are in excellent agreement with our theory for general dielectric media [S. W. Hancock et al., Phys. Rev. Lett. 127, 193901 (2021)]. For plasma, there is agreement up to near-critical densities and near-relativistic field strengths.</description>

      <title>Simulating X-point radiator turbulence</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.16190v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Coupling a high-performance burning plasma core to a detached boundary solution is critical for realizing magnetic confinement fusion power. Predictive simulations of the edge and scrape-off layer are therefore essential and must self-consistently account for turbulence and the interplay between the plasma, neutral gas, and impurities. We present results on controlled full detachment in ASDEX Upgrade with an X-point radiator (XPR), obtained with the edge turbulence code GRILLIX. Assuming a fixed nitrogen concentration (in terms of the electron density) in coronal equilibrium, two simulations are discussed: they exhibit dense nitrogen radiation fronts, located 5 and 12 cm above the X-point, accounting for 80 % of the input heating power. In validations against density, temperature, and bolometry measurements, the simulations show good agreement and reproduce the detached divertor conditions observed in the experiment. Neutral gas is critical for achieving detachment and modulating the height of the XPR front, in agreement with previous SOLPS-ITER transport modeling and analytical power balance studies. In addition, the front structure is highly dynamic due to turbulence, consisting of ionizing and radiative mantles surrounding intermittent cold spots of recombining plasma. Near the detachment front, density and temperature fluctuation amplitudes exceed the background by more than 400 %, compared to 40 % in an attached reference case. The radial electric field shifts inward, poloidal symmetry of the electrostatic potential is broken (inducing strong radial flows around the XPR), and radial particle and heat transport into the low-field side scrape-off layer increases. These effects may explain the ELM suppression observed in the H-mode XPR regime.</description>

      <title>A Simple Model of Current Ramp-Up and Ramp-Down in Tokamaks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.03561</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.03561v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A simple model of the ramp-up and ramp-down of the toroidal current in a tokamak plasma is developed. Faraday's law of electric induction is found to limit how rapidly the current can be safety ramped up or down. It is estimated that the minimum safe ramp-up/down times for the JET, SPARC, and ITER tokamaks are 4.2, 2.0, and 14.7 seconds, respectively. The JET ramp time is in accordance with operational experience. The SPARC and ITER minimum safe ramp times are less than the ramp times in the respective designs. Hence, there is no indication that the design ramp times are infeasible, as was recently suggested in arXiv:2507.05456 (2025). The typical ratios of the inductive electric field to the Connor-Hastie field in SPARC and ITER are found to be less than those in JET. Thus, the fact that the JET tokamak was able to operate successfully without encountering runaway electron problems during current ramps suggests that the future SPARC and ITER tokamaks should also be able to avoid such problems.</description>

      <title>Magnetic, Kinetic, and Transition Regime: Spatially-Segregated Structure of Compressive MHD Turbulence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.02769</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.02769v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Turbulence is a complex physical process prevalent in modern physics, particularly in ionized environments like interstellar gas, where magnetic fields play a dynamic role. However, the precise influence of magnetic fields in such settings remains unclear. We employ the Alfv\'{e}n Mach number, ${M}_{\mathrm{A}} = \sqrt{E_{\mathrm{k}}/E_{\mathrm{B}}}$, to gauge the magnetic field's significance relative to turbulent motion, uncovering diverse interaction patterns. In the low-${M}_{\mathrm{A}}$ magnetic regime, the field is force-free, yet gas motion does not align with it. At intermediate ${M}_{\mathrm{A}}$ (magnetic-kinetic transition regime), velocity and magnetic fields show peak alignment, likely due to rapid relaxation. In the high-${M}_{\mathrm{A}}$ kinetic regime, both fields are irregular and unaligned. These regimes find observational counterparts in interstellar gas, highlighting the multifaceted nature of MHD turbulence and aiding future astrophysical interpretations.</description>
