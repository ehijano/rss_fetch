      <title>Dynamic restrengthening and stress heterogeneity explain megathrust earthquake complexity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.08973</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.08973v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Megathrusts host Earth's largest earthquakes. Understanding the physical conditions controlling their rupture dynamics is critical for assessing seismic and tsunami hazards. These earthquakes often display complex rupture dynamics, exemplified by the 2011 Tohoku-Oki earthquake, which exhibited multiple rupture episodes, depth-dependent seismic radiation, and substantial tsunamigenic slip near the trench. However, whether such complexity arises from preexisting physical conditions remains uncertain. Here, we demonstrate that the observed rupture complexity of the Tohoku-Oki earthquake can spontaneously and self-consistently emerge, driven by rapid coseismic frictional restrengthening and data-informed initial stress heterogeneity, without prescribing frictional asperities. We use an ensemble of 3D dynamic rupture simulations to identify that mixed downdip pulse-like and updip crack-like rupture are driven by dynamic stress redistribution with episodic rupture reactivation. By featuring low fault strength compared to its dynamic stress drop, a preferred model can consistently reproduce the observed complex depth-dependent propagation speeds, multiple rupture fronts as imaged by back-projection, and large tsunamigenic slip at the trench. Our findings demonstrate that preexisting stress heterogeneity conjointly with dynamic frictional weakening and restrengthening drives seemingly unexpected megathrust rupture complexity, highlighting the need to include dynamic effects into physics-based seismic and tsunami hazard assessments of future earthquakes.</description>

      <title>Sensitivity of Trapping Efficiency and Relative Permeability to Experimental Methodology in Laboratory Core Flooding</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.09044</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.09044v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Understanding the migration and trapping of CO$_2$ in the subsurface is vital to geologic carbon storage projects. Traditional characterization methods employ steady-state co-injection experiments to determine relative permeability and trapping efficiency. Although laboratory studies aim to replicate reservoir conditions, co-injection experiments are often selected because they facilitate steady-state flow and reduce capillary end effects. The fundamental influence of this experimental design choice on measured petrophysical parameters remains inadequately characterized. This study presents a comparative analysis between co-injection and single-phase injection experiments, specifically investigating how experimental methodology influences both trapping efficiency and pressure differential across the core sample (which is used to calculate relative permeability). Our results demonstrate significant variations in trapping behavior between these injection techniques, suggesting that the traditional focus on co-injection experiments may overlook important physical flow phenomena. Differences between injection techniques could be strategically exploited in field applications to enhance residual trapping capacity in subsurface CO$_2$ storage operations. This work highlights the importance of understanding experimental artifacts in core flooding studies and their potential applications for improving carbon storage efficiency.</description>

      <title>Full-waveform earthquake source inversion using simulation-based inference</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.23238</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.23238v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper presents a novel framework for full-waveform seismic source inversion using simulation-based inference (SBI). Traditional probabilistic approaches often rely on simplifying assumptions about data errors, which we show can lead to inaccurate uncertainty quantification. SBI addresses this limitation by building an empirical probabilistic model of the data errors using machine learning models, known as neural density estimators, which can then be integrated into the Bayesian inference framework. We apply the SBI framework to point-source moment tensor inversions as well as joint moment tensor and time-location inversions. We construct a range of synthetic examples to explore the quality of the SBI solutions, as well as to compare the SBI results with standard Gaussian likelihood-based Bayesian inversions. We then demonstrate that under real seismic noise, common Gaussian likelihood assumptions for treating full-waveform data yield overconfident posterior distributions that underestimate the moment tensor component uncertainties by up to a factor of 3. We contrast this with SBI, which produces well-calibrated posteriors that generally agree with the true seismic source parameters, and offers an order-of-magnitude reduction in the number of simulations required to perform inference compared to standard Monte Carlo techniques. Finally, we apply our methodology to a pair of moderate magnitude earthquakes in the North Atlantic. We utilise seismic waveforms recorded by the recent UPFLOW ocean bottom seismometer array as well as by regional land stations in the Azores, comparing full moment tensor and source-time location posteriors between SBI and a Gaussian likelihood approach. We find that our adaptation of SBI can be directly applied to real earthquake sources to efficiently produce high quality posterior distributions that significantly improve upon Gaussian likelihood approaches.</description>
