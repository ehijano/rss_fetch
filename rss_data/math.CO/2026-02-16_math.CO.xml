      <title>On Camby-Plein's Characterization of Domination Perfect Graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.12374</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.12374v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We show that all results stated in [E. Camby, F. Plein, Discrete Appl. Math. 217 (2017) 711-717] are either previously known or incorrect. For example, Camby and Plein claimed to provide counterexamples to the 1995 characterization of domination perfect graphs due to Zverovich and Zverovich; however, these counterexamples are not valid. Moreover, the new characterization of domination perfect graphs proposed in that paper is incorrect.
  For completeness, we present a relatively brief proof of the 1995 characterization of domination perfect graphs due to Zverovich and Zverovich.</description>

      <title>On recurrence relations arising from NRS(2) applied to a cubic polynomial</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.12494</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.12494v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We prove that the leading coefficient of the "error" terms of NRS(2) applied to a cubic polynomial $f(z)$ with starting point $(-\frac{a_1}{a_2}, -\frac{a_1}{a_2})$ are positive-coefficient rational functions in the zeros of $f(z)$. We express these terms as a sum over combinatorial objects which we call radius-value trees.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2602.12551v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We give a complete characterization of tournaments H that have the Sidorenko property with respect to nearly regular tournaments, i.e., the homomorphism density of H among all nearly regular tournaments is minimized by a random tournament. Corollaries of our result are a positive answer to the question of Noel, Ranganathan and Simbaqueba whether there exist infinitely many non-transitive tournaments that are quasirandom forcing for nearly regular tournaments, and a negative answer to their question whether almost every tournament is quasirandom forcing for nearly regular tournaments.</description>

      <title>Plethysm and orbit harmonics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.12623</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.12623v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $\Pi_{(b^a)}$ be the locus of unordered set partitions of $[ab]$ with $a$ blocks of size $b$. We embed unordered set partitions of $[n]$ into the affine space $\mathbb{C}^{\binom{[n]}{2}}$ with coordinate ring $\mathbb{C}\Big[\mathbf{x}_{\binom{[n]}{2}}\Big]$. Then, we apply orbit harmonics to $\Pi_{(2^a)}$ and $\Pi_{(a^2)}$, yielding graded $\mathfrak{S}_{2a}$-modules whose graded character formulae respectively refine the Schur expansions of $h_a[h_2]$ and $h_2[h_a]$ according to $\lambda_1$. We further extend this $\lambda_1$-separation phenomenon to quotients of $\mathbb{C}^{\binom{[n]}{2}}$ where $n$ is odd. Combining $\Pi_{(b^a)},\Pi_{(a^b)}$ and orbit harmonics, we propose a conjecture related to Foulkes' conjecture, and we prove the special case $b=2$. We also apply orbit harmonics to the locus $\Pi_{n,m}$ of unordered set partitions of $[n]$ without blocks of size greater than $m$, yielding a graded $\mathfrak{S}_n$-module $R(\Pi_{n,m})$. We determine the standard monomial basis of $R(\Pi_{n,m})$ with respect to any monomial order, as well as its graded character formula.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2602.12654v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The $s$-blowup of a graph ($s\geq2$) is the $2s$-uniform hypergraph obtained by replacing each vertex with a set of size $s$ and preserving the adjacency relation. In this paper, we define $2s$-weighted graphs and use them to give all eigenvalues of the $s$-blowup of a graph.</description>

      <title>Combinatorial formulas for symmetric Macdonald polynomials by superizations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.12672</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.12672v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we derive new combinatorial formulas for symmetric Macdonald polynomials $P_{\lambda}(X;q,t)$ and integral Macdonald polynomials $J_{\lambda}(X;q,t)$, in terms of several new statistics and the major index for a partition $\lambda$. Moreover, three existing formulas for symmetric Macdonald polynomials established by Corteel--Mandelshtam--Williams (2022), Corteel--Haglund--Mandelshtam--Mason--Williams (2022) and Mandelshtam (2025) are recovered. Our proof relies on a new statistic on super fillings, employing the superization formula of Ayyer--Mandelshtam--Martin (2023) and our recent approach to modified Macdonald polynomials.</description>

      <title>Graph bootstrap percolation -- a discovery of slowness</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.12736</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.12736v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Graph bootstrap percolation is a discrete-time process capturing the spread of a virus on the edges of $K_n$. Given an initial set $G\subseteq K_n$ of infected edges, the transmission of the virus is governed by a fixed graph $H$: in each round of the process any edge $e$ of $K_n$ that is the last uninfected edge in a copy of $H$ in $K_n$ gets infected as well. Once infected, edges remain infected forever. The process was introduced by Bollob\'as in 1968 in the context of weak saturation and has since inspired a vast array of beautiful mathematics. The main focus of this survey is the extremal question of how long the infection process can last before stabilising. We give an exposition of our recent systematic study of this maximum running time and the influence of the infection rule $H$. The topic turns out to possess a wide variety of interesting behaviour, with connections to additive, extremal and probabilistic combinatorics. Along the way we encounter a number of surprises and attractive open problems.</description>

      <title>Flips and Merge-Width in Sparse Graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.12926</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.12926v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A flip of a graph is obtained by complementing the edge relation within a set of vertices. Flips are typically used to separate vertices in a graph, by increasing the distances between them. We show that in $K_{t,t}$-free graphs, every short sequence of flips can be simulated by a short sequence of vertex deletions that achieves a similar degree of separation: distances in the resulting graph are, up to a factor of three, at least as large as those obtained after the flips.
  This result provides a simple and uniform explanation of an emerging pattern in structural graph theory and finite model theory: the $K_{t,t}$-free fragment of a tameness notion for dense graphs often coincides with a tameness notion for sparse graphs. As immediate applications, we recover the following known equivalences. In the $K_{t,t}$-free setting, the dense notions (1) bounded shrub-depth, (2) bounded clique-width, (3) bounded flip-width, (4) monadic dependence, respectively, coincide with the sparse notions (1) bounded tree-depth, (2) bounded tree-width, (3) bounded expansion, and (4) no-where dense-ness.
  Furthermore, we reprove the result by Dreier and Toru\'nczyk (STOC 2025) stating that $K_{t,t}$-free classes of bounded merge-width have bounded expansion. Our proof provides explicit bounds and is direct, as it shows how to construct strong coloring orders (witnesses of bounded expansion) from merge sequences (witnesses of bounded merge-width).
  Along the way, we identify a new family of graph parameters, dubbed separation-width, that is sandwiched between the strong and weak coloring numbers, and is closely related to the merge-width parameters. We provide evidence that this family of graph parameters, apparently overlooked in the literature, may play a fundamental role in the study of sparse graphs.</description>

      <title>On Card guessing after a single shelf shuffle</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.12928</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.12928v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider a card guessing game with complete feedback. An ordered deck of $n$ cards labeled $1$ up to $n$ is shelf-shuffled exactly one time. One after the other a single card is drawn from the shuffled deck. The guesser makes has guess and the card is shown until no cards remain. We provide a distributional analysis of the number of correct guesses under the optimal strategy. We re-obtain the previously derived expectation and add a complete description of the distribution. We also obtain a central limit theorem for the number $n$ of cards tending to infinity. Furthermore, we discuss an unbalanced, biased shelf shuffle and show how to derive the extend our analysis, also adding the complete position matrix. Finally, a refined analysis of the number of correct guesses is carried out, distinguishing between pure luck guesses and certified correct guesses.</description>

      <title>Between proper and square coloring of planar graphs, hardness and extremal graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.13037</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.13037v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: $(1^a, 2^b)$-coloring is the problem of partitioning the vertex set of a graph into $a$ independent sets and $b$ 2-independent sets. This problem was recently introduced by Choi and Liu. We study the computational complexity and extremal properties of $(1^a, 2^b)$-coloring. We prove that this problem is NP-Complete even when restricted to certain classes of planar graphs, and we also investigate the extremal values of $b$ when $a$ is fixed and in some $(a + 1)$-colorable classes of graphs. In particular, we prove that $k$-degenerate graphs are $(1^k, 2^{O(\sqrt{n})})$-colorable, that triangle-free planar graphs are $(1^2, 2^{O(\sqrt{n})})$-colorable and that planar graphs are $(1^3, 2^{O(\sqrt{n})})$-colorable. All upper bounds obtained are tight up to a constant factor.</description>

      <title>Intersecting Codes and the Connectivity of $q$-Matroids</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.13107</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.13107v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the structure of intersecting error-correcting codes, with a particular focus on their connection to matroid theory. We establish properties and bounds for intersecting codes with the Hamming metric and illustrate how these distinguish the subfamily of minimal codes within the family of intersecting codes. We prove that the property of a code being intersecting is characterized by the matroid-theoretic notion of vertical connectivity, showing that intersecting codes are precisely those achieving the highest possible value of this parameter. We then introduce the concept of vertical connectivity for $q$-matroids and link it to the theory of intersecting codes endowed with the rank metric.</description>

      <title>Propagation processes on (hyper)graphs: where zero forcing and burning meet</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.13149</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.13149v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The burning and forcing processes are both instances of propagation processes on graphs that are commonly used to model real-world spreading phenomena. The contribution of this paper is two-fold. We first establish a connection between these two propagation processes via hypergraphs. We do so by showing a sharp upper bound on the zero forcing number of the incidence graph of a hypergraph in terms of the lazy burning number of the hypergraph, which builds up on and improves a result by Bonato, Jones, Marbach, Mishura and Zhang (Theor. Comput. Sci., 2025). Secondly, we deepen the understanding of the role of the burning process in the context of graph spectral characterizations, whose goal is to understand which graph properties are encoded in the spectrum. While for several graph properties, including the zero forcing number, it is known that the spectrum does not encode them, this question remained open for the burning number. We solve this problem by constructing infinitely many pairs of cospectral graphs which have a different burning number.</description>

      <title>Completeness in the Polynomial Hierarchy and PSPACE for many natural problems derived from NP</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.12350</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.12350v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Many natural optimization problems derived from $\sf NP$ admit bilevel and multilevel extensions in which decisions are made sequentially by multiple players with conflicting objectives, as in interdiction, adversarial selection, and adjustable robust optimization. Such problems are naturally modeled by alternating quantifiers and, therefore, lie beyond $\sf NP$, typically in the polynomial hierarchy or $\sf PSPACE$. Despite extensive study of these problem classes, relatively few natural completeness results are known at these higher levels. We introduce a general framework for proving completeness in the polynomial hierarchy and $\sf PSPACE$ for problems derived from $\sf NP$. Our approach is based on a refinement of $\sf NP$, which we call $\sf NP$ with solutions ($\sf NP$-$\sf S$), in which solutions are explicit combinatorial objects, together with a restricted class of reductions -- solution-embedding reductions -- that preserve solution structure. We define $\sf NP$-$\sf S$-completeness and show that a large collection of classical $\sf NP$-complete problems, including Clique, Vertex Cover, Knapsack, and Traveling Salesman, are $\sf NP$-$\sf S$-complete.
  Using this framework, we establish general meta-theorems showing that if a problem is $\sf NP$-$\sf S$-complete, then its natural two-level extensions are $\Sigma_2^p$-complete, its three-level extensions are $\Sigma_3^p$-complete, and its $k$-level extensions are $\Sigma_k^p$-complete. When the number of levels is unbounded, the resulting problems are $\sf PSPACE$-complete. Our results subsume nearly all previously known completeness results for multilevel optimization problems derived from $\sf NP$ and yield many new ones simultaneously, demonstrating that high computational complexity is a generic feature of multilevel extensions of $\sf NP$-complete problems.</description>

      <title>The Complexity of Homomorphism Reconstruction Revisited</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.12780</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.12780v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We revisit the algorithmic problem of reconstructing a graph from homomorphism counts that has first been studied in (B\"oker et al., STACS 2024): given graphs $F_1,\ldots,F_k$ and counts $m_1,\ldots,m_k$, decide if there is a graph $G$ such that the number of homomorphisms from $F_i$ to $G$ is $m_i$, for all $i$. We prove that the problem is NEXP-hard if the counts $m_i$ are specified in binary and $\Sigma_2^p$-complete if they are in unary.
  Furthermore, as a positive result, we show that the unary version can be solved in polynomial time if the constraint graphs are stars of bounded size.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2602.12801v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider $m\times n$ rectangular matrices formed from Sturmian words with slope $\alpha$ and we fully characterise their balance properties in terms of the Ostrowski representations of $m$ an $n$ with respect to $\alpha$. This generalises recent results by Anselmo et al., as well as by Shallit and Vukusic, where only quadratic irrationals $\alpha$ were considered. In contrast to the two mentioned papers, our approach is based on the distribution of $n\alpha \bmod 1$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2602.12912v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A base of a permutation group (X,G) is a subset B of X such that its pointwise stabilizer is the trivial group. A list (x1,x2, ... ,xk) of elements of X is irredundant if each element is not in the pointwise stabilizer of its predecessors. We define a Boolean representable simplicial complex B(X,G) such that a subset Y of X is independent if and only if some enumeration of its elements is irredundant. In addition Y is a base if and only if its closure is X. We give a number of examples and close with a conjecture whose solution leads to a new proof of the Feit-Thompson Theorem.</description>

      <title>Optimal Path Partitions in Subcubic and Almost-subcubic Graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.12925</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.12925v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider the problem of partitioning the edges of a graph into as few paths as possible. This is a~subject of the classic conjecture of Gallai and a recurring topic in combinatorics. Regarding the complexity of partitioning a graph optimally, Peroch\'e [Discret. Appl. Math., 1984] proved that it is NP-hard already on graphs of maximum degree four, even when we only ask if two paths suffice.
  We show that the problem is solvable in polynomial time on subcubic graphs and then we present an efficient algorithm for ``almost-subcubic'' graphs. Precisely, we prove that the problem is fixed-parameter tractable when parameterized by the edge-deletion distance to a subcubic graph. To this end, we reduce the task to model checking in first-order logic extended by disjoint-paths predicates ($\mathsf{FO}\text{+}\mathsf{DP}$) and then we employ the recent tractability result by Schirrmacher, Siebertz, Stamoulis, Thilikos, and Vigny [LICS 2024].</description>

      <title>Determinant and Pfaffian formulas for particle annihilation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.13183</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.13183v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: When particles on a line collide, they may annihilate-both are destroyed. Computing exact annihilation probabilities has been difficult because collisions reduce the particle count, while determinantal methods require a fixed count throughout. The ghost particle method, introduced in a companion paper for coalescence, keeps destroyed particles walking as invisible ghosts that restore the missing dimension. We apply this method to annihilation: when two particles annihilate, both trajectories continue as invisible walkers, yielding an exact determinantal formula that specifies the number of annihilations, where survivors end up, and where ghosts end up. For complete annihilation (no survivors), the formula simplifies to a Pfaffian-an algebraic relative of the determinant built from pairwise quantities-connecting to Pfaffian point process theory. The annihilation formula also yields results about coalescence: pairwise coalescence can be reinterpreted as complete annihilation, producing a Pfaffian coalescence formula. These formulas are exact for any finite initial configuration and apply to discrete lattice paths, birth-death chains, and continuous diffusions including Brownian motion.</description>

      <title>Enumeration of multiplex juggling card sequences using generalized q-derivatives</title>

      <description>arXiv:2402.09903v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In 2019, Butler, Choi, Kim, and Seo introduced a new type of juggling card that represents multiplex juggling patterns in a natural bijective way. They conjectured a formula for the generating function for the number of multiplex juggling cards with capacity 2. In this paper we prove their conjecture. More generally, we find an explicit formula for the generating function with any capacity. We also find an expression for the generating function for multiplex juggling card sequences by introducing a generalization of the q-derivative operator. As a consequence, we show that this generating function is a rational function.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.07689v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We establish a bijection between binary even LCD codes and simple graphs whose adjacency matrices are idempotent over $\FF_2$. This bijection preserves equivalence: permutation equivalence of codes corresponds exactly to graph isomorphism. Based on this framework, we characterize which distance-regular graphs yield LCD codes via intersection array parameters, prove that non-isomorphic conference graphs yield inequivalent codes, and classify LCD-derived graphs of small orders.</description>

      <title>Majorization via positivity of Jack and Macdonald polynomial differences</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.19649v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Majorization inequalities have a long history, going back to Maclaurin and Newton. They were recently studied for several families of symmetric functions, including by Cuttler--Greene--Skandera (2011), Sra (2016), Khare--Tao (2021), McSwiggen--Novak (2022), and Chen--Sahi (2024+) among others. Here we extend the inequalities by these authors to Jack and Macdonald polynomials, and obtain conjectural characterizations of majorization and of weak majorization of the underlying partitions. We prove these characterizations for two variables. In fact, we upgrade -- and prove in the above cases -- the characterization of majorization, to containment of Jack and Macdonald differences lying in the Muirhead semiring.</description>

      <title>Extending Ghouila-Houri's Characterization of Comparability Graphs to Temporal Graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.06849</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.06849v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: An orientation of a given static graph is called transitive if for any three vertices $a,b,c$, the presence of arcs $(a,b)$ and $(b,c)$ forces the presence of the arc $(a,c)$. If only the presence of an arc between $a$ and $c$ is required, but its orientation is unconstrained, the orientation is called quasi-transitive. A fundamental result presented by Ghouila-Houri guarantees that any static graph admitting a quasi-transitive orientation also admits a transitive orientation. In a seminal work, Mertzios et al. introduced the notion of temporal transitivity in order to model information flows in simple temporal networks. We revisit the model introduced by Mertzios et al. and propose an analogous to Ghouila-Houri's characterization for the temporal scenario. We present a structure theorem that will allow us to express by a 2-SAT formula all the constraints imposed by temporal transitive orientations. The latter produces an efficient recognition algorithm for graphs admitting such orientations. Additionally, we extend the temporal transitivity model to temporal graphs having multiple time-labels associated to their edges and claim that the previous results hold in the multilabel setting. Finally, we propose a characterization of temporal comparability graphs via forbidden temporal ordered patterns.</description>

      <title>Remarks on a theorem of Erd\H{o}s and Szemer\'{e}di</title>

      <description>arXiv:2602.03865v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Given a graph $G$ and a real $\varepsilon&gt;0$, an edge-coloring of $G$ is called $\varepsilon$-balanced if each color appears on at least an $\varepsilon$-fraction of the edges in $G$. A classical result of Erd\H{o}s and Szemer\'{e}di asserts that if a $2$-edge-coloring of a complete graph $K_n$ is not $\varepsilon$-balanced for some $0&lt;\varepsilon\leq1/2$, then there exists a large monochromatic clique. This theorem has been used extensively in Ramsey-type arguments, as it allows one to focus on reasonably balanced colorings. However, in its original formulation the dependence between $n$ and $\varepsilon$ was left implicit, occasionally leading to inaccurate applications. In this short note, we revisit the Erd\H{o}s--Szemer\'{e}di theorem and specify all parameter dependencies.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2602.06659v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A graph is universally $k$-edge-weightable if for every $k$-element set $Q\subset\mathbb{R}$, it admits a proper $Q$-edge weighting. The settled 1-2-3 conjecture implies that for any arithmetic progression $\{a,b,c\}$, every nice regular graph has a proper $\{a,b,c\}$-edge weighting. We prove that this remains valid for all 3-element set $\{a,b,c\}$ with $c-b \neq b-a$. Consequently, every nice regular graph is universally $3$-edge-weightable.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2212.09771v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Classification of cluster variables in cluster algebras (in particular, Grassmannian cluster algebras) is an important problem, which has direct application to computations of scattering amplitudes in physics. In this paper, we apply the tableaux method to classify cluster variables in Grassmannian cluster algebras $\mathbb{C}[Gr(k,n)]$ up to $(k,n)=(3,12), (4,10)$, or $(4,12)$ up to a certain number of columns of tableaux, using HPC clusters. These datasets are made available on GitHub. Supervised and unsupervised machine learning methods are used to analyse this data and identify structures associated to tableaux corresponding to cluster variables. Conjectures are raised associated to the enumeration of tableaux at each rank and the tableaux structure which creates a cluster variable, with the aid of machine learning.</description>

Abstract: The homogeneous coordinate ring of the Grassmannian $\rm{Gr}(k,n)$ has a well-known cluster structure. There is a categorification of this cluster structure via a category of modules for a ring $A_{k,n}$ due to Jensen-King-Su, building on work of Geiss-Leclerc-Schr\"oer, in which cluster variables correspond to indecomposable rigid modules. We give a combinatorial description of modules that correspond to rank $2$ cluster variables by using webs. This conjecturally gives the categorification of all rank $2$ cluster variables.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.07126v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We determine when the irreducible modules $L(c_{p, q}, h_{m, n})$ over the simple Virasoro vertex algebras $\operatorname{Vir}_{p, q}$, where $p, q \ge 2$ are relatively prime with $0 &lt; m &lt; p$ and $0 &lt; n &lt; q$, are classically free. It turns out this only happens with the boundary minimal models, i.e., with the irreducible modules over $\operatorname{Vir}_{2, 2s + 1}$ for $s \in \mathbb{Z}_+$. We thus obtain a complete description of the classical limits of these modules in terms of the jet algebra of the corresponding Zhu $C_2$-algebra. The Andrews-Gordon generalization of the Rogers-Ramanujan identities is used in the proof, and our results in turn provide a natural interpretation of these identities.</description>

Abstract: We investigate the open problem of the existence of genuinely unextendible product bases (GUPBs), that is, multipartite unextendible product bases (UPBs) which remain unextendible even with respect to biproduct vectors across all bipartitions of the parties. To this end, we exploit the well-known connection between UPBs and graph theory through orthogonality graphs and orthogonal representations, together with recent progress in this framework, and employ forbidden induced subgraph characterizations to single out the admissible local orthogonality graphs for GUPBs. Using this approach, we establish that GUPBs of size thirteen in three-qutrit systems-the smallest candidate GUPBs-do not exist. We further provide a partial characterization of graphs relevant to larger bases and systems with ququart subsystems.</description>

Abstract: This paper shows that discrete Morse-Bott theory can be developed as a natural extension of R. Forman's discrete Morse theory by improving the definition of the discrete Morse-Bott function introduced by S. Yaptieu. To this end, we demonstrate that the combinatorial structure of critical cells can be extended to critical sets intuitively. Furthermore, we establish the discrete Morse-Bott inequalities, providing a unified view that extends both the discrete Morse inequalities and the continuous Morse-Bott inequalities.</description>

      <title>Permanents of matrix ensembles: computation, distribution, and geometry</title>

      <description>arXiv:2602.10141v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We report on a computational and experimental study of permanents. On the computational side, we use the GPU to greaatly accelerate the computation of permanents over $\mathbb{C},$ $\mathbb{R},$ $\mathbb{F}_p$ and $\mathbb{Q}.$ First, for Haar-distributed unitary matrices~$U$, the permanent $\perm(U)$ follows a circularly-symmetric complex Gaussian distribution $\mathcal{CN}(0,\sigma^2)$ -- we confirm this via a number of tests for $n$ up to~23 with $50{,}000$ samples. The DFT matrix permanent is an extreme outlier for every prime $n\ge 7$. In contrast, for Haar-random \emph{orthogonal} matrices~$O$, the permanent $\perm(O)$ is approximately real Gaussian but with positive excess kurtosis that decays as~$O(1/n)$, indicating slower convergence. For matrices with Gaussian entries (GUE, GOE, Ginibre), the permanent follows an $\alpha$-stable distribution with stability index $\alpha\approx 1.0$--$1.4$, well below the Gaussian value $\alpha=2$. We test Aaronson's conjecture that $|\perm(X)|^2$ is asymptotically lognormal for Gaussian~$X$: it is plausible for the complex Ginibre and GOE ensembles, but appears to fail for GUE and real Ginibre, where the $\alpha$-stable tails prevent convergence. Anti-concentration, however, holds for all Gaussian ensembles and is more robust than for Haar unitaries.
  Secondly, we study the permanent along geodesics on the unitary group. For the geodesic from the identity to the $n$-cycle permutation matrix, we find a universal scaling function $f(t)=\frac{1}{n}\ln|\perm(\gamma(t))|$ that is independent of~$n$ in the large-$n$ limit, with a midpoint value \[
  \perm(\gamma({\textstyle\frac12}))
  = (-1)^{(n-1)/2}\cdot 2e^{-n}\bigl(1+\tfrac{1}{3n}+O(n^{-2})\bigr) \] for odd~$n$ and zero for even~$n$. We also study the geodesic forom the identity to the DFT matrix.</description>
