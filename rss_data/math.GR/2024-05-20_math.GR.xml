      <title>On spherical Deligne complexes of type $D_n$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.11374</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.11374v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $\Delta$ be the Artin complex of the Artin group of type $D_n$. This complex is also called the spherical Deligne complex of type $D_n$. We show certain types of 6-cycles in the 1-skeleton of $\Delta$ either have a center, which is a vertex adjacent to each vertex of the 6-cycle, or a quasi-center, which is a vertex adjacent to three of the alternating vertices of the 6-cycle. This will be a key ingredient in proving $K(\pi,1)$-conjecture for several classes of Artin groups in a companion article.
  As a consequence, we also deduce that certain 2-dimensional relative Artin complex inside the $D_n$-type Artin complex, endowed with the induced Moussong metric, is CAT$(1)$.</description>

      <title>On $\mathrm{K}$-$\mathbb{P}_{t}$-subnormal subgroups of finite groups and related formations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.11652</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.11652v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $t$ be a fixed natural number. A subgroup $H$ of a group $G$ will be called $\mathrm{K}$-$\mathbb{P}_{t}$-subnormal in $G$ if there exists a chain of subgroups $H = H_{0} \leq H_{1} \leq \cdots \leq H_{m-1} \leq H_{m} = G$ such that either $H_{i-1}$ is normal in $H_{i}$ or $|H_{i} : H_{i-1}|$ is a some prime $p$ and $p-1$ is not divisible by the $(t+1)$th powers of primes for every $i = 1,\ldots , n$. In this work, properties of $\mathrm{K}$-$\mathbb{P}_{t}$-subnormal subgroups and classes of groups with Sylow $\mathrm{K}$-$\mathbb{P}_{t}$-subnormal subgroups are obtained.</description>

      <title>First examples of non-abelian quotients of the Grothendieck-Teichmueller group that receive surjective homomorphisms from the absolute Galois group of rational numbers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.11725</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.11725v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Many challenging questions about the Grothendieck-Teichmueller group, $GT$, are motivated by the fact that this group receives the injective homomorphism (called the Ihara embedding) from the absolute Galois group, $G_Q$, of rational numbers. Although the question about the surjectivity of the Ihara embedding is a very challenging problem, in this paper, we construct a family of finite non-abelian quotients of $GT$ that receive surjective homomorphisms from $G_Q$. We also assemble these finite quotients into an infinite (non-abelian) profinite quotient of $GT$. We prove that the natural homomorphism from $G_Q$ to the resulting profinite group is also surjective. We give an explicit description of this profinite group.
  To achieve these goals, we used the groupoid $GTSh$ of $GT$-shadows for the gentle version of the Grothendieck-Teichmueller group. This groupoid was introduced in the recent paper by the second author and J. Guynee and the set $Ob(GTSh)$ of objects of $GTSh$ is a poset of certain finite index normal subgroups of the Artin braid group on 3 strands. We introduce a sub-poset $Dih$ of $Ob(GTSh)$ related to the family of dihedral groups and call it the dihedral poset. We show that each element $K$ of $Dih$ is the only object of its connected component in $GTSh$. Using the surjectivity of the cyclotomic character, we prove that, if the order of the dihedral group corresponding to $K$ is a power of 2, then the natural homomorphism from $G_Q$ to the finite group $GTSh(K, K)$ is surjective. We introduce the Lochak-Schneps conditions on morphisms of $GTSh$ and prove that each morphism of $GTSh$ with the target $K$ in $Dih$ satisfies the Lochak-Schneps conditions. Finally, we conjecture that the natural homomorphism from $G_Q$ to the finite group $GTSh(K, K)$ is surjective for every object $K$ of the dihedral poset.</description>

      <title>Cycles in spherical Deligne complexes and application to $K(\pi,1)$-conjecture for Artin groups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.12068</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.12068v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We show the $K(\pi,1)$-conjecture holds for Artin groups whose Dynkin diagrams are complete bipartite (edge labels are allowed to be arbitrary), answering a question of J. McCammond. Along the way, we treat several related families of hyperbolic type Artin groups, namely the $K(\pi,1)$-conjecture holds for all 3-dimensional hyperbolic type Artin groups, except one single example with Dynkin diagram $[3,5,3]$; and the conjecture holds for all quasi-Lann\'er hyperbolic type Artin groups up to dimension 4. We also treat several higher dimensional families.
  Most of the article is about developing new methods of understanding combinatorial minimal fillings of certain types of cycles in spherical Deligne complexes or relative Artin complexes, via non-positive curvature geometry. Then we combine this with an approached to the $K(\pi,1)$-conjecture introduced by a previous article of the author to settle new cases of $K(\pi,1)$-conjecture.
  In the appendix we list some related open questions and conjectures.</description>

      <title>Bounds in terms of the number of cyclic subgroups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.12160</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.12160v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A family of groups is called (maximal) cyclic bounded ((M)CB) if, for every natural number $n$, there are only finitely many groups in the family with at most $n$ (maximal) cyclic subgroups. We prove that the family of groups of prime power order is MCB. We also prove that the family of finite groups without cyclic coprime direct factors is CB. As a consequence, a natural number $n \geqslant 10$ is prime if and only if there are only finitely many finite noncyclic groups with precisely $n$ cyclic subgroups.</description>

      <title>Rota-Baxter groups with weight zero and integration on topological groups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.11288</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.11288v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Rota-Baxter groups with weights $\pm 1$ have attracted quite much attention since their recent introduction, thanks to their connections with Rota-Baxter Lie algebras, factorizations of Lie groups, post- and pre-Lie algebras, braces and set-theoretic solutions of the Yang-Baxter equation. Despite their expected importance from integrals on groups to pre-groups and Yang-Baxter equations, Rota-Baxter groups with weight zero and other weights has been a challenge to define and their search has been the focus of several attempts.
  By composing an operator with a section map as a perturbation device, we first generalize the notion of a Rota-Baxter operator on a group from the existing case of weight $\pm 1$ to the case where the weight is given by a pair of maps and then a sequence limit of such pairs. From there, two candidates of Rota-Baxter operators with weight zero are given. One of them is the Rota-Baxter operator with limit-weight zero detailed here, with the other candidate introduced in a companion work. This operator is shown to have its tangent map the Rota-Baxter operator with weight zero on Lie algebras. It also gives concrete applications in integrals of maps with values in a class of topological groups called $\RR$-groups, satisfying a multiplicative version of the integration-by-parts formula.
  In parallel, differential groups in this framework is also developed and a group formulation of the First Fundamental Theorem of Calculus is obtained.</description>

      <title>Time-inhomogeneous random walks on finite groups and cokernels of random integer block matrices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.11435</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.11435v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study time-inhomogeneous random walks on finite groups in the case where each random walk step need not be supported on a generating set of the group. When the supports of the random walk steps satisfy a natural condition involving normal subgroups of quotients of the group, we show that the random walk converges to the uniform distribution on the group and give bounds for the convergence rate using spectral properties of the random walk steps. As an application, we prove a universality theorem for cokernels of random integer matrices allowing some dependence between entries.</description>

Abstract: We show that there is a type-preserving homomorphism from the fundamental group of the figure-eight knot complement to the mapping class group of the thrice-punctured torus. As a corollary, we obtain infinitely many commensurability classes of purely pseudo-Anosov surface subgroups of mapping class groups of closed surfaces. This gives the first examples of compact atoroidal surface bundles over surfaces.</description>

Abstract: We characterise hyperbolic groups in terms of quasigeodesics in the Cayley graph forming regular languages. We also obtain a quantitative characterisation of hyperbolicity of geodesic metric spaces by the non-existence of certain local (3,0)-quasigeodesic loops. As an application we make progress towards a question of Shapiro regarding groups admitting a uniquely geodesic Cayley graph.</description>

Abstract: We show that discrete stationary random subgroups of isometry groups of Gromov hyperbolic spaces have full limit sets as well as critical exponents bounded from below. This information is used to answer a question of Gelander and show that a rank one locally symmetric space for which the bottom of the spectrum of the Laplace-Beltrami operator is the same as that of its universal cover has unbounded injectivity radius.</description>

      <title>Splittings of One-Ended Groups with One-Ended Halfspaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.06218</link>
      <description>arXiv:2308.06218v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We introduce the notion of halfspaces associated to a group splitting, and investigate the relationship between the coarse geometry of the halfspaces and the coarse geometry of the group. Roughly speaking, the halfspaces of a group splitting are subgraphs of the Cayley graph obtained by pulling back the halfspaces of the Bass--Serre tree. Our first theorem shows that (under mild conditions) any splitting of a one-ended group can be upgraded to a splitting where all the halfspaces are one-ended. Our second theorem demonstrates that a one-ended group usually has a JSJ splitting where all the halfspaces are one-ended. And our third theorem states that if a one-ended finitely presented group $G$ admits a splitting such that some edge stabilizer has more than one end, but the halfspaces associated to the edge stabilizer are one-ended, then $H^2(G,\mathbb ZG)\ne \{0\}$; in particular $G$ is not simply connected at infinity and $G$ is not an $n$-dimensional duality group for $n\geq3$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:1910.12497v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the geometry and partial differential equations arising from the consideration of group-determinants, and representation theory. The simplest and most striking such example is undoubtedly that of the Humbert operator, associated with the cyclic group Z/3Z. This operator appears as a natural extension of the Laplacian in dimension 2. Another originality of our work is to show that the spectral theory of operators associated with Frobenius determinants is closely linked to finite Fourier transform theory.</description>

      <title>Zimmer's conjecture for non-uniform lattices: escape of mass and growth of cocycles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2105.14541</link>
      <description>arXiv:2105.14541v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We establish finiteness of low-dimensional actions of lattices in higher-rank semisimple Lie groups and establish Zimmer's conjecture for many such groups. This builds on previous work of the authors handling the case of actions by cocompact lattices and of actions by $\Sl(n,\Z)$. While the results are not sharp in all cases, they do dramatically improve all known results. The key difficulty overcome in this paper concerns escape of mass when taking limits of sequences of measures. Due to a need to control Lyapunov exponents for unbounded cocycles when taking such limits, quantitative controls on the concentration of mass at infinity are need and novel techniques are introduced to avoid ``escape of Lyapunov exponent."</description>

Abstract: We study the antipodal subsets of the full flag manifolds $\mathcal{F}(\mathbb{R}^d)$. As a consequence, for natural numbers $d \ge 2$ such that $d\ne 5$ and $d \not\equiv 0,\pm1 \mod 8$, we show that Borel Anosov subgroups of ${\rm SL}(d,\mathbb{R})$ are virtually isomorphic to either a free group or the fundamental group of a closed hyperbolic surface. This gives a partial answer to a question asked by Andr\'es Sambarino. Furthermore, we show restrictions on the hyperbolic spaces admitting uniformly regular quasi-isometric embeddings into the symmetric space $X_d$ of ${\rm SL}(d,\mathbb{R})$.</description>

      <title>The moduli space of cactus flower curves and the virtual cactus group</title>

      <description>arXiv:2308.06880v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The space $ \ft_n = \C^n/\C $ of $n$ points on the line modulo translation has a natural compactification $ \overline \ft_n $ as a matroid Schubert variety. In this space, pairwise distances between points can be infinite; it is natural to imagine points at infinite distance from each other as living on different projective lines. We call such a configuration of points a ``flower curve'', since we picture the projective lines joined into a flower. Within $ \ft_n $, we have the space $ F_n = \C^n \setminus \Delta / \C $ of $ n$ distinct points. We introduce a natural compatification $ \overline F_n $ along with a map $ \overline F_n \rightarrow \overline \ft_n $, whose fibres are products of genus 0 Deligne-Mumford spaces. We show that both $\overline \ft_n$ and $\overline F_n$, are special fibers of $1$-parameter families whose generic fibers are, respectively, Losev-Manin and Deligne-Mumford moduli spaces of stable genus $0$ curves with $n+2$ marked points.
  We find combinatorial models for the real loci $ \overline \ft_n(\BR) $ and $ \overline F_n(\BR) $. Using these models, we prove that these spaces are aspherical and that their equivariant fundamental groups are the virtual symmetric group and the virtual cactus groups, respectively. The degeneration of a twisted real form of the Deligne-Mumford space to $\overline F_n(\mathbb{R})$ gives rise to a natural homomorphism from the affine cactus group to the virtual cactus group.</description>

      <title>The harmonic oscillator on the Moyal-Groenewold plane: an approach via Lie groups and twisted Weyl tuples</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.06143</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.06143v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper investigates the functional calculus of the harmonic oscillator on each Moyal-Groenewold plane, the noncommutative phase space which is a fundamental object in quantum mechanics. Specifically, we show that the harmonic oscillator admits a bounded $\mathrm{H}^\infty(\Sigma_\omega)$ functional calculus for any angle $0 &lt; \omega &lt; \frac{\pi}{2}$ and even a bounded H\"ormander functional calculus on the associated noncommutative $\mathrm{L}^p$-spaces, where $\Sigma_\omega=\{ z \in \mathbb{C}^*: |\arg z| &lt;\omega \}$. To achieve these results, we develop a connection with the theory of 2-step nilpotent Lie groups by introducing a notion of twisted Weyl tuple and connecting it to some semigroups of operators previously investigated by Robinson via group representations. Along the way, we demonstrate that $\mathrm{L}^p$-square-max decompositions lead to new insights between noncommutative ergodic theory and $R$-boundedness, and we prove a twisted transference principle, which is of independent interest. Our approach accommodate the presence of a constant magnetic field and they are indeed new even in the framework of magnetic Weyl calculus on classical $\mathrm{L}^p$-spaces. Our results contribute to the understanding of functional calculi on noncommutative spaces and have implications for the maximal regularity of the most basic evolution equations associated to the harmonic oscillator.</description>
