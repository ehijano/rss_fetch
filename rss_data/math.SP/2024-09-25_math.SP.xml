      <title>Prolate Spheroidal Wave Functions and the Accuracy and Dimensionality of Spectral Analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.16584</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.16584v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The main result of this thesis is an efficient protocol to determine the frequencies of a signal $C(t)= \sum_k |a_k|^2 e^{i \omega_k t}$, which is given for a finite time, to a high degree of precision. Specifically, we develop a theorem that provides a fundamental precision guarantee. Additionally, we establish an approximation theory for spectral analysis through low-dimensional subspaces that can be applied to a wide range of problems. The signal processing routine relies on a symmetry between harmonic analysis and quantum mechanics. In this context, prolate spheroidal wave functions (PSWF) are identified as the optimal information processing basis. To establish rigorous precision guarantees, we extend the concentration properties of PSWFs to a supremum bound and an $\ell_2$ bound on their derivatives. The new bounds allow us to refine the truncation estimates for the prolate sampling formula. We also provide a new geometrical insight into the commutation relation between an integral operator and a differential operator, both of which have PSWFs as eigenfunctions.</description>

      <title>Eigenvalues of the magnetic Dirichlet Laplacian with constant magnetic field on discs in the strong field limit</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.01474</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.01474v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider the magnetic Dirichlet Laplacian with constant magnetic field on domains of finite measure. In the case of a disc, we prove that the eigenvalue branches with respect to the field strength behave asymptotically linear with an exponentially small remainder term as the field strength goes to infinity. We compute the asymptotic expression for this remainder term. Furthermore, we show that for sufficiently large magnetic field strengths, the spectral bound corresponding to the P\'olya conjecture for the non-magnetic Dirichlet Laplacian is violated up to a sharp excess factor which is independent of the domain.</description>

      <title>Perron similarities and the nonnegative inverse eigenvalue problem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.07682</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.07682v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The longstanding nonnegative inverse eigenvalue problem (NIEP) is to determine which multisets of complex numbers occur as the spectrum of an entry-wise nonnegative matrix. Although there are some well-known necessary conditions, a solution to the NIEP is far from known.
  An invertible matrix is called a Perron similarity if it diagonalizes an irreducible, nonnegative matrix. Johnson and Paparella developed the theory of real Perron similarities. Here, we fully develop the theory of complex Perron similarities.
  Each Perron similarity gives a nontrivial polyhedral cone and polytope of realizable spectra (thought of as vectors in complex Euclidean space). The extremals of these convex sets are finite in number, and their determination for each Perron similarity would solve the diagonalizable NIEP, a major portion of the entire problem. By considering Perron similarities of certain realizing matrices of Type I Karpelevich arcs, large portions of realizable spectra are generated for a given positive integer. This is demonstrated by producing a nearly complete geometrical representation of the spectra of $4 \times 4$ stochastic matrices.
  Similar to the Karpelevich region, it is shown that the subset of complex Euclidean space comprising the spectra of stochastic matrices is compact and star-shaped. Extremal elements of the set are defined and shown to be on the boundary.
  It is shown that the polyhedral cone and convex polytope of the discrete Fourier transform (DFT) matrix corresponds to the conical hull and convex hull of its rows, respectively. Similar results are established for multifold Kronecker products of DFT matrices and multifold Kronecker products of DFT matrices and Walsh matrices. These polytopes are of great significance with respect to the NIEP because they are extremal in the region comprising the spectra of stochastic matrices.</description>

      <title>Dispersive Estimates for Maxwell's Equations in the Exterior of a Sphere</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.00536</link>
      <description>arXiv:2308.00536v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The goal of this article is to establish general principles for high frequency dispersive estimates for Maxwell's equation in the exterior of a perfectly conducting ball. We construct entirely new generalized eigenfunctions for the corresponding Maxwell propagator. We show that the propagator corresponding to the electric field has a global rate of decay in $L^1-L^{\infty}$ operator norm in terms of time $t$ and powers of $h$. In particular we show that some, but not all, polarizations of electromagnetic waves scatter at the same rate as the usual wave operator. The Dirichlet Laplacian wave operator $L^1-L^{\infty}$ norm estimate should not be expected to hold in general for Maxwell's equations in the exterior of a ball because of the Helmholtz decomposition theorem.</description>
