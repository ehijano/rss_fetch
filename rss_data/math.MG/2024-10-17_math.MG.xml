      <title>Pentagonal bipyramids lead to the smallest flexible embedded polyhedron</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.13811</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.13811v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Steffen's polyhedron was believed to have the least number of vertices among polyhedra that can flex without self-intersections. Maksimov clarified that the pentagonal bipyramid with one face subdivided into three is the only polyhedron with fewer vertices for which the existence of a self-intersection-free flex was open. Since subdividing a face into three does not change the mobility, we focus on flexible pentagonal bipyramids. When a bipyramid flexes, the distance between the two opposite vertices of the two pyramids changes; associating the position of the bipyramid to this distance yields an algebraic map that determines a nontrivial extension of rational function fields. We classify flexible pentagonal bipyramids with respect to the Galois group of this field extension and provide examples for each class, building on a construction proposed by Nelson. Surprisingly, one of our constructions yields a flexible pentagonal bipyramid that can be extended to an embedded flexible polyhedron with 8 vertices. The latter hence solves the open question.</description>

      <title>Geometric graphs with exponential chromatic number and arbitrary girth</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.06898</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.06898v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In 1975 Erd\H{o}s initiated the study of the following very natural question. What can be said about the chromatic number of unit distance graphs in $\mathbb{R}^2$ that have large girth? Over the years this question and its natural extension to $\mathbb{R}^d$ attracted considerable attention with the high-dimensional variant reiterated recently by Alon and Kupavskii.
  We prove that there exist unit distance graphs in $\mathbb{R}^d$ with chromatic number at least $(1.074 + o(1))^d$ that have arbitrarily large girth. This improves upon a series of results due to Kupavskii; Sagdeev; and Sagdeev and Raigorodskii and gives the first bound in which the base of the exponent does not tend to one with the girth. In addition, our construction can be made explicit which allows us to answer in a strong form a question of Kupavskii.
  Our arguments show graphs of large chromatic number and high girth exist in a number of other geometric settings including diameter graphs and orthogonality graphs.</description>

      <title>Expected Sliced Transport Plans</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.12176</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.12176v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The optimal transport (OT) problem has gained significant traction in modern machine learning for its ability to: (1) provide versatile metrics, such as Wasserstein distances and their variants, and (2) determine optimal couplings between probability measures. To reduce the computational complexity of OT solvers, methods like entropic regularization and sliced optimal transport have been proposed. The sliced OT framework improves efficiency by comparing one-dimensional projections (slices) of high-dimensional distributions. However, despite their computational efficiency, sliced-Wasserstein approaches lack a transportation plan between the input measures, limiting their use in scenarios requiring explicit coupling. In this paper, we address two key questions: Can a transportation plan be constructed between two probability measures using the sliced transport framework? If so, can this plan be used to define a metric between the measures? We propose a "lifting" operation to extend one-dimensional optimal transport plans back to the original space of the measures. By computing the expectation of these lifted plans, we derive a new transportation plan, termed expected sliced transport (EST) plans. We prove that using the EST plan to weight the sum of the individual Euclidean costs for moving from one point to another results in a valid metric between the input discrete probability measures. We demonstrate the connection between our approach and the recently proposed min-SWGG, along with illustrative numerical examples that support our theoretical findings.</description>
