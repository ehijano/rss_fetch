      <title>Society's Resilience to a Total Loss of Agriculture</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.17828</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.17828v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: While technology and trade have made modern food systems increasingly resilient to disruptions, it is unknown if human society could survive the most extreme threats to agriculture, such as from severe climate change or nuclear/biological warfare. One way that society could withstand such disruptions is to make food without agriculture. Here, I evaluate the feasibility of rapidly scaling up nonagricultural food production in response to a disaster. I find that even in an idealized worst-case scenario where all current agricultural production ends instantaneously and cannot be restarted, it may be possible for at least some countries to begin producing enough food without agriculture to feed their populations before existing food supplies run out. As a proof of principle, for the US, producing edible bacteria grown on natural gas appears to be one feasible option for quickly making food without agriculture. Feeding the US population this way would require about 16% of US annual natural gas production, 6% of US annual electricity consumption, and $530 billion (1.9% of US GDP) worth of food production facilities. Several key findings from this report remain uncertain, and if a disaster hits at the worst possible time with respect to annual variation in stored food supplies, there may not be enough time to scale up other food production options. However, this report suggests that some countries are close to, or may already be at, the point where they could survive just about any agricultural disaster, as long as modern industry remains intact. I find that there are several interventions that could more thoroughly close this window of vulnerability: designing and piloting alternative food production facilities in advance of a disaster, improving the nutritional quality of alternative foods through research and development, and increasing crop stock levels.</description>

      <title>Asymmetric Outcomes in Two-Actor Conflict Dynamics: Stability, Bifurcations, and Emergent Behaviors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.17993</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.17993v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper we present an analytical and numerical study of a generalized model
  of two-actor cooperative-competitive conflict. Theoretically, we note that the in troduction of a new parameter allows generalizing feedback as strong and weak.
  Furthermore, we show that for positive-positive and negative-negative feedback there
  exists a supercritical pitchfork bifurcation, and that the model does not admit limit
  cycles in any case, and we study the effect of different parameter values and initial
  conditions by using a difference equation approximation of the model. Additionally,
  our model offers important insight on social phenomena such as false levels of support
  among cooperators, often observed in agreement negotiations; instances of ``non-strict
  consensus'' when two people support the same political position, albeit with different
  intensities; and competitive situations, such as in competitions with disproportionate
  profit and losses. Thus, this generalized model offers an enhanced descriptive power
  compared to previously proposed models.</description>

      <title>Innovation by Displacement</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.15959</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.15959v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: New ideas are often thought to arise from recombining existing knowledge. Yet despite rapid publication growth - and expanding opportunities for recombination - scientific breakthroughs remain rare. This gap between productivity and progress challenges recombinant growth theory as the prevailing account of innovation. We argue that the limitation of this theory lies in treating ideas solely as complements, overlooking that breakthroughs often arise when ideas act as substitutes. To test this, we integrate scientist interviews, bibliometric validation, and machine learning analysis of 41 million papers (1965-2024). Interviews reveal that breakthroughs are marked not by novelty (Atypicality) alone but by their ability to displace dominant ideas (Disruption). Large-scale analysis confirms that novelty and disruption represent distinct innovation mechanisms: they are negatively correlated across domains, periods, team sizes, and paper versions. Novel papers extend dominant ideas across topics and attract immediate attention; disruptive papers displace them within the same topic and generate lasting influence. Hence, progress slows not from lack of effort but because most research extends rather than overturns ideas. Applying this perspective reveals distinct roles of theories and methods in scientific change: methods more often drive breakthroughs, whereas theories tend to be novel but rarely disruptive, reinforcing the dominance of established ideas.</description>
