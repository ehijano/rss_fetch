      <title>Spontaneous fission half-life in Fm isotopes with nuclear energy density functional</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.09735</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.09735v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A microscopic description of fission dynamics is important to understand the decay properties of neutron-rich heavy nuclei that are relevant to $r$-process nucleosynthesis. To provide a reliable and efficient method to evaluate the spontaneous fission half-life, we develop a method, called the constrained Hartree--Fock--Bogoliubov (CHFB) plus local quasiparticle random-phase approximation (LQRPA), to include dynamical residual effects in the collective inertia. With the CHFB + LQRPA, we evaluate the collective potential and the collective inertia along a mass-symmetric fission path in Fm isotopes with the neutron numbers $N=158$--164. The obtained LQRPA inertia is much larger than the cranking one that ignores dynamical residual effects and shows a remarkable variation along the fission path. We estimate the fission half-life of the Fm isotopes using the action integral with the obtained collective potential and inertia. A large difference between the fission half-lives obtained with the LQRPA inertia and with the cranking inertia is observed. This indicates the importance of evaluating the collective inertia for estimating the fission half-life.</description>

      <title>Exploration on $1n$ halo nucleus $^{19}$C from D-RHFB structure to reaction observables</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.09766</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.09766v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We utilize the axially deformed relativistic Hartree-Fock-Bogoliubov (D-RHFB) model to describe the structure of neutron-rich carbon isotopes, taking into account the continuum, pairing correlations, tensor force and their interplay. In this scheme, one- and two-neutron separation energies of neutron-rich carbon isotopes agree well with measured data, as well as the spin and parity $J^\pi=1/2^+$ for the ground state of $^{19}$C, which is a long-standing problem for theoretical structure models. With the structure input extracted from the microscopic D-RHFB model, the reaction observables are well described the Glauber model. In particular, this unified approach accurately reproduces the inclusive longitudinal momentum distributions of the breakup reaction $^{19}$C + $^{12}$C at 240 MeV/nucleon, which rule out the possibility of the ground state of $^{19}$C being $J^\pi=3/2^+$. Moreover, the continuum plays a crucial role in the formation of the halo, which is further confirmed by the reaction cross sections and longitudinal momentum distributions. However, the tensor force components carried by the $\pi$-coupling are not as significant as anticipated. Consequently, the D-RHFB + Glauber approach turns out to be a promising tool to search for halo candidates from the structure to the reaction.</description>

      <title>Triaxial shape of the one-proton emitter $^{149}$Lu</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.09803</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.09803v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We revisit the proton emitter $^{149}$Lu utilizing the recently developed triaxial relativistic Hartree-Bogoliubov theory in continuum (TRHBc). By incorporating the microscopic nuclear structure properties from the TRHBc theory into the WKB approximation, we successfully reproduce the measured proton-emission half-life of $^{149}$Lu within experimental uncertainties. A triaxial ground state characterized by ($\beta=0.17,\gamma=31^\circ$) has been clarified for $^{149}$Lu. The inclusion of triaxiality significantly changes nuclear density distributions and potentials, which results in enhanced binding of both the nuclear system and the proton-emitting orbital. As a result, a slightly extended half-life for the proton emission of $^{149}$Lu is achieved after considering triaxial deformation degrees of freedom.</description>

      <title>The weak magnetic field effect on dilepton polarization in heavy-ion collisions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.10041</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.10041v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The measurement of the magnetic field created in high-energy heavy-ion collisions is challenging, due the the fact that the magnetic field decays so drastically that in a thermalized quark-gluon plasma the field strength becomes rather weak. By incorporating the weak magnetic effect into the medium, and especially into the production formalism of dileptons from the quark-gluon plasma, the effect of dilepton polarization is studied through the dilepton angular distribution. We find that the anisotropic coefficients in the dilepton spectrum are quite sensitive to the orientation and strength of the weak field. Accordingly, these coefficients provide ideal probes for the magnetic field in realistic experiments.</description>

      <title>A Weak Entanglement Approximation for Nuclear Structure</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.10120</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.10120v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The interacting shell model, a configuration-interaction method, is a venerable approach to low-lying nuclear structure; but it is hampered by the exponential growth of the basis dimension as one increases the single-particle space and/or the number of active particles. Recent, quantum-information-inspired work has demonstrated that the proton and neutron sectors of a nuclear wave function are weakly entangled. Furthermore the entanglement is smaller for nuclides away from N = Z, such as heavy, neutron-rich nuclides. Here we implement a weak entanglement approximation to bipartite configuration-interaction wave functions, approximating low-lying levels through coupling a relatively small number of many-proton and many-neutron states. This truncation scheme, which we put in context to other past approaches, reduces the basis dimension by many orders of magnitude while preserving essential features of nuclear spectra.</description>

      <title>Investigating the Role of Quantum Entanglement in Heavy Ion Collisions through Elliptic Flow</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.10129</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.10129v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper investigates the relationship between initial spatial anisotropy and final state momentum anisotropy in heavy ion collisions through the analysis of elliptic flow ($\nu_2$) as a function of transverse momentum ($p_T$). Building upon previous studies on thermalization in heavy ion collisions using transverse momentum distributions, we extend the analysis to the $p_T$ dependence of $\nu_2$ in Pb-Pb and Xe-Xe collisions. By employing a two-component model to extract the thermal and hard scattering contributions to the elliptic flow, we aim to gain further insights into the role of quantum entanglement in the rapid thermalization and collective behavior of the quark-gluon plasma (QGP).</description>

      <title>Study of the Coulomb and nuclear breakup of $^{11}$Be using a Halo-EFT description at N$^2$LO</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.10168</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.10168v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Background: The halo effective field theory (Halo-EFT) provides a very efficient description of loosely-bound nuclei in models of reaction. It offers a very systematical ranking of the significance of nuclear-structure observables in reaction calculations. This greatly helps to infer reliable structure information from reaction cross sections. However, for a meaningful analysis, the Halo-EFT scheme needs to have converged. Purpose: In a previous study [P. Capel, D. R. Phillips, and H.-W. Hammer, Phys. Rev. C 98, 034610 (2018)], NLO descriptions of 11Be have been developed and lead to excellent agreement with existing breakup data. However, the convergence of the scheme at NLO was not fully demonstrated. Moreover, a significant dependence on the regulator of the effective 10Be-n interaction has been observed. Method: We develop Halo-EFT descriptions of 11Be at N2LO and use them in an accurate breakup-reaction code. We compare our theoretical cross sections with experiment on Pb and C targets at about 70 MeV/nucleon. Results: On Pb, the N2LO descriptions of 11Be lead to little change to the NLO results of the previous study, confirming the convergence of that scheme. On C, the reaction is significantly affected by the presence of d resonances in the low-energy spectrum of 11Be. In the Halo-EFT power counting these resonances appear only at N2LO; our new descriptions include them naturally. Going to N2LO removes also the cutoff dependence observed in the previous study. Conclusions: We demonstrate the convergence of the Halo-EFT description of 11Be at NLO for Coulomb breakup and at N2LO for nuclear-dominated dissociation. The reliability of the nuclear-structure information inferred in the previous study is thus confirmed.</description>

      <title>Bridging Electromagnetic and Gravitational Form Factors: Insights from LFHQCD</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.09644</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.09644v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose an efficacious approach to derive the generalized parton distributions for the pion and proton, based upon prior knowledge of their respective parton distribution functions (PDFs). Our method leverages on integral representations of the electromagnetic form factors derived from the light-front holographic QCD (LFHQCD) formalism, coupled with PDFs computed from continuum Schwinger functional methods at the hadronic scale. Using these techniques, we calculate gravitational form factors and associated mass distributions for each hadron. Remarkably, our calculations yield results that closely match recent lattice QCD simulations conducted near the physical pion mass. This work not only deepens our understanding of hadronic structure but also highlights the efficacy of the LFHQCD approach in modeling fundamental properties of hadrons.</description>

      <title>Steady state, displacement current and spin polarization for massless fermion in a shear flow</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.10003</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.10003v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider spin polarization of massless fermions in a shear flow, whose complete contributions contain magnetization current and side-jump current known from collisional chiral kinetic theory. We argue that the side-jump current adopts interpretation of displacement current. We explicitly determine the displacement current contribution in the steady state reached in shear flow for a QED plasma. We find the displacement contribution enhances the magnetization contribution at small and large momenta, but leads to a suppression effect at intermediate momenta. Major differences from previous studies on collisional effect are: (i) the fermions are in the same steady state as the medium rather than being probes; (ii) Compton scattering and pair annihilation are also included in addition to the Coulomb scattering considered before. %We also propose an alternative scenario for hadron polarization in ultra-relativistic limit.</description>

      <title>Wavefunction matching for solving quantum many-body problems</title>

      <description>arXiv:2210.17488v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Ab initio calculations play an essential role in our fundamental understanding of quantum many-body systems across many subfields, from strongly correlated fermions to quantum chemistry and from atomic and molecular systems to nuclear physics. One of the primary challenges is to perform accurate calculations for systems where the interactions may be complicated and difficult for the chosen computational method to handle. Here we address the problem by introducing a new approach called wavefunction matching. Wavefunction matching transforms the interaction between particles so that the wavefunctions up to some finite range match that of an easily computable interaction. This allows for calculations of systems that would otherwise be impossible due to problems such as Monte Carlo sign cancellations. We apply the method to lattice Monte Carlo simulations of light nuclei, medium-mass nuclei, neutron matter, and nuclear matter. We use high-fidelity chiral effective field theory interactions and find good agreement with empirical data. These results are accompanied by new insights on the nuclear interactions that may help to resolve long-standing challenges in accurately reproducing nuclear binding energies, charge radii, and nuclear matter saturation in ab initio calculations.</description>

Abstract: We present comparisons to experimental data along with predictions of observables for U+U collisions at 193 GeV using a multistage theoretical and computational framework consisting of boost-invariant IP-Glasma initial state, MUSIC hydrodynamics, and a hadronic transport cascade generated by iS3D \&amp; SMASH. Our results show great agreement with existing anisotropic flow measurements from RHIC [ arXiv:1505.07812 ; arXiv:1901.08155 ] . We provide predictions for differential flow observables as well as multiparticle correlations and transverse-momentum-flow correlations. When possible, we compare our predictions to results from Au+Au collisions at 200 GeV to properly outline the effects of deformation in the initial state on final state observables.</description>

      <title>Uniform descriptions of pseudospin symmetries in bound and resonant states</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.14765</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.14765v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: As a continuation of our previous work on the conservation and breaking of the pseudospin symmetry (PSS) in resonant states [Phys. Lett. B 847, 138320 (2023)}], in this work, the PSS in nuclear single-particle bound and resonant states are investigated uniformly within a relativistic framework by exploring the poles of the Green's function in spherical Woods-Saxon potentials. As the potential depths increase from zero to finite depths, the PS partners evolve from resonant states to bound states. In this progress,the PSS is broken gradually with energy, width, and density splittings. Specially, the energy and width splittings for the resonant and bound states are directly determined by the ratio of the pseudo spin-orbit potentials between the PS partners. Obvious threshold effect is observed for the energy splitting at a critical potential depth, with which the PS partners locate between the centrifugal barriers of PS partners. The differences in the density distributions of the lower component between the PS partners are manifested in the phase shift for the resonant states and amplitudes for bound states. Besides, the evolution of the phase shift as the potential depth is consistent with those for the width splitting.</description>

      <title>Neutron stars as a dense liquid drop at equilibrium within the effective surface approximation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.01445</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.01445v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The macroscopic model for a neutron star (NS) as a perfect liquid drop at the equilibrium is formulated for derivations of the particle number density $\rho$, equation of state (EoS) for the pressure $P=P(\rho)$, and the NS mass expressions, $M=M(R)$. We use the leptodermic approximation $a/R&lt;&lt;1$, where $a$ is the crust thickness of the effective NS surface (ES), and $R$ is the mean radius of the ES curvature. Within the approximate Schwarzschild metric solution to the general relativity theory equations for the spherically symmetric systems, the macroscopic gravitation is taken into account in terms of the total separation energy and incompressibility in the simplest form as expansion of a gravitational potential $\Phi(\rho)$ in powers of $\rho-\overline{\rho} $, where $\overline{\rho}$ is the saturation density, up to second order. Density distribution $\rho$ across the ES in the normal direction to the ES was obtained analytically for a general form of the energy density $\mathcal{E}(\rho)$ in the leading order of parameter $a/R \ll 1$. For the typical crust thickness, $a \sim 1$ km, and effective radii, $R\sim 10$ km, one finds the leading expression for the density $\rho$. NS masses are analytically calculated as a sum of the volume and surface terms, $M(R)=M_{\rm V}+M_{\rm S}$, taking into account the radial curvature of the Schwarzschild metric space, in reasonable agreement with recently measured masses, $M=(1.4-2.0) M_\odot$, and radii, $R=10-14$ km, for several neutron stars. The energy tension coefficient is derived with accounting for the Schwarzschild metric correction. We derive the simple macroscopic equation of state, $P=P(\rho)$, with the surface correction. The analytical and numerical solutions to Tolman-Oppenheimer-Volkoff equations for the pressure are in good agreement with the volume part of our EoS.</description>

Abstract: In this work, we perform a model-to-data comparison for U+U and Au+Au collisions performed at RHIC at $\sqrt{s_{\rm NN}}$ = $193$ GeV and $200$ GeV, using a multistage framework. Model calculations for various configurations of $^{238}$U and $^{197}$Au are used to compare with measurements of $\rho(v_n\{2\}^2,\left\langle p_T \right\rangle)$, the elliptic-flow-momentum correlator, for the first time. It is found that momentum-flow correlations measured in high-energy nuclear collisions, combined with the flow harmonics themselves, are excellent probes of nuclear deformation and of nuclear structure in general.</description>

      <title>First constraint on the dissipative tidal deformability of neutron stars</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.11659</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.11659v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The gravitational waves (GWs) emitted by neutron star binaries probe the physics of matter at supra nuclear densities. During the late inspiral, tidal deformations raised on each star by the gravitational field of its companion depend crucially on the star's internal properties. The misalignment of a star's tidal bulge with its companion's gravitational field encodes the strength of internal dissipative processes, which imprint onto the phase of the gravitational waves emitted. We here analyze GW data from the GW170817 (binary neutron star) event detected by LIGO and Virgo and find the first constraint on the dissipative tidal deformability of a neutron star. From this constraint, \emph{assuming} a temperature profile for each star in the binary, we obtain an order of magnitude bound on the averaged bulk ($\zeta$) and shear ($\eta$) viscosity of each star during the inspiral.: $\zeta \lesssim 10^{31} \mathrm{g}\;\mathrm{cm}^{-1}\mathrm{s}^{-1}$ and $\eta \lesssim 10^{28} \mathrm{g}\;\mathrm{cm}^{-1}\mathrm{s}^{-1} $. We forecast that these bounds could be improved by two orders of magnitude with third-generation detectors, like Cosmic Explorer, using inspiral data. These constraints already inform nuclear physics models and motivate further theoretical work to better understand the interplay between viscosity and temperature in the late inspiral of neutron stars.</description>

Abstract: We perform classical-statistical real-time lattice simulations to compute real-time spectral functions and momentum broadening of quarks in the presence of strongly populated non-Abelian gauge fields. Based on a novel methodology to extract the momentum broadening for relativistic quarks, we find that the momentum distribution of quarks exhibit interesting non-perturbative features as a function of time due to correlated momentum kicks it receives from the medium, eventually going over to a diffusive regime. We extract the momentum diffusion coefficient for a mass range describing charm and bottom quarks and find sizeable discrepancies from the heavy quark limit.</description>

      <title>Introducing the concept of the Widom line in the QCD phase diagram</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.12401</link>

Abstract: Critical phenomena emerging from the critical end point of a first-order transition are ubiquitous in nature. Here we bring the concept of a supercritical crossover, the Widom line, initially developed in the context of fluids, into the interacting matter described by quantum chromodynamics (QCD). We show that the existence of the putative critical end point between hadron gas and quark-gluon plasma in the temperature versus chemical potential of the QCD phase diagram implies the existence of a Widom line emerging from it in the supercritical region. We survey the thermodynamic anomalies already identified in simplified theoretical models of QCD exhibiting a critical end point, to show that they can be interpreted in terms of a Widom line. Then we suggest possible directions where the Widom line concept could provide new light on the QCD phase diagram.</description>

      <title>Classical and Quantum Computing of Shear Viscosity for $2+1D$ SU(2) Gauge Theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.04221</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.04221v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We perform a nonperturbative calculation of the shear viscosity for $(2+1)$-dimensional SU(2) gauge theory by using the lattice Hamiltonian formulation. The retarded Green's function of the stress-energy tensor is calculated from real time evolution via exact diagonalization of the lattice Hamiltonian with a local Hilbert space truncation, and the shear viscosity is obtained via the Kubo formula. When taking the continuum limit, we account for the renormalization group flow of the coupling but no additional operator renormalization. We find the ratio of the shear viscosity and the entropy density $\frac{\eta}{s}$ is consistent with a well-known holographic result $\frac{1}{4\pi}$ at several temperatures on a $4\times4$ honeycomb lattice with the local electric representation truncated at $j_{\rm max}=\frac{1}{2}$. We also find the ratio of the spectral function and frequency $\frac{\rho^{xy}(\omega)}{\omega}$ exhibits a peak structure when the frequency is small.
  Both the exact diagonalization method and simple matrix product state classical simulation method beyond $j_{\rm max}=\frac{1}{2}$ on bigger lattices require exponentially growing resources. So we develop a quantum computing method to calculate the retarded Green's function and analyze various systematics of the calculation including $j_{\rm max}$ truncation and finite size effects, Trotter errors and the thermal state preparation efficiency. Our thermal state preparation method still requires resources that grow exponentially with the lattice size, but with a very small prefactor at high temperature. We test our quantum circuit on both the Quantinuum emulator and the IBM simulator for a small lattice and obtain results consistent with the classical computing ones.</description>

      <title>Stress out of charmonia</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.06259v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate the gravitational form factors of charmonium. Our method is based on a Hamiltonian formalism on the light front known as basis light-front quantization. The charmonium mass spectrum and light-front wave functions were obtained from diagonalizing an effective Hamiltonian that incorporates confinement from holographic QCD and one-gluon exchange interaction from light-front QCD. We proposed a quantum many-body approach to construct the hadronic matrix elements of the energy momentum tensor $T^{++}$ and $T^{+-}$, which are used to extract the gravitational form factors $A(Q^2)$ and $D(Q^2)$. The obtained form factors satisfy the known constraints, e.g. von Laue condition. From these quantities, we also extract the energy, pressure and light-front energy distributions of the system. We find that hadrons are multi-layer systems.</description>

      <title>Towards the understanding of heavy quarks hadronization: from leptonic to heavy-ion collisions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.19137</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.19137v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The formation of hadrons is a fundamental process in nature that can be investigated at particle colliders. As several recent findings demonstrate, with $\mathrm{e^+e^-}$ collisions as a "vacuum-like" reference at one extreme, and central nucleus--nucleus as a dense, extended-size system characterized by flow and local equilibrium at the opposite extreme, different collision systems offer a lever arm that can be exploited to probe with a range of heavy-flavour hadron species the onset of various hadronization processes. In this review, we present an overview of the theoretical and experimental developments. The focus is on open-heavy-flavour measurements. The comparison with model predictions and connections among the results in electron-positron, proton--proton, proton--nucleus, nucleus--nucleus collisions are discussed. After reviewing the current state, we suggest some prospects and future developments.</description>
