      <title>Metrology of microwave fields based on trap-loss spectroscopy with cold Rydberg atoms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.17445</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.17445v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We demonstrate a new approach for the metrology of microwave fields based on the trap-loss-spectroscopy of cold Rydberg atoms in a magneto-optical trap. Compared to state-of-the-art sensors using room-temperature vapors, cold atoms allow longer interaction times, better isolation from the environment and a reduced Doppler effect. Our approach is particularly simple as the detection relies on fluorescence measurements only. Moreover, our signal is well described by a two-level model across a broad measurement range, allowing in principle to reconstruct the amplitude and the frequency of the microwave field simultaneously without the need for an external reference field. We report on a scale factor linearity at the percent level and no noticeable drifts over two hours, paving the way for new applications of cold Rydberg atoms in metrology such as calibrating blackbody shifts in state-of-the-art optical clocks, monitoring the Earth cryosphere from space, measuring the cosmic microwave background or searching for dark matter.</description>

      <title>Resolving the size and charge of small particles: a predictive model of nanopore mechanics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.17115</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.17115v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The movement of small particles and molecules through membranes is widespread and has far-reaching implications. Consequently, the development of mathematical models is essential for understanding these processes on a micro level, leading to deeper insights. In this endeavour, we suggested a model based on a set of empirical equations to predict the transport of substances through a solid-state nanopore and the associated signals generated during their translocation. This model establishes analytical relationships between the ionic current and electrical double-layer potential observed during ana-lyte translocation and their size, charge, and mobility in an electrolyte solution. This framework allows for rapid interpretation and prediction of the nanopore system's behaviour and provides a means for quantitatively determining the physical properties of molecular analytes. To illustrate the analyt-ical capability of this model, ceria nanoparticles were investigated while undergoing oxidation or reduction within an original nanopore device. The re-sults obtained were found to be in good agreement with predictions from physicochemical methods. This developed approach and model possess transfer-able utility to various porous materials, thereby expediting research efforts in membrane characterization and the advancement of nano- and ultrafiltra-tion or electrodialysis technologies.</description>

      <title>New bounds on heavy axions with an X-ray free electron laser</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.17333</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.17333v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present new exclusion bounds obtained at the European X-ray Free Electron Laser facility (EuXFEL) on axion-like particles (ALPs) in the mass range $10^{-3}\;\rm{eV} \lesssim m_a \lesssim 10^{4}\;\rm{eV}$, which is relatively unconstrained by laboratory searches. Our experiment exploits the Primakoff effect via which photons can, in the presence of a strong external electric field, decay into axions, which then convert back into photons after passing through an opaque wall. While similar searches have been performed previously at a 3$^{\rm rd}$ generation synchrotron \cite{Yamaji:2018ufo} our work demonstrates improved sensitivity, exploiting the higher brightness of X-rays at EuXFEL.</description>

      <title>High-fidelity detection of large-scale atom arrays in an optical lattice</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.04717</link>
      <description>arXiv:2309.04717v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Recent advances in quantum simulation based on neutral atoms have largely benefited from high-resolution, single-atom sensitive imaging techniques. A variety of approaches have been developed to achieve such local detection of atoms in optical lattices or optical tweezers. For alkaline-earth and alkaline-earth-like atoms, the presence of narrow optical transitions opens up the possibility of performing novel types of Sisyphus cooling, where the cooling mechanism originates from the capability to spatially resolve the differential optical level shifts in the trap potential. Up to now, it has been an open question whether high-fidelity imaging could be achieved in a "repulsive Sisyphus" configuration, where the trap depth of the ground state exceeds that of the excited state involved in cooling. Here, we demonstrate high-fidelity ($99.971(1)\%$) and high-survival ($99.80(5)\%$) imaging of strontium atoms using repulsive Sisyphus cooling. We use an optical lattice as a pinning potential for atoms in a large-scale tweezer array with up to $399$ tweezers and show repeated, high-fidelity lattice-tweezer-lattice transfers. We furthermore demonstrate loading the lattice with approximately 10000 atoms directly from the MOT and scalable imaging over $&gt;10000$ lattice sites with a combined survival probability and classification fidelity better than $99.2\%$. Our lattice thus serves as a locally addressable and sortable reservoir for continuous refilling of optical tweezer arrays in the future.</description>
