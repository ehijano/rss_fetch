      <title>A New Broadcast Model for Several Network Topologies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.18058</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.18058v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present Broadcast by Balanced Saturation (BBS), a general broadcast algorithm designed to optimize communication efficiency across diverse network topologies. BBS maximizes node utilization, addressing challenges in broadcast operations such as topology constraints, bandwidth limitations, and synchronization overhead, particularly in large-scale systems like supercomputers. The algorithm ensures sustained activity with nodes throughout the broadcast, thereby enhancing data propagation and significantly reducing latency. Through a precise communication cycle, BBS provides a repeatable, streamlined, stepwise broadcasting framework. Simulation results across various topologies demonstrate that the BBS algorithm consistently outperforms common general broadcast algorithms, often by a substantial margin. These findings suggest that BBS is a versatile and robust framework with the potential to redefine broadcast strategies across network topologies.</description>

      <title>Revisiting RFID Missing Tag Identification</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.18285</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.18285v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We revisit the problem of missing tag identification in RFID networks by making three contributions. Firstly, we quantitatively compare and gauge the existing propositions spanning over a decade on missing tag identification. We show that the expected execution time of the best solution in the literature is $\Theta \left(N+\frac{(1-\alpha)^2(1-\delta)^2}{ \epsilon^2}\right)$, where $\delta$ and $\epsilon$ are parameters quantifying the required identification accuracy, $N$ denotes the number of tags in the system, among which $\alpha N$ tags are missing. Secondly, we analytically establish the expected execution time lower-bound for any missing tag identification algorithm as $\Theta\left(\frac{N}{\log N}+\frac{(1-\delta)^2(1-\alpha)^2}{\epsilon^2 \log \frac{(1-\delta)(1-\alpha)}{\epsilon}}\right)$, thus giving the theoretical performance limit. Thirdly, we develop a novel missing tag identification algorithm by leveraging a tree structure with the expected execution time of $\Theta \left(\frac{\log\log N}{\log N}N+\frac{(1-\alpha)^2(1-\delta)^2}{ \epsilon^2}\right)$, reducing the time overhead by a factor of up to $\log N$ over the best algorithm in the literature. The key technicality in our design is a novel data structure termed as collision-partition tree (CPT), built on a subset of bits in tag pseudo-IDs, leading to more balanced tree structure and reducing the time complexity in parsing the entire tree.</description>

      <title>On AI Verification in Open RAN</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.18417</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.18417v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Open RAN introduces a flexible, cloud-based architecture for the Radio Access Network (RAN), enabling Artificial Intelligence (AI)/Machine Learning (ML)-driven automation across heterogeneous, multi-vendor deployments. While EXplainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI) helps mitigate the opacity of AI models, explainability alone does not guarantee reliable network operations. In this article, we propose a lightweight verification approach based on interpretable models to validate the behavior of Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) agents for RAN slicing and scheduling in Open RAN. Specifically, we use Decision Tree (DT)-based verifiers to perform near-real-time consistency checks at runtime, which would be otherwise unfeasible with computationally expensive state-of-the-art verifiers. We analyze the landscape of XAI and AI verification, propose a scalable architectural integration, and demonstrate feasibility with a DT-based slice-verifier. We also outline future challenges to ensure trustworthy AI adoption in Open RAN.</description>

      <title>JAUNT: Joint Alignment of User Intent and Network State for QoE-centric LLM Tool Routing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.18550</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.18550v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) increasingly rely on emerging protocols such as the Model Context Protocol (MCP) to invoke external tools and services. However, current tool routing mechanisms remain fragile because they only consider functional matching between users' queries and tools. In practice, user intent expressed through queries can be vague or underspecified, and the actual Quality of Experience (QoE) also depends on external factors such as link latency and server availability that are not captured by semantics alone. To address this challenge, we propose JAUNT, a framework for Joint Alignment of User intent and Network state in QoE-centric Tool routing. JAUNT introduces a dual-view alignment strategy that interprets user intent while employing LLM agents to construct network profiles, mapping numerical performance indicators into the semantic space to guide routing. We further design a benchmark that integrates diverse user request patterns with heterogeneous network states, enabling systematic evaluation of QoE outcomes. Experimental results show that JAUNT significantly improves QoE compared with several baselines, demonstrating the importance of aligning both intent and network state for scalable LLM service orchestration.</description>

      <title>Formal Methods for Mobile Ad Hoc Networks: A Survey</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.18730</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.18730v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In a mobile ad hoc network (MANET), communication is wireless and nodes can move independently. Properly analyzing the functional correctness, performance, and security of MANET protocols is a challenging task. A wide range of formal specification and analysis techniques have been employed in the analysis of MANET protocols. This survey presents an overview of rigorous formal analysis techniques and their applications, with a focus on MANET routing protocols. Next to functional correctness, also real-time properties and security are considered. Moreover, an overview is given of formal frameworks that target MANETs specifically, as well as mobility models that underlie performance analyses of MANET protocols. The aim is to give a comprehensive and coherent overview of this rather scattered field, in which a variety of rigorous formal methods have been applied to analyze different aspects of a wide range of MANET protocols.</description>

      <title>Black-Box Evasion Attacks on Data-Driven Open RAN Apps: Tailored Design and Experimental Evaluation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.18160</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.18160v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The impending adoption of Open Radio Access Network (O-RAN) is fueling innovation in the RAN towards data-driven operation. Unlike traditional RAN where the RAN data and its usage is restricted within proprietary and monolithic RAN equipment, the O-RAN architecture opens up access to RAN data via RAN intelligent controllers (RICs), to third-party machine learning (ML) powered applications - rApps and xApps - to optimize RAN operations. Consequently, a major focus has been placed on leveraging RAN data to unlock greater efficiency gains. However, there is an increasing recognition that RAN data access to apps could become a source of vulnerability and be exploited by malicious actors. Motivated by this, we carry out a comprehensive investigation of data vulnerabilities on both xApps and rApps, respectively hosted in Near- and Non-real-time (RT) RIC components of O-RAN. We qualitatively analyse the O-RAN security mechanisms and limitations for xApps and rApps, and consider a threat model informed by this analysis. We design a viable and effective black-box evasion attack strategy targeting O-RAN RIC Apps while accounting for the stringent timing constraints and attack effectiveness. The strategy employs four key techniques: the model cloning algorithm, input-specific perturbations, universal adversarial perturbations (UAPs), and targeted UAPs. This strategy targets ML models used by both xApps and rApps within the O-RAN system, aiming to degrade network performance. We validate the effectiveness of the designed evasion attack strategy and quantify the scale of performance degradation using a real-world O-RAN testbed and emulation environments. Evaluation is conducted using the Interference Classification xApp and the Power Saving rApp as representatives for near-RT and non-RT RICs. We also show that the attack strategy is effective against prominent defense techniques for adversarial ML.</description>

      <title>Censorship Chokepoints: New Battlegrounds for Regional Surveillance, Censorship and Influence on the Internet</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.18394</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.18394v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Undoubtedly, the Internet has become one of the most important conduits to information for the general public. Nonetheless, Internet access can be and has been limited systematically or blocked completely during political events in numerous countries and regions by various censorship mechanisms. Depending on where the core filtering component is situated, censorship techniques have been classified as client-based, server-based, or network-based. However, as the Internet evolves rapidly, new and sophisticated censorship techniques have emerged, which involve techniques that cut across locations and involve new forms of hurdles to information access. We argue that modern censorship can be better understood through a new lens that we term chokepoints, which identifies bottlenecks in the content production or delivery cycle where efficient new forms of large-scale client-side surveillance and filtering mechanisms have emerged.</description>

      <title>How2Compress: Scalable and Efficient Edge Video Analytics via Adaptive Granular Video Compression</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.18409</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.18409v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: With the rapid proliferation of the Internet of Things, video analytics has become a cornerstone application in wireless multimedia sensor networks. To support such applications under bandwidth constraints, learning-based adaptive quantization for video compression have demonstrated strong potential in reducing bitrate while maintaining analytical accuracy. However, existing frameworks often fail to fully exploit the fine-grained quality control enabled by modern blockbased video codecs, leaving significant compression efficiency untapped.
  In this paper, we present How2Compress, a simple yet effective framework designed to enhance video compression efficiency through precise, fine-grained quality control at the macroblock level. How2Compress is a plug-and-play module and can be seamlessly integrated into any existing edge video analytics pipelines. We implement How2Compress on the H.264 codec and evaluate its performance across diverse real-world scenarios. Experimental results show that How2Compress achieves up to $50.4\%$ bitrate savings and outperforms baselines by up to $3.01\times$ without compromising accuracy, demonstrating its practical effectiveness and efficiency. Code is available at https://github.com/wyhallenwu/how2compress and a reproducible docker image at https://hub.docker.com/r/wuyuheng/how2compress.</description>

      <title>Forward to Hell? On the Potentials of Misusing Transparent DNS Forwarders in Reflective Amplification Attacks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.18572</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.18572v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The DNS infrastructure is infamous for facilitating reflective amplification attacks. Various countermeasures such as server shielding, access control, rate limiting, and protocol restrictions have been implemented. Still, the threat remains throughout the deployment of DNS servers. In this paper, we report on and evaluate the often unnoticed threat that derives from transparent DNS forwarders, a widely deployed, incompletely functional set of DNS components. Transparent DNS forwarders transfer DNS requests without rebuilding packets with correct source addresses. As such, transparent forwarders feed DNS requests into (mainly powerful and anycasted) open recursive resolvers, which thereby can be misused to participate unwillingly in distributed reflective amplification attacks. We show how transparent forwarders raise severe threats to the Internet infrastructure. They easily circumvent rate limiting and achieve an additional, scalable impact via the DNS anycast infrastructure. We empirically verify this scaling behavior up to a factor of 14. Transparent forwarders can also assist in bypassing firewall rules that protect recursive resolvers, making these shielded infrastructure entities part of the global DNS attack surface.</description>

      <title>sNVMe-oF: Secure and Efficient Disaggregated Storage</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.18756</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.18756v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Disaggregated storage with NVMe-over-Fabrics (NVMe-oF) has emerged as the standard solution in modern data centers, achieving superior performance, resource utilization, and power efficiency. Simultaneously, confidential computing (CC) is becoming the de facto security paradigm, enforcing stronger isolation and protection for sensitive workloads. However, securing state-of-the-art storage with traditional CC methods struggles to scale and compromises performance or security. To address these issues, we introduce sNVMe-oF, a storage management system extending the NVMe-oF protocol and adhering to the CC threat model by providing confidentiality, integrity, and freshness guarantees. sNVMe-oF offers an appropriate control path and novel concepts such as counter-leasing. sNVMe-oF also optimizes data path performance by leveraging NVMe metadata, introducing a new disaggregated Hazel Merkle Tree (HMT), and avoiding redundant IPSec protections. We achieve this without modifying the NVMe-oF protocol. To prevent excessive resource usage while delivering line rate, sNVMe-oF also uses accelerators of CC-capable smart NICs. We prototype sNVMe-oF on an NVIDIA BlueField-3 and demonstrate how it can achieve as little as 2% performance degradation for synthetic patterns and AI training.</description>

      <title>Optimal Online Probe Allocation for Classical and Quantum Network Tomography</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.21549</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.21549v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: How to efficiently perform network tomography is a fundamental problem in network management and monitoring. A network tomography task usually consists of applying multiple probing experiments, e.g., across different paths or via different casts (e.g., unicast and multicast). We study how to optimize the network tomography process through online sequential decision-making. From the methodology perspective, we introduce an online probe allocation algorithm that sequentially performs network tomography based on the principles of optimal experimental design and the maximum likelihood estimation. We rigorously analyze the regret of the algorithm under the conditions that i) the optimal allocation is Lipschitz continuous in the parameters being estimated and ii) the parameter estimators satisfy a concentration property. From the application perspective, we present two case studies: a) the classical lossy packet-switched network and b) the quantum bit-flip network. We show that both cases fulfill the two theoretical conditions and provide their corresponding regrets when deploying our proposed online probe allocation algorithm. Besides case studies with theoretical guarantees, we also conduct simulations to compare our proposed algorithm with existing methods and demonstrate our algorithm's effectiveness in a broader range of scenarios. In an experiment on the Roofnet topology, our algorithm improves the estimation accuracy by 13.64% compared with the state-of-the-art baseline.</description>

      <title>Pinching Antenna-Aided Wireless Powered Communication Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.00355</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.00355v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this letter, we investigate a novel pinching antenna (PA)-aided wireless powered communication network (WPCN), in which multiple PAs are activated along a waveguide to establish robust line-of-sight links with multiple devices. Both time division multiple access (TDMA) and non-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA) protocols are considered in the PA-WPCN. Moreover, some practical considerations, including a proportional power model for the PAs, a waveguide transmission loss model, and a nonlinear energy harvesting model, are incorporated into the PA-WPCN. Furthermore, we formulate a sum-rate maximization problem by jointly optimizing resource allocation and PAs position. To address the challenging problem of the PAs position optimization, we propose a high-performance element-wise (EW) algorithm and a low-complexity stochastic parameter differential evolution (SPDE) algorithm. Numerical results validate the remarkable performance of the proposed PA-WPCN and the effectiveness of our algorithms, indicating that optimal performance is attained when the PA power distribution ratio of approximately 0.55-0.6.</description>

      <title>ASINT: Learning AS-to-Organization Mapping from Internet Metadata</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.02571</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.02571v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Accurate AS-to-organization mapping underpins Internet measurement and security, yet registries are fragmented, PeeringDB is narrow, and routing views reflect connectivity rather than ownership. We take a pragmatic step: ASINT integrates curated web evidence with retrieval-guided LLM techniques and strict, evidence-cited validation to infer two relations (aliases and directed parent-child) and then revalidates them conservatively. To keep the dataset sustainable, we operate a public dashboard and API where operators can inspect per-ASN evidence and submit feedback that seeds refreshes.
  At scale, ASINT maps 112,172 ASNs into 82,840 organization families and, on overlapping AS sets, yields fewer, larger families with 21-24% more multi-AS groups than prior datasets (i.e., CAIDA AS2Org [11], AS2ORG+ [4], AS-Sibling [10], and Borges [28]). Quality is high in practice: ASINT achieves a precision of 0.9608, a recall of 0.9915 and an accuracy of 0.9752 under manual validation. Public deployment further drew operator-submitted reports for 595 ASNs across 106 organizations, with only 6 errors (99.0% observed clustering accuracy), with feedback coming from network operators across all RIR regions.
  Better organization context improves downstream analyses: +27.5% intra-organization RPKI misconfiguration detections, -9.4% benign hijack alerts, and -5.9% corrections to cases mislabeled as IP leasing.
  We release code, datasets, and the operator platform with APIs; given persistent ambiguity in organizational names and the continual evolution of corporate structures, an operator-in-the-loop process is essential; the platform records per ASN feedback with provenance and incorporates it into periodic refreshes and retraining. The methodology is model-agnostic and stands to improve further as base LLMs advance.</description>

      <title>Adaptive Semantic Communication for UAV/UGV Cooperative Path Planning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.06901</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.06901v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Effective path planning is fundamental to the coordination of unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) and unmanned ground vehicles (UGVs) systems, particularly in applications such as surveillance, navigation, and emergency response. Combining UAVs' broad field of view with UGVs' ground-level operational capability greatly improve the likelihood of successfully achieving task objectives such as locating victims, monitoring target areas, or navigating hazardous terrain. In complex environments, UAVs need to provide precise environmental perception information for UGVs to optimize their routing policy. However, due to severe interference and non-line-of-sight conditions, wireless communication is often unstable in such complex environments, making it difficult to support timely and accurate path planning for UAV-UGV coordination. To this end, this paper proposes a semantic communication (SemCom) framework to enhance UAV/UGV cooperative path planning under unreliable wireless conditions. Unlike traditional methods that transmit raw data, SemCom transmits only the key information for path planning, reducing transmission volume without sacrificing accuracy. The proposed framework is developed by defining key semantics for path planning and designing a transceiver for meeting the requirements of UAV-UGV cooperative path planning. Simulation results show that, compared to conventional SemCom transceivers, the proposed transceiver significantly reduces data transmission volume while maintaining path planning accuracy, thereby enhancing system collaboration efficiency.</description>

      <title>Dynamic Control Aware Semantic Communication Enabled Image Transmission for Lunar Landing</title>

Abstract: The primary challenge in autonomous lunar landing missions lies in the unreliable local control system, which has limited capacity to handle high-dynamic conditions, severely affecting landing precision and safety. Recent advancements in lunar satellite communication make it possible to establish a wireless link between lunar orbit satellites and the lunar lander. This enables satellites to run high-performance autonomous landing algorithms, improving landing accuracy while reducing the lander's computational and storage load. Nevertheless, traditional communication paradigms are not directly applicable due to significant temperature fluctuations on the lunar surface, intense solar radiation, and severe interference caused by lunar dust on hardware. The emerging technique of semantic communication (SemCom) offers significant advantages in robustness and resource efficiency, particularly under harsh channel conditions. In this paper, we introduce a novel SemCom framework for transmitting images from the lander to satellites operating the remote landing control system. The proposed encoder-decoder dynamically adjusts the transmission strategy based on real-time feedback from the lander's control algorithm, ensuring the accurate delivery of critical image features and enhancing control reliability. We provide a rigorous theoretical analysis of the conditions that improve the accuracy of the control algorithm and reduce end-to-end transmission time under the proposed framework. Simulation results demonstrate that our SemCom method significantly enhances autonomous landing performance compared to traditional communication methods.</description>

      <title>Byzantine-Eavesdropper Alliance: How to Achieve Symmetric Privacy in Quantum $X$-Secure $B$-Byzantine $E$-Eavesdropped $U$-Unresponsive $T$-Colluding PIR?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.06728</link>

Abstract: We consider the quantum \emph{symmetric} private information retrieval (QSPIR) problem in a system with $N$ databases and $K$ messages, with $U$ unresponsive servers, $T$-colluding servers, and $X$-security parameter, under several fundamental threat models. In the first model, there are $\mathcal{E}_1$ eavesdropped links in the uplink direction (the direction from the user to the $N$ servers), $\mathcal{E}_2$ eavesdropped links in the downlink direction (the direction from the servers to the user), where $|\mathcal{E}_1|, |\mathcal{E}_2| \leq E$; we coin this eavesdropper setting as \emph{dynamic} eavesdroppers. We show that super-dense coding gain can be achieved for some regimes. In the second model, we consider the case with Byzantine servers, i.e., servers that can coordinate to devise a plan to harm the privacy and security of the system together with static eavesdroppers, by listening to the same links in both uplink and downlink directions. It is important to note the considerable difference between the two threat models, since the eavesdroppers can take huge advantage of the presence of the Byzantine servers. Unlike the previous works in SPIR with Byzantine servers, that assume that the Byzantine servers can send only random symbols independent of the stored messages, we follow the definition of Byzantine servers in \cite{byzantine_tpir}, where the Byzantine servers can send symbols that can be functions of the storage, queries, as well as the random symbols in a way that can produce worse harm to the system. In the third and the most novel threat model, we consider the presence of Byzantine servers and dynamic eavesdroppers together. We show that having dynamic eavesdroppers along with Byzantine servers in the same system model creates more threats to the system than having static eavesdroppers with Byzantine servers.</description>

      <title>FedMeld: A Model-dispersal Federated Learning Framework for Space-ground Integrated Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.17231</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.17231v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: To bridge the digital divide, the space-ground integrated networks (SGINs), which will be a key component of the six-generation (6G) mobile networks, are expected to deliver artificial intelligence (AI) services to every corner of the world. One mission of SGINs is to support federated learning (FL) at a global scale. However, existing space-ground integrated FL frameworks involve ground stations or costly inter-satellite links, entailing excessive training latency and communication costs. To overcome these limitations, we propose an infrastructure-free federated learning framework based on a model dispersal (FedMeld) strategy, which exploits periodic movement patterns and store-carry-forward capabilities of satellites to enable parameter mixing across large-scale geographical regions. We theoretically show that FedMeld leads to global model convergence and quantify the effects of round interval and mixing ratio between adjacent areas on its learning performance. Based on the theoretical results, we formulate a joint optimization problem to design the staleness control and mixing ratio (SC-MR) for minimizing the training loss. By decomposing the problem into sequential SC and MR subproblems without compromising the optimality, we derive the round interval solution in a closed form and the mixing ratio in a semi-closed form to achieve the optimal latency-accuracy tradeoff. Experiments using various datasets demonstrate that FedMeld achieves superior model accuracy while significantly reducing communication costs as compared with traditional FL schemes for SGINs.</description>
