      <title>Kagome Hubbard model away from the strong coupling limit: Flat band localization and non Fermi liquid signatures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.05787</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.05787v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Taking cue from the recent experimental realization of metallic phases in Kagome materials we report the low temperature signatures and thermal scales of Kagome metals and insulators, determined in the framework of the Kagome Hubbard model, using a non perturbative numerical approach. In contrast to the existing consensus we establish a flat band localized insulator in the weak coupling regime which crosses over to a non Fermi liquid (NFL) metal at intermediate coupling, followed by a first order metal-Mott insulator transition in the strong coupling regime. We provide the first accurate estimates of the thermal scales of this model and analyze the NFL phases in terms of resilient quasiparticles and short range magnetic correlations. With our unprecedented access to the low temperature phases and sufficiently large system sizes, we provide the essential benchmarks for the prospective experiments on the Kagome metal and insulators in terms of their thermodynamic, spectroscopic and transport signatures.</description>

      <title>Quantum Spin Liquids in Weak Mott Insulators with a Spin-Orbit Coupling</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.05806v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The weak Mott insulating regime of the triangular lattice Hubbard model exhibits a rich magnetic phase diagram as a result of the ring exchange interaction in the spin Hamiltonian. These phases include the Kalmeyer-Laughlin type chiral spin liquid (CSL) and a valence bond solid (VBS). A natural question arises regarding the robustness of these phases in the presence of a weak spin-orbit coupling (SOC). In this study, we derive the effective spin model for the spin-orbit coupled triangular lattice Hubbard model in the weak Mott insulting regime, including all SOC-mediated spin-bilinears and ring-exchange interactions. We then construct a simplified spin model keeping only the most relevant SOC-mediated spin interactions. Using infinite density matrix renormalization group (iDMRG) we show that the CSL and VBS phases of the triangular lattice Hubbard model can be stabilized in the presence of a weak SOC. The stabilization results from a compensation between the Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interaction and a SOC-mediated ring exchange interaction. We also provide additional qualitative arguments to intuitively understand the compensation mechanism in the iDMRG quantum phase diagrams. This mechanism for stabilization can potentially be useful for the experimental realization of quantum spin liquids.</description>

      <title>Spin high-harmonic generation through terahertz laser-driven phonons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.05830</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.05830v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the realm of open quantum systems, steady states and high-harmonic generation (HHG) existing far from equilibrium have become core pillars of ultrafast science. Most solid-state research explores charge HHG with limited investigations into spin degrees of freedom. In this study, we theoretically address spin HHG in the steady state resulting from the terahertz laser-driven spin-phonon coupling in a dissipative dimerized spin-1/2 chain. Instead of directly driving spins using time-dependent magnetic fields, we employ the magnetophononic mechanism, where the laser first drives the lattice, and then the excited lattice subsequently drives the spins. We investigate the role of various model parameters for optimizing HHG. Increasing the laser's amplitude amplifies spin HHG beyond the perturbative regime, enhancing both harmonic amplitudes and orders. We find that configuring the drive frequency far below the spin band yields the highest harmonic order. Additionally, we provide a theory matching the numerical results under weak spin-phonon coupling and propose an experimental procedure to probe the emission spectrum of spin HHG.</description>

      <title>Witnessing Quantum Entanglement Using Resonant Inelastic X-ray Scattering</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.05850</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.05850v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Although entanglement is both a central ingredient in our understanding of quantum many-body systems and an essential resource for quantum technologies, we only have a limited ability to quantify entanglement in real quantum materials. Thus far, entanglement metrology in quantum materials has been limited to measurements involving Hermitian operators, such as the detection of spin entanglement using inelastic neutron scattering. Here, we devise a method to extract the quantum Fisher information (QFI) from non-Hermitian operators and formulate an entanglement witness for resonant inelastic x-ray scattering (RIXS). Our approach is then applied to the model iridate dimer system Ba$_3$CeIr$_2$O$_9$ and used to directly test for entanglement of the electronic orbitals between neighboring Ir sites. We find that entanglement is challenging to detect under standard conditions, but that it could be achieved by analyzing the outgoing x-ray polarization or via specific choices of momentum and energy. Our protocol provides a new handle for entanglement detection, which offers routes to related types of entanglement witness (such as orbitally-resolved measurements) and to the generalization to out-of-equilibrium settings accessed in ultrafast settings.</description>

      <title>Inverse melting and intertwined orders in PrCuSb$_2$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.06032</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.06032v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Much of the rich physics of correlated systems is manifested in the diverse range of intertwined ordered phases and other quantum states that are associated with different electronic and structural degrees of freedom. Here we find that PrCuSb$_2$ exhibits such phenomena, which at ambient pressure exhibits a fragile antiferromagnetic order, where cooling in a small $c$ axis magnetic field leads to an additional transition to a field-induced ferromagnetic state. This corresponds to an 'inverse melting' effect, whereby further cooling the system restores symmetries of the paramagnetic state broken at the antiferromagnetic transition. Moreover, hydrostatic pressure induces an additional first-order transition at low temperatures, which despite being not likely associated with solely magnetic degrees of freedom, is closely entwined with the magnetic order, disappearing once antiferromagnetism is destroyed by pressure or magnetic fields. Consequently, PrCuSb$_2$ presents a distinct scenario for interplay between different orders, underscoring the breadth of such behaviors within one family of correlated materials.</description>

      <title>Quantifying the U $5f$ covalence and degree of localization in U intermetallics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.06266</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.06266v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A procedure for quantifying the U $5f$ electrons' covalence and degree of localization in U intermetallic compounds is presented. To this end, bulk sensitive hard and soft x-ray photoelectron spectroscopy were utilized in combination with density-functional theory (DFT) plus dynamical mean-field theory (DMFT) calculations. The energy dependence of the photoionization cross-sections allows the disentanglement of the U\,$5f$ contribution to the valence band from the various other atomic subshells so that the computational parameters in the DFT\,+\,DMFT can be reliably determined. Applying this method to UGa$_2$ and UB$_2$ as model compounds from opposite ends of the (de)localization range, we have achieved excellent simulations of the valence band and core-level spectra. The width in the distribution of atomic U\,$5f$ configurations contributing to the ground state, as obtained from the calculations, quantifies the correlated nature and degree of localization of the U\,5$f$. The findings permit answering the longstanding question why different spectroscopic techniques give seemingly different numbers for the U 5$f$ valence in intermetallic U compounds.</description>

      <title>Defect Fusion and Casimir Energy in Higher Dimensions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.05815</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.05815v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the operator algebra of extended conformal defects in more than two spacetime dimensions. Such algebra structure encodes the combined effect of multiple impurities on physical observables at long distances as well as the interactions among the impurities. These features are formalized by a fusion product which we define for a pair of defects, after isolating divergences that capture the effective potential between the defects, which generalizes the usual Casimir energy. We discuss general properties of the corresponding fusion algebra and contrast with the more familiar cases that involve topological defects. We also describe the relation to a different defect setup in the shape of a wedge. We provide explicit examples to illustrate these properties using line defects and interfaces in the Wilson-Fisher CFT and the Gross-Neveu(-Yukawa) CFT and determine the defect fusion data thereof.</description>

      <title>Quasispins of vacancy defects and their interactions in disordered antiferromagnets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.05845</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.05845v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Vacancy defects in disordered magnetic materials are known to act as effective spins, ``quasispins'', in response to an external magnetic field. In the dilute limit, the contributions of such ``quasispins'' to the magnetic susceptibility $\chi_\text{vac}(T)\propto N_\text{vac}/T$ are singular in the limit of low temperatures $T$ and match those of free spins. With increasing the density of vacancies, their interactions may become essential. Motivated by frustrated and quasi-one-dimensional magnetic materials, we study analytically quasispins and their interactions in a generic system that has short-range antiferromagnetic order and lacks long-range order. We predict that if the vacancy defect does not disrupt the short-range antiferromagnetic order around it, the quasispin value matches the value of spins of the magnetic atoms in the material, and the correlators of the quasispins of different vacancies match the spin-spin correlators in the vacancy-free material. We confirm our conclusions by exact calculations for Ising chains with nearest-neighbour and next-to-nearest-neighbour interactions. We also compute the first virial correction to the susceptibility of a magnetic material due to the interactions of vacancy quasispins.</description>

      <title>Strict area law implies commuting parent Hamiltonian</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.05867</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.05867v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We show that in two spatial dimensions, when a quantum state has entanglement entropy obeying a strict area law, meaning $S(A)=\alpha |\partial A| - \gamma$ for constants $\alpha, \gamma$ independent of lattice region $A$, then it admits a commuting parent Hamiltonian. More generally, we prove that the entanglement bootstrap axioms in 2D imply the existence of a commuting, local parent Hamiltonian with a stable spectral gap. We also extend our proof to states that describe gapped domain walls. Physically, these results imply that the states studied in the entanglement bootstrap program correspond to ground states of some local Hamiltonian, describing a stable phase of matter. Our result also suggests that systems with chiral gapless edge modes cannot obey a strict area law provided they have finite local Hilbert space.</description>

      <title>Thermoelectric transport and current noise through a multilevel Anderson impurity: Three-body Fermi-liquid corrections in quantum dots and magnetic alloys</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.05947</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.05947v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a comprehensive Fermi-liquid description for thermoelectric transport and current noise, applicable to multilevel quantum dots (QD) and magnetic alloys (MA) without electron-hole or time-reversal symmetry. Our formulation for the low-energy transport is based on an Anderson model with $N$ discrete impurity levels, and is asymptotically exact at low energies, up to the next-leading order terms in power expansions with respect to temperature $T$ and bias voltage $eV$. The expansion coefficients can be expressed in terms of the Fermi-liquid parameters, which include the three-body correlation functions defined with respect to the equilibrium ground state in addition to the linear susceptibilities and the occupation number $N_d^{}$ of impurity electrons. We apply this formulation to SU($N$) symmetric QD and MA, and calculate the correlation functions for $N=4$ and $6$, using the numerical renormalization group approach. The three-body correlations are shown to be determined by a single parameter over a wide range of electron fillings $1 \lesssim N_d^{} \lesssim N-1$ for strong Coulomb interactions $U$, and they also exhibit the plateau structures due to the SU($N$) Kondo effects at integer values of $N_d^{}$. We find that the Lorenz number $L=\kappa/(T \sigma)$ for QD and MA, defined as the ratio of the thermal conductivity $\kappa$ to the electrical conductivity $\sigma$, deviates from the universal Wiedemann-Franz value $\pi^2/(3e^2)$ as the temperature increases from $T=0$, showing the $T^2$ dependence, the coefficient for which depends on the three-body correlations away from half filling. We also demonstrate the role of three-body correlations on the nonlinear current noise and the other transport coefficients.</description>

      <title>Quantum computing topological invariants of two-dimensional quantum matter</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.06048v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Quantum algorithms provide a potential strategy for solving computational problems that are intractable by classical means. Computing the topological invariants of topological matter is one central problem in research on quantum materials, and a variety of numerical approaches for this purpose have been developed. However, the complexity of quantum many-body Hamiltonians makes calculations of topological invariants challenging for interacting systems. Here, we present two quantum circuits for calculating Chern numbers of two-dimensional quantum matter on quantum computers. Both circuits combine a gate-based adiabatic time-evolution over the discretized Brillouin zone with particular phase estimation techniques. The first algorithm uses many qubits, and we analyze it using a tensor-network simulator of quantum circuits. The second circuit uses fewer circuits, and we implement it experimentally on a quantum computer based on superconducting qubits. Our results establish a method for computing topological invariants with quantum circuits, taking a step towards characterizing interacting topological quantum matter using quantum computers.</description>

      <title>Complete Active Space Iterative Coupled Cluster Theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.06070</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.06070v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this work, we investigate the possibility of improving multireference-driven coupled cluster (CC) approaches with an algorithm that iteratively combines complete active space (CAS) calculations with tailored CC and externally corrected CC. This is accomplished by establishing a feedback loop between the CC and CAS parts of a calculation through similarity transformation of the Hamiltonian with those CC amplitudes that are not encompassed by the active space. We denote this approach the complete active space iterative coupled cluster (CASiCC) ansatz. We investigate its efficiency and accuracy in the singles and doubles approximation by studying the prototypical molecules H4, H8, H2O, and N2. Our results demonstrate that CASiCC systematically improves on the single-reference CCSD and the ecCCSD methods across entire potential energy curves, while retaining modest computational costs. However, the tailored coupled cluster method shows superior performance in the strong correlation regime suggesting that its accuracy is based on error compensation. We find that the iterative version of externally corrected and tailored coupled cluster methods converge to the same results.</description>

      <title>Copper doping effects on the superconducting properties of Sm-based oxypnictides</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.06146</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.06146v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A systematic investigation has been performed by synthesis and comprehensive characterization of a series of SmFe1-xCuxAsO0.8F0.2 bulks (x = 0 to 0.2). These samples are well characterized by structural, Raman spectroscopy, microstructural, transport, magnetic measurements, and supplementary calculations within density functional theory (DFT). The parent compound, SmFeAsO0.8F0.2 (Sm1111), exhibits a superconducting transition temperature (Tc) of approximately 54 K. The lattice volume (V) is increased with Cu substitution (x) without observing any impurity phase related to copper, which confirms the successful incorporation of Cu at Fe sites in the superconducting FeAs layers. These analyses are also well in agreement with Raman spectroscopy measurements and relevant DFT results. The superconducting transition is decreased systematically with copper doping and completely suppressed for 7% Cu-doped Sm1111 (x = 0.07). A large amount of Cu substitution (x greater than 0.07) has demonstrated the metal to insulate transition in the low-temperature range, and no impurity phase was observed even at high Cu doping levels (x = 0.2). The calculated critical current density of the parent sample is suppressed with copper substitution, suggesting the reduced pinning centers, sample density, and grain connections, as confirmed by the microstructural analysis. Our studies suggest that the substitution of Cu in the superconducting FeAs layer, resulting the enlargement of the lattice volume, is a source of strong disorder scattering, leading to the suppression of Tc and the emergence of metal-to-insulator, unlike the more successful carrier doping by nickel (Ni) or cobalt (Co), as previously reported.</description>

      <title>Facilities and practices for linear response Hubbard parameters U and J in Abinit</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.06284v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Members of the DFT+U family of functionals are increasingly prevalent methods of addressing errors intrinsic to (semi-) local exchange-correlation functionals at minimum computational cost, but require their parameters U and J to be calculated in situ for a given system of interest, simulation scheme, and runtime parameters. The SCF linear response approach offers ab initio acquisition of the U and has recently been extended to compute the J analogously, which measures localized errors related to exchange-like effects. We introduce a renovated post-processor, the lrUJ utility, together with this detailed best-practices guide, to enable users of the popular, open-source Abinit first-principles simulation suite to engage easily with in situ Hubbard parameters and streamline their incorporation into material simulations of interest. Features of this utility, which may also interest users and developers of other DFT codes, include $n$-degree polynomial regression, error analysis, Python plotting facilities, didactic documentation, and avenues for further developments. In this technical introduction and guide, we place particular emphasis on the intricacies and potential pitfalls introduced by the projector augmented wave (PAW) method, SCF mixing schemes, and non-linear response, several of which are translatable to DFT+U(+J) implementations in other packages.</description>

Abstract: We study the entanglement structure of topological orders subject to decoherence on the bipartition boundary. Focusing on the toric codes in $d$ space dimensions for $d=2,3,4$, we explore whether the boundary decoherence may be able to induce a disentangling transition, characterized by the destruction of mixed-state long-range entanglement across the bipartition, measured by topological entanglement negativity. A key insight of our approach is the connection between the negativity spectrum of the decohered mixed states and emergent symmetry-protected topological orders under certain symmetry-preserving perturbation localized on the bipartition boundary. This insight allows us to analytically derive the exact results of entanglement negativity without using a replica trick.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2210.17485v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Average symmetry-protected topological (ASPT) phase is a generalization of symmetry-protected topological phases to disordered systems or open quantum systems. We devise a "strange correlator" in one and two dimensions to detect nontrivial ASPT states. We demonstrate that for a nontrivial ASPT phase this strange correlator exhibits long-range or power-law behavior. We explore the connection between the strange correlators and correlation functions in two-dimensional loop models with quantum corrections, leading to the exact scaling exponents of the strange correlators.</description>

      <title>Demonstrating the wormhole mechanism of the entanglement spectrum via a perturbed boundary</title>

Abstract: The Li-Haldane conjecture is one of the most famous conjectures in physics and opens a new research area in the quantum entanglement and topological phase. Although a lot of theoretical and numerical works have confirmed the conjecture in topological states with bulk-boundary correspondence, the cases with gapped boundary and the systems in high dimension are widely unknown. What is the valid scope of the Li-Haldane conjecture? Via the newly developed quantum Monte Carlo scheme, we are now able to extract the large-scale entanglement spectrum (ES) and study its relation with the edge energy spectrum generally. Taking the two-dimensional Affleck-Kennedy-Lieb-Tasaki model with a tunable boundary on the square-octagon lattice as an example, we find several counterexamples which cannot be explained by the Li-Haldane conjecture; e.g., the low-lying entanglement spectrum does not always show similar behaviors as the energy spectrum on the virtual boundary, and sometimes the ES resembles the energy spectrum of the edge even if it is gapped. Finally, we demonstrate that the newly proposed wormhole mechanism on the path integral of a reduced density matrix is the formation principle of the general ES. We find that the Li-Haldane conjecture is a particular case in some limit of the wormhole picture while all the examples of the conjecture we have studied can totally be explained within the wormhole mechanism framework. Our results provide important evidence for demonstrating that the wormhole mechanism is the fundamental principle to explain the ES.</description>

Abstract: Van Hove singularities (VHss) in the vicinity of the Fermi energy often play a dramatic role in the physics of strongly correlated electron materials. The divergence of the density of states generated by VHss can trigger the emergence of new phases such as superconductivity, ferromagnetism, metamagnetism, and density wave orders. A detailed understanding of the electronic structure of these VHss is therefore essential for an accurate description of such instabilities. Here, we study the low-energy electronic structure of the trilayer strontium ruthenate Sr$_4$Ru$_3$O$_{10}$, identifying a rich hierarchy of VHss using angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy and millikelvin scanning tunneling microscopy. Comparison of $k$-resolved electron spectroscopy and quasiparticle interference allows us to determine the structure of the VHss and demonstrate the crucial role of spin-orbit coupling in shaping them. We use this to develop a minimal model from which we identify a new mechanism for driving a field-induced Lifshitz transition in ferromagnetic metals.</description>

Abstract: We explore numerically the intricate interplay between Berry phases in both real and momentum spaces within itinerant magnets. This interplay manifests as an emergent spin-orbit coupling, where charge carriers occupying a Berry-curved band generate an orbital magnetization, inducing a pseudo-magnetic field originating in chiral spin textures. Using density-matrix-renormalization-group techniques, we demonstrate that switching on a band Berry curvature in a metallic ferromagnetic phase results in chiral magnetic textures. Furthermore, employing a two-leg strip geometry, we establish a connection between charge and spin chirality, further supporting this emergent spin-orbit interaction.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2201.07806v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Fault-tolerant quantum computation demands significant resources: large numbers of physical qubits must be checked for errors repeatedly to protect quantum data as logic gates are implemented in the presence of noise. We demonstrate that an approach based on the color code can lead to considerable reductions in the resource overheads compared with conventional methods, while remaining compatible with a two-dimensional layout. We propose a lattice surgery scheme that exploits the rich structure of the color-code phase to perform arbitrary pairs of commuting logical Pauli measurements in parallel while keeping the space cost low. Compared to lattice surgery schemes based on the surface code with the same code distance, our approach yields about a $3\times$ improvement in the space-time overhead, obtained from a combination of a $1.5\times$ improvement in spatial overhead together with a $2\times$ speedup due to the parallelisation of commuting logical measurements. Even when taking into account the color code's lower error threshold using current decoders, the overhead is reduced by 10\% at a physical error rate of $10^{-3}$ and by 50\% at $10^{-4}$.</description>

Abstract: We investigate operator growth in quantum systems with two-dimensional Schr\"odinger group symmetry by studying the Krylov complexity. While feasible for semisimple Lie algebras, cases such as the Schr\"odinger algebra which is characterized by a semi-direct sum structure are complicated. We propose to compute Krylov complexity for this algebra in a natural orthonormal basis, which produces a pentadiagonal structure of the time evolution operator, contrasting the usual tridiagonal Lanczos algorithm outcome. The resulting complexity behaves as expected. We advocate that this approach can provide insights to other non-semisimple algebras.</description>

Abstract: We generalize the idea of symmetry topological field theory (SymTFT) for subsystem symmetry. We propose the 2-foliated BF theory with level $N$ in $(3+1)$d as subsystem SymTFT for subsystem $\mathbb Z_N$ symmetry in $(2+1)$d. Focusing on $N=2$, we investigate various topological boundaries. The subsystem Kramers-Wannier and Jordan-Wigner dualities can be viewed as boundary transformations of the subsystem SymTFT and are included in a larger duality web from the subsystem $SL(2,\mathbb Z_2)$ symmetry of the bulk foliated BF theory. Finally, we construct the condensation defects and twist defects of $S$-transformation in the subsystem $SL(2,\mathbb Z_2)$, from which the fusion rule of subsystem non-invertible operators can be recovered.</description>

      <title>Bound states and local topological phase diagram of classical impurity spins coupled to a Chern insulator</title>

      <description>arXiv:2310.14097v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The existence of bound states induced by local impurities coupled to an insulating host depends decisively on the global topological properties of the host's electronic structure. In this context, we consider magnetic impurities modelled as classical unit-length spins that are exchange-coupled to the spinful Haldane model on the honeycomb lattice. We investigate the spectral flow of bound states with the coupling strength $J$ in both the topologically trivial and Chern-insulating phases. In addition to conventional $k$-space topology, an additional, spatially local topological feature is available, based on the space of impurity-spin configurations forming, in case of $R$ impurities, an $R$-fold direct product of two-dimensional spheres. Global $k$-space and local $S$-space topology are represented by different topological invariants, the first ($k$-space) Chern number and the $R$-th ($S$-space) spin-Chern number. We demonstrate that there is a local $S$-space topological transition as a function of $J$ associated with a change in the spin Chern number and work out the implications of this for the $J$-dependent local electronic structure close to the impurities and, in particular, for in-gap bound states. The critical exchange couplings' dependence on the parameters of the Haldane model, and thus on the $k$-space topological state, is obtained numerically to construct local topological phase diagrams for systems with $R=1$ and $R=2$ impurity spins.</description>

      <title>Fracton models from product codes</title>

      <description>arXiv:2312.08462v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We explore a deep connection between fracton order and product codes. In particular, we propose and analyze conditions on classical seed codes which lead to fracton order in the resulting quantum product codes. Depending on the properties of the input codes, product codes can realize either Type-I or Type-II fracton models, in both nonlocal and local constructions. For the nonlocal case, we show that a recently proposed model of lineons on an irregular graph can be obtained as a hypergraph product code. Interestingly, constrained mobility in this model arises only from glassiness associated with the graph. For the local case, we introduce a novel type of classical LDPC code defined on a planar aperiodic tiling. By considering the specific example of the pinwheel tiling, we demonstrate the systematic construction of local Type-I and Type-II fracton models as product codes. Our work establishes product codes as a natural setting for exploring fracton order.</description>

      <title>Dichotomous Dynamics of Magnetic Monopole Fluids</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.00726v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A recent advance in the study of emergent magnetic monopoles was the discovery that monopole motion is restricted to dynamical fractal trajectories (J. Hall\'en et al, Science 378, 1218 (2022)) thus explaining the characteristics of magnetic monopole noise spectra (Dusad, R. et al. Nature 571, 234 (2019); Samarakoon, A. M. et al. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. 119, e2117453119 (2022)). Here we apply this new theory to explore the dynamics of field-driven monopole currents, finding them comprised of two quite distinct transport processes: initially swift fractal rearrangements of local monopole configurations followed by conventional monopole diffusion. This theory also predicts a characteristic frequency dependence of the dissipative loss-angle for AC-field-driven currents. To explore these novel perspectives on monopole transport, we introduce simultaneous monopole current control and measurement techniques using SQUID-based monopole current sensors. For the canonical material Dy2Ti2O7, we measure ${\Phi}(t)$, the time-dependence of magnetic flux threading the sample when a net monopole current $J(t) = \dot{\Phi}(t)/\mu_0$ is generated by applying an external magnetic field $B_0(t)$. These experiments find a sharp dichotomy of monopole currents, separated by their distinct relaxation time-constants before and after $t \approx 600 {\mu}s$ from monopole current initiation. Application of sinusoidal magnetic fields $B_0(t) = Bcos({\omega}t)$ generates oscillating monopole currents whose loss angle ${\theta}(f)$ exhibits a characteristic transition at frequency $f \approx 1.8$ kHz over the same temperature range. Finally, the magnetic noise power is also dichotomic, diminishing sharply after $t \approx 600 {\mu}s$. This complex phenomenology represents a new form of heterogeneous dynamics generated by the interplay of fractionalization and local spin configurational symmetry.</description>

      <title>Symmetry Protected Topological Phases of Mixed States in the Doubled Space</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.13280v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The interplay of symmetry and topology in quantum many-body mixed states has recently garnered significant interest. In a phenomenon not seen in pure states, mixed states can exhibit average symmetries -- symmetries that act on component states while leaving the ensemble invariant. In this work, we systematically characterize symmetry protected topological (SPT) phases of short-range entangled (SRE) mixed states of spin systems -- protected by both average and exact symmetries -- by studying their pure Choi states in a doubled Hilbert space, where the familiar notions and tools for SRE and SPT pure states apply. This advantage of the doubled space comes with a price: extra symmetries as well as subtleties around how hermiticity and positivity of the original density matrix constrain the possible SPT invariants. Nevertheless, the doubled space perspective allows us to obtain a systematic classification of mixed-state SPT (MSPT) phases. We also investigate the robustness of MSPT invariants under symmetric finite-depth quantum channels, the bulk-boundary correspondence for MSPT phases, and the consequences of the MSPT invariants for the separability of mixed states and the symmetry-protected sign problem. In addition to MSPT phases, we study the patterns of spontaneous symmetry breaking (SSB) of mixed states, including the phenomenon of exact-to-average SSB, and the order parameters that detect them. Mixed state SSB is related to an ingappability constraint on symmetric Lindbladian dynamics.</description>

      <title>From Local Spin Nematicity to Altermagnets: Footprints of Band Topology</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.14620v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Altermagnets are crystallographic rotational symmetry breaking spin-ordered states, possessing a net zero magnetization despite manifesting Kramers non-degenerate bands. Here, we show that momentum-independent local spin nematic orders in monolayer, Bernal bilayer and rhombohedral trilayer graphene give rise to $p$-wave, $d$-wave and $f$-wave altermagnets, respectively, thereby inheriting topology of linear, quadratic and cubic free fermion band dispersions that are also described in terms of angular momentum $\ell=1,\; 2$ and $3$ harmonics in the reciprocal space. The same conclusions also hold inside a spin-triplet nematic superconductor, featuring Majorana altermagnets. Altogether, these findings highlight the importance of electronic band structure in identifying such exotic magnetic orders in quantum materials. We depict the effects of in-plane magnetic fields on altermagnets, and propose novel spin-disordered alter-valleymagnets in these systems.</description>

      <title>Magic Boundaries of 3D Color Codes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.05033</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.05033v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate boundaries of 3D color codes and provide a systematic classification into 101 distinct boundary types. The elementary types of boundaries are codimension-1 (2D) boundaries that condense electric particle ($Z$-type) or magnetic flux ($X$-type) excitations in the 3D color code, including the $Z$-boundary condensing only electric particles, the $X$-boundary condensing only the magnetic flux, and other boundaries condensing both electric and magnetic excitations. Two novel types of boundaries can be generated based on certain elementary types. The first type is generated by applying transversal-$T$ gate on the entire code in the presence of the $X$-boundary, which effectively sweeps the codimension-1 (2D) $T$-domain wall across the system and attaches it to the $X$-boundary. Since the $T$-domain wall cannot condense on the $X$-boundary, a new magic boundary is produced, where the boundary stabilizers contain $XS$-stabilizers going beyond the conventional Pauli stabilizer formalism and hence contains `magic'. Neither electric nor magnetic excitations can condense on such a magic boundary, and only the composite of the magnetic flux and codimension-2 (1D) $S$-domain wall can condense on it, which makes the magic boundary going beyond the classification of the Lagrangian subgroup. The second type is generated by applying transversal-$S$ gate on a codimension-1 (2D) submanifold in the presence of certain codimension-1 (2D) boundaries, which effectively sweeps the $S$-domain wall across this submanifold and attaches it onto the boundary. This generates a codimension-2 (1D) nested boundary at the intersection. We also connect these novel boundaries to their previously discovered counterpart in the $\mathbb{Z}_2^3$ gauge theory equivalent to three copies of 3D toric codes, where the $S$ and $T$ domain walls correspond to gauged symmetry-protected topological (SPT) defects.</description>
