      <title>Cell-Free Full-Duplex Communication -- An Overview</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.04711</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.04711v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Cell-free (CF) architecture and full-duplex (FD) communication are leading candidates for next-generation wireless networks. The CF framework removes cell boundaries in traditional cell-based systems, thereby mitigating inter-cell interference and improving coverage probability. In contrast, FD communication allows simultaneous transmission and reception on the same frequency-time resources, effectively doubling the spectral efficiency (SE). The integration of these technologies, known as CF FD communication, leverages the advantages of both approaches to enhance the spectral and energy efficiency in wireless networks. CF FD communication is particularly promising due to the low-power and cost-effective FD-enabled access points (APs), which are ideal for short-range transmissions between APs and users. Despite its potential, a comprehensive survey or tutorial on CF FD communication has been notably absent. This paper aims to address this gap in the literature. It begins with an overview of FD communication fundamentals, self-interference cancellation techniques, and CF technology principles, including their implications for current wireless networks. The discussion then moves to the integration and compatibility of CF and FD technologies, focusing on channel estimation, performance analysis, and resource allocation in CF FD massive multiple-input multiple-output (mMIMO) networks, supported by an extensive literature review and case studies.</description>

      <title>Sensing-Aided 6G Drone Communications: Real-World Datasets and Demonstration</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.04734</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.04734v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the advent of next-generation wireless communication, millimeter-wave (mmWave) and terahertz (THz) technologies are pivotal for their high data rate capabilities. However, their reliance on large antenna arrays and narrow directive beams for ensuring adequate receive signal power introduces significant beam training overheads. This becomes particularly challenging in supporting highly-mobile applications such as drone communication, where the dynamic nature of drones demands frequent beam alignment to maintain connectivity. Addressing this critical bottleneck, our paper introduces a novel machine learning-based framework that leverages multi-modal sensory data, including visual and positional information, to expedite and refine mmWave/THz beam prediction. Unlike conventional approaches that solely depend on exhaustive beam training methods, our solution incorporates additional layers of contextual data to accurately predict beam directions, significantly mitigating the training overhead. Additionally, our framework is capable of predicting future beam alignments ahead of time. This feature enhances the system's responsiveness and reliability by addressing the challenges posed by the drones' mobility and the computational delays encountered in real-time processing. This capability for advanced beam tracking asserts a critical advancement in maintaining seamless connectivity for highly-mobile drones. We validate our approach through comprehensive evaluations on a unique, real-world mmWave drone communication dataset, which integrates concurrent camera visuals, practical GPS coordinates, and mmWave beam training data...</description>

      <title>Deep Learning-Enabled ISAC-OTFS Pre-equalization Design for Aerial-Terrestrial Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.04751</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.04751v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Orthogonal time frequency space (OTFS) modulation has been viewed as a promising technique for integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) systems and aerial-terrestrial networks, due to its delay-Doppler domain transmission property and strong Doppler-resistance capability. However, it also suffers from high processing complexity at the receiver. In this work, we propose a novel pre-equalization based ISAC-OTFS transmission framework, where the terrestrial base station (BS) executes pre-equalization based on its estimated channel state information (CSI). In particular, the mean square error of OTFS symbol demodulation and Cramer-Rao lower bound of sensing parameter estimation are derived, and their weighted sum is utilized as the metric for optimizing the pre-equalization matrix. To address the formulated problem while taking the time-varying CSI into consideration, a deep learning enabled channel prediction-based pre-equalization framework is proposed, where a parameter-level channel prediction module is utilized to decouple OTFS channel parameters, and a low-dimensional prediction network is leveraged to correct outdated CSI. A CSI processing module is then used to initialize the input of the pre-equalization module. Finally, a residual-structured deep neural network is cascaded to execute pre-equalization. Simulation results show that under the proposed framework, the demodulation complexity at the receiver as well as the pilot overhead for channel estimation, are significantly reduced, while the symbol detection performance approaches those of conventional minimum mean square error equalization and perfect CSI.</description>

      <title>Space-Time-Modulated Wideband Radiation-Type Programmable Metasurface for Low Sidelobe Beamforming</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.04822</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.04822v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Programmable metasurfaces promise a great potential to construct low-cost phased array systems due to the capability of elaborate modulation over electromagnetic (EM) waves. However, they are in either reflective or transmissive mode, and usually possess a relatively high profile as a result of the external feed source. Besides, it is difficult to conduct multibit phase shift in metasurfaces, when comparing with conventional phased arrays. Here, we propose a strategy of space-time modulated wideband radiation-type programmable metasurface for low side-lobe beamforming. The wideband programmable metasurface avoids the space-feed external source required by its traditional counterpart, thus achieving a significant reduction of profile through integration of a highefficiency microwave-fed excitation network and metasurface. Furthermore, through introducing space-time-modulated strategy, the high-accuracy amplitude-phase weight algorithm can also be synchronously carried out on the first harmonic component for low side-lobe beam-scanning. Most importantly, adaptive beamforming and generation of interference null can further be created after analyzing the harmonic component characteristics of received signals.</description>

      <title>Asynchronous Random Access in Massive MIMO Systems Facilitated by the Delay-Angle Domain</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.04841</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.04841v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The problem of uplink transmissions in massive connectivity is commonly dealt with using schemes for grant-free random access. When a large number of devices transmit almost synchronously, the receiver may not be able to resolve the collision. This could be addressed by assigning dedicated pilots to each user, leading to a contention-free random access (CFRA), which suffers from low scalability and efficiency. This paper explores contention-based random access (CBRA) schemes for asynchronous access in massive multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) systems. The symmetry across the accessing users with the same pilots is broken by leveraging the delay information inherent to asynchronous systems and the angle information from massive MIMO to enhance activity detection (AD) and channel estimation (CE). The problem is formulated as a sparse recovery in the delay-angle domain. The challenge is that the recovery signal exhibits both row-sparse and cluster-sparse structure, with unknown cluster sizes and locations. We address this by a cluster-extended sparse Bayesian learning (CE-SBL) algorithm that introduces a new weighted prior to capture the signal structure and extends the expectation maximization (EM) algorithm for hyperparameter estimation. Simulation results demonstrate the superiority of the proposed method in joint AD and CE.</description>

      <title>Integrating Semantic Communication and Human Decision-Making into an End-to-End Sensing-Decision Framework</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.05103</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.05103v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: As early as 1949, Weaver defined communication in a very broad sense to include all procedures by which one mind or technical system can influence another, thus establishing the idea of semantic communication. With the recent success of machine learning in expert assistance systems where sensed information is wirelessly provided to a human to assist task execution, the need to design effective and efficient communications has become increasingly apparent. In particular, semantic communication aims to convey the meaning behind the sensed information relevant for Human Decision-Making (HDM). Regarding the interplay between semantic communication and HDM, many questions remain, such as how to model the entire end-to-end sensing-decision-making process, how to design semantic communication for the HDM and which information should be provided to the HDM. To address these questions, we propose to integrate semantic communication and HDM into one probabilistic end-to-end sensing-decision framework that bridges communications and psychology. In our interdisciplinary framework, we model the human through a HDM process, allowing us to explore how feature extraction from semantic communication can best support human decision-making. In this sense, our study provides new insights for the design/interaction of semantic communication with models of HDM. Our initial analysis shows how semantic communication can balance the level of detail with human cognitive capabilities while demanding less bandwidth, power, and latency.</description>

      <title>Compound Gaussian Radar Clutter Model With Positive Tempered Alpha-Stable Texture</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.05174</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.05174v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The compound Gaussian (CG) family of distributions has achieved great success in modeling sea clutter. This work develops a flexible-tailed CG model to improve generality in clutter modeling, by introducing the positive tempered $\alpha$-stable (PT$\alpha$S) distribution to model clutter texture. The PT$\alpha$S distribution exhibits widely tunable tails by tempering the heavy tails of the positive $\alpha$-stable (P$\alpha$S) distribution, thus providing greater flexibility in texture modeling. Specifically, we first develop a bivariate isotropic CG-PT$\alpha$S complex clutter model that is defined by an explicit characteristic function, based on which the corresponding amplitude model is derived. Then, we prove that the amplitude model can be expressed as a scale mixture of Rayleighs, just as the successful compound K and Pareto models. Furthermore, a characteristic function-based method is developed to estimate the parameters of the amplitude model. Finally, real-world sea clutter data analysis indicates the amplitude model's flexibility in modeling clutter data with various tail behaviors.</description>

      <title>On Models with Power Conservation in Reflective Intelligent Surfaces and their Design Implications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.05201</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.05201v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Reconfigurable intelligent surfaces (RISs) are potential enablers of future wireless communications and sensing applications and use-cases. The RIS is envisioned as a dynamically controllable surface that is capable of transforming impinging electromagnetic waves in terms of angles and polarization. Many models has been proposed to predict the wave-transformation capabilities of potential RISs, where power conservation is ensured by enforcing that the scattered power equals the power impinging upon the aperture of the RIS, without considering whether the scattered field adds coherently of destructively with the source field. In effect, this means that power is not conserved, as elaborated in this paper. With the goal of investigating the implications of global and local power conservation in RISs, work considers a single-layer metasurface based RIS. A complete end-to-end communications channel is given through polarizability modeling and conditions for power conservation and channel reciprocity are derived. The implications of the power conservation conditions upon the end-to-end communications channel is analyzed.</description>

      <title>Communication Compression for Distributed Learning without Control Variates</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.04538</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.04538v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Distributed learning algorithms, such as the ones employed in Federated Learning (FL), require communication compression to reduce the cost of client uploads. The compression methods used in practice are often biased, which require error feedback to achieve convergence when the compression is aggressive. In turn, error feedback requires client-specific control variates, which directly contradicts privacy-preserving principles and requires stateful clients. In this paper, we propose Compressed Aggregate Feedback (CAFe), a novel distributed learning framework that allows highly compressible client updates by exploiting past aggregated updates, and does not require control variates. We consider Distributed Gradient Descent (DGD) as a representative algorithm and provide a theoretical proof of CAFe's superiority to Distributed Compressed Gradient Descent (DCGD) with biased compression in the non-smooth regime with bounded gradient dissimilarity. Experimental results confirm that CAFe consistently outperforms distributed learning with direct compression and highlight the compressibility of the client updates with CAFe.</description>

      <title>Passive Six-Dimensional Movable Antenna (6DMA)-Assisted Multiuser Communication</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.04720</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.04720v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Six-dimensional movable antenna (6DMA) is a promising solution for enhancing wireless network capacity through the adjustment of both three-dimensional (3D) positions and 3D rotations of distributed antenna surfaces. Previous works mainly consider 6DMA surfaces composed of active antenna elements, thus termed as active 6DMA. In this letter, we propose a new passive 6DMA system consisting of distributed passive intelligent reflecting surfaces (IRSs) that can be adjusted in terms of 3D position and 3D rotation. Specifically, we study a passive 6DMA-aided multiuser uplink system and aim to maximize the users' achievable sum rate by jointly optimizing the 3D positions, 3D rotations, and reflection coefficients of all passive 6DMA surfaces, as well as the receive beamforming matrix at the base station (BS). To solve this challenging non-convex optimization problem, we propose an alternating optimization (AO) algorithm that decomposes it into three subproblems and solves them alternately in an iterative manner. Numerical results are presented to investigate the performance of the proposed passive 6DMA system under different configurations and demonstrate its superior performance over the traditional fixed-IRS counterpart for both directive and isotropic radiation patterns of passive reflecting elements.</description>

      <title>KNN-MMD: Cross Domain Wi-Fi Sensing Based on Local Distribution Alignment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.04783</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.04783v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: As a key technology in Integrated Sensing and Communications (ISAC), Wi-Fi sensing has gained widespread application in various settings such as homes, offices, and public spaces. By analyzing the patterns of Channel State Information (CSI), we can obtain information about people's actions for tasks like person identification, gesture recognition, and fall detection. However, the CSI is heavily influenced by the environment, such that even minor environmental changes can significantly alter the CSI patterns. This will cause the performance deterioration and even failure when applying the Wi-Fi sensing model trained in one environment to another. To address this problem, we introduce a K-Nearest Neighbors Maximum Mean Discrepancy (KNN-MMD) model, a few-shot method for cross-domain Wi-Fi sensing. We propose a local distribution alignment method within each category, which outperforms traditional Domain Adaptation (DA) methods based on global alignment. Besides, our method can determine when to stop training, which cannot be realized by most DA methods. As a result, our method is more stable and can be better used in practice. The effectiveness of our method are evaluated in several cross-domain Wi-Fi sensing tasks, including gesture recognition, person identification, fall detection, and action recognition, using both a public dataset and a self-collected dataset. In one-shot scenario, our method achieves accuracy of 93.26%, 81.84%, 77.62%, and 75.30% in the four tasks respectively. To facilitate future research, we will make our code and dataset publicly available upon publication.</description>

      <title>MSECG: Incorporating Mamba for Robust and Efficient ECG Super-Resolution</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.04861</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.04861v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Electrocardiogram (ECG) signals play a crucial role in diagnosing cardiovascular diseases. To reduce power consumption in wearable or portable devices used for long-term ECG monitoring, super-resolution (SR) techniques have been developed, enabling these devices to collect and transmit signals at a lower sampling rate. In this study, we propose MSECG, a compact neural network model designed for ECG SR. MSECG combines the strength of the recurrent Mamba model with convolutional layers to capture both local and global dependencies in ECG waveforms, allowing for the effective reconstruction of high-resolution signals. We also assess the model's performance in real-world noisy conditions by utilizing ECG data from the PTB-XL database and noise data from the MIT-BIH Noise Stress Test Database. Experimental results show that MSECG outperforms two contemporary ECG SR models under both clean and noisy conditions while using fewer parameters, offering a more powerful and robust solution for long-term ECG monitoring applications.</description>

      <title>Near-field Communications with Extremely Large-Scale Uniform Arc Arrays: Channel Modelling and Performance Analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.04866</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.04866v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this letter, we propose a new conformal array architecture, called extremely large-scale uniform arc array (XL-UAA), to improve near-field communication performance. Specifically,under the non-uniform spherical wavefront channel model, we establish mathematical modeling and performance analysis for XL-UAAs. It is shown that XL-UAAs have larger direction-dependent Rayleigh distance and uniform power distance than the conventional XL uniform linear arrays (XL-ULAs). Moreover, a closed-form expression for the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) is obtained, which depends on collective properties of XL-UAAs, such as the distance between the user and the array center,as well as the arc radius. In addition, we show that the asymptotic SNR of XL-UAAs with the number of antennas depends on the projection distance of the user to the middle of the arc array. Finally, numerical results verify that XL-UAAs achieve a higher SNR than XL-ULAs, especially at larger user incident angles.</description>

      <title>Fluid Antenna Grouping-Based Index Modulation: Transceiver Design for MIMO Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.04877</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.04877v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The fluid antenna (FA)-enabled multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) system based on index modulation (IM), referred to as FA-IM, significantly enhances spectral efficiency (SE) compared to the conventional FA-assisted MIMO system. This paper proposes an innovative FA grouping-based IM (FAG-IM) system to improve performance in mitigating the high spatial correlation between multiple activated ports. A block grouping scheme is employed based on the spatial correlation model and the distribution structure of the ports. Then, a closed-form expression for the average bit error probability (ABEP) upper bound of the FAG-IM system is derived. In order to reduce the receiver complexity of the proposed system, the message passing mechanism is first incorporated into the FAG-IM system. Subsequently, within the approximate message passing (AMP) framework, an efficient structured AMP (S-AMP) detector is devised by leveraging the structural characteristics of the transmission signal vector. Simulation results confirm that the proposed FAG-IM system significantly outperforms the existing FA-IM system in the presence of spatial correlation. The derived ABEP curve aligns well with the numerical results, providing an efficient theoretical tool for evaluating the system performance. Additionally, simulation results demonstrate that the proposed low-complexity S-AMP detector not only reduces the time complexity to a linear scale but also substantially improves bit error rate (BER) performance compared to the minimum mean square error (MMSE) detector, thus facilitating the practical implementation of the FAG-IM system.</description>

      <title>Continuous Speech Tokens Makes LLMs Robust Multi-Modality Learners</title>

Abstract: Recent advances in GPT-4o like multi-modality models have demonstrated remarkable progress for direct speech-to-speech conversation, with real-time speech interaction experience and strong speech understanding ability. However, current research focuses on discrete speech tokens to align with discrete text tokens for language modelling, which depends on an audio codec with residual connections or independent group tokens, such a codec usually leverages large scale and diverse datasets training to ensure that the discrete speech codes have good representation for varied domain, noise, style data reconstruction as well as a well-designed codec quantizer and encoder-decoder architecture for discrete token language modelling. This paper introduces Flow-Omni, a continuous speech token based GPT-4o like model, capable of real-time speech interaction and low streaming latency. Specifically, first, instead of cross-entropy loss only, we combine flow matching loss with a pretrained autoregressive LLM and a small MLP network to predict the probability distribution of the continuous-valued speech tokens from speech prompt. second, we incorporated the continuous speech tokens to Flow-Omni multi-modality training, thereby achieving robust speech-to-speech performance with discrete text tokens and continuous speech tokens together. Experiments demonstrate that, compared to discrete text and speech multi-modality training and its variants, the continuous speech tokens mitigate robustness issues by avoiding the inherent flaws of discrete speech code's representation loss for LLM.</description>

      <title>Analog-Only Beamforming for Near-Field Multiuser MIMO Communications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.05006</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.05006v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: For the existing near-field multiuser communications based on hybrid beamforming (HBF) architectures, high-quality effective channel estimation is required to obtain the channel state information (CSI) for the design of the digital beamformer. To simplify the system reconfiguration and eliminate the pilot overhead required by the effective channel estimation, we considered an analog-only beamforming (AoBF) architecture in this study. The AoBF is designed with the aim of maximizing the sum rate, which is then transformed into a problem, maximizing the power transmitted to the target user equipment (UE) and meanwhile minimizing the power leaked to the other UEs. To solve this problem, we used beam focusing and beam nulling and proposed two AoBF schemes based on the majorization-minimization (MM) algorithm. First, the AoBF scheme based on perfect CSI is proposed, with the focus on the beamforming performance and regardless of the CSI acquisition. Then, the AoBF scheme based on imperfect CSI is proposed, where the low-dimensional imperfect CSI is obtained by beam sweeping based on a near-field codebook. Simulation results demonstrate that the two AoBF schemes can approach the sum rate of the HBF schemes but outperform HBF schemes in terms of energy efficiency (EE).</description>

      <title>Spatial Bandwidth of Bilateral Near-Field Channels for Linear Large-Scale Antenna Array System</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.05058</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.05058v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper analyzes the spatial bandwidth of line-of-sight (LoS) channels in massive MIMO systems. For the linear large-scale antenna arrays (LSAA) of transceivers placed in random locations in 3D space, a simple but accurate closed-form expression is derived to characterize the spatial bandwidth. Subsequent analysis of the LSAA's spatial bandwidth properties is also provided, leading to the formulation of an approximate expression for the effective degrees of freedom (EDoF) of bilateral near-field channels. Interestingly, as proved in this work, when the transmit and receive arrays are coplanar, with the receive array positioned perpendicular to the axis joining the centroids of the transmit and receive arrays, the EDoF of the LoS channel is found to be approximately maximized.</description>

      <title>LoFi: Vision-Aided Label Generator for Wi-Fi Localization and Tracking</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.05074</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.05074v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Wi-Fi localization and tracking has shown immense potential due to its privacy-friendliness, wide coverage, permeability, independence from lighting conditions, and low cost. Current methods can be broadly categorized as model-based and data-driven approaches, where data-driven methods show better performance and have less requirement for specialized devices, but struggle with limited datasets for training. Due to limitations in current data collection methods, most datasets only provide coarse-grained ground truth (GT) or limited amount of label points, which greatly hinders the development of data-driven methods. Even though lidar can provide accurate GT, their high cost makes them inaccessible to many users. To address these challenges, we propose LoFi, a vision-aided label generator for Wi-Fi localization and tracking, which can generate ground truth position coordinates solely based on 2D images. The easy and quick data collection method also helps data-driven based methods deploy in practice, since Wi-Fi is a low-generalization modality and when using relevant methods, it always requires fine-tuning the model using newly collected data. Based on our method, we also collect a Wi-Fi tracking and localization dataset using ESP32-S3 and a webcam. To facilitate future research, we will make our code and dataset publicly available upon publication.</description>

      <title>An Information Theoretic Analysis of Ghost Modulation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.05249</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.05249v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Side channels have become an essential component of many modern information-theoretic schemes. The emerging field of cross technology communications (CTC) provides practical methods for creating intentional side channels between existing communications technologies. This paper describes a theoretical foundation for one such, recently proposed, CTC scheme: Ghost Modulation (GM). Designed to modulate a low-data-rate message atop an existing network stream, GM is particularly suited for transmitting identification or covert information. The implementation only requires firmware updates to existing hardware, making it a cost-effective solution. However, GM provides an interesting technical challenge due to a highly asymmetric binary crossover erasure channel (BCEC) that results from packet drops and network delays. In this work, we provide a mathematical description of the signal and channel models for GM. A heuristic decision rule based on maximum-likelihood principles for simplified channel models is proposed. We describe an algorithm for GM packet acquisition and timing synchronization, supported by simulation results. Several well known short block codes are applied, and bit error rate (BER) results are presented.</description>

      <title>Interpretable ECG Analysis for Myocardial Infarction Detection through Counterfactuals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.08304</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.08304v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In the evolving landscape of ECG signal analysis, the challenge of limited transparency in machine learning models remains a significant barrier to their effective integration into clinical practice. This study addresses this issue by investigating the use of counterfactual explanations to improve model interpretability for clinicians, particularly in differentiating healthy subjects from myocardial infarction patients. Utilizing the PTB-XL dataset, we developed a methodology for systematic feature extraction and refinement to prepare for counterfactual analysis. This led to the creation of the Visualizing Counterfactual Clues on Electrocardiograms (VCCE) method, designed to improve the practicality of counterfactual explanations in a clinical setting. The validity of our approach was assessed using custom metrics that reflect the diagnostic relevance of counterfactuals, evaluated with the help of two cardiologists. Our findings suggest that this approach could support future efforts in using ECGs to predict patient outcomes for cardiac conditions, achieving interpretation validity scores of 23.29 $\pm$ 1.04 and 20.28 $\pm$ 0.99 out of 25 for high and moderate-quality interpretations, respectively. Clinical alignment scores of 0.83 $\pm$ 0.12 for high-quality and 0.57 $\pm$ 0.10 for moderate-quality interpretations underscore the potential clinical applicability of our method. The methodology and findings of this study contribute to the ongoing discussion on enhancing the interpretability of machine learning models in cardiology, offering a concept that bridges the gap between advanced data analysis techniques and clinical decision-making.

      <description>arXiv:2408.12252v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Light detection and ranging (LiDAR) has been utilized for optimizing wireless communications due to its ability to detect the environment. This paper explores the use of LiDAR in channel estimation for wideband multi-user multiple-input-multiple-output orthogonal frequency division multiplexing systems and introduces a LiDAR-enhanced Channel State Information (CSI) learning network (LE-CLN). By utilizing user positioning information, LE-CLN first calculates user-localized over-complete angular measurements. It then investigates the correlation between LiDAR and CSI, transforming raw LiDAR data into a low-complexity format embedded with signal propagation characteristics. LE-CLN also adapts the use of LiDAR based on channel conditions through attention mechanisms. Thanks to the unique wireless features offered by LiDAR, LE-CLN achieves higher estimation accuracy and spectrum efficiency compared to benchmarks, particularly in latency-sensitive applications where pilot transmissions are expected to be reduced.</description>

      <title>TFT-multi: simultaneous forecasting of vital sign trajectories in the ICU</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.15586</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.15586v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Trajectory forecasting in healthcare data has been an important area of research in precision care and clinical integration for computational methods. In recent years, generative AI models have demonstrated promising results in capturing short and long range dependencies in time series data. While these models have also been applied in healthcare, most of them only predict one value at a time, which is unrealistic in a clinical setting where multiple measures are taken at once. In this work, we extend the framework temporal fusion transformer (TFT), a multi-horizon time series prediction tool, and propose TFT-multi, an end-to-end framework that can predict multiple vital trajectories simultaneously. We apply TFT-multi to forecast 5 vital signs recorded in the intensive care unit: blood pressure, pulse, SpO2, temperature and respiratory rate. We hypothesize that by jointly predicting these measures, which are often correlated with one another, we can make more accurate predictions, especially in variables with large missingness. We validate our model on the public MIMIC dataset and an independent institutional dataset, and demonstrate that this approach outperforms state-of-the-art univariate prediction tools including the original TFT and Prophet, as well as vector regression modeling for multivariate prediction. Furthermore, we perform a study case analysis by applying our pipeline to forecast blood pressure changes in response to actual and hypothetical pressor administration.</description>

      <title>Distributed Channel Estimation and Optimization for 6D Movable Antenna: Unveiling Directional Sparsity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.16510</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.16510v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Six-dimensional movable antenna (6DMA) is an innovative technology to improve wireless network capacity by adjusting 3D positions and 3D rotations of antenna surfaces based on channel spatial distribution. However, the existing works on 6DMA have assumed a central processing unit (CPU) to jointly process the signals of all 6DMA surfaces to execute various tasks. This inevitably incurs prohibitively high processing cost for channel estimation. Therefore, we propose a distributed 6DMA processing architecture to reduce processing complexity of CPU by equipping each 6DMA surface with a local processing unit (LPU). In particular, we unveil for the first time a new \textbf{\textit{directional sparsity}} property of 6DMA channels, where each user has significant channel gains only for a (small) subset of 6DMA position-rotation pairs, which can receive direct/reflected signals from users. In addition, we propose a practical three-stage protocol for the 6DMA-equipped base station (BS) to conduct statistical CSI acquisition for all 6DMA candidate positions/rotations, 6DMA position/rotation optimization, and instantaneous channel estimation for user data transmission with optimized 6DMA positions/rotations. Specifically, the directional sparsity is leveraged to develop distributed algorithms for joint sparsity detection and channel power estimation, as well as for directional sparsity-aided instantaneous channel estimation. Using the estimated channel power, we develop a channel power-based optimization algorithm to maximize the ergodic sum rate of the users by optimizing the antenna positions/rotations. Simulation results show that our channel estimation algorithms are more accurate than benchmarks with lower pilot overhead, and our optimization outperforms fluid/movable antennas optimized only in two dimensions (2D), even when the latter have perfect instantaneous CSI.</description>

      <title>The Patchkeeper: An Integrated Wearable Electronic Stethoscope with Multiple Sensors</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.11837v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Many parts of human body generate internal sound during biological processes, which are rich sources of information for understanding health and wellbeing. Despite a long history of development and usage of stethoscopes, there is still a lack of proper tools for recording internal body sound together with complementary sensors for long term monitoring. In this paper, we show our development of a wearable electronic stethoscope, coined Patchkeeper (PK), that can be used for internal body sound recording over long periods of time. Patchkeeper also integrates several state-of-the-art biological sensors, including electrocardiogram (ECG), photoplethysmography (PPG), and inertial measurement unit (IMU) sensors. As a wearable device, Patchkeeper can be placed on various parts of the body to collect sound from particular organs, including heart, lung, stomach, and joints etc. We show in this paper that several vital signals can be recorded simultaneously with high quality. As Patchkeeper can be operated directly by the user, e.g. without involving health care professionals, we believe it could be a useful tool for telemedicine and remote diagnostics.</description>

      <title>Cross-modal semantic segmentation for indoor environmental perception using single-chip millimeter-wave radar raw data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.00499</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.00499v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In the context of firefighting and rescue operations, a cross-modal semantic segmentation model based on a single-chip millimeter-wave (mmWave) radar for indoor environmental perception is proposed and discussed. To efficiently obtain high-quality labels, an automatic label generation method utilizing LiDAR point clouds and occupancy grid maps is introduced. The proposed segmentation model is based on U-Net. A spatial attention module is incorporated, which enhanced the performance of the mode. The results demonstrate that cross-modal semantic segmentation provides a more intuitive and accurate representation of indoor environments. Unlike traditional methods, the model's segmentation performance is minimally affected by azimuth. Although performance declines with increasing distance, this can be mitigated by a well-designed model. Additionally, it was found that using raw ADC data as input is ineffective; compared to RA tensors, RD tensors are more suitable for the proposed model.</description>
