      <title>Precision Physics with Muons : A Decade of Theoretical and Experimental Advances</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.12442</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.12442v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The muon has been instrumental in establishing the Standard Model of particle physics and continues to play a key role in exploring the nature of New Physics. A global program is underway to enhance the discovery potential of a wide range of muon probes, with significant increases in sensitivity anticipated over the next decade. In this review, we examine recent experimental advancements in the study of muon decays, the determination of the muon magnetic and electric dipole moments, and the search for charged lepton flavor violating transitions. We explore the implications for scenarios of physics beyond the Standard Model, focusing on models involving light new particles, such as axions or hidden sectors. Opportunities from novel experimental concepts and proposal for new muon facilities are also discussed.</description>

      <title>NNLL$^\prime$ resummation of azimuthal decorrelation for boosted top quark pair production at the LHC</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.12572</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.12572v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The precision program of the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) increasingly relies on the boosted regime, where top quark properties are probed at the TeV scale. However, the simultaneous presence of heavy quark mass effects and large logarithmic corrections from soft radiation poses a significant challenge for theoretical predictions. In this work, we develop a transverse momentum dependent (TMD) factorization and resummation framework for boosted top quark pair production in the back-to-back limit at the LHC. By employing a two step matching procedure, matching QCD through $\mathrm{SCET}\,+\,\mathrm{HQET}$ onto $\mathrm{SCET}\,+\,\mathrm{bHQET}$, we systematically resum large logarithms associated with both the top quark mass and the azimuthal decorrelation. A key component of our formalism is the first extraction of the two-loop ultra-collinear function, obtained via the refactorization of the fully differential massive soft function. This result completes the set of perturbative ingredients required to achieve $\mathrm{NNLL}^\prime$ accuracy for the azimuthal decorrelation distribution. Our framework establishes a new benchmark for heavy-quark TMD resummation in the boosted limit at hadron colliders.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2602.12853v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Cherenkov imaging detectors will continue to play a central role for particle identification in future particle and nuclear physics experiments. Growing demands on momentum coverage, timing precision, radiation tolerance, and sustainability have driven extensive R&amp;D in detector concepts, radiator materials, and photon sensors. This article reviews recent efforts, focusing on experiments leading advances in sensor technology, radiator materials, and the exploitation of Cherenkov photon timing to push PID limits, while highlighting synergies across experiments in addressing common challenges.</description>

      <title>Simulation Study for Particle Identification with the dRICH of the ePIC Experiment at the EIC</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.12931</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.12931v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The dual-radiator Imaging Cherenkov detector (dRICH) is a key component of the forward particle identification system for the ePIC experiment at the Electron-Ion Collider (EIC). This study evaluates the dRICH performance using Geant4 simulations in the context of the global ePIC simulation stack, focusing on the optimization of the aerogel radiator and the impact of sensor noise. We compare two aerogel configurations: the initial design (n=1.019) and the current default (n=1.026). The latter, characterized by improved optical properties and a higher refractive index, demonstrates enhanced $\pi-K$ separation at high momenta, effectively extending the operational overlap with the $\mathrm{C_2F_6}$ gas radiator. Additionally, the study investigates the impact of Silicon Photomultiplier (SiPM) dark noise, showing that a 300 kHz noise rate per channel leads to a moderate reduction (approximately 1.5 GeV/c) in the $3\sigma$ separation threshold. These results validate the current dRICH design and quantify the purity levels achievable for both radiators under expected experimental conditions.</description>

      <title>Beta delayed neutron emission of $N=84$ $^{132}$Cd</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.04333</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.04333v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Using the time-of-flight technique, we measured the beta-delayed neutron emission of $^{132}$Cd. From our large-scale shell model (LSSM) calculation using the N$^3$LO interaction [Z.Y. Xu et al., Phys. Rev. Lett. 131, 022501 (2023)], we suggest the decay is dominated by the transformation of a neutron in the $g_{7/2}$ orbital, deep below the Fermi surface, into a proton in the $g_{9/2}$ orbital. We compare the beta-decay half-lives and neutron branching ratios of nuclei with $Z&lt;50$ and $N\geq82$ obtained with our LSSM with those of leading "global" models such as Finite-Range Droplet Model (FRDM). Our calculations match known half-lives and neutron branching ratios well and suggest that current leading models overestimate the yet-to-be-measured half-lives. Our model, backed by the $^{132}$Cd decay data presented here, offers robust predictive power for nuclei of astrophysical interest such as $r$-process waiting points.</description>

      <title>Geant4 and FLUKA Simulations of a Cyclotron Based 30 MeV Proton-Beryllium Reaction: Benchmarking and Optimization of Neutron Fields</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.05426</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.05426v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: For studies where a reliable neutron source/beam is required and a nuclear reactor is not a viable option (considering their high neutron flux supply, which may not be suitable for research concerning low flux operations), alternative approaches may be sought. We present a comprehensive simulation analysis of 30 MeV proton induced ${}^9\mathrm{Be}\text{(p,n)}{}^9\mathrm{B}$ reaction, which can be utilized as an isotropic neutron source. This energy was chosen as it was the maximum allowed limit of protons supplied by IBA's Cyclone 30 XP proton cyclotron. Due to different underlying physics and transport mechanisms, when it comes to numerical calculations, slight variations in findings between different toolkits may occur. Hence it may require one to have a guide at hand to address the differences and interpret the data more accurately before conducting the actual experiment. In this work present the different numerical results of Geant4 and FLUKA. We conducted preliminary Monte Carlo runs to estimate the resulting neutron fluence and prompt gamma dose equivalents, while also assessing the degree of moderation achieved by different thicknesses of high density polyethylene. Furthermore, this work also presents an examplar modular irradiation station designed for target-moderator configurations, with the capability of generating thermal neutron fields.</description>

      <title>On the Measurability of True Coincidence Summing in the GRIFFIN Spectrometer</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.16679</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.16679v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The measurement of gamma-rays from decaying nuclei allow for the investigation into nuclear structure. True coincidence summing occurs when two gamma-rays from a single decay get detected in a single detector and their energies sum together to give false peaks in the energy spectrum. Corrections to this summing effect are crucial for an accurate determination of nuclear decay events. The summing correction formalism of Semkow et al. is generalized here into the \textit{Semkow matrix formalism} and is extended into a multiplicity expansion. This formalism is used to calculate the matrix probabilities for 180-degree coincidence events as a method for correcting coincidence summing; in doing so, the deviation between the full correction and this 180-degree correction is shown as a function of multiplicity. This formalism is extended to the \textit{partitioned matrix formalism}, to calculate probabilities for \textit{gated} gamma rays; where two gamma-rays of interest are taken in multi-detector coincidence. The summing correction probabilities for gated gamma-rays are provided and the deviation is shown in a manner similar to that of the singles. Terms such as measurability, event equivalence, and ontic and epistemic events are defined. It is shown that within these definitions, coincidence summing is not sufficiently measurable, or rather, its sufficient measurability is statistically bounded by the deviations derived.</description>
