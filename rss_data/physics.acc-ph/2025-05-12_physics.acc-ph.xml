      <title>Demonstration of Direct-amplification Enabled Harmonic Generation in an Ultraviolet Free-Electron Laser</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.05954</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.05954v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We report the experimental demonstration of direct-amplification enabled harmonic generation in an ultraviolet free-electron laser (FEL) driven by a low-intensity seed laser. By employing a versatile undulator configuration that enables seed amplification and harmonic generation within a unified setup, we achieved over 100-fold energy gain of the seed and observed exponential growth at the second harmonic. The results demonstrate that a sufficiently long modulator can not only amplify a weak seed but also induce strong energy modulation of the electron beam, enabling efficient harmonic bunching. This method markedly relaxes the power requirements on external seed lasers and presents a viable route toward high-repetition-rate, fully coherent FELs</description>

      <title>Neutrinos from Stored Muons (nuSTORM)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.06137</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.06137v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Neutrinos from Stored Muons, nuSTORM, facility has been designed to deliver a definitive neutrino-nucleus scattering programme using beams of ,{\nu}e- and ,{\nu}{\mu}- from the decay of muons confined within a storage ring. The facility is unique, it will be capable of storing {\mu} beams with a central momentum of between 1 GeV/c and 6 GeV/c and a momentum spread of 16%. This specification will allow neutrino-scattering measurements to be made over the kinematic range of interest to the DUNE and Hyper-K collaborations. At nuSTORM, the flavour composition of the beam and the neutrino-energy spectrum are both precisely known. The storage-ring instrumentation will allow the neutrino flux to be determined to a precision of 1% or better. With its existing proton-beam infrastructure, CERN is uniquely well-placed to implement nuSTORM. A summary of the proposed implementation of nuSTORM at CERN is presented below.</description>
