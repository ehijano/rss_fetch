      <title>Clique-free t-matchings in degree-bounded graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.00429</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.00429v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider problems of finding a maximum size/weight $t$-matching without forbidden subgraphs in an undirected graph $G$ with the maximum degree bounded by $t+1$, where $t$ is an integer greater than $2$. Depending on the variant forbidden subgraphs denote certain subsets of $t$-regular complete partite subgraphs of $G$. A graph is complete partite if there exists a partition of its vertex set such that every pair of vertices from different sets is connected by an edge and vertices from the same set form an independent set. A clique $K_t$ and a bipartite clique $K_{t,t}$ are examples of complete partite graphs. These problems are natural generalizations of the triangle-free and square-free $2$-matching problems in subcubic graphs. In the weighted setting we assume that the weights of edges of $G$ are vertex-induced on every forbidden subgraph. We present simple and fast combinatorial algorithms for these problems. The presented algorithms are the first ones for the weighted versions, and for the unweighted ones, are faster than those known previously. Our approach relies on the use of gadgets with so-called half-edges. A half-edge of edge $e$ is, informally speaking, a half of $e$ containing exactly one of its endpoints.</description>

      <title>Probabilistic estimates of the diameters of the Rubik's Cube groups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.07337</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.07337v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The diameter of the Cayley graph of the Rubik's Cube group is the fewest number of turns needed to solve the Cube from any initial configurations. For the 2$\times$2$\times$2 Cube, the diameter is 11 in the half-turn metric, 14 in the quarter-turn metric, 19 in the semi-quarter-turn metric, and 10 in the bi-quarter-turn metric. For the 3$\times$3$\times$3 Cube, the diameter was determined by Rokicki et al. to be 20 in the half-turn metric and 26 in the quarter-turn metric. This study shows that a modified version of the coupon collector's problem in probabilistic theory can predict the diameters correctly for both 2$\times$2$\times$2 and 3$\times$3$\times$3 Cubes insofar as the quarter-turn metric is adopted. In the half-turn metric, the diameters are overestimated by one and two, respectively, for the 2$\times$2$\times$2 and 3$\times$3$\times$3 Cubes, whereas for the 2$\times$2$\times$2 Cube in the semi-quarter-turn and bi-quarter-turn metrics, they are overestimated by two and underestimated by one, respectively. Invoking the same probabilistic logic, the diameters of the 4$\times$4$\times$4 and 5$\times$5$\times$5 Cubes are predicted to be 48 (41) and 68 (58) in the quarter-turn (half-turn) metric, whose precise determinations are far beyond reach of classical supercomputing. It is shown that the probabilistically estimated diameter is approximated by $\ln N / \ln r + \ln N / r$, where $N$ is the number of configurations and $r$ is the branching ratio.</description>

      <title>Cover and Hitting Times of Hyperbolic Random Graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2207.06956</link>
      <description>arXiv:2207.06956v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study random walks on the giant component of Hyperbolic Random Graphs (HRGs), in the regime when the degree distribution obeys a power law with exponent in the range $(2,3)$. In particular, we first focus on the expected time for a random walk to hit a given vertex or visit, i.e. cover, all vertices. We show that, a.a.s. (with respect to the HRG), and up to multiplicative constants: the cover time is $n(\log n)^2$, the maximum hitting time is $n\log n$, and the average hitting time is $n$. We then determine the expected time to commute between two given vertices a.a.s., up to a small factor polylogarithmic in $n$, and under some mild hypothesis on the pair of vertices involved. Our results are proved by controlling effective resistances using the energy dissipated by carefully designed network flows associated to a tiling of the hyperbolic plane, on which we overlay a forest-like structure.</description>

      <title>The Information Geometry of UMAP</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.01237</link>
      <description>arXiv:2309.01237v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this note we highlight some connections of UMAP to the basic principles of Information Geometry. Originally, UMAP was derived from Category Theory observations. However, we posit that it also has a natural geometric interpretation.</description>
