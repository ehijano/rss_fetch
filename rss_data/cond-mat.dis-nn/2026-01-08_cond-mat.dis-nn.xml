      <title>Multifractality, percolation threshold and critical point of a nuclear reactor</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.03399</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.03399v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A multifractal model is used to analyze neutron evolution within a reactor. For chain reactions, various characteristics of multifractal neutron behavior have been determined. These include the dimension of the multifractal carrier, information and correlation dimensions, the entropy of the fractal set, maximum and minimum dimension values, and the multifractal spectrum function. The geometric features of a multifractal allow for the description of a stochastic system consisting of hierarchically subordinate statistical ensembles, which are characterized by Cayley trees. A stationary distribution over hierarchical levels is established, which follows the Tsallis power law. The text also points out some potential applications of fractal patterns in nuclear reactor theory. The chance of percolation, which is when we see a state in the Bethe lattice where there's at least one continuous path through neighboring conducting nodes all the way across, is similar to the likelihood of a self-sustaining fission chain reaction happening. When this probability hits a critical point, we get a (conditionally) infinite cluster of neutrons forming. The percolation probability, influenced by how long the reactor has been running and its size, is linked to the reactor's criticality. We take a look at how the neutron multiplication factor behaves over time. We especially focus on the early stages of a self-sustaining nuclear fission chain reaction. We also highlight the ways to identify the boundaries of the critical region.</description>

      <title>Anderson Localization on Husimi Trees and its implications for Many-Body localization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.04155</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.04155v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Motivated by the analogy between many-body localization (MBL) and single-particle Anderson localization on hierarchical graphs, we study localization on the Husimi tree, a generalization of the Bethe lattice with a finite density of local loops of arbitrary but finite length. The exact solution of the model provides a transparent and quantitative framework to systematically inspect the effect of loops on localization. Our analysis indicates that local loops enhance resonant processes, thereby reducing the critical disorder with increasing their number and size. At the same time, loops promote local hybridization, leading to an increase in the spatial extent of localized eigenstates. These effects reconcile key discrepancies between MBL phenomenology and its single-particle Anderson analog. These results show that local loops are a crucial structural ingredient for realistic single-particle analogies to many-body Hilbert spaces.</description>

      <title>Wigner solid or Anderson solid -- 2D electrons in strong disorder</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.03521</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.03521v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Critically analyzing recent STM and transport experiments [Z. Ge, et al, arXiv:2510.12009] on 2D electron systems in the presence of random quenched impurities, we argue that the resulting low-density putative "solid" phase reported experimentally is better described as an Anderson solid with the carriers randomly spatially localized by impurities than as a Wigner solid where the carriers form a crystal due to an interaction-induced spontaneous breaking of the translational symmetry. In strongly disordered systems, the resulting solid is amorphous, which is adiabatically connected to the infinite disorder Anderson fixed point rather than the zero disorder Wigner crystal fixed point.</description>

      <title>Learning Shrinks the Hard Tail: Training-Dependent Inference Scaling in a Solvable Linear Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.03764</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.03764v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We analyze neural scaling laws in a solvable model of last-layer fine-tuning where targets have intrinsic, instance-heterogeneous difficulty. In our Latent Instance Difficulty (LID) model, each input's target variance is governed by a latent ``precision'' drawn from a heavy-tailed distribution. While generalization loss recovers standard scaling laws, our main contribution connects this to inference. The pass@$k$ failure rate exhibits a power-law decay, $k^{-\beta_\text{eff}}$, but the observed exponent $\beta_\text{eff}$ is training-dependent. It grows with sample size $N$ before saturating at an intrinsic limit $\beta$ set by the difficulty distribution's tail. This coupling reveals that learning shrinks the ``hard tail'' of the error distribution: improvements in the model's generalization error steepen the pass@$k$ curve until irreducible target variance dominates. The LID model yields testable, closed-form predictions for this behavior, including a compute-allocation rule that favors training before saturation and inference attempts after. We validate these predictions in simulations and in two real-data proxies: CIFAR-10H (human-label variance) and a maths teacher-student distillation task.</description>

      <title>The maximum-average subtensor problem: equilibrium and out-of-equilibrium properties</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.15400</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.15400v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper we introduce and study the Maximum-Average Subtensor ($p$-MAS) problem, in which one wants to find a subtensor of size $k$ of a given random tensor of size $N$, both of order $p$, with maximum sum of entries. We are motivated by recent work on the matrix case of the problem in which several equilibrium and non-equilibrium properties have been characterized analytically in the asymptotic regime $1 \ll k \ll N$, and a puzzling phenomenon was observed involving the coexistence of a clustered equilibrium phase and an efficient algorithm which produces submatrices in this phase. Here we extend previous results on equilibrium and algorithmic properties for the matrix case to the tensor case. We show that the tensor case has a similar equilibrium phase diagram as the matrix case, and an overall similar phenomenology for the considered algorithms. Additionally, we consider out-of-equilibrium landscape properties using Overlap Gap Properties and Franz-Parisi analysis, and discuss the implications or lack-thereof for average-case algorithmic hardness.</description>

      <title>Enhanced Long Wavelength Mermin-Wagner Fluctuations in Two-Dimensional Active Crystals and Glasses</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.10625</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.10625v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In two-dimensions (2D), the Mermin-Wagner-Hohenberg (MWH) fluctuation plays a significant role, giving rise to striking dimensionality effects marked by long-range density fluctuations leading to the singularities of various dynamical properties. According to the MWH theorem, a 2D equilibrium system with continuous degrees of freedom cannot achieve long-range crystalline order at non-zero temperatures. Recently, MWH fluctuations have been observed in glass-forming liquids, evidenced by the logarithmic divergence in the plateau value of mean squared displacement (MSD). Our research investigates long-wavelength fluctuations in crystalline and glassy systems influenced by non-equilibrium active noises. Active systems serve as a minimal model for understanding diverse non-equilibrium dynamics, such as those in biological systems and self-propelled colloids. We demonstrate that fluctuations from active forces can strongly couple with long-wavelength density fluctuations, altering the lower critical dimension ($d_l$) from $2$ to $3$ and leading to a novel logarithmic divergence of the MSD plateau with system size in 3D.</description>

      <title>Reflected multi-entropy and its holographic dual</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.08546</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.08546v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We introduce a mixed-state generalization of the multi-entropy through the canonical purification, which we call reflected multi-entropy. We propose the holographic dual of this measure. For the tripartite case, a field-theoretical calculation is performed using a six-point function of twist operators at large $c$ limit. At both zero and finite temperature, the field-theoretical results match the holographic results, supporting our holographic conjecture of this new measure.</description>
