      <title>Weak Supervision Techniques towards Enhanced ASR Models in Industry-level CRM Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.16843</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.16843v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the design of customer relationship management (CRM) systems, accurately identifying customer types and offering personalized services are key to enhancing customer satisfaction and loyalty. However, this process faces the challenge of discerning customer voices and intentions, and general pre-trained automatic speech recognition (ASR) models make it difficult to effectively address industry-specific speech recognition tasks. To address this issue, we innovatively proposed a solution for fine-tuning industry-specific ASR models, which significantly improved the performance of the fine-tuned ASR models in industry applications. Experimental results show that our method substantially improves the crucial auxiliary role of the ASR model in industry CRM systems, and this approach has also been adopted in actual industrial applications.</description>

      <title>On Temporal Guidance and Iterative Refinement in Audio Source Separation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.17297</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.17297v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Spatial semantic segmentation of sound scenes (S5) involves the accurate identification of active sound classes and the precise separation of their sources from complex acoustic mixtures. Conventional systems rely on a two-stage pipeline - audio tagging followed by label-conditioned source separation - but are often constrained by the absence of fine-grained temporal information critical for effective separation. In this work, we address this limitation by introducing a novel approach for S5 that enhances the synergy between the event detection and source separation stages. Our key contributions are threefold. First, we fine-tune a pre-trained Transformer to detect active sound classes. Second, we utilize a separate instance of this fine-tuned Transformer to perform sound event detection (SED), providing the separation module with detailed, time-varying guidance. Third, we implement an iterative refinement mechanism that progressively enhances separation quality by recursively reusing the separator's output from previous iterations. These advancements lead to significant improvements in both audio tagging and source separation performance, as demonstrated by our system's second-place finish in Task 4 of the DCASE Challenge 2025. Our implementation and model checkpoints are available in our GitHub repository: https://github.com/theMoro/dcase25task4 .</description>

      <title>Application of Whisper in Clinical Practice: the Post-Stroke Speech Assessment during a Naming Task</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.17326</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.17326v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Detailed assessment of language impairment following stroke remains a cognitively complex and clinician-intensive task, limiting timely and scalable diagnosis. Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) foundation models offer a promising pathway to augment human evaluation through intelligent systems, but their effectiveness in the context of speech and language impairment remains uncertain. In this study, we evaluate whether Whisper, a state-of-the-art ASR foundation model, can be applied to transcribe and analyze speech from patients with stroke during a commonly used picture-naming task. We assess both verbatim transcription accuracy and the model's ability to support downstream prediction of language function, which has major implications for outcomes after stroke. Our results show that the baseline Whisper model performs poorly on single-word speech utterances. Nevertheless, fine-tuning Whisper significantly improves transcription accuracy (reducing Word Error Rate by 87.72% in healthy speech and 71.22% in speech from patients). Further, learned representations from the model enable accurate prediction of speech quality (average F1 Macro of 0.74 for healthy, 0.75 for patients). However, evaluations on an unseen (TORGO) dataset reveal limited generalizability, highlighting the inability of Whisper to perform zero-shot transcription of single-word utterances on out-of-domain clinical speech and emphasizing the need to adapt models to specific clinical populations. While challenges remain in cross-domain generalization, these findings highlight the potential of foundation models, when appropriately fine-tuned, to advance automated speech and language assessment and rehabilitation for stroke-related impairments.</description>

      <title>BoSS: Beyond-Semantic Speech</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.17563</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.17563v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Human communication involves more than explicit semantics, with implicit signals and contextual cues playing a critical role in shaping meaning. However, modern speech technologies, such as Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) and Text-to-Speech (TTS) often fail to capture these beyond-semantic dimensions. To better characterize and benchmark the progression of speech intelligence, we introduce Spoken Interaction System Capability Levels (L1-L5), a hierarchical framework illustrated the evolution of spoken dialogue systems from basic command recognition to human-like social interaction. To support these advanced capabilities, we propose Beyond-Semantic Speech (BoSS), which refers to the set of information in speech communication that encompasses but transcends explicit semantics. It conveys emotions, contexts, and modifies or extends meanings through multidimensional features such as affective cues, contextual dynamics, and implicit semantics, thereby enhancing the understanding of communicative intentions and scenarios. We present a formalized framework for BoSS, leveraging cognitive relevance theories and machine learning models to analyze temporal and contextual speech dynamics. We evaluate BoSS-related attributes across five different dimensions, reveals that current spoken language models (SLMs) are hard to fully interpret beyond-semantic signals. These findings highlight the need for advancing BoSS research to enable richer, more context-aware human-machine communication.</description>

      <title>Audio-Vision Contrastive Learning for Phonological Class Recognition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.17682</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.17682v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Accurate classification of articulatory-phonological features plays a vital role in understanding human speech production and developing robust speech technologies, particularly in clinical contexts where targeted phonemic analysis and therapy can improve disease diagnosis accuracy and personalized rehabilitation. In this work, we propose a multimodal deep learning framework that combines real-time magnetic resonance imaging (rtMRI) and speech signals to classify three key articulatory dimensions: manner of articulation, place of articulation, and voicing. We perform classification on 15 phonological classes derived from the aforementioned articulatory dimensions and evaluate the system with four audio/vision configurations: unimodal rtMRI, unimodal audio signals, multimodal middle fusion, and contrastive learning-based audio-vision fusion. Experimental results on the USC-TIMIT dataset show that our contrastive learning-based approach achieves state-of-the-art performance, with an average F1-score of 0.81, representing an absolute increase of 0.23 over the unimodal baseline. The results confirm the effectiveness of contrastive representation learning for multimodal articulatory analysis. Our code and processed dataset will be made publicly available at https://github.com/DaE-plz/AC_Contrastive_Phonology to support future research.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.16845</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.16845v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Lung diseases, including lung cancer and COPD, are significant health concerns globally. Traditional diagnostic methods can be costly, time-consuming, and invasive. This study investigates the use of semi supervised learning methods for lung sound signal detection using a model combination of MFCC+CNN. By introducing semi supervised learning modules such as Mix Match, Co-Refinement, and Co Refurbishing, we aim to enhance the detection performance while reducing dependence on manual annotations. With the add-on semi-supervised modules, the accuracy rate of the MFCC+CNN model is 92.9%, an increase of 3.8% to the baseline model. The research contributes to the field of lung disease sound detection by addressing challenges such as individual differences, feature insufficient labeled data.</description>

      <title>Seed LiveInterpret 2.0: End-to-end Simultaneous Speech-to-speech Translation with Your Voice</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.17527</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.17527v2 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Simultaneous Interpretation (SI) represents one of the most daunting frontiers in the translation industry, with product-level automatic systems long plagued by intractable challenges: subpar transcription and translation quality, lack of real-time speech generation, multi-speaker confusion, and translated speech inflation, especially in long-form discourses. In this study, we introduce Seed-LiveInterpret 2.0, an end-to-end SI model that delivers high-fidelity, ultra-low-latency speech-to-speech generation with voice cloning capabilities. As a fully operational product-level solution, Seed-LiveInterpret 2.0 tackles these challenges head-on through our novel duplex speech-to-speech understanding-generating framework. Experimental results demonstrate that through large-scale pretraining and reinforcement learning, the model achieves a significantly better balance between translation accuracy and latency, validated by human interpreters to exceed 70% correctness in complex scenarios. Notably, Seed-LiveInterpret 2.0 outperforms commercial SI solutions by significant margins in translation quality, while slashing the average latency of cloned speech from nearly 10 seconds to a near-real-time 3 seconds, which is around a near 70% reduction that drastically enhances practical usability.</description>

      <title>Clustering-based hard negative sampling for supervised contrastive speaker verification</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.17540</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.17540v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In speaker verification, contrastive learning is gaining popularity as an alternative to the traditionally used classification-based approaches. Contrastive methods can benefit from an effective use of hard negative pairs, which are different-class samples particularly challenging for a verification model due to their similarity. In this paper, we propose CHNS - a clustering-based hard negative sampling method, dedicated for supervised contrastive speaker representation learning. Our approach clusters embeddings of similar speakers, and adjusts batch composition to obtain an optimal ratio of hard and easy negatives during contrastive loss calculation. Experimental evaluation shows that CHNS outperforms a baseline supervised contrastive approach with and without loss-based hard negative sampling, as well as a state-of-the-art classification-based approach to speaker verification by as much as 18 % relative EER and minDCF on the VoxCeleb dataset using two lightweight model architectures.</description>

      <title>Accent Normalization Using Self-Supervised Discrete Tokens with Non-Parallel Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.17735</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.17735v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Accent normalization converts foreign-accented speech into native-like speech while preserving speaker identity. We propose a novel pipeline using self-supervised discrete tokens and non-parallel training data. The system extracts tokens from source speech, converts them through a dedicated model, and synthesizes the output using flow matching. Our method demonstrates superior performance over a frame-to-frame baseline in naturalness, accentedness reduction, and timbre preservation across multiple English accents. Through token-level phonetic analysis, we validate the effectiveness of our token-based approach. We also develop two duration preservation methods, suitable for applications such as dubbing.</description>

      <title>Koel-TTS: Enhancing LLM based Speech Generation with Preference Alignment and Classifier Free Guidance</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.05236</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.05236v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: While autoregressive speech token generation models produce speech with remarkable variety and naturalness, their inherent lack of controllability often results in issues such as hallucinations and undesired vocalizations that do not conform to conditioning inputs. We introduce Koel-TTS, a suite of enhanced encoder-decoder Transformer TTS models that address these challenges by incorporating preference alignment techniques guided by automatic speech recognition and speaker verification models. Additionally, we incorporate classifier-free guidance to further improve synthesis adherence to the transcript and reference speaker audio. Our experiments demonstrate that these optimizations significantly enhance target speaker similarity, intelligibility, and naturalness of synthesized speech. Notably, Koel-TTS directly maps text and context audio to acoustic tokens, and on the aforementioned metrics, outperforms state-of-the-art TTS models, despite being trained on a significantly smaller dataset. Audio samples and demos are available on our website.</description>

Abstract: Speech Enhancement techniques have become core technologies in mobile devices and voice software. Still, modern deep learning solutions often require high amount of computational resources what makes their usage on low-resource devices challenging. We present HiFi-Stream, an optimized version of recently published HiFi++ model. Our experiments demonstrate that HiFi-Stream saves most of the qualities of the original model despite its size and computational complexity improved in comparison to the original HiFi++ making it one of the smallest and fastest models available. The model is evaluated in streaming setting where it demonstrates its superior performance in comparison to modern baselines.</description>

      <title>Miipher-2: A Universal Speech Restoration Model for Million-Hour Scale Data Restoration</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.04457</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.04457v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Training data cleaning is a new application for generative model-based speech restoration (SR). This paper introduces Miipher-2, an SR model designed for million-hour scale data, for training data cleaning for large-scale generative models like large language models. Key challenges addressed include generalization to unseen languages, operation without explicit conditioning (e.g., text, speaker ID), and computational efficiency. Miipher-2 utilizes a frozen, pre-trained Universal Speech Model (USM), supporting over 300 languages, as a robust, conditioning-free feature extractor. To optimize efficiency and minimize memory, Miipher-2 incorporates parallel adapters for predicting clean USM features from noisy inputs and employs the WaveFit neural vocoder for waveform synthesis. These components were trained on 3,000 hours of multi-lingual, studio-quality recordings with augmented degradations, while USM parameters remained fixed. Experimental results demonstrate Miipher-2's superior or comparable performance to conventional SR models in word-error-rate, speaker similarity, and both objective and subjective sound quality scores across all tested languages. Miipher-2 operates efficiently on consumer-grade accelerators, achieving a real-time factor of 0.0078, enabling the processing of a million-hour speech dataset in approximately three days using only 100 such accelerators.</description>

      <title>ISDrama: Immersive Spatial Drama Generation through Multimodal Prompting</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.20630</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.20630v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Multimodal immersive spatial drama generation focuses on creating continuous multi-speaker binaural speech with dramatic prosody based on multimodal prompts, with potential applications in AR, VR, and others. This task requires simultaneous modeling of spatial information and dramatic prosody based on multimodal inputs, with high data collection costs. To the best of our knowledge, our work is the first attempt to address these challenges. We construct MRSDrama, the first multimodal recorded spatial drama dataset, containing binaural drama audios, scripts, videos, geometric poses, and textual prompts. Then, we propose ISDrama, the first immersive spatial drama generation model through multimodal prompting. ISDrama comprises these primary components: 1) Multimodal Pose Encoder, based on contrastive learning, considering the Doppler effect caused by moving speakers to extract unified pose information from multimodal prompts. 2) Immersive Drama Transformer, a flow-based mamba-transformer model that generates high-quality drama, incorporating Drama-MOE to select proper experts for enhanced prosody and pose control. We also design a context-consistent classifier-free guidance strategy to coherently generate complete drama. Experimental results show that ISDrama outperforms baseline models on objective and subjective metrics. The demos are available at https://aaronz345.github.io/ISDramaDemo. We provide the dataset and the evaluation code at https://huggingface.co/datasets/AaronZ345/MRSDrama and https://github.com/AaronZ345/ISDrama.</description>

      <title>UniCUE: Unified Recognition and Generation Framework for Chinese Cued Speech Video-to-Speech Generation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.04134</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.04134v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Cued Speech (CS) enhances lipreading through hand coding, providing precise speech perception support for the hearing-impaired. CS Video-to-Speech generation (CSV2S) task aims to convert the CS visual expressions (CS videos) of hearing-impaired individuals into comprehensible speech signals. Direct generation of speech from CS video (called single CSV2S) yields poor performance due to insufficient CS data. Current research mostly focuses on CS Recognition (CSR), which convert video content into linguistic text. Based on this, one straightforward way of CSV2S is to combine CSR with a Text-to-Speech system. This combined architecture relies on text as an intermediate medium for stepwise cross-modal alignment, which may lead to error propagation and temporal misalignment between speech and video dynamics. To address these challenges, we propose a novel approach that directly generates speech from CS videos without relying on intermediate text. Building upon this, we propose UniCUE, the first unified framework for CSV2S, whose core innovation lies in the integration of the CSR task that provides fine-grained visual-semantic information to facilitate speech generation from CS videos. More precisely, (1) a novel fine-grained semantic alignment pool to ensure precise mapping between visual features and speech contents; (2) a VisioPhonetic adapter to bridge cross-task representations, ensuring seamless compatibility between two distinct tasks (i.e., CSV2S and CSR); (3) a pose-aware visual processor is introduced to enhance fine-grained spatiotemporal correlations between lip and hand movements in CS video. Experiments on our new established Chinese CS dataset show that our UniCUE achieves state-of-the-art performance across various metrics.</description>

Abstract: Zero-shot online voice conversion (VC) holds significant promise for real-time communications and entertainment. However, current VC models struggle to preserve semantic fidelity under real-time constraints, deliver natural-sounding conversions, and adapt effectively to unseen speaker characteristics. To address these challenges, we introduce Conan, a chunkwise online zero-shot voice conversion model that preserves the content of the source while matching the voice timbre and styles of reference speech. Conan comprises three core components: 1) a Stream Content Extractor that leverages Emformer for low-latency streaming content encoding; 2) an Adaptive Style Encoder that extracts fine-grained stylistic features from reference speech for enhanced style adaptation; 3) a Causal Shuffle Vocoder that implements a fully causal HiFiGAN using a pixel-shuffle mechanism. Experimental evaluations demonstrate that Conan outperforms baseline models in subjective and objective metrics. Audio samples can be found at https://aaronz345.github.io/ConanDemo.</description>
