      <title>Stochastic simulation of binary annihilation reactions within q-analysis formalism</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.03922</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.03922v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Although Gillespie's algorithm is justified under a set of axioms based on the assumption of homogeneity of the system, many chemical systems deviate from this assumption, as is the case for reactions taking place in low-mobility media. Using instead the generalized q formalism, we propose a new stochastic simulation algorithm by redefining the probability with which a mu reaction occurs between t + tao and t + tao + delta tao as P(tao q, mu) = a mu exp q(-a0 tao q), taking into account the separation of the natural exponential by the q parameter. Our algorithm has been implemented in the study of binary annihilation reactions, demonstrating a wider amplitude within the range of established physicochemical reactions, being the stochastic Gillespie scheme and the classical deterministic approach, particular cases of this new proposal. The effect of the nonextensivity parameter, q, on the reaction rate is analyzed and its relationship with the reaction order, n, and the heterogeneity parameter, h, is determined for two different reactant concentrations in the annihilation reaction. Different behaviors of these parameters are observed for the two types of samples, especially as q moves away from 1, confirming that quasi-second order reactions occur when reactant concentrations are similar and quasi-first order reactions when they are different. Empirical expressions between the classical reaction order and the degree of heterogeneity are proposed. The results obtained allow us to associate the behavior of sub and supra Arrhenius kinetics reported in other different reactions with the degree of non-extensiveness of the reaction.</description>

      <title>A new computational framework for spinor-based relativistic exact two-component calculations using contracted basis functions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.04008</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.04008v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A new computational framework for spinor-based relativistic exact two-component (X2C) calculations is developed using contracted basis sets with a spin-orbit contraction scheme. Generally contracted j-adapted basis sets using primitive functions in the correlation-consistent basis sets are constructed for the X2C Hamiltonian with atomic mean-field spin-orbit integrals (the X2CAMF scheme). The contraction coefficients are taken from atomic X2CAMF Hartree-Fock spinors, hereby following the simple concept of linear combination of atomic orbitals (LCAOs). Benchmark calculations of spin-orbit splittings, equilibrium bond lengths, and harmonic vibrational frequencies demonstrate the accuracy and efficacy of the j-adapted spin-orbit contraction scheme.</description>

      <title>{\sigma}/{\pi} character of H-bonding in water clusters</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.04173</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.04173v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Hydrogen bonds are typically treated as sufficiently localized directional intermolecular bonds, in which dispersion and electrostatic contributions can be distinguished. However, being formed chiefly due to the overlapping of p orbitals of electronegative atoms, the corresponding electronic bonds are characterized by both {\sigma}- and {\pi}-kind binding, the former determining the directionality of bonds, while the latter, the coupling of molecules and the collective effects in H-bond networks. The latter contribution was never considered previously and is predetermined by overlapping pre-lone pair orbitals of oxygen atoms. This is manifested in the peculiarities of the electron density distribution, which are quantified based on the analysis of magnetic shielding tensors of oxygen and bridge hydrogen nuclei and illustrated by the shapes of cluster orbitals of water aggregates.</description>

      <title>Third density and acoustic virial coefficients of helium isotopologues from ab initio calculations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.04353</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.04353v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Improved two-body and three-body potentials for helium have been used to calculate from first principles the third density and acoustic virial coefficients for both $^4$He and $^3$He. For the third density virial coefficient $C(T)$, uncertainties have been reduced by a factor of 4--5 compared to the previous state of the art; the accuracy of first-principles $C(T)$ now exceeds that of the best experiments by more than two orders of magnitude. The range of calculations has been extended to temperatures as low as 0.5~K. For the third acoustic virial coefficient $\gamma_a(T)$, we applied the Schlessinger Point Method, which can calculate $\gamma_a$ and its uncertainty based on the $C(T)$ data, overcoming some limitations of direct path-integral calculation. The resulting $\gamma_a$ are calculated at temperatures down to 0.5~K; they are consistent with available experimental data but have much smaller uncertainties. The first-principles data presented here will enable improvement of primary temperature and pressure metrology based on gas properties.</description>

      <title>AdsorbDiff: Adsorbate Placement via Conditional Denoising Diffusion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.03962</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.03962v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Determining the optimal configuration of adsorbates on a slab (adslab) is pivotal in the exploration of novel catalysts across diverse applications. Traditionally, the quest for the lowest energy adslab configuration involves placing the adsorbate onto the slab followed by an optimization process. Prior methodologies have relied on heuristics, problem-specific intuitions, or brute-force approaches to guide adsorbate placement. In this work, we propose a novel framework for adsorbate placement using denoising diffusion. The model is designed to predict the optimal adsorbate site and orientation corresponding to the lowest energy configuration. Further, we have an end-to-end evaluation framework where diffusion-predicted adslab configuration is optimized with a pretrained machine learning force field and finally evaluated with Density Functional Theory (DFT). Our findings demonstrate an acceleration of up to 5x or 3.5x improvement in accuracy compared to the previous best approach. Given the novelty of this framework and application, we provide insights into the impact of pre-training, model architectures, and conduct extensive experiments to underscore the significance of this approach.</description>

      <title>Dynamical Decoherence and Memory Effects in Green Fluorescent Proteins by Dielectric Relaxation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2211.09408</link>
      <description>arXiv:2211.09408v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this article, we explore the dynamical decoherence of the chromophores within a green fluorescent protein when coupled to a finite-temperature dielectric environment. Such systems are of significant interest due to their anomalously long coherence lifetimes compared to other biomolecules. We work within the spin-boson model and employ the Hierarchical Equations of Motion formalism which allows for the accounting of the full non-perturbative and non-Markovian characteristics of the system dynamics. We analyse the level coherence of independent green fluorescent protein chromophores and the energy transfer dynamics in homo-dimer green fluorescent proteins, focusing on the effect of dielectric relaxation on the timescales of these systems. Using the Fluctuation-Dissipation theorem, we generate spectral densities from local electric susceptibility generated from Poisson's equation and employ a Debye dielectric model for the solvent environment. For different system architectures, we identify a number of very striking features in the dynamics of the chromophore induced by the dielectric relaxation of the environment, resulting in strong memory effects that extend the coherence lifetime of the system. Remarkably, the complex architecture of the green fluorescent protein, which includes a cavity-like structure around the atomic system, is well suited to preserving the coherences in the homo-dimer system. The system dynamics generate a dynamical correlation between the coherent energy transfer between its sub-systems and the entropy production, which can lead to transient reductions in entropy, a unique feature of the non-Markovian nature of the system-environment interaction.</description>

      <title>Quantum Quality with Classical Cost: Ab Initio Nonadiabatic Dynamics Simulations using the Mapping Approach to Surface Hopping</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.07299</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.07299v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Nonadiabatic dynamics methods are an essential tool for investigating photochemical processes. In the context of employing first principles electronic structure techniques, such simulations can be carried out in a practical manner using semiclassical trajectory-based methods or wave packet approaches. While all approaches applicable to first principles simulations are necessarily approximate, it is commonly thought that wave packet approaches offer inherent advantages over their semiclassical counterparts in terms of accuracy, and that this trait simply comes at a higher computational cost. Here we demonstrate that the mapping approach to surface hopping (MASH), a recently introduced trajectory-based nonadiabatic dynamics method, can be efficiently applied in tandem with ab initio electronic structure. Our results even suggest that MASH may provide more accurate results than on-the-fly wave packet techniques, all at a much lower computational cost.</description>

      <title>ChemReasoner: Heuristic Search over a Large Language Model's Knowledge Space using Quantum-Chemical Feedback</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.10980</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.10980v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The discovery of new catalysts is essential for the design of new and more efficient chemical processes in order to transition to a sustainable future. We introduce an AI-guided computational screening framework unifying linguistic reasoning with quantum-chemistry based feedback from 3D atomistic representations. Our approach formulates catalyst discovery as an uncertain environment where an agent actively searches for highly effective catalysts via the iterative combination of large language model (LLM)-derived hypotheses and atomistic graph neural network (GNN)-derived feedback. Identified catalysts in intermediate search steps undergo structural evaluation based on spatial orientation, reaction pathways, and stability. Scoring functions based on adsorption energies and barriers steer the exploration in the LLM's knowledge space toward energetically favorable, high-efficiency catalysts. We introduce planning methods that automatically guide the exploration without human input, providing competitive performance against expert-enumerated chemical descriptor-based implementations. By integrating language-guided reasoning with computational chemistry feedback, our work pioneers AI-accelerated, trustworthy catalyst discovery.</description>

      <title>FRECKLL: Full and Reduced Exoplanet Chemical Kinetics distiLLed</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2209.11203</link>
      <description>arXiv:2209.11203v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We introduce a new Python 1D chemical kinetic code FRECKLL (Full and Reduced Exoplanet Chemical Kinetics distiLLed) to evolve large chemical networks efficiently. FRECKLL employs `distillation' in computing the reaction rates, which minimizes the error bounds to the minimum allowed by double precision values ($\epsilon \leq 10^{-15}$). Compared to summation of rates with traditional algorithms like pairwise summation, distillation provides a tenfold reduction in solver time for both full and reduced networks. Both the full and reduced Venot2020 networks are packaged in FRECKLL as well as a TauREx 3.1 plugin for usage in forward modelling and retrievals of exoplanet atmospheres. We present TauREx retrievals performed on a simulated HD189733 JWST spectra using the full and reduced Venot2020 chemical networks and demonstrate the viability of total disequilibrium chemistry retrievals and the ability for JWST to detect disequilibrium processes.</description>

      <title>Material Property Prediction using Graphs based on Generically Complete Isometry Invariants</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2212.11246</link>
      <description>arXiv:2212.11246v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The structure-property hypothesis says that the properties of all materials are determined by an underlying crystal structure. The main obstacle was the ambiguity of conventional crystal representations based on incomplete or discontinuous descriptors that allow false negatives or false positives. This ambiguity was resolved by the ultra-fast Pointwise Distance Distribution (PDD), which distinguished all periodic structures in the world's largest collection of real materials (Cambridge Structural Database). The state-of-the-art results in property predictions were previously achieved by graph neural networks based on various graph representations of periodic crystals, including the Crystal Graph with vertices at all atoms in a crystal unit cell. This work adapts the Pointwise Distance Distribution for a simpler graph whose vertex set is not larger than the asymmetric unit of a crystal structure. The new Distribution Graph reduces mean-absolute-error by 0.6\%-12\% while having 44\%-88\% of the number of vertices when compared to the crystal graph when applied on the Materials Project and Jarvis-DFT datasets using CGCNN and ALIGNN. Methods for hyper-parameters selection for the graph are backed by the theoretical results of the Pointwise Distance Distribution and are then experimentally justified.</description>

      <title>Microscopic origin of twist-dependent electron transfer rate in bilayer graphene</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.00783</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.00783v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Using molecular simulation and continuum dielectric theory, we consider how electrochemical kinetics are modulated as a function of twist angle in bilayer graphene electrodes. By establishing an effective connection between twist angle and the screening length of charge carriers within the electrode, we investigate how tunable metallicity can result in modified statistics of the electron transfer energy gap. Constant potential molecular simulations show that the activation free energy for electron transfer is an increasing function of the screening length, or decreasing function the density of states at the Fermi energy in the electrode, and subsequently a non-monotonic function of twist angle. We find the twist angle alters the density of states, which tunes the number of thermally-accessible channels for electron transfer, as well as the reorganization energy by altering the stability of the vertically excited state through attenuated image charge interactions. Understanding these effects allows us to cast the Marcus rate of interfacial electron transfer as a function of twist angle, in a manner consistent with a growing body of experimental observations.</description>
