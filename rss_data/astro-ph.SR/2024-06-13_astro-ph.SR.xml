      <title>Automatic detection of large-scale flux ropes and their geoeffectiveness with a machine learning approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.07798</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.07798v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Detecting large-scale flux ropes (FRs) embedded in interplanetary coronal mass ejections (ICMEs) and assessing their geoeffectiveness are essential since they can drive severe space weather. At 1 au, these FRs have an average duration of 1 day. Their most common magnetic features are large, smoothly rotating magnetic fields. Their manual detection has become a relatively common practice over decades, although visual detection can be time-consuming and subject to observer bias. Our study proposes a pipeline that utilizes two supervised binary-classification machine learning (ML) models trained with solar wind magnetic properties to automatically detect large-scale FRs and additionally determine their geoeffectiveness. The first model is used to generate a list of auto-detected FRs. Using the properties of southward magnetic field the second model determines the geoeffectiveness of FRs. Our method identifies 88.6\% and 80\% large-scale ICMEs (duration $\ge 1$ day) observed at 1 au by Wind and Sun Earth Connection Coronal and Heliospheric Investigation (STEREO) mission, respectively. While testing with a continuous solar wind data obtained from Wind, our pipeline detected 56 of the 64 large-scale ICMEs during 2008 - 2014 period (recall= 0.875) but many false positives (precision= 0.56) as we do not take into account any additional solar wind properties than the magnetic properties. We found an accuracy of 0.88 when estimating the geoeffectiveness of the auto-detected FRs using our method. Thus, in space weather now-casting and forecasting at L1 or any planetary missions, our pipeline can be utilized to offer a first-order detection of large-scale FRs and geoeffectiveness.</description>

      <title>A Census of Sun's Ancestors and their Contributions to the Solar System Chemical Composition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.08036</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.08036v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work we compute the rates and numbers of different types of stars and phenomena (SNe, novae, white dwarfs, merging neutron stars, black holes) that contributed to the chemical composition of the Solar System. Stars die and restore the newly formed elements into the interstellar gas. This process is called "chemical evolution". In particular, we analyse the death rates of stars of all masses, dying either quiescently or explosively. These rates and total star numbers are computed in the context of a revised version of the two-infall model for the chemical evolution of the Milky Way, which reproduces fairly well the observed abundance patterns of several chemical species, as well as the global solar metallicity. We compute also the total number of stars ever born and still alive as well as the number of stars born up to the formation of the Solar System and with a mass and metallicity like the Sun. This latter number will account for all the possible existing Solar Systems which can host life in the solar vicinity. Among all the stars (from 0.8 to 100 M$_{\odot}$) born and died from the beginning up to the Solar System formation epoch, which contributed to its chemical composition, 93.00$\%$ are represented by stars dying as single white dwarfs (without interacting significantly with a companion star) and originating in the mass range 0.8-8 M$_{\odot}$, while 5.24$\%$ are neutron stars and 0.73$\%$ are black holes, both originating from SNe core-collapse (M&gt;8 M$_{\odot}$); 0.64$\%$ are Type Ia SNe and 0.40$\%$ are nova systems, both originating from the same mass range as the white dwarfs. The number of stars similar to the Sun born from the beginning up to the Solar System formation, with metallicity in the range 12+log(Fe/H)= 7.50 $\pm$ 0.04 dex is 3.1732$\cdot$ 10$^{7}$, and in particular our Sun is the 2.6092$\cdot$ 10$^7$-th star of this kind, born in the solar vicinity.</description>

      <title>The Sun's Magnetic Power Spectra over Two Solar Cycles. \uppercase\expandafter{\romannumeral2}. Cycle Dependence of Active Region, Magnetic Network, and Their Relation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.08141</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.08141v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The multi-scaled solar magnetic field consists of two major components: active regions (ARs) and magnetic network. Unraveling the cycle-dependent properties and interrelations of these components is crucial for understanding the evolution of the solar magnetic field. In this study, we investigate these components using magnetic power spectra derived from high-resolution and continuous synoptic magnetograms since cycle 23 onwards. Our results show that the size of the magnetic network ranges from 26 Mm to 41 Mm without dependence on the solar cycle. The power of the network field ($P_{NW}$) accounts for approximately 20\% of the total power during any phase of solar cycles. In contrast to the AR power ($P_{AR}$), $P_{NW}$ displays a weaker cycle dependence, as described by the relationship $P_{NW}$ $\approx$ 0.6* $P_{AR}$ + 40. The power-law index between AR sizes and magnetic network sizes presents a strong anti-correlation with the activity level. Additionally, our study indicates that in the absence of sunspots on the solar disc, the magnetic power spectra remain time-independent, consistently exhibiting similarity in both shape and power. This study introduces a new method to investigate the properties of the magnetic network and provides magnetic power spectra for high-resolution simulations of the solar magnetic field at the surface at various phases of solar cycles.</description>

      <title>Simulated Coronal Mass Ejections on a young Solar-Type Star and the Associated Instantaneous Angular Momentum Loss</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.08194</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.08194v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Coronal mass ejections (CMEs) on stars can change the stars' magnetic field configurations and mass loss rates during the eruption and propagation and therefore, may affect the stars' rotation properties on long time-scales. The dynamics of stellar CMEs and their influence on the stellar angular momentum loss rate are not yet well understood. In order to start investigating these CME-related aspects on other stars, we conducted a series of magnetohydrodynamic simulations of CMEs on a solar-type star of moderate activity levels. The propagation and evolution of the CMEs were traced in the three-dimensional outputs and the temporal evolution of their dynamic properties (such as masses, velocities, and kinetic energies) were determined. The simulated stellar CMEs are more massive and energetic than their solar analog, which is a result of the stronger magnetic field on the surface of the simulated star than that of the Sun. The simulated CMEs display masses ranging from ~10^16 g to ~10^18 g and kinetic energies from ~10^31 erg to ~10^33 erg. We also investigated the instantaneous influence of the CMEs to the star's angular momentum loss rate. Our results suggest that angular momentum can either be added to or be removed from the star during the evolution of CME events. We found a positive correlation between the amplitude of the angular momentum loss rate variation and the CME's kinetic energy as well as mass, suggesting that more energetic/massive CMEs have higher possibility to add angular momentum to the star.</description>

      <title>Yellow hypergiant V509 Cas -- stable in the 'yellow void'</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.08276</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.08276v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The yellow hypergiant star V509 Cas is currently undergoing an extreme phase of evolution. Having experienced eruptive mass-loss outbursts in the 20th century, the star's effective temperature reached record high values in the early 2000s. However, since then, the star's behaviour has displayed an unprecedented level of stability. In spite of that, the star could be traversing through the 'yellow void' instability region. To describe the current evolutionary state of V509 Cas, we analysed its variability using photometric and spectroscopic data collected over recent years. By comparing our findings with historical records, we aim to determine whether the star's surface shows signs of stabilisation. Additionally, we investigate the variability of emission components in the wings of certain spectral lines to highlight the contribution of the circumstellar gaseous disc to this phenomenon. Our spectroscopic monitoring observations were carried out at Tartu Observatory over the course of seven years, supplemented by echelle spectra obtained at the Nordic Optical Telescope, as well as publicly available photometric data from Gaia, AAVSO, and AAVSO's Bright Star Monitor programme. We estimated the variability of effective temperature and radial velocity from the spectral time series and correlated it with the brightness variability of V509 Cas. The results indicate that the star's average brightness level has remained stable throughout the observed period, with an amplitude of variability ~0.1 mag. While the amplitude of short-term temperature fluctuations has decreased compared to the early 2000s, the variability of the radial velocity remains similar to historical values from the early 20th century. Moreover, we show how the variable radial velocity affects the emission components in some absorption lines (e.g. Sc II) and how that follows the hypothesis of a disc surrounding the star.</description>

      <title>A suite of classical Cepheids tied to the binary cluster Berkeley 58 \&amp; NGC 7790</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.08483</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.08483v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The classical Cepheids CE Cas A, CE Cas B, CF Cas, and CG Cas are likely members of the binary open cluster comprising NGC 7790 and Berkeley 58. The clusters are of comparable age and in close proximity, as deduced from differentially dereddened $UuB_PBVGR_P$ photometry, and Cepheid period-age relations. Gaia DR3 astrometric and spectroscopic solutions for the clusters are likewise consistent. Conversely, the seemingly adjacent open cluster NGC 7788 is substantially younger and less distant.</description>

      <title>Constraining Wind-Driven Accretion Onto Gaia BH3 With Chandra</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.07602</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.07602v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Gaia BH3 is the most massive known stellar-origin black hole, with a mass $M_\bullet \approx 33 M_\odot$. Detected from Gaia's astrometry, this black hole resembles those observed via gravitational waves, whose nature is still highly debated. Hosted in a binary system with a companion giant star that is too far away for Roche-lobe mass transfer, this black hole could nonetheless accrete at low levels due to wind-driven mass-loss from its companion star, thus accreting in advection-dominated accretion flow, or ADAF, mode. Using stellar models, we constrain its Eddington ratio in the range $10^{-9} &lt; f_{\rm Edd} &lt; 10^{-7}$, corresponding to radiative efficiencies $5\times10^{-5} &lt; \epsilon &lt; 10^{-3}$, compatible with radiatively inefficient accretion modes. Chandra ACIS-S observed this object and obtained the most sensitive upper bound of its [2-10] keV flux: $F_X &lt; 3.25 \times 10^{-15} \, \rm erg \, s^{-1} \, cm^{-2}$ at $90\%$ confidence level corresponding to $L_{[2-10]}&lt; 2.10 \times 10^{29} \, \rm erg \, s^{-1}$. Using ADAF emission models, we constrained its accretion rate to $f_{\rm Edd}&lt; 4.91 \times 10^{-7}$ at the apastron, in agreement with our theoretical estimate. At the periastron, we expect fluxes $\sim 50$ times larger. Hence, accretion did not significantly contribute to black hole growth over the system's lifetime. Detecting the electromagnetic emission from Gaia BH3 will be fundamental to informing stellar wind and accretion disk models.</description>

      <title>Evidence for Non-zero Turbulence in the Protoplanetary disc around IM Lup</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.07689</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.07689v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The amount of turbulence in protoplanetary discs around young stars is critical for determining the efficiency, timeline, and outcomes of planet formation. It is also difficult to measure. Observations are still limited, but direct measurements of the non-thermal, turbulent gas motion are possible with the Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array (ALMA). Using CO(2-1)/$^{13}$CO(2-1)/C$^{18}$O(2-1) ALMA observations of the disc around IM Lup at ~0.4" (~60 au) resolution we find evidence of significant turbulence, at the level of $\delta v_{\rm turb}=(0.18-0.30)$c$_s$. This result is robust against systematic uncertainties (e.g., amplitude flux calibration, midplane gas temperature, disc self-gravity). We find that gravito-turbulence as the source of the gas motion is unlikely based on the lack of an imprint on the rotation curve from a massive disc, while magneto-rotational instabilities and hydrodynamic instabilities are still possible, depending on the unknown magnetic field strength and the cooling timescale in the outer disc.</description>

      <title>Probing the Shock Breakout Signal of SN 2024ggi from the Transformation of Early Flash Spectroscopy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.07806</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.07806v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present early-time, hour-to-day cadence spectroscopy of the nearby type II supernova (SN II) 2024ggi, which was discovered at a phase when the SN shock just emerged from the red-supergiant (RSG) progenitor star. Over the first few days after the first light, SN\,2024ggi exhibited prominent narrow emission lines formed through intense and persistent photoionization of the nearby circumstellar material (CSM). In the first 63 hours, spectral lines of He, C, N, and O revealed a rapid rise in ionization, as a result of the progressive sweeping-up of the CSM by the shock. The duration of the IIn-like spectra indicates a dense and relatively confined CSM distribution extending up to $\sim\,4\,\times\,10^{14}$\,cm. Spectral modeling reveals a CSM mass loss rate at this region exceeding $5 \times\, 10^{-3}$\,\Msun\,yr$^{-1}$\,is required to reproduce low-ionization emissions, which dramatically exceeds that of an RSG. Analyzing H$\alpha$ emission shift implies the velocity of the unshocked outer CSM to be between 20 and 40 \kms, matching the typical wind velocity of an RSG. The differences between the inner and outer layers of the CSM and an RSG progenitor highlight a complex mass loss history before the explosion of SN 2024ggi.</description>

      <title>Investigating Sulfur Chemistry in the HD 163296 disk</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.07896</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.07896v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Sulfur chemistry in the formation process of low-mass stars and planets remains poorly understood. The protoplanetary disks (PPDs) are the birthplace of planets and its distinctive environment provides an intriguing platform for investigating models of sulfur chemistry. We analyzed the ALMA observations of CS 7-6 transitions in the HD 163296 disk and perform astrochemical modeling to explore its sulfur chemistry. We simulated the distribution of sulfur-containing molecules and compared it with observationally deduced fractional column densities. We have found that the simulated column density of CS is consistent with the observationally deduced fractional column densities, while the simulated column density of C$_2$S is lower than the observationally deduced upper limits on column densities. This results indicate that we have a good understanding of the chemical properties of CS and C$_2$S in the disk. We also investigated the influence of the C/O ratio on sulfur-containing molecules and found that the column densities of SO, SO$_2$, and H$_2$S near the central star are dependent on the C/O ratio. Additionally, we found that the $N$[CS]/$N$[SO] ratio can serve as a promising indicator of the disk's C/O ratio in the HD 163296. Overall, the disk of HD 163296 provides a favorable environment for the detection of sulfur-containing molecules.</description>

      <title>Probing the filamentary nature of star formation in the California giant molecular cloud</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.08004</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.08004v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recent studies suggest that filamentary structures are representative of the initial conditions of star formation in molecular clouds and support a filament paradigm for star formation, potentially accounting for the origin of the stellar initial mass function (IMF). Using Herschel imaging observations of the California giant molecular cloud, we aim to further investigate the filament paradigm for low- to intermediate-mass star formation and to better understand the exact role of filaments in the origin of stellar masses. Using the multiscale, multiwavelength extraction method getsf, we identify starless cores, protostars, and filaments in the Herschel data set and separate these components from the background cloud contribution to determine accurate core and filament properties. Both the prestellar core mass function (CMF) and the distribution of filament masses per unit length or filament line mass function (FLMF) are consistent with power-law distributions at the high-mass end, $\Delta N/\Delta {\rm log}M\propto M^{-1.4 \pm 0.2}$ at $M &gt; 1\,M_\odot$ for the CMF and $\Delta N/\Delta {\rm log} {M}_{\rm line} \propto {M}_{\rm line}^{-1.5\pm0.2}$ for the FLMF at $M_{\rm line} &gt; 10\,M_\odot {\rm pc^{-1}}$, which are both consistent with the Salpeter power-law IMF. Based on these results, we propose a revised model for the origin of the CMF in filaments, whereby the global prestellar CMF in a molecular cloud arises from the integration of the CMFs generated by individual thermally supercritical filaments within the cloud. Our findings support the existence a tight connection between the FLMF and the CMF/IMF and suggests that filamentary structures represent a critical evolutionary step in establishing a Salpeter-like mass function.</description>

      <title>Rotational spectroscopy of CH$_3$OD with a reanalysis of CH$_3$OD toward IRAS 16293$-$2422</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.08236v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We have started a measurement campaign of numerous methanol isotopologs in low-lying torsional states in order to provide extensive line lists for radio astronomical observations from an adequate spectroscopic model and to investigate how the intricate vibration-torsion-rotation interactions manifest themselves in the spectra of different isotopic species. After CD$_3$OH and CD$_3$OD, we turn our focus to CH$_3$OD, which is an important species for studying deuteration in prestellar cores and envelopes that enshroud protostars. Notably, deuteration is frequently viewed as a diagnostic tool for star formation. The measurements used in this study were obtained in two spectroscopic laboratories and cover large fractions of the 34 GHz--1.35 THz range. As done in previous studies, we employed a torsion-rotation Hamiltonian model for our analysis that is based on the rho-axis method. The resulting model describes the ground and first excited torsional states of CH$_3$OD well up to quantum numbers $J \leqslant 51$ and $K_a \leqslant 18$. We derived a line list for radio astronomical observations from this model that is accurate up to at least 1.35~THz and should be sufficient for all types of radio astronomical searches for this methanol isotopolog in these two lowest torsional states. This line list was applied to a reinvestigation of CH$_3$OD in data from the Protostellar Interferometric Line Survey of IRAS 16293--2422 obtained with the Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array. The new accurately determined value for the column density of CH$_3$OD implies that the deuteration in methanol differs in its two functional groups by a factor of $\sim$7.5.</description>

Abstract: We present a multi-wavelength analysis of the young star cluster Berkeley 59 (Be 59) based on the $Gaia$ data and deep infrared (IR) observations with the 3.58-m Telescopio Nazionale Galileo and $Spitzer$ space telescope. The mean proper motion of the cluster is found to be $\mu$$_\alpha$cos$\delta$ $\sim$ -0.63 mas yr$^{-1}$ and $\mu$$_\delta$ $\sim$ -1.83 mas yr$^{-1}$ and the kinematic distance of the cluster, $\sim$ 1 kpc, is in agreement with previous photometric studies. Present data is the deepest available near-IR observations for the cluster so far and reached below 0.03 M$_\odot$. The mass function of the cluster region is calculated using the statistically cleaned color-magnitude diagram and is similar to the Salpeter value for the member stars above 0.4 M$_\odot$. In contrast, the slope becomes shallower ($\Gamma$ $\sim$ 0.01 $\pm$ 0.18) in the mass range 0.04 - 0.4 M$_\odot$, comparable to other nearby clusters. The spatial distribution of young brown dwarfs (BDs) and stellar candidates shows a non-homogeneous distribution. This suggests that the radiation feedback from massive stars may be a prominent factor contributing to the BD population in the cluster Be 59. We also estimated the star-to-BD ratio for the cluster, which is found to be $\sim$ 3.6. The Kolomogorov-Smirnov test shows that stellar and BD populations significantly differ, and stellar candidates are near the cluster center compared to the BDs, suggesting mass segregation in the cluster toward the substellar mass regime.</description>

Abstract: We report a multi-wavelength study of the Wolf Rayet (WR) star: [KSF2015] 1381-19L, which is located in the solar metallicity region (Z=0.014) of the Milky Way Galaxy, strongly obscured by the interstellar dust. We perform a detailed characterization of the stellar atmosphere by fitting the spectral emission lines observed in the Optical and Near-InfraRed (NIR) bands, using CMFGEN. The best-fitted spectroscopic model indicates a highly luminous ($10^{5.89}L_{\odot}$) star with a larger radius ($15\,R_{\odot}$) and effective temperature, wind terminal velocity, and chemical composition similar to that of Galactic WC9-dusty (WC9d)-type stars. The atmospheric ionization structure shows coexisting ionization states of different elements, simultaneously affecting the opacity and thermal electron balance. Fitting of the spectral energy data (SED) reveals high interstellar optical extinction ($A_{V}=$ 8.87) while the IR extinction is found to be comparatively lower ($A_{K_{s}}=$ 0.98). We do not detect any excess emission at near-IR wavelengths due to dust. Upon comparison of our results with the GENEVA single star evolutionary models (Z=0.014), we identify the best possible progenitors ( a rotating star of $67\,M_{\odot}$ and a non-rotating star of $90\,M_{\odot}$).</description>

      <title>Cosmic-gamma-ray emission at low-luminosity from CCO 1E 1207.4-5209 and its Host SNR G296.5+10.0</title>

Abstract: The origin and acceleration mechanisms of energetic particles in the universe remain enigmatic in contemporary astrophysics. Recent efforts have focused on identifying Galactic sources capable of accelerating particles to 1 PeV, known as PeVatrons, and also identifying sources contributing to the spectrum at lower energies. The different morphology of galactic supernova remnants is directly related to the type of stellar explosion and the existence of a possible Compact Central Object (CCO), which possess intense radiativegravitational fields on their surfaces. These CCOs, due to their strong fields and interactions with surrounding magnetic clouds, are potential candidates for cosmic ray production. Through observations of the compact X-ray source 1E 1207.4-5209, located near the remnant G296.5+10.0, and using the enhanced GALPROP code, we analyze the emission of gamma-ray emission resulting from cosmic-ray acceleration and propagation. Additionally, we calculate the contribution of this association to the overall observed Galactic cosmic-ray flux, considering cosmic-ray propagation within the Galaxy, including energy losses and particle interactions. Our findings suggest that this setup offers a fertile environment for producing a wide range of cosmic-ray energies at low energy within the Galaxy.</description>

      <title>APPLE: An Evolution Code for Modeling Giant Planets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.14483</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.14483v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We introduce APPLE, a novel planetary evolution code designed specifically for the study of giant exoplanet and Jovian planet evolution in the era of Galileo, Juno, and Cassini. With APPLE, state-of-the-art equations of state for hydrogen, helium, ice, and rock are integrated with advanced features to treat ice/rock cores and metals in the gaseous envelope; models for helium rain and hydrogen/helium immiscibility; detailed atmosphere boundary tables that also provide self-consistent albedos and spectra; and options to address envelope metal gradients and stably-stratified regions. Our hope is that these purpose-built features of APPLE will help catalyze the development of the next generation of giant exoplanet and Jovian planet evolutionary models.</description>

      <title>The rotation-tunneling spectrum of 3-hydroxypropenal and confirmation of its detection toward IRAS 16293$-$2422 B</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.01338</link>

Abstract: 3-Hydroxypropenal (HOCHCHCHO) is the lower energy tautomer of malonaldehyde which displays a complex rotation-tunneling spectrum. It was detected tentatively toward the solar-type protostar IRAS 16293$-$2422 B with ALMA in the framework of the Protostellar Interferometric Line Survey (PILS). Several transitions, however, had large residuals, preventing not only their detection, but also the excitation temperature of the species from being determined unambiguously. We want to extend the existing rotational line list of 3-hydroxypropenal to shed more light on the recent observational results and to facilitate additional radio astronomical searches for this molecule. We analyzed the rotation-tunneling spectrum of 3-hydroxypropenal in the frequency regions between 150 and 330 GHz and between 400 and 660 GHz. Transitions were searched for in the PILS observations of IRAS 16293$-$2422. Local thermodynamic equilibrium (LTE) models were carried out and compared to the observations to constrain the excitation temperature. Additional transitions were searched for in other ALMA archival data of the same source to confirm the presence of 3-hydroxypropenal. More than 11500 transitions were assigned in the course of our investigation with quantum numbers $2 \le J \le 100$, $K_a \le 59$, and $K_c \le 97$, resulting in a greatly improved set of spectroscopic parameters. The comparison between the LTE models and the observations yields an excitation temperature of 125 K with a column density $N = 1.0 \times 10^{15}$ cm$^{-2}$ for this species. We identified seven additional lines of 3-hydroxypropenal that show a good agreement with the model in the ALMA archive data. The calculated rotation-tunneling spectrum of 3-hydroxypropenal has sufficient accuracy for radio astronomical searches. The detection of 3-hydroxypropenal toward IRAS 16293$-$2422 B is now secure.</description>

      <title>On the age distribution of Classical Cepheids in the Galaxy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.06228</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.06228v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We revisit the problem of the positive correlation between age and Galactocentric distance seen in Galactic Classical Cepheids, which at first sight is counter-intuitive in the context of inside-out galaxy formation. To explain it, we use the Besan\c{c}on Galaxy Model and a simulation of star particles in the Galactic disc coupled with stellar evolutionary models. We then select Classical Cepheids from this simulation and test in qualitative terms which ingredients are necessary to find agreement with the observational data. We show that the observed age vs. Galactocentric radius distribution in the Milky Way is a direct consequence of the disc's negative radial metallicity gradient (and, depending on the set of stellar models used, a metallicity dependence of the instability strip). The interplay of the metallicity gradient and the metallicity dependence of the Cepheids' life-time in the instability strip results in a pronounced positive age-Galactocentric distance relation. This renders a reconstruction of the recent star-formation history based on Classical Cepheids unlikely. It also has important consequences on our interpretation of the observed scatter about the radial metallicity gradient measured with Galactic Classical Cepheids.</description>
