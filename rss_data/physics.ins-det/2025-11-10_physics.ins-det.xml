      <title>A prototype neutron-detector array for future deep-underground s-process studies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.04724</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.04724v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We report a novel neutron-detection approach employing an EJ-309 liquid scintillator surrounded by six 3He proportional counters. Tests were performed at the FRANZ facility of the Goethe-University Frankfurt using the 7Li(p,n0)7Be reaction, producing neutrons across energies 50-720 keV. The scintillator's neutron energy quenching is determined, and its neutron/gamma-ray discrimination performance is evaluated. The lowest detectable neutron energy is 163 keV. EJ-309 - 3He counter neutron coincidences are compared with those from simulations. This array forms the prototype of a larger design, called scintillator-3He array for deep-underground experiments on the S-process, currently undergoing construction and testing for an upcoming deep-underground study of the 22Ne(alpha,n)25Mg reaction cross-section at the freshly-commissioned Bellotti Ion Beam facility of the INFN Laboratori Nazionali del Gran Sasso. This upcoming project is expected to achieve exceptionally low sensitivity for measuring the cross section at energies of interest for the astrophysical 'weak' and 'main' slow neutron-capture processes.</description>

      <title>Hardware-Accelerated GNN-based Hit Filtering for the Belle II Level-1 Trigger</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.04731</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.04731v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a hardware-accelerated hit filtering system employing Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) on Field-Programmable Gate Arrays (FPGAs) for the Belle II Level-1 Trigger. The GNN exploits spatial and temporal relationships among sense wire hits and is optimized for high-throughput hardware operation via quantization, pruning, and static graph-building. Sector-wise spatial parallelization permits scaling to full-detector coverage, satisfying stringent latency and throughput requirements. At a sustained throughput of 31.804 MHz, the system processes sense wire data in real-time and achieves detector-level background suppression with a measured latency of 632.4 ns while utilizing 35.65% of Look-Up Tables (LUTs), and 29.75% of Flip-Flops, with zero Digital Signal Processing (DSP) usage, as demonstrated in a prototype implementation for a single sector on an AMD Ultrascale XVCU190. Offline validation using Belle II data yields a background hit rejection of 83% while maintaining 95% signal hit efficiency. This work establishes hit-level GNN-based filtering on FPGAs as a scalable low-latency solution for real-time data reduction in high-luminosity collider conditions.</description>

      <title>Impact of the lead factor of neutron irradiation on the magnetic properties of RPV steels</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.04801</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.04801v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Materials used in nuclear reactors are constantly exposed to the effects of neutron irradiation, which leads to changes in their mechanical properties. In particular, the steels employed in reactor pressure vessels experience a reduction in the ductile-to brittle transition temperature. Given that the pressure vessel is a non-redundant component, understanding this phenomenon is of significant interest. In this work, we focus on studying the effects of accelerated irradiation by maintaining constant neutron fluence while varying neutron flux, which results in different lead factors. This approach enables the extrapolation of accelerated test results to real operational conditions of the reactor pressure vessels. In our study, we analyzed irradiated steels using three magnetic techniques. Each technique responds differently to the microstructural changes induced by irradiation, allowing for a better characterization of its effects on the material. Through DC magnetometry, the analysis of minor loops shows that the remanence, coercivity, and saturation of the steel depend not only on the fluence with which the material was irradiated but also on the irradiation rate, which means, more specifically, on the lead factor. The AC susceptibility technique shows that the response of the irradiated steel to the applied magnetic field increases with fluence but also with the lead factor. For the real part of XAC, there is an increase with the lead factor, while the imaginary component of XAC grows with the size of the nanoprecipitates. Finally, Barkhausen noise measurements show a clear increase in the RMS of the signal with the lead factor.</description>

      <title>Nuclear Ptychoscopy: A Ptychographic Framework for Nuclear Spectroscopy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.04924</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.04924v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Accessing both amplitude and phase of nuclear response functions is central to fully characterizing light-matter interactions in the X-ray-nuclear regime. Recent work has demonstrated phase retrieval in two-dimensional time- and energy-resolved spectra, establishing the feasibility of phase-sensitive nuclear spectroscopy. Here, we introduce Nuclear Ptychoscopy, a ptychographic framework that adapts algorithms from coherent diffractive imaging to nuclear spectroscopy, enabling reconstruction of the complex response function by exploiting redundancy in two-dimensional spectra. We develop three complementary reconstruction schemes tailored to distinct experimental scenarios: reconstruction with a known analyzer response, blind reconstruction, and reconstruction incorporating partial prior information. In parallel, we develop geometric analysis techniques that elucidate algorithmic behavior and contribute new tools to ptychography. The framework is validated through experimental data and simulations, demonstrating its versatility across diverse nuclear spectroscopy scenarios and bridging nuclear spectroscopy with ptychography. Beyond advancing quantitative nuclear spectroscopy, our framework opens new opportunities for metrology, coherent control, and quantum applications in the X-ray-nuclear regime.</description>

      <title>Optical studies of scintillation detectors for precision beta-energy measurements</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.05083</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.05083v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This work presents optical calculations and simulations for scintillation detectors used in precision measurements of beta-particle energy spectra. Particular attention is given to Cherenkov photons and the impact of the light detection efficiency in the detector ensemble. We present an approach to estimate this light detection efficiency from the measured energy resolution of a detector. This is essential for the inclusion of scintillation photons in optical tracking Monte-Carlo simulations. A method to account for possible saturation and cross-talk of silicon photo-multipliers is also discussed. The impact of these effects is quantified in terms of systematic shifts in the extraction of the Fierz interference term from measurements of beta-energy spectra using scintillator detectors.</description>

      <title>Design and performance of a xenon-based cryogenic heat pump demonstrator for future LXe observatories</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.05172</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.05172v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This manuscript details the development and characterization of a small-scale cryogenic heat pump demonstrator, a technology designed to enable high-flow xenon distillation systems for the removal of $^{222}\mathrm{Rn}$ in future liquid xenon observatories like the XLZD experiment. The heat pump demonstrator operates on a left-turning Clausius-Rankine cycle, utilizing xenon as phase-changing working medium. Two demonstration tests conducted at a nominal pressure of $3.3\,\mathrm{bar}$ and $4.3\,\mathrm{bar}$ showed stable operation through out the test. In both measurements the demonstrator achieved its designed cooling and heating power of $(124\pm8)\,\mathrm{Watt}$ and $(126\pm8)\,\mathrm{Watt}$ respectively, while consuming $(386\pm1)\,\mathrm{Watt}$ electrical power.</description>

      <title>$^{42}$Ar Production and Injection to a Liquid Argon Environment for Background Mitigation Studies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.05336</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.05336v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Atmosphere-sourced argon contains traces of $^{42}$Ar, whose $\beta^-$-decaying progeny $^{42}$K represents a significant intrinsic background for rare-event experiments using liquid argon (LAr) as detector or shielding medium. Understanding and mitigating this background is crucial for current and future large-scale detectors in neutrino and dark-matter physics. To enable controlled studies of $^{42}$K behavior and suppression techniques, $^{42}$Ar was produced by irradiating natural argon with 34 MeV $^{7}$Li$^{3+}$ ions at the Maier-Leibnitz-Laboratorium tandem accelerator, using beam currents of $101 \pm 5$ nA and $140 \pm 5$ nA, yielding $476 \pm 9$ Bq within two weeks, corresponding to a production rate of $\sim 1 \times 10^{6}$ atoms$\,$s$^{-1}$. The activated argon was injected into the one-ton SCARF cryostat, where two HPGe detectors monitored the subsequent $^{42}$K activity build-up. A time-dependent model describing $^{42}$Ar mixing and $^{42}$K equilibration in LAr yielded characteristic mixing time constants between one and two days. The established production and injection capability provides a reproducible platform for high-statistics $^{42}$K background studies, essential for developing and validating suppression strategies for next-generation LAr-based rare-event experiments such as LEGEND-1000.</description>

      <title>Modelling the Performance of Tritium Process Monitors from First Principles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.05340</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.05340v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Ionization chamber-based, in-line tritium process monitors play an important part in determining the behavior of a tritium system. The one-liter detection volume monitor has been characterized well through experiment and to respond linearly to tritium concentrations for the range of $1 {\mu}Ci/m^3$ to $1 Ci/m^3$. Additionally, it has been shown to behave nonlinearly for low voltage on the central anode and low pressure of the carrier gas. A computational model was developed from first principles that successfully describes the behavior of the one-liter monitor for each of these regimes. Predictions from the model are compared to previously-collected experimental data in order to determine validity and tune the model. The model will be expanded to incorporate additional detector geometries and designs in the future.</description>

      <title>Development and Characterization of MPGD-based Transition Radiation Detectors</title>

      <description>arXiv:2511.05453v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Transition Radiation Detectors (TRDs) are useful for electron identification and hadron suppression in high energy nuclear and particle physics experiments. Conventional wire-chamber TRDs face operational limitations due to space charge effects, motivating the replacement of the amplification stage with MicroPattern Gaseous Detectors (MPGDs). In this work, we explore different MPGD technologies - Gas Electron Multiplier (GEM), Micro-Mesh Gaseous Structure (Micromegas), and Resistive Micro-Well (microRWELL) - as alternative TRD amplification stages. We report on the design, construction, and in-beam characterization of three MPGD-based TRD prototypes exposed to 3-20 GeV mixed electron-hadron beams at the Fermilab Test Beam Facility (FTBF) and at the CERN SPS H8 beamline. Each detector consisted of a multi-layered radiator, an approximately 2 cm deep drift region, an MPGD amplification stage optimized for X-ray transition radiation detection in a 90%10% ratio of Xenon and CO2, and a two-dimensional readout. The GEM-based TRD prototype achieved a pion suppression factor of about 8 at 90% electron efficiency at FTBF, while the Micromegas-based prototype - with an added GEM preamplification layer - demonstrated improved gain stability and clear TR photon discrimination at CERN. The microRWELL prototype achieved stable operation but limited gain. Geant4-based studies confirmed the observed trends and highlighted the sensitivity of the TR yield to cathode material and radiator configuration. These studies represent the first in-beam measurements of Micromegas- and microRWELL-based TRDs, along with discussion of the performance capabilities of a triple-GEM-TRD. The results demonstrate the feasibility of MPGDs as scalable, high-rate amplification structures for next-generation TRD applications.</description>

      <title>Poissonian Analysis of Glitches Observed in the LIGO Gravitational Wave Interferometers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.05244</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.05244v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This work investigates the temporal distribution of glitches detected by LIGO, focusing on the morphological classification provided by the Gravity Spy project. Starting from the hypothesis that these events follow a Poisson process, we developed a statistical methodology to evaluate the agreement between the empirical distribution of glitches and an ideal Poisson model, using the coefficient of determination ($R^2$) as the main metric. The analysis was applied to real data from the LIGO detectors in Livingston and Hanford throughout the O3 run, as well as to synthetic datasets generated from pure Poisson distributions. The results show that while several morphologies exhibit good agreement with the proposed model, classes such as 1400Ripples, Fast Scattering, and Power Line display significant deviations ($R^2 \leq 0.6$), suggesting that their origins do not strictly follow Poissonian statistics. In some cases, a dependence on the detector or the observing run was also observed. This analysis provides a quantitative basis for distinguishing glitch classes based on their degree of "Poissonness", potentially supporting the development of more effective glitch mitigation strategies in gravitational wave detector data.</description>

      <title>Strain-engineered nanoscale spin polarization reversal in diamond nitrogen-vacancy centers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.05373</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.05373v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The ability to control solid-state quantum emitters is fundamental to advancing quantum technologies. The performance of these systems is fundamentally governed by their spin-dependent photodynamics, yet conventional control methods using cavities offer limited access to key non-radiative processes. Here we demonstrate that anisotropic lattice strain serves as a powerful tool for manipulating spin dynamics in solid-state systems. Under high pressure, giant shear strain gradients trigger a complete reversal of the intrinsic spin polarization, redirecting ground-state population from $|0\rangle$ to $|\pm 1\rangle$ manifold. We show that this reprogramming arises from strain-induced mixing of the NV center's excited states and dramatic alteration of intersystem crossing, which we quantify through a combination of opto-magnetic spectroscopy and a theoretical model that disentangles symmetry-preserving and symmetry-breaking strain contributions. Furthermore, the polarization reversal is spatially mapped with a transition region below 120 nm, illustrating sub-diffraction-limit control. Our work establishes strain engineering as a powerful tool for tailoring quantum emitter properties, opening avenues for programmable quantum light sources, high-density spin-based memory, and hybrid quantum photonic devices.</description>

      <title>An improved reliability factor for quantitative low-energy electron diffraction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.05448</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.05448v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Quantitative low-energy electron diffraction [LEED $I(V)$ or LEED $I(E)$, the evaluation of diffraction intensities $I$ as a function of the electron energy] is a versatile technique for the study of surface structures. The technique is based on optimizing the agreement between experimental and calculated intensities. Today, the most commonly used measure of agreement is Pendry's $R$ factor $R_\mathrm{P}$. While $R_\mathrm{P}$ has many advantages, it also has severe shortcomings, as it is a noisy target function for optimization and very sensitive to small offsets of the intensity. Furthermore, $R_\mathrm{P} = 0$, which is meant to imply perfect agreement between two $I(E)$ curves can also be achieved by qualitatively very different curves. We present a modified $R$ factor $R_\mathrm{S}$, which can be used as a direct replacement for $R_\mathrm{P}$, but avoids these shortcomings. We also demonstrate that $R_\mathrm{S}$ is as good as $R_\mathrm{P}$ or better in steering the optimization to the correct result in the case of imperfections of the experimental data, while another common $R$ factor, $R_\mathrm{ZJ}$ (suggested by Zanazzi and Jona) is worse in this respect.</description>

      <title>Identification of tau leptons using a convolutional neural network with domain adaptation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.05468</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.05468v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A tau lepton identification algorithm, DeepTau, based on convolutional neural network techniques, has been developed in the CMS experiment to discriminate reconstructed hadronic decays of tau leptons ($\tau_\mathrm{h}$) from quark or gluon jets and electrons and muons that are misreconstructed as $\tau_\mathrm{h}$ candidates. The latest version of this algorithm, v2.5, includes domain adaptation by backpropagation, a technique that reduces discrepancies between collision data and simulation in the region with the highest purity of genuine $\tau_\mathrm{h}$ candidates. Additionally, a refined training workflow improves classification performance with respect to the previous version of the algorithm, with a reduction of 30$-$50% in the probability for quark and gluon jets to be misidentified as $\tau_\mathrm{h}$ candidates for given reconstruction and identification efficiencies. This paper presents the novel improvements introduced in the DeepTau algorithm and evaluates its performance in LHC proton-proton collision data at $\sqrt{s}$ = 13 and 13.6 TeV collected in 2018 and 2022 with integrated luminosities of 60 and 35 fb$^{-1}$, respectively. Techniques to calibrate the performance of the $\tau_\mathrm{h}$ identification algorithm in simulation with respect to its measured performance in real data are presented, together with a subset of results among those measured for use in CMS physics analyses.</description>

Abstract: For self-triggered readout of SiPM sum signals, a waveform classification can aid a simple threshold trigger to reliably extract calorimetric particle hit information online at an early stage and thus reduce the volume of transmitted data. Typically, the ADC data acquisition is based on FPGAs for edge data processing. In this study, we consider look-up-table-based neural-networks and address challenges of binary multi-layer neural networks' layout, footprint, performance and training. We show that these structures can be trained using a genetic algorithm and achieve the inference latency compatible with dead-time free processing online.</description>

      <title>Further Characterization of the JadePix-3 CMOS Pixel Sensor for the CEPC Vertex Detector: in Dependence of Substrate Reverse Bias</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.22062</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.22062v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The Circular Electron-Positron Collider (CEPC), a proposed next-generation $e^+e^-$ collider to enable high-precision studies of the Higgs boson and potential new physics, imposes rigorous demands on detector technologies, particularly the vertex detector. JadePix-3 is a prototype Monolithic Active Pixel Sensor (MAPS) designed for the CEPC vertex detector. This paper presents a detailed laboratory-based characterization of the JadePix-3 sensor, focusing on the previously under-explored effects of substrate reverse bias voltage on key performance metrics: charge collection efficiency, average cluster size, and hit efficiency of laser. Systematic testing demonstrated that JadePix-3 operates reliably under reverse bias, exhibiting a reduced input capacitance, an expanded depletion region, enhanced charge collection efficiency, and a lower fake-hit rate. These findings confirm the sensor's potential for high-precision particle tracking and vertexing at the CEPC while offering valuable references for future iterational R\&amp;D of the JadePix series.</description>

      <title>Low Activity Tritium Detection in CCDs Using Deep Learning Techniques</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.00532</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.00532v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This study explores the use of charge-coupled devices (CCDs) for detecting low-energy beta particles from tritium decay - a critical signal for nuclear safety, nuclear nonproliferation, and environmental monitoring. We employ a dual approach utilizing both measured CCD data and detailed Geant4 simulations. Our analysis compares classical techniques with advanced deep learning methods, including convolutional neural networks (CNNs), autoencoders trained exclusively on tritium data, and preliminary studies on boosted decision trees (BDTs). The CNN, trained on mixed signal/background datasets, demonstrates superior classification performance, while the autoencoder shows the potential of unsupervised, background-agnostic strategies when background characteristics are poorly defined. These results highlight the excellent sensitivity achievable thanks to the background rejection made possible by information-rich CCD data, paving the way for improved portable tritium monitoring.</description>

      <title>TCT-based monitoring of LGAD radiation hardness for ATLAS-HGTD production</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.09187</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.09187v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Production of the High Granularity Timing Detector for the ATLAS experiment at High Luminosity LHC requires over 21000 silicon sensors based on Low Gain Avalanche Diode (LGAD) technology. Their radiation hardness is monitored as a part of the production quality control. Dedicated test structures from each wafer are irradiated with neutrons and a fast and comprehensive characterization is required. We introduce a new test method based on Transient Current Technique (TCT) performed in the interface region of two LGAD devices. The measurement enables extraction of numerous sensor performance parameters, such as LGAD gain layer depletion voltage, LGAD gain dependence on bias voltage, sensor leakage current and effective interpad distance. Complementary capacitance-voltage measurements and charge collection measurements with 90Sr on the same samples have been performed to calibrate the TCT results in terms of charge collection and define acceptance criteria for wafer radiation hardness in the ATLAS-HGTD project.</description>

      <title>Background stability and annual modulation test using PICOLON ultra-pure NaI(Tl) detector</title>

Abstract: The dark matter observation claimed by the DAMA/LIBRA experiment has been a long-standing puzzle within the particle physics community. NaI(Tl) crystals with radiopurity comparable to DAMA/LIBRA's are essential for adequate verification. Existing experiments using NaI(Tl) target have been hampered by the high radioactivity concentration of NaI(Tl) crystals. PICOLON experiment conducts an independent search for Weakly Interacting Massive Particles using highest purity NaI(Tl) crystals. In 2020, the NaI(Tl) crystal (Ingot#85) reached the same purity level as DAMA/LIBRA crystals. The DAMA/LIBRA group has stressed that verifying their signal requires high-purity NaI(Tl) crystals with long-term stability. Based on a six-month measurement, we have confirmed the long-term stability of its radiopurity. This stability provides a significant advantage for future efforts to adequately verify the DAMA/LIBRA result using NaI(Tl) crystal. In this paper, we present the background stability of purity in the Ingot#94 NaI(Tl) detector, which was produced using the Ingot#85 purification method, along with the first annual modulation search conducted by the PICOLON experiment.</description>

      <title>BabyMOSS stitched sensors: results of characterisation tests for ALICE ITS3 upgrade</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.01834</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.01834v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: During the Long Shutdown 3 (LS3, scheduled 2026-2030), the innermost 3 layers (Inner Barrel, or IB) of the present ALICE ITS2 will be replaced with large-area, flexible, stitched CMOS 65 nm sensors, arranged in 2 half-barrels of 3 half-layers each, in the framework of the ITS3 upgrade project. For the first time in a High Energy Physics experiment, such large-scale sensors will be bent into truly half-cylindrical shaped half-layers, requiring little mechanical support. This will also help lower the material budget: a reduction down to an average of 0.09% X$_{0}$ per layer is expected, benefitting ITS tracking and vertexing capabilities especially at low momenta.
  In the wafer yield and stitching assessment stage for ITS3 R&amp;D, test devices from the Engineering Run 1 (ER1) submission were developed, including the MOnolithic Stiched Sensors (MOSS) and smaller variants of them (babyMOSS). In particular, babyMOSS is a single Repeated Sensor Unit (RSU) of a MOSS device: the chip is $\sim14\times30$ mm$^{2}$ in size, and consists of 8 digitally read out pixel matrices (regions) arranged in 2 rows, i.e. half-units (HUs).
  BabyMOSS chip characterisation tests have been performed in laboratory and test beam environments. Laboratory tests include systematic functional scans to study the behaviour of front-end electronics over a range of different settings, whereas test beam measurements, under high-energy charged particle beams, were used to investigate the detection efficiency and spatial resolution.
  In this contribution, we will present the babyMOSS chip characterisation campaign, with a focus on recent test beam results. So far, babyMOSS test beam results have been consistent with full MOSS, and confirmed that babyMOSS devices meet the ITS3 requirements: a detection efficiency $&gt;99\%$, fake hit rate $&lt;10^{-6}$ hits per pixel and event, and a spatial resolution $&lt;6$ $\mu$m.</description>

      <title>Characterization of the H2M Monolithic CMOS Sensor</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.26741</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.26741v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The H2M (Hybrid-to-Monolithic) is a monolithic pixel sensor manufactured in a modified \SI{65}{\nano\meter}~CMOS imaging process with a small collection electrode. Its design addresses the challenges of porting an existing hybrid pixel detector architecture into a monolithic chip, using a digital-on-top design methodology, and developing a compact digital cell library. Each square pixel integrates an analog front-end and digital pulse processing with an 8-bit counter within a \SI{35}{\micro\meter}~pitch.
  This contribution presents the performance of H2M based on laboratory and test beam measurements, including a comparison with analog front-end simulations in terms of gain and noise. A particular emphasis is placed on backside thinning in order to reduce material budget, down to a total chip thickness of \SI{21}{\micro\meter} for which no degradation in MIP detection performance is observed. For all investigated samples, a MIP detection efficiency above \SI{99}{\%} is achieved below a threshold of approximately 205 electrons. At this threshold, the fake-hit rate corresponds to a matrix occupancy of fewer than one pixel per the \SI{500}{\nano\second}~frame.
  Measurements reveal a non-uniform in-pixel response, attributed to the formation of local potential wells in regions with low electric field. A simulation flow combining technology computer-aided design, Monte Carlo, and circuit simulations is used to investigate and describe this behavior, and is applied to develop mitigation strategies for future chip submissions with similar features.</description>

      <title>3D-printed components for electron-ion trapping: Tests of functionality and ultra-high vacuum compatibility</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.06537</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.06537v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We demonstrate the ultra-high vacuum compatibility of a microwave-driven electron trap and an atomic oven (for atomic beam generation) fabricated through 3D printing via Laser Powder Bed Fusion (L-PBF). The trap integrates into a coaxial microwave cavity, enabling stable, narrow-band, high-amplitude oscillations of the electric field at the electrodes. The design also supports simultaneous trapping of ions. The oven performs well in ultrahigh vacuum (UHV) environments without significant outgassing. In addition to achieving the UHV regime for 3D-printed components, pressure variations and their potential impact on electron-ion trapping experiments were investigated over a month. Our results show that experiments with electrons photodetached from trapped and laser-cooled ions are feasible with the trap and oven manufactured by the L-PBF method. These findings establish a foundation for future experiments in microwave detection and the study of low-energy ion-electron interactions at room temperature.</description>
