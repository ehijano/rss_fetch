      <title>Larmor radius effect on the control of chaotic transport in tokamaks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.15963</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.15963v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce a second-order gyro-averaged extension to a guiding-center transport model for test particles subject to an $\mathbf{E}\times\mathbf{B}$ drift in a tokamak. Using this approximation, we numerically investigate the influence of finite Larmor radius effects on the chaotic transport and the formation of transport barriers. For non-monotonic plasma profiles, we show that the twist condition of the system is violated along a curve, usually called shearless transport barrier, which, under non-equilibrium conditions, exhibits significant resilience to destruction, thereby inhibiting chaotic transport. We analyze bifurcation diagrams of the shearless barriers and escape rates to explore the impact of the Larmor radius on controlling chaotic transport while varying the amplitude of electrostatic perturbations. Our findings show that increasing the Larmor radius enhances the robustness of transport barriers, as a larger electrostatic perturbation amplitude is required to disrupt them. Additionally, even in the absence of transport barriers, we observe a decrease in chaotic transport with an increase in the Larmor radius.</description>

      <title>Characterization of the SCR-1 Stellarator Physics: Investigating Plasma Discharge, MHD Equilibrium Calculations, and O-X-B Mode Conversion Feasibility</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.16217</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.16217v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Stellarator de Costa Rica 1 (SCR-1) is a modular stellarator with a small aspect ratio that serves as a valuable research and training tool for plasma magnetic confinement. This study explored a new heating mechanism and the factors that influence it. The current state of the device and plasma discharge are initially presented. Subsequently, the measurement process was utilized to determine radial profiles of electron density and electron temperature using a single Langmuir probe, and the results were compared with theoretical predictions based on the particle and energy balance. Additionally, the VMEC code was employed to calculate magnetic flux surfaces with characteristics such as a low aspect ratio, low beta parameter, negative magnetic shear, and decreasing rotational transform along magnetic flux surfaces. The Mercier criterion was employed to conduct a linear stability analysis, which identified a magnetic well that played a crucial role in the linear stability of the majority of magnetic flux surfaces. Feasibility studies of electron Bernstein waves were conducted using the IPF-FMDC full-wave code, with input files generated from the device and known plasma characteristics. The results obtained from the IPF-FMDC full-wave code revealed that the O-X conversion percentage reached a maximum of 63 % when considering radiation reflection in the vacuum vessel. Significant effects of plasma curvature on the O-X wave conversion and normalized electron density scale length were observed, while the change in the SCR-1 heating position did not produce a significant impact. Three damping mechanisms affecting O-X conversion were studied, and one of the principal effects was the SX-FX conversion due to steep electron density gradient. Additionally, stochastic electron heating showed a low electron field amplitude, which is important for limiting the electron Bernstein wave propagation.</description>

      <title>MHD activity induced coherent mode excitation in the edge plasma region of ADITYA-U Tokamak</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.16301</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.16301v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we report the excitation of coherent density and potential fluctuations induced by magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) activity in the edge plasma region of ADITYA-U Tokamak. When the amplitude of the MHD mode, mainly the m/n = 2/1, increases beyond a threshold value of 0.3-0.4 %, coherent oscillations in the density and potential fluctuations are observed having the same frequency as that of the MHD mode. The mode numbers of these MHD induced density and potential fluctuations are obtained by Langmuir probes placed at different radial, poloidal, and toroidal locations in the edge plasma region. Detailed analyses of these Langmuir probe measurements reveal that the coherent mode in edge potential fluctuation has a mode structure of m/n = 2/1 whereas the edge density fluctuation has an m/n = 1/1 structure. It is further observed that beyond the threshold, the coupled power fraction scales almost linearly with the magnitude of magnetic fluctuations. Furthermore, the rise rates of the coupled power fraction for coherent modes in density and potential fluctuations are also found to be dependent on the growth rate of magnetic fluctuations. The disparate mode structures of the excited modes in density and plasma potential fluctuations suggest that the underlying mechanism for their existence is most likely due to the excitation of the global high-frequency branch of zonal flows occurring through the coupling of even harmonics of potential to the odd harmonics of pressure due to 1/R dependence of the toroidal magnetic field.</description>

      <title>Impact of electron trapping on stimulated Raman scattering under incoherent broadband laser light in homogeneous plasma</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.16332</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.16332v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Backward stimulated Raman scattering is a three-wave coupling instability requiring the matching of an incoming pump light wave to a scattered light wave and electron plasma wave. It can be harmful to laser-driven inertial confinement fusion because of the reflection of a part of incident laser flux and the generation of suprathermal electrons that preheat the fuel. It is believed that by increasing the laser bandwidth one can suppress the excitation of Raman scattering and mitigate its detrimental effects. It is demonstrated in this paper that using a broad bandwidth laser has little effect on stimulated Raman scattering in the kinetic inflation regime where Landau damping dominates, as the additional bandwidth allows the electron plasma wave to match a wider range of laser frequencies. As a result, plasma wave saturation and Raman backscattering levels remain high even when the laser bandwidth is much larger than the effective instability growth rate.</description>

      <title>Fast radio bursts as precursor radio emission from monster shocks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.15076</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.15076v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: It has been proposed recently that the breaking of MHD waves in the inner magnetosphere of strongly magnetized neutron stars can power different types of high-energy transients. Motivated by these considerations, we study the steepening and dissipation of a strongly magnetized fast magnetosonic wave propagating in a declining background magnetic field, by means of particle-in-cell simulations that encompass MHD scales. Our analysis confirms the formation of a monster shock as $B^2-E^2 \to 0$, that dissipates about half of the fast magnetosonic wave energy. It also reveals, for the first time, the generation of a high-frequency precursor wave by a synchrotron maser instability at the monster shock front, carrying a fraction of $\sim 10^{-3}$ of the total energy dissipated at the shock. The spectrum of the precursor wave exhibits several sharp harmonic peaks, with frequencies in the GHz band under conditions anticipated in magnetars. Such signals may appear as fast radio bursts.</description>

      <title>Application of Optical Stochastic Cooling in Future Accelerator Light Sources</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.16098</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.16098v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we propose to combine two promising research topics in accelerator physics, i.e., optical stochastic cooling (OSC) and steady-state microbunching (SSMB). The motivation is to provide a powerful radiation source which could benefit fundamental science research and industry applications. Our study shows that such a compact OSC-SSMB storage ring using present technology can deliver EUV light with an average power of kilowatt, and spectral flux $&gt;10^{20}$ phs/s/0.1\%b.w., which is four orders of magnitude higher than existing synchrotron sources. It is expected that the presented work is of value for the development of both OSC and SSMB.</description>

      <title>The role of meridional flow in the generation of solar/stellar magnetic fields and cycles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.16620</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.16620v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Meridional flow is crucial in generating the solar poloidal magnetic field by facilitating the poleward transport of the field from the decayed Bipolar Magnetic Regions (BMRs). As the meridional circulation changes with the stellar rotation rate, the properties of stellar magnetic cycles are expected to be influenced by this flow. In this study, we explore the role of meridional flow in generating magnetic fields in Sun and sun-like stars using STABLE, Surface flux Transport And Babcock-Leighton, dynamo model. We find that a moderate meridional flow increases the polar field by efficiently driving the trailing polarity flux toward the pole, while a strong flow tends to transport both polarities of BMRs poleward, potentially reducing the polar field. Our findings are in perfect agreement with what one can expect from the surface flux transport model. Similarly, the toroidal field initially increases with moderate flow speeds and then decreases after a certain value. This trend is due to the competitive effects of shearing and diffusion. Furthermore, our study highlights the impact of meridional flow on the cycle strength and duration in stellar cycles. By including the meridional flow from a mean-field hydrodynamics model in STABLE, we show that the magnetic field strength initially increases with the stellar rotation rate and then declines in rapidly rotating stars, offering an explanation of the observed variation of stellar magnetic field with rotation rate.</description>

      <title>Exploring relaxation dynamics in warm dense plasmas by tailoring non-thermal electron distributions with a free electron laser</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.04240</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.04240v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Knowing the characteristic relaxation time of free electrons in a dense plasma is crucial to our understanding of plasma equilibration and transport. However, experimental investigations of electron relaxation dynamics have been hindered by the ultra-fast, sub-femtosecond time scales on which these interactions typically take place. Here we propose a novel approach that uses x-rays from a free electron laser to generate well-defined non-thermal electron distributions, which can then be tracked via emission spectroscopy from radiative recombination as they thermalize. Collisional radiative simulations reveal how this method can enable the measurement of electron relaxation time scales {\it in situ}, shedding light on the applicability and accuracy of the Coulomb Logarithm framework for modelling collisions in dense plasmas.</description>
