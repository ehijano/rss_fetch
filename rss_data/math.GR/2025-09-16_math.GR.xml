      <title>On Bi-rotary Maps of Negative Prime Power Euler Characteristic</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.12687</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.12687v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A map is bi-orientable if it admits an assignment of local orientations to its vertices such that for every edge, the local orientations at its two endpoints are opposite. Such an assignment is called a bi-orientation of the map. A bi-orientable map is bi-rotary if its automorphism group contains an arc-regular subgroup that preserves the bi-orientation. In this paper, we characterize the automorphism group structure of bi-rotary maps whose Euler characteristic is a negative prime power.</description>

      <title>Dehn functions: computations, lower bounds, and the quasiisometric rigidity of $\rm{Sol}_5$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.12823</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.12823v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We establish distortion estimates in completely solvable Lie groups, using a sublinear bilipschitz retraction constructed by Cornulier, and interpolating between two theorems of Osin. This provides new lower bounds on Dehn functions. Our second main result is the quasiisometric rigidity of $\rm{Sol}_5$ and its lattices. Together with a theorem of Peng, a key tool for the rigidity is the complete list of Dehn functions and dimensions of asymptotic cones of all simply connected solvable Lie groups of exponential growth up to dimension $5$, which we compute using Cornulier and Tessera's results.</description>

      <title>A piecewise linear homeomorphism of the circle which is periodic under renormalization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2211.05825</link>
      <description>arXiv:2211.05825v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We demonstrate the existence of a piecewise linear homeomorphism $f$ of $\mathbb{R}/\mathbb{Z}$ which maps rationals to rationals, whose slopes are powers of $\frac{2}{3}$, and whose rotation number is $\sqrt{2}-1$. This is achieved by showing that a renormalization procedure becomes periodic when applied to $f$. Our construction gives a negative answer to a question of D. Calegari. When combined with work of the 2nd and 3rd authors, our result also shows that $F_{\frac{2}{3}}$ does not embed into $F$, where $F_{\frac{2}{3}}$ is the subgroup of the Stein-Thompson group $F_{2,3}$ consisting of those elements whose slopes are powers of $\frac{2}{3}$. Finally, we produce some evidence suggesting a positive answer to a variation of Calegari's question and record a number of computational observations.</description>

      <title>The average-case complexity of the Word Problem for groups of matrices over $\mathbb{Z}$ is linear</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.00948</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.00948v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We show that the Word Problem in finitely generated subgroups of $\textsf{GL}_d(\mathbb{Z})$ can be solved in linear average-case complexity. This is done under the bit-complexity model, which accounts for the fact that large integers are handled, and under the assumption that the input words are chosen uniformly at random among the words of a given length. Our result generalizes to matrices in $\textsf{GL}_d(R)$, where $R$ is a subring of $\mathbb{C}$, of finite rank over $\mathbb{Z}$.</description>

      <title>On a class of involutive Yang-Baxter groups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.06521</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.06521v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A group is called an involutive Yang-Baxter group (IYB-group) if it is isomorphic to the permutation group of an involutive, non-degenerate set-theoretic solution of the Yang-Baxter equation. This paper investigates finite soluble groups whose Sylow subgroups have nilpotency class at most two, addressing Ced\'{o} and Okni\'{n}ski's question~\cite{CedoOkninski2025} of whether such groups are IYB-groups. We establish that a finite soluble group with Sylow subgroups of class at most two is an IYB-group if its nilpotent residual is $\Q_8$-free. We also prove that a finite soluble group with Sylow subgroups of class at most two and Sylow $2$-subgroups isomorphic to $Q_8$ is an IYB-group.</description>

      <title>Products of Infinite Countable Groups Have Fixed Price One</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.08325</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.08325v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We prove that the product of any two infinite countable groups has fixed price one. This resolves a problem posed by Gaboriau. The proof uses the propagation method to construct a Poisson horoball process as a weak factor of i.i.d. Then, a low-cost graphing of this process is constructed by connecting the points of each horoball first, and then adding a percolation with small intensity. The connectedness of this graphing is ensured by proving that the resulting horoballs have the infinite touching property almost surely, if the metric and the other parameters of the construction are chosen carefully.</description>

      <title>Non-split sharply 2-transitive groups of bounded exponent</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.11958</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.11958v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We construct here the first known examples of non-split sharply 2-transitive groups of bounded exponent in odd positive characteristic for every large enough prime $p \equiv 3 \pmod{4}$. In fact, we show that there are countably many pairwise non-isomorphic countable non-split sharply 2-transitive groups of characteristic $p$ for each such $p$. Furthermore, we construct non-periodic non-split sharply 2-transitive groups (of these same characteristics) with centralizers of involutions of bounded exponent. As a consequence of these results, we answer two open questions about sharply 2-transitive and 2-transitive permutation groups. The constructions of groups as announced rely on iteratively applying (geometric) small cancellation methods in the presence of involutions. To that end, we develop a method to control some small cancellation parameters in the presence of even-order torsion.</description>

      <title>On the group cohomology of groups of the form $\mathbb{Z}^n\rtimes \mathbb{Z}/m$ with $m$ square-free</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.14569</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.14569v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We provide an explicit computation of the cohomology groups (with untwisted coefficients) of semidirect products of the form $\mathbb{Z}^n\rtimes \mathbb{Z}/m$ with $m$ free of squares, by means of formulas that only depend on $n$, $m$ and the action of $\mathbb{Z}/m$ on $\mathbb{Z}^n$. We want to highlight the fact that we are not impossing any conditions on the $\mathbb{Z}/m$-action on $\mathbb{Z}^n$, and as far as we know our formulas are the first in the literature in this generality. This generalizes previous computations of L\"uck-Davis and Adem-Ge-Pan-Petrosyan. In order to show that our formulas are usable, we develop a concrete example of the form $\mathbb{Z}^5\rtimes \mathbb{Z}/6$ where its cohomology groups are described in full detail.</description>

      <title>High dimensional hyperbolic Coxeter groups that virtually fiber</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.12906</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.12906v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper provides an iterative procedure for constructing hyperbolic Coxeter groups that virtually fiber over $\mathbb{Z}$ that is flexible enough to yield infinitely many isomorphism classes in each virtual cohomological dimension (vcd) $n\geq 2$. Our procedure combines results of Jankiewicz, Norin, and Wise with a generalization of a construction due to Osajda involving a new simplicial thickening process. We also give a topological argument showing that the vcd of the right-angled Coxeter groups produced by our construction increases by exactly one with each iteration, guaranteeing that our process produces examples of every vcd.</description>
