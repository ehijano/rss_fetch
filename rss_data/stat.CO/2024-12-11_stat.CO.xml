      <title>Emperical Study on Various Symmetric Distributions for Modeling Time Series</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.07194</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.07194v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study evaluated probability distributions for modeling time series with abrupt structural changes. The Pearson type VII distribution, with an adjustable shape parameter $b$, proved versatile. The generalized Laplace distribution performed similarly to the Pearson model, occasionally surpassing it in terms of likelihood and AIC. Mixture models, including the mixture of $\delta$-function and Gaussian distribution, showed potential but were less stable. Pearson type VII and extended Laplace models were deemed more reliable for general cases. Model selection depends on data characteristics and goals.</description>

      <title>Innovative Sentiment Analysis and Prediction of Stock Price Using FinBERT, GPT-4 and Logistic Regression: A Data-Driven Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.06837</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.06837v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This study explores the comparative performance of cutting-edge AI models, i.e., Finaance Bidirectional Encoder representations from Transsformers (FinBERT), Generatice Pre-trained Transformer GPT-4, and Logistic Regression, for sentiment analysis and stock index prediction using financial news and the NGX All-Share Index data label. By leveraging advanced natural language processing models like GPT-4 and FinBERT, alongside a traditional machine learning model, Logistic Regression, we aim to classify market sentiment, generate sentiment scores, and predict market price movements. This research highlights global AI advancements in stock markets, showcasing how state-of-the-art language models can contribute to understanding complex financial data. The models were assessed using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, F1 score, and ROC AUC. Results indicate that Logistic Regression outperformed the more computationally intensive FinBERT and predefined approach of versatile GPT-4, with an accuracy of 81.83% and a ROC AUC of 89.76%. The GPT-4 predefined approach exhibited a lower accuracy of 54.19% but demonstrated strong potential in handling complex data. FinBERT, while offering more sophisticated analysis, was resource-demanding and yielded a moderate performance. Hyperparameter optimization using Optuna and cross-validation techniques ensured the robustness of the models. This study highlights the strengths and limitations of the practical applications of AI approaches in stock market prediction and presents Logistic Regression as the most efficient model for this task, with FinBERT and GPT-4 representing emerging tools with potential for future exploration and innovation in AI-driven financial analytics</description>

      <title>Theoretical and Practical Limits of Signal Strength Estimate Precision for Kolmogorov-Zurbenko Periodograms with Dynamic Smoothing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.07735</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.07735v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This investigation establishes the theoretical and practical limits of signal strength estimate precision for Kolmogorov-Zurbenko periodograms with dynamic smoothing and compares them to those of standard log-periodograms with static smoothing. Previous research has established the sensitivity, accuracy, resolution, and robustness of Kolmogorov-Zurbenko periodograms with dynamic smoothing in estimating signal frequencies. However, the precision with which they estimate signal strength has never been evaluated. To this point, the width of the confidence interval for a signal strength estimate can serve as a criterion for assessing the precision of such estimates: the narrower the confidence interval, the more precise the estimate. The statistical background for confidence intervals of periodograms is presented, followed by candidate functions to compute and plot them when using Kolmogorov-Zurbenko periodograms with dynamic smoothing. Given an identified signal frequency, a static smoothing window and its smoothing window width can be selected such that its confidence interval is narrower and, thus, its signal strength estimate more precise, than that of dynamic smoothing windows, all while maintaining a level of frequency resolution as good as or better than that of a dynamic smoothing window. These findings suggest the need for a two-step protocol in spectral analysis: computation of a Kolmogorov-Zurbenko periodogram with dynamic smoothing to detect, identify, and separate signal frequencies, followed by computation of a Kolmogorov-Zurbenko periodogram with static smoothing to precisely estimate signal strength and compute its confidence intervals.</description>

      <title>A Bayesian Nonparametric Stochastic Block Model for Directed Acyclic Graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2301.07513</link>
      <description>arXiv:2301.07513v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Random graphs have been widely used in statistics, for example in network and social interaction analysis. In some applications, data may contain an inherent hierarchical ordering among its vertices, which prevents any directed edge between pairs of vertices that do not respect this order. For example, in bibliometrics, older papers cannot cite newer ones. In such situations, the resulting graph forms a Directed Acyclic Graph. In this article, we propose an extension of the popular Stochastic Block Model (SBM) to account for the presence of a latent hierarchical ordering in the data. The proposed approach includes a topological ordering in the likelihood of the model, which allows a directed edge to have positive probability only if the corresponding pair of vertices respect the order. This latent ordering is treated as an unknown parameter and endowed with a prior distribution. We describe how to formalize the model and perform posterior inference for a Bayesian nonparametric version of the SBM in which both the hierarchical ordering and the number of latent blocks are learnt from the data. Finally, an illustration with a real-world dataset from bibliometrics is presented. Additional supplementary materials are available online.</description>

      <title>Embrace rejection: Kernel matrix approximation by accelerated randomly pivoted Cholesky</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.03969</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.03969v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Randomly pivoted Cholesky (RPCholesky) is an algorithm for constructing a low-rank approximation of a positive-semidefinite matrix using a small number of columns. This paper develops an accelerated version of RPCholesky that employs block matrix computations and rejection sampling to efficiently simulate the execution of the original algorithm. For the task of approximating a kernel matrix, the accelerated algorithm can run over $40\times$ faster. The paper contains implementation details, theoretical guarantees, experiments on benchmark data sets, and an application to computational chemistry.</description>
