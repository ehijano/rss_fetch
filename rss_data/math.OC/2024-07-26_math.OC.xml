      <title>Pattern control via Diffussion interaction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.17514</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.17514v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We analyse a dynamic control problem for scalar reaction-diffusion equations, focusing on the emulation of pattern formation through the selection of appropriate active controls. While boundary controls alone prove inadequate for replicating the complex patterns seen in biological systems, particularly under natural point-wise constraints of the system state, their combination with the regulation of the diffusion coefficient enables the successful generation of such patterns.
  Our study demonstrates that the set of steady-states is path-connected, facilitating the use of the staircase method. This approach allows any admissible initial configuration to evolve into any stationary pattern over a sufficiently long time while maintaining the system's natural bilateral constraints. We provide also examples of complex patterns that steady-state configurations can adopt.</description>

      <title>Universal methods for variational inequalities: deterministic and stochastic cases</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.17519</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.17519v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we propose universal proximal mirror methods to solve the variational inequality problem with Holder continuous operators in both deterministic and stochastic settings. The proposed methods automatically adapt not only to the oracle's noise (in the stochastic setting of the problem) but also to the Holder continuity of the operator without having prior knowledge of either the problem class or the nature of the operator information. We analyzed the proposed algorithms in both deterministic and stochastic settings and obtained estimates for the required number of iterations to achieve a given quality of a solution to the variational inequality. We showed that, without knowing the Holder exponent and Holder constant of the operators, the proposed algorithms have the least possible in the worst case sense complexity for the considered class of variational inequalities. We also compared the resulting stochastic algorithm with other popular optimizers for the task of image classification.</description>

      <title>On the Relationship between $\Lambda$-poisedness in Derivative-Free Optimization and Outliers in Local Outlier Factor</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.17529</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.17529v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Derivative-free optimization (DFO) is a method that does not require the calculation of gradients or higher-order derivatives of the objective function, making it suitable for cases where the objective function is non-differentiable or the computation of derivatives is expensive. This communication discusses the importance of \(\Lambda\)-poisedness in DFO and the outliers detected by the Local Outlier Factor (LOF) on the optimization process. We discuss the relationship between \(\Lambda\)-poisedness in derivative-free optimization and outliers in local outlier factor.</description>

      <title>A Matheuristic Multi-Start Algorithm for a Novel Static Repositioning Problem in Public Bike-Sharing Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.17635</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.17635v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper investigates a specific instance of the static repositioning problem within station-based bike-sharing systems. Our study incorporates operational and damaged bikes, a heterogeneous fleet, and multiple visits between stations and the depot. The objective is to minimize the weighted sum of the deviation from the target number of bikes for each station, the number of damaged bikes not removed, and the total time used by vehicles. To solve this problem, we propose a matheuristic approach based on a randomized multi-start algorithm integrated with an integer programming model for optimizing the number of operatives and damaged bikes that will be moved between stations and/or the depot (loading instructions). The algorithm's effectiveness was assessed using instances derived from real-world data, yielding encouraging results. Furthermore, we adapted our algorithm to a simpler problem studied in the literature, achieving competitive outcomes compared to other existing methods. The experimental results in both scenarios demonstrate that this algorithm can generate high-quality solutions within a short computational time.</description>

      <title>Optimal Hessian/Jacobian-Free Nonconvex-PL Bilevel Optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.17823</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.17823v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Bilevel optimization is widely applied in many machine learning tasks such as hyper-parameter learning, meta learning and reinforcement learning. Although many algorithms recently have been developed to solve the bilevel optimization problems, they generally rely on the (strongly) convex lower-level problems. More recently, some methods have been proposed to solve the nonconvex-PL bilevel optimization problems, where their upper-level problems are possibly nonconvex, and their lower-level problems are also possibly nonconvex while satisfying Polyak-{\L}ojasiewicz (PL) condition. However, these methods still have a high convergence complexity or a high computation complexity such as requiring compute expensive Hessian/Jacobian matrices and its inverses. In the paper, thus, we propose an efficient Hessian/Jacobian-free method (i.e., HJFBiO) with the optimal convergence complexity to solve the nonconvex-PL bilevel problems. Theoretically, under some mild conditions, we prove that our HJFBiO method obtains an optimal convergence rate of $O(\frac{1}{T})$, where $T$ denotes the number of iterations, and has an optimal gradient complexity of $O(\epsilon^{-1})$ in finding an $\epsilon$-stationary solution. We conduct some numerical experiments on the bilevel PL game and hyper-representation learning task to demonstrate efficiency of our proposed method.</description>

      <title>Multicriteria Adjustable Regret Robust Optimization for Building Energy Supply Design</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.17833</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.17833v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Optimizing a building's energy supply design is a task with multiple competing criteria, where not only monetary but also, for example, an environmental objective shall be taken into account. Moreover, when deciding which storages and heating and cooling units to purchase (here-and-now-decisions), there is uncertainty about future developments of prices for energy, e.g. electricity and gas. This can be accounted for later by operating the units accordingly (wait-and-see-decisions), once the uncertainty revealed itself. Therefore, the problem can be modeled as an adjustable robust optimization problem. We combine adjustable robustness and multicriteria optimization for the case of building energy supply design and solve the resulting problem using a column and constraint generation algorithm in combination with an $\varepsilon$-constraint approach.
  In the multicriteria adjustable robust problem, we simultaneously minimize worst-case cost regret and carbon emissions. We take into account future price uncertainties and consider the results in the light of information gap decision theory to find a trade-off between security against price fluctuations and over-conservatism. We present the model, a solution strategy and discuss different application scenarios for a case study building.</description>

      <title>Periodic Exponential Turnpike Phenomenon in Mean-Field Stochastic Linear-Quadratic Optimal Control</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.17926</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.17926v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The paper establishes the exponential turnpike property for a class of mean-field stochastic linear-quadratic (LQ) optimal control problems with periodic coefficients. It first introduces the concepts of stability, stabilizability, and detectability for stochastic linear systems. Then, the long-term behavior of the associated Riccati equations is analyzed under stabilizability and detectability conditions.Subsequently, a periodic mean-field stochastic LQ problem is formulated and solved. Finally, a linear transformation of the periodic extension of its optimal pair is shown to be the turnpike limit of the initial optimal control problem.</description>

      <title>Recursive Optimal Stopping with Poisson Stopping Constraints</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.17975</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.17975v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper solves a recursive optimal stopping problem with Poisson stopping constraints using the penalized backward stochastic differential equation (PBSDE) with jumps. Stopping in this problem is only allowed at Poisson random intervention times, and jumps play a significant role not only through the stopping times but also in the recursive objective functional and model coefficients. To solve the problem, we propose a decomposition method based on Jacod-Pham that allows us to separate the problem into a series of sub-problems between each pair of consecutive Poisson stopping times. To represent the value function of the recursive optimal stopping problem when the initial time falls between two consecutive Poisson stopping times and the generator is concave/convex, we leverage the comparison theorem of BSDEs with jumps. We then apply the representation result to American option pricing in a nonlinear market with Poisson stopping constraints.</description>

      <title>Continuous time Stochastic optimal control under discrete time partial observations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.18018</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.18018v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This work addresses stochastic optimal control problems where the unknown state evolves in continuous time while partial, noisy, and possibly controllable measurements are only available in discrete time. We develop a framework for controlling such systems, focusing on the measure-valued process of the system's state and the control actions that depend on noisy and incomplete data. Our approach uses a stochastic optimal control framework with a probability measure-valued state, which accommodates noisy measurements and integrates them into control decisions through a Bayesian update mechanism. We characterize the control optimality in terms of a sequence of interlaced Hamilton Jacobi Bellman (HJB) equations coupled with controlled impulse steps at the measurement times. For the case of Gaussian-controlled processes, we derive an equivalent HJB equation whose state variable is finite-dimensional, namely the state's mean and covariance. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our methods through numerical examples. These include control under perfect observations, control under no observations, and control under noisy observations. Our numerical results highlight significant differences in the control strategies and their performance, emphasizing the challenges and computational demands of dealing with uncertainty in state observation.</description>

      <title>Computing an Aircraft's Gliding Range and Minimal Return Altitude in Presence of Obstacles and Wind</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.18056</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.18056v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the event of a total loss of thrust a pilot must identify a reachable landing site and subsequently execute a forced landing. To do so this, they must estimate which region on the ground can be reached safely in gliding flight. We call this the gliding reachable region (GRR). To compute the GRR, we employ an optimal control formulation aiming to reach a point in space while minimizing altitude loss. A simplified model of the aircraft's dynamics is used, where the effect of turns is neglected. The resulting equations are discretized on a grid and solved numerically. Our algorithm for computing the GRR is fast enough to run in real time during flight, it accounts for ground obstacles and wind, and for each point in the GRR it outputs the path to reach it with minimal loss of altitude. A related problem is estimating the minimal altitude an aircraft needs to glide to a given airfield in the presence of obstacles. This information enables pilots to plan routes that always have an airport within gliding distance. We formalize this problem using an optimal control formulation based on the same aircraft dynamics model. The resulting equations are solved with a second algorithm that outputs the minimal re-entry altitude and the paths to reach the airfield from any position while avoiding obstacles. The algorithms we develop are based on the Ordered Upwind Method and the Fast Marching Method.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.18081v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, we present composite Bernstein polynomials as a direct collocation method for approximating optimal control problems. An analysis of the convergence properties of composite Bernstein polynomials is provided, and beneficial properties of composite Bernstein polynomials for the solution of optimal control problems are discussed. The efficacy of the proposed approximation method is demonstrated through a bang-bang example. Lastly, we apply this method to a motion planning problem, offering a practical solution that emphasizes the ability of this method to solve complex optimal control problems.</description>

      <title>Block cubic Newton with greedy selection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.18150</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.18150v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A second-order block coordinate descent method is proposed for the unconstrained minimization of an objective function with Lipschitz continuous Hessian. At each iteration, a block of variables is selected by means of a greedy (Gauss-Southwell) rule which considers the amount of first-order stationarity violation, then an approximate minimizer of a cubic model is computed for the block update. In the proposed scheme, blocks are not required to have a prefixed structure and their size is allowed to change during the iterations. For non-convex objective functions, global convergence to stationary points is proved and a worst-case iteration complexity analysis is provided. In particular, given a tolerance $\varepsilon$, we show that at most ${\cal O}(\varepsilon^{-3/2})$ iterations are needed to drive the stationarity violation with respect to the selected block of variables below $\varepsilon$, while at most ${\cal O}(\varepsilon^{-2})$ iterations are needed to drive the stationarity violation with respect to all variables below $\varepsilon$. Numerical results are finally provided.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.18182v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider optimal control problems involving nonlinear ordinary differential equations with uncertain inputs. Using the sample average approximation, we obtain optimal control problems with ensembles of deterministic dynamical systems. Leveraging techniques for metric entropy bounds, we derive non-asymptotic Monte Carlo-type convergence rates for the ensemble-based solutions. Our theoretical framework is validated through numerical simulations on a harmonic oscillator problem and a vaccination scheduling problem for epidemic control under model parameter uncertainty.</description>

      <title>Network Relaxations for Discrete Bilevel Optimization under Linear Interactions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.18193</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.18193v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate relaxations for a class of discrete bilevel programs where the interaction constraints linking the leader and the follower are linear. Our approach reformulates the upper-level optimality constraints by projecting the leader's decisions onto vectors that map to distinct follower solution values, each referred to as a state. Based on such a state representation, we develop a network-flow linear program via a decision diagram that captures the convex hull of the follower's value function graph, leading to a new single-level reformulation of the bilevel problem. We also present a reduction procedure that exploits symmetry to identify the reformulation of minimal size. For large networks, we introduce parameterized relaxations that aggregate states by considering tractable hyperrectangles based on lower and upper bounds associated with the interaction constraints, and can be integrated into existing mixed-integer bilevel linear programming (MIBLP) solvers. Numerical experiments suggest that the new relaxations, whether used within a simple cutting-plane procedure or integrated into state-of-the-art MIBLP solvers, significantly reduce runtimes or solve additional benchmark instances. Our findings also highlight the correlation between the quality of relaxations and the properties of the interaction matrix, underscoring the potential of our approach in enhancing solution methods for structured bilevel optimization instances.</description>

      <title>What makes a steady flow to favour kinematic magnetic field generation: A statistical analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.17627</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.17627v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: To advance our understanding of the magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) processes in liquid metals, in this paper we propose an approach combining the classical methods in the dynamo theory based on numerical simulations of the partial differential equations governing the evolution of the magnetic field with the statistical methods. In this study, we intend to answer the following ``optimization'' question: Can we find a statistical explanation what makes a flow to favour magnetic field generation in the linear regime (i.e. the kinematic dynamo is considered), where the Lorenz force is neglected? The flow is assumed to be steady and incompressible, and the magnetic field generation is governed by the magnetic induction equation. The behaviour of its solution is determined by the dominant (i.e. with the largest real part) eigenvalue of the magnetic induction operator. Considering an ensemble of 2193 randomly generated flows, we solved the kinematic dynamo problem and performed an attempt to find a correlation between the dominant eigenvalue and the standard quantities used in hydrodynamics -- vorticity and kinetic helicity. We have found that there is no visible relation between the property of the flow to be a kinematic dynamo and these quantities. This enables us to conclude that the problem requires a more elaborated approach to ``recognize'' if the flow is a dynamo or not; we plan to solve it using contemporary data-driven approach based on deep neural networks.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.17749v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study opinion dynamics over a directed multilayer network. In particular, we consider networks in which the impact of neighbors of agents on their opinions is proportional to their in-degree. Agents update their opinions over time to coordinate with their neighbors. However, the frequency of agents' interactions with neighbors in different network layers differs. Consequently, the multilayer network's adjacency matrices are time-varying. We aim to characterize how the frequency of activation of different layers impacts the convergence of the opinion dynamics process.</description>

      <title>Fast convergence of the Expectation Maximization algorithm under a logarithmic Sobolev inequality</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.17949</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.17949v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: By utilizing recently developed tools for constructing gradient flows on Wasserstein spaces, we extend an analysis technique commonly employed to understand alternating minimization algorithms on Euclidean space to the Expectation Maximization (EM) algorithm via its representation as coordinate-wise minimization on the product of a Euclidean space and a space of probability distributions due to Neal and Hinton (1998). In so doing we obtain finite sample error bounds and exponential convergence of the EM algorithm under a natural generalisation of a log-Sobolev inequality. We further demonstrate that the analysis technique is sufficiently flexible to allow also the analysis of several variants of the EM algorithm.</description>

      <title>Optimal Assignment and Motion Control in Two-Class Continuum Swarms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.18159</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.18159v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider optimal swarm control problems where two different classes of agents are present. Continuum idealizations of large-scale swarms are used where the dynamics describe the evolution of the spatially-distributed densities of each agent class. The problem formulation we adopt is motivated by applications where agents of one class are assigned to agents of the other class, which we refer to as demand and resource agents respectively. Assignments have costs related to the distances between mutually assigned agents, and the overall cost of an assignment is quantified by a Wasserstein distance between the densities of the two agent classes. When agents can move, the assignment cost can decrease at the expense of a physical motion cost, and this tradeoff sets up a nonlinear, infinite-dimensional optimal control problem. We show that in one spatial dimension, this problem can be converted to an infinite-dimensional, but decoupled, linear-quadratic (LQ) tracking problem when expressed in terms of the respective quantile functions. Solutions are given in the general one-dimensional case, as well as in the special cases of constant and periodically time-varying demands.</description>

      <title>Solvability and optimal control of a multi-species Cahn-Hilliard-Keller-Segel tumor growth model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.18162</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.18162v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper investigates an optimal control problem associated with a two-dimensional multi-species Cahn-Hilliard-Keller-Segel tumor growth model, which incorporates complex biological processes such as species diffusion, chemotaxis, angiogenesis, and nutrient consumption, resulting in a highly nonlinear system of nonlinear partial differential equations. The modeling derivation and corresponding analysis have been addressed in a previous contribution. Building on this foundation, the scope of this study involves investigating a distributed control problem with the goal of optimizing a tracking-type cost functional. This latter aims to minimize the deviation of tumor cell location from desired target configurations while penalizing the costs associated with implementing control measures, akin to introducing a suitable medication. Under appropriate mathematical assumptions, we demonstrate that sufficiently regular solutions exhibit continuous dependence on the control variable. Furthermore, we establish the existence of optimal controls and characterize the first-order necessary optimality conditions through a suitable variational inequality.</description>

      <title>A Proximal DC Algorithm for Sample Average Approximation of Chance Constrained Programming</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2301.00423</link>
      <description>arXiv:2301.00423v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Chance constrained programming (CCP) refers to a type of optimization problem with uncertain constraints that are satisfied with at least a prescribed probability level. In this work, we study the sample average approximation (SAA) of chance constraints. This is an important approach to solving CCP, especially in the data-driven setting where only a sample of multiple realizations of the random vector in the chance constraints is available. The SAA is obtained by replacing the underlying distribution with an empirical distribution over the available sample. Assuming that the functions in chance constraints are all convex, we reformulate the SAA of chance constraints into a difference-of-convex (DC) form. Moreover, considering that the objective function is a difference-of-convex function, the resulting formulation becomes a DC constrained DC program. Then, we propose a proximal DC algorithm for solving this reformulation. In particular, we show that the subproblems of the proximal DC are suitable for off-the-shelf solvers in some scenarios. Moreover, we not only prove the subsequential and sequential convergence of the proposed algorithm but also derive the iteration complexity for finding an approximate Karush-Kuhn-Tucker point. To support and complement our theoretical development, we show via numerical experiments that our proposed approach is competitive with a host of existing approaches.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2310.10619v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we consider the signature-to-path reconstruction problem from the control theoretic perspective. Namely, we design an optimal control problem whose solution leads to the minimal-length path that generates a given signature. In order to do that, we minimize a cost functional consisting of two competing terms, i.e., a weighted final-time cost combined with the $L^2$-norm squared of the controls. Moreover, we can show that, by taking the limit to infinity of the parameter that tunes the final-time cost, the problem $\Gamma$-converges to the problem of finding a sub-Riemannian geodesic connecting two signatures. Finally, we provide an alternative reformulation of the latter problem, which is particularly suitable for the numerical implementation.</description>

      <title>The Anytime Convergence of Stochastic Gradient Descent with Momentum: From a Continuous-Time Perspective</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.19598</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.19598v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we study the stochastic optimization problem from a continuous-time perspective, with a focus on the Stochastic Gradient Descent with Momentum (SGDM) method. We show that the trajectory of SGDM, despite its stochastic nature, converges to a deterministic second-order Ordinary Differential Equation (ODE) in $L_2$-norm, as the stepsize goes to zero. The connection between the ODE and the algorithm results in delightful patterns in the discrete-time convergence analysis. More specifically, we develop convergence results for the ODE through a Lyapunov function, and translate the whole argument to the discrete-time case. This approach yields a novel anytime convergence guarantee for stochastic gradient methods. Precisely, we prove that the sequence $\{ x_k \}$ governed by running SGDM on a smooth convex function $f$ satisfies \begin{align*}
  \mathbb{P}\left(\text{for any $k$},\;f (x_k) - f^* \le C\left(1+\log\frac{1}{\beta}\right)\frac{\log k}{\sqrt{k}}\right)\ge 1-\beta \end{align*} for any $\beta$, where $f^*=\min_{x\in\mathbb{R}^n} f(x)$, and $C$ is a constant. Our contribution is significant in that it better captures the convergence behavior across the entire trajectory of the algorithm, rather than at a single iterate.</description>

      <title>Improved SQP and SLSQP Algorithms for Feasible Path-based Process Optimisation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.10396</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.10396v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Feasible path algorithms have been widely used for process optimisation due to its good convergence. The sequential quadratic programming (SQP) algorithm is usually used to drive the feasible path algorithms towards optimality. However, existing SQP algorithms may suffer from inconsistent quadratic programming (QP) subproblems and numerical noise, especially for ill-conditioned process optimisation problems, leading to a suboptimal or infeasible solution. In this work, we propose an improved SQP algorithm (I-SQP) and an improved sequential least squares programming algorithm (I-SLSQP) that solves a least squares (LSQ) subproblem at each major iteration. A hybrid method through the combination of two existing relaxations is proposed to solve the inconsistent subproblems for better convergence and higher efficiency. We find that a certain part of the dual LSQ algorithm suffers from serious cancellation errors, resulting in an inaccurate search direction or no viable search direction generated. Therefore, the QP solver is used to solve LSQ subproblems in such a situation. The computational results indicates that I-SLSQP is more robust than fmincon in MATLAB, IPOPT, Py-SLSQP and I-SQP. It is also shown that I-SLSQP and Py-SLSQP is superior to I-SQP for ill-conditioned process optimisation problems, whilst I-SQP is more computationally efficient than I-SLSQP and Py-SLSQP for well-conditioned problems.</description>

Abstract: The paper proposes another extension of the extremal principle. A new extremality model involving collections of arbitrary families of sets is studied. It generalizes the conventional model based on linear translations of given sets as well as its set-valued extensions. This approach leads to a more general and simpler version of fuzzy separation. The new model is capable of treating a wider range of optimization and variational problems.</description>

      <title>Auxiliary-Variable Adaptive Control Lyapunov Barrier Functions for Spatio-Temporally Constrained Safety-Critical Applications</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.00881v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Recent work has shown that stabilizing an affine control system while optimizing a quadratic cost subject to state and control constraints can be mapped to a sequence of Quadratic Programs (QPs) using Control Barrier Functions (CBFs) and Control Lyapunov Functions (CLFs). One of the main challenges in this method is that the QPs could easily become infeasible under safety and spatio-temporal constraints with tight control bounds. In our own recent work, we defined Auxiliary-Variable Adaptive CBFs (AVCBFs) to improve the feasibility of the CBF-based QP, while avoiding extensive parameter tuning. In this paper, we consider spatio-temporal constraints as finite-time reachability requirements. In order to satisfy these requirements, we generalize AVCBFs to Auxiliary-Variable Adaptive Control Lyapunov Barrier Functions (AVCLBFs) that work for systems and constraints with arbitrary relative degrees. We show that our method has fewer conflicts with safety and input constraints, and outperforms the state of the art in term of adaptivity and feasibility in solving the QP. We illustrate our approach on an optimal control problem for a unicycle.</description>

Abstract: In this article, we study a simplified version of a density-dependent first-order mean field game, in which the players face a penalization equal to the population density at their final position. We consider the problem of finding an equilibrium when the initial distribution is a discrete measure. We show that the problem becomes finite-dimensional: the final piecewise smooth density is completely determined by the weights and positions of the initial measure. We establish existence and uniqueness of a solution using classical fixed point theorems. Finally, we show that Newton's method provides an effective way to compute the solution. Our numerical simulations provide an illustration of how density penalization in a mean field game tends to the smoothen the initial distribution.</description>

Abstract: We present a new algorithm for solving linear-quadratic regulator (LQR) problems with linear equality constraints, also known as constrained LQR (CLQR) problems. Our method's sequential runtime is linear in the number of stages and constraints, and its parallel runtime is logarithmic in the number of stages. The main technical contribution of this paper is the derivation of parallelizable techniques for eliminating the linear equality constraints while preserving the standard positive (semi-)definiteness requirements of LQR problems.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.10107v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we formulate a two-player zero-sum game under dynamic constraints defined by hybrid dynamical equations. The game consists of a min-max problem involving a cost functional that depends on the actions and resulting solutions to the hybrid system, defined as functions of hybrid time and, hence, can flow or jump. A terminal set conviniently defined allows to recast both finite and infinite horizon problems. We present sufficient conditions given in terms of Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman-Isaacs-like equations to guarantee to attain a solution to the game. It is shown that when the players select the optimal strategy, the value function can be evaluated without computing solutions to the hybrid system. Under additional conditions, we show that the optimal state-feedback laws render a set of interest asymptotically stable for the resulting hybrid closed-loop system. Applications of this problem, as presented here, include a disturbance rejection scenario for which the effect of the perturbation is upper bounded, and a security scenario in which we formulate an optimal control problem under the presence of a maximizing attack.</description>

      <title>Accelerating Low-Rank Factorization-Based Semidefinite Programming Algorithms on GPU</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.15049</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.15049v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we address a long-standing challenge: how to achieve both efficiency and scalability in solving semidefinite programming problems. We propose breakthrough acceleration techniques for a wide range of low-rank factorization-based first-order methods using GPUs, making the computation much more efficient and scalable. To illustrate the idea and effectiveness of our approach, we use the low-rank factorization-based SDP solver, LoRADS, as an example, which involves both the classic Burer-Monterio method and a novel splitting scheme with a starting logarithmic rank. Our numerical results demonstrate that the accelerated GPU version of LoRADS, cuLoRADS, can solve huge-scale semidefinite programming problems with remarkable efficiency. By effectively leveraging GPU computational power, cuLoRADS exhibits outstanding performance. Specifically, it can solve a set of MaxCut problems with $10^7 \times 10^7$ matrix variables in 10 seconds to 1 minute each on an NVIDIA H100 GPU with 80GB memory, whereas previous solvers demonstrated the capability of handling problems of this scale, required at least dozens of hours per problem on CPUs. Additionally, cuLoRADS shows exceptional scalability by solving 1) a MaxCut problem with a $170 \text{ million} \times 170 \text{ million}$ matrix variable and 2) a Matrix Completion problem with a 20 million $\times$ 20 million matrix variable and approximately 200 million constraints, both in a matter of minutes.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.16088v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This is a note on the extension of the Benamou-Brenier formulation of optimal transport to nonlinear control affine systems on $\mathbb{R}^d$. They are the non-compact version of the author and collaborators' previous result on compact manifolds, stated here for the sake for completeness. Additionally, by using Bernard's Young measure based weak formulation of optimal transport, the results are established for cases not covered by previous works. Particularly, no assumptions are made on the non-existence of singular minimizing controls or the cost function being Lipschitz. Therefore, the existence of solutions to fluid formulation is established for general Sub-Riemmanian energy costs not covered by literature previously. The results also provide controllability of the continuity equation (using Borel measurable feedback laws) whenever the corresponding Kantorovich problem has a feasible solution, due to the established equivalence between the Kantorovich and Benamou-Brenier formulation.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.17413v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present a novel algorithm that fuses the existing convex-programming based approach with heuristic information to find optimality guarantees and near-optimal paths for the Shortest Path Problem in the Graph of Convex Sets (SPP-GCS). Our method, inspired by $A^*$, initiates a best-first-like procedure from a designated subset of vertices and iteratively expands it until further growth is neither possible nor beneficial. Traditionally, obtaining solutions with bounds for an optimization problem involves solving a relaxation, modifying the relaxed solution to a feasible one, and then comparing the two solutions to establish bounds. However, for SPP-GCS, we demonstrate that reversing this process can be more advantageous, especially with Euclidean travel costs. In other words, we initially employ $A^*$ to find a feasible solution for SPP-GCS, then solve a convex relaxation restricted to the vertices explored by $A^*$ to obtain a relaxed solution, and finally, compare the solutions to derive bounds. We present numerical results to highlight the advantages of our algorithm over the existing approach in terms of the sizes of the convex programs solved and computation time.</description>

Abstract: The paper concerns classical solution of path-dependent partial differential equations (PPDEs) with coefficients depending on both variables of path and path-valued measure, which are crucial to understanding large-scale mean-field interacting systems in a non-Markovian setting. We construct classical solutions of the PPDEs via solution of the forward and backward stochastic differential equations. To accommodate the intricacies introduced by the appearance of the path in the coefficients, we develop a novel technique known as the ``parameter frozen'' approach to the PPDEs.</description>

Abstract: We consider the problem of minimizing a continuous function given quantum access to a stochastic gradient oracle. We provide two new methods for the special case of minimizing a Lipschitz convex function. Each method obtains a dimension versus accuracy trade-off which is provably unachievable classically and we prove that one method is asymptotically optimal in low-dimensional settings. Additionally, we provide quantum algorithms for computing a critical point of a smooth non-convex function at rates not known to be achievable classically. To obtain these results we build upon the quantum multivariate mean estimation result of Cornelissen et al. 2022 and provide a general quantum-variance reduction technique of independent interest.</description>

Abstract: Most existing theoretical investigations of the accuracy of diffusion models, albeit significant, assume the score function has been approximated to a certain accuracy, and then use this a priori bound to control the error of generation. This article instead provides a first quantitative understanding of the whole generation process, i.e., both training and sampling. More precisely, it conducts a non-asymptotic convergence analysis of denoising score matching under gradient descent. In addition, a refined sampling error analysis for variance exploding models is also provided. The combination of these two results yields a full error analysis, which elucidates (again, but this time theoretically) how to design the training and sampling processes for effective generation. For instance, our theory implies a preference toward noise distribution and loss weighting in training that qualitatively agree with the ones used in [Karras et al. 2022]. It also provides perspectives on the choices of time and variance schedules in sampling: when the score is well trained, the design in [Song et al. 2020] is more preferable, but when it is less trained, the design in [Karras et al. 2022] becomes more preferable.</description>
