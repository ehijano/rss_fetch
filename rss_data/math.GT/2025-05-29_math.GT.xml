      <title>Ideal Triangulations and Once-Punctured Surface Bundles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.21798</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.21798v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A well-known result of Walsh states that if $\mathcal T^*$ is an ideal triangulation of an atoroidal, acylindrical, irreducible, compact 3-manifold with torus boundary components, then every properly embedded, two-sided, incompressible surface $S$ is isotopic to a spun-normal surface unless $S$ is isotopic to a fiber or virtual fiber. Previously it was unknown if for such a 3-manifold an ideal triangulation in which a fiber spun-normalizes exists. We give a proof of existence and give an algorithm to construct the ideal triangulation provided the 3-manifold has a single boundary component.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.22403</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.22403v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We describe an alternative way of computing Alexander polynomials of knots/links, based on the Artin representation of the corresponding braids by automorphisms of a free group. Then we apply the same method to other representations of braid groups discovered by Wada and compare the corresponding isotopic invariants to Alexander polynomials.</description>

      <title>Amalgamations along surfaces with boundary in a handlebody</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.22530</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.22530v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let M be a connected orientable 3-manifold, and F a compact connected orientable surface properly embedded in M. If F cuts M into two connected 3-manifolds X and Y, that is, M=X \cup_F Y, we say that M is an amalgamation of X and Y along F; and if F cuts M into a connected 3-manifold X, we say that M is a self-amalgamation of X along F. A characterization of an amalgamation of two handlebodies along a surface, incompressible in both, to be a handlebody was obtained by Lei, Liu, Li, and Vesnin. The case of amalgamation of two handelbodies along a compressional surface was studdied by Xu, Fang, and Lei. In the present paper, a characterization of an amalgamation and self-amalgamation of a handlebody to be a handlebody is given.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.22562</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.22562v2 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider the isometries of the complex hyperbolic bidisk, that is, the product space $\mathbb{H}^2_{\mathbb{C}} \times \mathbb{H}^2_{\mathbb{C}} $, where each factor $ \mathbb{H}^2_{\mathbb{C}} $ denotes the complex hyperbolic plane. We investigate the Dirichlet domain formed by the action of a cyclic subgroup $(g_1, g_2)$, where each $g_i$ is loxodromic. We prove that such a Dirichlet domain has two sides.</description>

      <title>Orientation Reversal and the Chern-Simons Natural Boundary</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.14441</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.14441v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We show that the fundamental property of preservation of relations, underlying resurgent analysis, provides a new perspective on crossing a natural boundary, an important general problem in theoretical and mathematical physics. This reveals a deeper rigidity of resurgence in a quantum field theory. We study the non-perturbative completion of complex Chern-Simons theory that associates to a 3-manifold a collection of $q$-series invariants labeled by Spin$^c$ structures, for which crossing the natural boundary corresponds to orientation reversal of the 3-manifold. Our new resurgent perspective leads to a practical numerical algorithm that generates $q$-series which are dual to unary $q$-series composed of false theta functions. Until recently, these duals were only known in a limited number of cases, essentially based on Ramanujan's mock theta functions, and the common belief was that the more general duals might not even exist. Resurgence analysis identifies as primary objects Mordell integrals: transforms of resurgent functions. Their unique Borel summed transseries decomposition on either side of the Stokes line is the unique decomposition into real and imaginary parts. The latter are combinations of unary $q$-series in terms of $q$ and its modular counterpart $\tilde{q}$, and are resurgent by construction. The Mordell integral is analytic across the natural boundary of the $q$ and $\tilde{q}$ series, and uniqueness of a similar decomposition which preserves algebraic relations on the other side of the boundary defines the unique boundary crossing of the $q$ series. This continuation can be efficiently implemented numerically. This identifies known unique mock modular identities, and extends well beyond. The resurgent approach reveals new aspects, and is very different from other approaches based on indefinite theta series, Appell-Lerch sums, and logarithmic vertex operator algebras.</description>

      <title>Bochner-type theorems for distributional category</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.21763</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.21763v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We show that in the presence of a geometric condition such as non-negative Ricci curvature, the distributional category of a manifold may be used to bound invariants, such as the first Betti number and macroscopic dimension, from above. Moreover, \`a la Bochner, when the bound is an equality, special constraints are imposed on the manifold. We show that the distributional category of a space also bounds the rank of the Gottlieb group, with equality imposing constraints on the fundamental group. These bounds are refined in the setting of cohomologically symplectic manifolds, enabling us to get specific computations for the distributional category and LS-category.</description>

      <title>Quantum traces for $SL_n$-skein algebras</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.08082</link>
      <description>arXiv:2303.08082v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We establish the existence of several quantum trace maps. The simplest one is an algebra map between two quantizations of the algebra of regular functions on the $SL_n$-character variety of a surface $\mathfrak{S}$ equipped with an ideal triangulation $\lambda$. The first is the (stated) $SL_n$-skein algebra $\mathscr{S}(\mathfrak{S})$. The second $\overline{\mathcal{X}}(\mathfrak{S},\lambda)$ is the Fock and Goncharov's quantization of their $X$-moduli space. The quantum trace is an algebra homomorphism $\bar{tr}^X:\overline{\mathscr{S}}(\mathfrak{S})\to\overline{\mathcal{X}}(\mathfrak{S},\lambda)$ where the reduced skein algebra $\overline{\mathscr{S}}(\mathfrak{S})$ is a quotient of $\mathscr{S}(\mathfrak{S})$. When the quantum parameter is 1, the quantum trace $\bar{tr}^X$ coincides with the classical Fock-Goncharov homomorphism. This is a generalization of the Bonahon-Wong quantum trace map for the case $n=2$. We then define the extended Fock-Goncharov algebra $\mathcal{X}(\mathfrak{S},\lambda)$ and show that $\bar{tr}^X$ can be lifted to $tr^X:\mathscr{S}(\mathfrak{S})\to\mathcal{X}(\mathfrak{S},\lambda)$. We show that both $\bar{tr}^X$ and $tr^X$ are natural with respect to the change of triangulations. When each connected component of $\mathfrak{S}$ has non-empty boundary and no interior ideal point, we define a quantization of the Fock-Goncharov $A$-moduli space $\overline{\mathcal{A}}(\mathfrak{S},\lambda)$ and its extension $\mathcal{A}(\mathfrak{S},\lambda)$. We then show that there exist quantum traces $\bar{tr}^A:\overline{\mathscr{S}}(\mathfrak{S})\to\overline{\mathcal{A}}(\mathfrak{S},\lambda)$ and $tr^A:\mathscr{S}(\mathfrak{S})\hookrightarrow\mathcal{A}(\mathfrak{S},\lambda)$, where the second map is injective, while the first is injective at least when $\mathfrak{S}$ is a polygon. They are equivalent to the $X$-versions but have better algebraic properties.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2311.07309v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we consider the non-singular extension problem for circle-valued Morse functions on closed orientable surfaces. The problem asks, given a circle-valued Morse function $f\colon M\to S^{1}$ on a closed orientable surface $M$, under what condition there exist a compact orientable 3-dimensional manifold $N$ with $\partial N = M$ and a submersion $G\colon N \to S^{1}$ such that $G|_{\partial N}=f$. We provide necessary and sufficient conditions for the existence of a non-singular extension of a circle-valued Morse function as the main theorem when a submersion on a collar neighborhood is given.</description>

      <title>Triangular decomposition of character varieties</title>

      <description>arXiv:1904.09022v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A marked surface is a compact oriented surface equipped with some pairwise disjoint arcs embedded in its boundary. In this paper, we extend the notion of character varieties to marked surfaces, in such a way that they have a nice behaviour for the operation of gluing two boundary arcs together. These stated character varieties are affine Poisson varieties which coincide with the Culler-Shalen character varieties when the surface is unmarked and are closely related to the Fock-Rosly and Alekseev-Kosmann-Malkin-Meinrenken constructions in the marked case. These Poisson varieties are the classical moduli spaces underlying stated skein algebras and share similar properties. In particular, stated character varieties admit triangular decompositions, associated to triangulations of the surface. We identify the Zariski tangent spaces of these varieties with some twisted groupoid cohomological groups and provide a generalization of Goldman's formula for the Poisson bracket of curve functions in terms of intersection form in homology.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.16261v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we study nonmaximal representations of surface groups in PU(2,1). In genus large enough, we show the existence of convex-cocompact representations of non-maximal Toledo invariant admitting a unique equivariant minimal surface, which is holomorphic and almost totally geodesic. These examples can be obtained for any Toledo invariant of the form 2-2g +2/3 d, provided g is large compared to d. When d is not divisible by 3, this yields examples of convex-cocompact representations in PU(2,1) which do not lift to SU(2,1)</description>
