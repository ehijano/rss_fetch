      <title>A Digital Twin Framework for Adaptive Treatment Planning in Radiotherapy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.14701</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.14701v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study aims to develop and evaluate a digital twin (DT) framework to enhance adaptive proton therapy for prostate stereotactic body radiotherapy (SBRT), focusing on improving treatment precision for dominant intraprostatic lesions (DILs) while minimizing organ-at-risk (OAR) toxicity. We propose a decision-theoretic (DT) framework combining deep learning (DL)-based deformable image registration (DIR) with a prior treatment database to generate synthetic CTs (sCTs) for predicting interfractional anatomical changes. Using daily CBCT from five prostate SBRT patients with DILs, the framework precomputes multiple plans with high (DT-H) and low (DT-L) similarity sCTs. Plan optimization is performed in RayStation 2023B, assuming a constant RBE of 1.1 and robustly accounting for positional and range uncertainties. Plan quality is evaluated via a modified ProKnow score across two fractions, with reoptimization limited to 10 minutes. Daily CBCT evaluation showed clinical plans often violated OAR constraints (e.g., bladder V20.8Gy, rectum V23Gy), with DIL V100 &lt; 90% in 2 patients, indicating SIFB failure. DT-H plans, using high-similarity sCTs, achieved better or comparable DIL/CTV coverage and lower OAR doses, with reoptimization completed within 10 min (e.g., DT-H-REopt-A score: 154.3-165.9). DT-L plans showed variable outcomes; lower similarity correlated with reduced DIL coverage (e.g., Patient 4: 84.7%). DT-H consistently outperformed clinical plans within time limits, while extended optimization brought DT-L and clinical plans closer to DT-H quality. This DT framework enables rapid, personalized adaptive proton therapy, improving DIL targeting and reducing toxicity. By addressing geometric uncertainties, it supports outcome gains in ultra-hypofractionated prostate RT and lays groundwork for future multimodal anatomical prediction.</description>

      <title>Harnessing the "Reactive Falling Effect" for rehabilitation and performance boosting</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.13959</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.13959v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present Logic Workout, a novel training method based on radical dynamic instability combining rolling, deformation and spring instability on small fitballs. By exploiting the "reactive falling effect", it re-engages innate balance mechanisms and forces real-time motor corrections, leading to better joint control, coordination, and movement precision. Preliminary results from a cohort of 18 participants show complete resolution of chronic pain, enhanced functional mobility, and surprising improvements in strength and performance -- challenging the belief that instability training impairs power output. We hypothesise that, by harnessing maximal instability, Logic Workout activates deep neuromuscular pathways and improve rehabilitation outcomes, training efficiency, and athletic performance.</description>

      <title>Contrast-Optimized Basis Functions for Self-Navigated Motion Correction in Quantitative MRI</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.19552</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.19552v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Purpose: The long scan times of quantitative MRI techniques make motion artifacts more likely. For MR-Fingerprinting-like approaches, this problem can be addressed with self-navigated retrospective motion correction based on reconstructions in a singular value decomposition (SVD) subspace. However, the SVD promotes high signal intensity in all tissues, which limits the contrast between tissue types and ultimately reduces the accuracy of registration. The purpose of this paper is to rotate the subspace for maximum contrast between two types of tissue and improve the accuracy of motion estimates.
  Methods: A subspace is derived that promotes contrasts between brain parenchyma and CSF, achieved through the generalized eigendecomposition of mean autocorrelation matrices, followed by a Gram-Schmidt process to maintain orthogonality. We tested our motion correction method on 85 scans with varying motion levels, acquired with a 3D hybrid-state sequence optimized for quantitative magnetization transfer imaging.
  Results: A comparative analysis shows that the contrast-optimized basis significantly improve the parenchyma-CSF contrast, leading to smoother motion estimates and reduced artifacts in the quantitative maps.
  Conclusion: The proposed contrast-optimized subspace improves the accuracy of the motion estimation.</description>

      <title>First Positronium Lifetime Imaging with Scandium-44 on a Long Axial Field-of-view PET/CT</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.13460</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.13460v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Purpose: 44Sc has been successfully produced, synthesized, labeled and first-in-human studies were conducted some years ago. The decay properties of 44Sc, together with being close to a clinical implementation, make it an ideal candidate for in vivo positronium lifetime measurements. In this study, we investigate the count statistics for ortho-positronium (oPs) measurements with 44Sc.
  Method: A NEMA image quality phantom was filled with 41.7 MBq of 44Sc dissolved in water and scanned on a commercial long-axial field-of-view PET/CT. Three-photon events were identified using a prototype feature of the scanner and dedicated software. The lifetime of oPs was determined in the phantom spheres and in 4x4x4 mm^3 voxels.
  Results: All measured oPs lifetimes are compatible, within the uncertainties, with the literature values for water. The oPs lifetime is 2.65+-0.50, 1.39+-0.20 and 1.76+-0.18 ns in the three smallest spheres of the phantom and 1.79+-0.57 ns for a single voxel in the central region of the largest sphere. The relative standard deviation in the background regions of the time difference distributions, i.e., for time differences smaller than -2.7 ns, is above 20% - even for voxels inside the phantom spheres.
  Conclusions: Despite the favorable physical properties of 44Sc, the count statistics of three-photon events remains a challenge. The high prompt-photon energy causes a significant amount of random three-photon coincidences with the given methodology and, therefore, increases the statistical uncertainties on the measured oPs lifetime.</description>
