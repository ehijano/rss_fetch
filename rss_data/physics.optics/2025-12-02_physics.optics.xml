      <title>3D space-variant modal deconvolution with computed point spread functions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.00225</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.00225v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Deconvolution is the most widely used aberration correction technique in microscopy, however most techniques assume that the aberrations are the same for each point in the image, which is rarely true. Methods for tracking spatially varying aberrations require burdensome calibration or computation, or require symmetries in the aberration patterns. Here, we expand on existing modal deconvolution methods to demonstrate 3D fluorescence deconvolution in imaging systems that exhibit no simple symmetry. Our method is based on a space-variant generalization of Richardson-Lucy deconvolution that makes use of ZEMAX\textsuperscript{\textregistered}-derived point spread functions without the requirement of guide stars or calibration measurements. We validate the performance of our method by applying it to snapshot multiplane imaging of both bead samples and biological specimens, and show that modal decomposition is a practical solution for deconvolving spatially varying aberrations that do not display clear symmetries.</description>

      <title>Hardware-aware Lightweight Photonic Spiking Neural Network for Pattern Classification</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.00419</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.00419v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: There exists a significant scale gap between photonic neural network integrated chips and neural networks, which hinders the deployment and application of photonic neural network. Here, we propose hardware-aware lightweight spiking neural networks (SNNs) architecture tailored to our photonic neuromorphic chips, and conducts hardware-software collaborative computing for solving patter classification tasks. Here, we employed a simplified Mach-Zehnder interferometer (MZI) mesh for performing linear computation, and 16-channel distributed feedback lasers with saturable absorber (DFB-SA) array for performing nonlinear spike activation. Both photonic neuromorphic chips based on the MZI mesh and DFB-SA array were designed, optimized and fabricated. Furthermore, we propose a lightweight spiking neural network (SNN) with discrete cosine transform to reduce input dimension and match the input/output ports number of the photonic neuromorphic chips. We demonstrated an end-to-end inference of an entire layer of the lightweight photonic SNN. The hardware-software collaborative inference accuracy is 90% and 80.5% for MNIST and Fashion-MNIST datasets, respectively. The energy efficiency is 1.39 TOPS/W for the MZI mesh, and is 987.65 GOPS/W for the DFB-SA array. The lightweight architecture and experimental demonstration address the challenge of scale mismatch between the photonic chip and SNN, paving the way for the hardware deployment of photonic SNNs.</description>

      <title>Observation of linear and nonlinear light trapping on topological dislocations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.00735</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.00735v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Topological dislocations in otherwise periodic lattices represent global structural defects that, nevertheless, typically leave the lattice periodicity intact far from the dislocation. Such dislocations arise in diverse physical systems ranging from crystalline solids, acoustic and photonic lattices and crystals to matter waves in optical lattices. Dislocations drastically affect the evolution of wave excitations in their vicinity, enabling novel mechanisms for trapping on topological defects and controlling the energy flow. Moreover, when combined with nonlinearity, such systems give rise to new types of self-sustained states of topological origin that have never been observed to date. Here we demonstrate experimentally, for the first time at optical frequencies, the waveguiding at various types of topological edge dislocations, resulting in the formation of localized photonic eigenstates with distinct and tunable shapes. Using femtosecond laser-writing techniques, we fabricated waveguide arrays with precisely tailored dislocation parameters, enabling full control over the degree of localization and internal structure of the associated modes. We further demonstrate both theoretically and experimentally that in the high-power regime, the families of thresholdless dislocation solitons bifurcate from such modes, which inherit shape diversity of their linear counterparts. Our results reveal a nontrivial interplay between nonlinearity and global lattice deformations and establish dislocation solitons as a new class of nonlinear topological states. They may stimulate the observation of new types of nonlinear states and interaction scenarios for excitations in nonlinear physical systems, where lattices with controllable global deformations can be created.</description>

      <title>Photonic chip-based Reconfigurable Radar Compound Jamming Signal Generator</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.00781</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.00781v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Microwave photonics (MWP) serves as a powerful bridge between the radio-frequency and optical worlds, unlocking unprecedented bandwidth and speed for critical information systems. Recently, MWP-based radar jamming has demonstrated significant potential in overcoming electronic bottlenecks; however, existing solutions rely heavily on bulky discrete components and generate deterministic symmetric waveforms that are vulnerable to advanced counter-countermeasures. Here, we break this status quo by demonstrating the first monolithic photonic chip-based reconfigurable radar compound jamming signal generator. Implemented on a compact 25 mm2 silicon photonic footprint, our system features high integration and electrical reconfigurability, supporting agile switching among four distinct jamming modes. Crucially, we introduce a composite jamming mechanism that exploits time-frequency coupling to break the inherent symmetry of traditional deceptive jamming, generating controllable asymmetric false-target clusters. The on-chip system exhibits an operating bandwidth exceeding 20 GHz and is capable of generating over 20 high-fidelity false targets simultaneously. This work establishes a fully functional platform combining broad bandwidth, multi-mode flexibility, and asymmetric deception, paving the way for miniaturized, intelligent photonic solutions in next-generation electronic warfare.</description>

      <title>Deep learning-based dynamic error correction and uncertainty estimation for digital twin-assisted fringe projection profilometry of rotating gears</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.00859</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.00859v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper presents a deep learning-based method for dynamic gear measurement and uncertainty estimation. A twin-system proposed on the Unity platform is utilized to flexibly generate diverse simulated datasets. This effectively addresses the scarcity of real-world gear measurement data and facilitates verification of network performance.The designed Concrete Dropout-Pixel wise Uncertainty Network integrates the Concrete Dropout mechanism for pixel-level uncertainty estimation. Two lightweight layers are employed in the output layer to enhance the spatial continuity of prediction results.During network training, a transfer learning strategy is adopted: the model is first pretrained with a small amount of three-phase-shifting (3-PS) data, then fine-tuned on the target gear measurement dataset. Experimental results demonstrate that, compared with the traditional three-step phase-shifting (3-PS) method, the proposed approach achieves significant improvements in phase prediction accuracy, three-dimensional reconstruction accuracy, dynamic error correction capability, and uncertainty estimation reliability.This work provides a practical and efficient technical solution for fringe projection-based dynamic gear measurement.</description>

      <title>Decomposition of the total wave aberration in generalized optical systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.00981</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.00981v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The increasing use of freeform optical surfaces raises the demand for optical design tools developed for generalized systems. In the design process surface-by-surface aberration contributions are of special interest. The expansion of the wave aberration function into field and pupil dependent coefficients is an analytical method used for that purpose. An alternative numerical approach utilizing data from the trace of multiple ray sets is proposed. The optical system is divided into segments of the optical path measured along the chief ray. Each segment covers one surface and the distance to the subsequent surface. Surface contributions represent the change of the wavefront that occurs due to propagation through individual segments. Further, the surface contributions are divided with respect to their phenomenological origin into intrinsic, induced and transfer components. Each component is determined from a separate set of rays. The proposed method does not place any constraints on the system geometry or the aperture shape. However, here we concentrate on near-circular apertures and specify the resulting wavefront error maps using an expansion into Zernike polynomials. Hence, for the first time additive surface Zernike contributions are obtained.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2512.00992v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the scintillation index of multi-wavelength Gaussian optical beams propagating through a turbulent optical channel. We consider a turbulent environment ranging from weak to strong, with a specific focus on the weak turbulent regime. Furthermore, the impacts of absorption and scattering effects are taken into account. It is shown here that the use of a multi-wavelength beam results in a reduction in the scintillation index, thereby enhancing the performance of the underwater optical link.</description>

      <title>Sub-second A-scan Acquisition Using Marginal Spectral-Domain Quantum Optical Coherence Tomography</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.01110</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.01110v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We report an optimized implementation of spectral-domain quantum optical coherence tomography (SD-QOCT) capable of acquiring axial scans (A-scans) of multilayer samples without in the absence of mechanical scanning, at an unprecedented speed. We demonstrate a proof-of-concept system that integrates a diffraction grating, a high-resolution intensified CCD camera, and a high-flux photon-pair source operating in the VIS-NIR region (810 nm). This configuration enables the acquisition of an entire marginal SD-QOCT interferogram in a single camera exposure, yielding a transverse A-scan with a record acquisition time of 100 ms and a penetration depth of 4 mm. The measured interferometric response shows excellent agreement with the theoretical model. These results represent a decisive step toward the practical deployment of SD-QOCT as a competitive imaging modality for biomedical applications.</description>

      <title>Metasurface Holography on a Relative-Phase Manifold for Stable and High Fidelity Tweezer-Array Generation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.01180</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.01180v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a new holographic approach for generating large scale, polarization resolved optical tweezer arrays. By analyzing the ideal Jones fields that realize a target pattern, we identify that the fundamental degrees of freedom are the relative phases of the individual tweezers, rather than the full spatial phase profile. Leveraging this insight, we formulate a reverse projection optimization that adjusts only a small set of phase parameters to approximate the ideal operator within the physical constraints of a metasurface. This produces significantly higher fidelity and robustness than Gerchberg_Saxton type algorithms. Experimentally, we demonstrate H, V, L, and R polarized tweezer arrays using a single layer metasurface. A key advantage of our method is its phase stability, yielding strong resistance to optical aberrations and enabling coherent global phase modulation such as forming vortex tweezer lattice, without degrading trap quality. This framework provides a conceptually clear and experimentally powerful route for scalable optical field synthesis.</description>

      <title>Near-field perturbation of laser filament enabling simultaneous far-field THz diagnosis and broadband calculus processing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.01215</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.01215v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Terahertz (THz) wave manipulation based on laser filaments-plasma channels formed by femtosecond laser-induced air ionization-has emerged as a promising platform for free-space THz applications. However, in-situ characterization of the spatially confined THz modes within filaments faces significant challenges due to the plasma's ultra-high intensity, which not only hinders direct near-field probing but also limits reliance on indirect far-field reconstruction. Here, we introduce a non-invasive near-field modulation scheme where a metal plate approaches the filament at submillimeter distances (comparable to THz wavelengths), perturbing the dielectric environment to convert the symmetric annular THz mode into an asymmetric state. This controlled transition enables far-field detection of broadband calculus behaviors (first- and second-order differentiation/integration) on time-domain THz waveforms and characteristic spectral transfer functions with 1/f, 1/f^2, f or f^2 dependency (where f is the THz frequency), thereby diagnosing the near-field THz mode confinement. Hence, the proposed approach synergizes near-field modulation efficiency with far-field detection robustness, advancing fundamental understanding of plasma-THz interactions and enabling novel all-optical signal processing for filament-based THz technologies.</description>

      <title>Programmable Switching of Molecular Transitions via Plasmonic Toroidal Nanoantennae</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.01303</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.01303v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The ability to switch and program molecular transitions via deterministically located plasmonic nanoantennae presents opportunities for wide spectrum of applications from biosensors to quantum computing. Due to its topology, toroidal nanoantenna (TNA) focuses immense amount of three-dimensional (3D) local electric field by toroidal moment while allowing pre and post positioning around quantum emitters (QEs). Here, we report complete switching of molecular transition energies of quantum objects (QOs) with modulation depth of 99.9% over 2840-fold radiative enhancement. At optimized TNA geometries, Fano interference between the broadband plasmonic continuum and narrow quantum transitions of QOs suppresses both radiative and non-radiative decay channels near 850 nm, yielding an observable full switching that traps energy within the hybrid mode instead of re-emitting it. To show the promises of the concept, we further demonstrate systems with multiple QOs where spectral degeneracy enhances the transparency bandwidth, while detuning generates distinct minima, enabling individually addressable spectral responses. These results establish plasmonic TNA as a promising architecture for spectral detection of single or multi-molecule configurations with high sensitivity and empowers the user for the implementation of quantum mode switches to be used in photonic processing.</description>

      <title>Molecular Photonics Meets OLED Technology: The Untapped Potential of Lanthanide Emitters</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.01375</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.01375v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Lanthanide-based emitters are attracting increasing interest for their potential in high-performance OLEDs due to their narrow emission bands, high photostability, and functional versatility. However, their low radiative rates and poor charge transport properties remain key challenges for efficient device integration. Here, we report the design, synthesis, and characterization of dual-emissive Eu3+ - Yb3+ coordination compounds that exhibit temperature-dependent luminescence intensity ratios (LIR) between the visible and near-infrared regions. These materials enable simultaneous optical thermometry and electroluminescence, with LIR values showing excellent agreement with external thermocouple measurements over a broad temperature range. OLED devices incorporating these complexes demonstrate stable operation, and their luminescence properties are further enhanced by integration with engineered plasmonic metasurfaces. This integration leads to a significant increase in emission directionality and a reduction of the excited-state lifetime via Purcell enhancement, without compromising spectral integrity. Our findings highlight the promise of lanthanide-based coordination compounds as multifunctional emitters for next-generation optoelectronic devices and suggest new pathways toward intelligent OLED architectures with integrated sensing and directional control.</description>

      <title>Extension of interferometric particle imaging to small ice-crystal sizes using the Discrete Dipole Approximation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.01393</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.01393v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Interferometric Particle Imaging (IPI) is a powerful technique to characterize aerosol particles, which so far has been applied only to particles larger than about 100 wavelengths. We extend its applicability to smaller ice crystals, combining rigorous modelling of particle shapes with the Phase Field Modelling and light-scattering simulations with the Discrete Dipole Approximation (DDA). Even for particles with the largest dimension of 11.5 wavelengths (and the smallest one comparable to the wavelength), the 2D Fourier transform of the interferometric image remains linked to the 2D autocorrelation of the particle shape at various viewing angles, validating the general measurement principle. However, the sensor must necessarily have wide viewing angle, which complicates interpretation of apparent particle shape, when such particles are observed from the edge. IPI is, thus, shown to be a powerful optical technology for characterizing ice particles down to a few micrometers in the atmosphere. Meanwhile, DDA is a versatile method for such synthetic experiments and can further supply large datasets for development of various inversion methods.</description>

      <title>Modeling high-order harmonic generation in quantum dots using a real-space tight-binding approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.01399</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.01399v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recently, the size-dependence of high-order harmonic generation (HHG) in quantum dots has been investigated experimentally. In particular, for longer driving wavelengths and QDs smaller than 3\,nm, HHG was strongly suppressed, however, there is no computational model capable of describing the strong-field response of such systems. In this work, we introduce a computationally efficient three-dimensional real-space tight-binding model specifically designed for the simulation of HHG in confined systems. The model parameters are meticulously derived from density functional theory (DFT) calculations for the semiconductor bulk, followed by a process of Wannierization. Our findings demonstrate that the proposed model accurately captures the observed dependency of the HHG yield on the quantum dot size. Additionally, we simulate the HHG yield for elliptically polarized pulses for different QD-sizes and driving wavelengths up to $5\,\mu{\mathrm{m}}$. The herein proposed model fills the theoretical void in simulating HHG within medium-sized nanostructures, which cannot be described by methods applied for periodic solids or small molecules or atoms.</description>

      <title>Effects of thermal annealing and film thickness on the structural and optical properties of indium-tin-oxide thin films</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.01441</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.01441v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Indium-tin oxide (ITO) has been leveraged as a crucial functional layer in the optoelectronic frameworks, such as non-volatile color display thin films based on the ITO/phase-change material (PCM)/ITO/reflective metal multilayer structures on a silicon substrate. In addition to non-volatile color tuning by PCMs, phase transition of ITO may pose a substantial impact on display performances. Yet, a comprehensive colormap of ITO thin films as functions of annealing temperature and film thickness is missing. In this work, we systematically investigate properties of ITO films based on X-ray diffraction, spectroscopic ellipsometry and ultraviolet-visible spectrophotometry measurements. We provide a colormap of the ITO/platinum/silicon structure in terms of the annealing temperature (150-350 {\deg}C) and thickness (5-100 nm) for the non-volatile color display, and we observe strong color changes under 250 {\deg}C annealing treatment for the 50-nm and 100-nm-thick ITO films. We suggest that the intrinsic change in colors of the ITO functional thin-film layers should also be taken into account, when the PCM-based reconfigurable color devices are used in practice.</description>

      <title>All-optical directional switching of non-thermal photocurrents in plasmonic nanocircuits</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.01480</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.01480v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Controlling the flow of electricity in metallic circuits with light is a key goal for future optoelectronics. In this work, we demonstrate all-optical generation and directional control of non-thermal drift photocurrents in a plasmonic gold wire. We attribute this phenomenon to the Inverse Faraday Effect and show that the current's direction can be precisely reversed at a subwavelength scale by tailoring the incident light's polarization or laser beam position. A bespoke polarization modulation technique is employed to unambiguously separate ultrafast drift currents from the ubiquitous photothermal background. We further reveal a collaborative mechanism where macroscopic thermal gradients, acting as a driving force, are used to extract and remotely detect the locally-generated nanoscale photocurrents. This robust control and detection scheme paves the way for reconfigurable, all-optical nanocircuitry capable of ultrafast on-chip processing.</description>

      <title>Near-infrared polarimetric imaging with nonlinear flat-optics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.01525</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.01525v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A compact and broadband polarimetric imaging platform is presented, based on second-harmonic generation (SHG) in nonlinear flat-optics. The system employs periodic all-dielectric AlGaAs gratings to induce polarization-dependent SH emission, enabling pixel by pixel direct retrieval of the full Stokes vector from an input intensity distribution in the near-infrared range. By engineering the geometry and orientation of the polarimetric units, sensitivity to linear and circular polarization components is achieved. A superpixel design comprising four polarimetric structures allows accurate reconstruction of the polarization state without moving parts or sequential measurements. This approach offers a scalable, passive, and cost-effective solution for polarimetric imaging, particularly suited for near-infrared applications.</description>

      <title>Unsupervised and Supervised Algorithms for Identification of Sample Pixels in FTIR Images</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.01585</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.01585v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Mid-InfraRed spectroscopy is a promising label-free technique that can offer insights into morphological and pathological alterations in biological tissues at the molecular level. Owing to the development of the Fourier Transform InfraRed (FTIR) spectrometer, combined with scanning devices, FTIR images can be produced by simultaneously acquiring spectral data from multiple spatial points, generating comprehensive chemical maps. In the data pre-processing, the identification of the sample pixels, with the background pixels excluded, is important for further effective feature extraction in FTIR images. Here, we present three algorithms realized in unsupervised and supervised approaches for the identification of the sample pixels. The algorithms demonstrate accurate prediction results of the sample and background pixels, and the supervised method further enables the automatic detection. These findings highlight thorough and robust solutions to the sample pixels detection problem in FTIR images, contributing to the FTIR signal processing and future research with FTIR images.</description>

      <title>Orbit-orbit photonics: Harnessing vortex-trajectory interplay for light manipulation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.01632</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.01632v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Light can carry a spin angular momentum, an intrinsic and extrinsic orbital angular momentum, associated with a circular polarization, optical vortex beams, and varying beam trajectories, respectively. The interplay between these momenta yields the spin-orbit interaction of light, in which the spin (circular polarization) controls the spatial (orbital) degrees of freedom of light: either the extrinsic (trajectory) or the intrinsic orbital angular momentum (vortex). While the well-known spin-orbit interaction of light plays a crucial role in nano-optics by providing spin-controlled light manipulation, the interaction between the intrinsic and the extrinsic orbital angular momentum - the orbit-orbit interaction of light - has remained elusive. In this interplay, the helical phase fronts of optical vortices control the spatial trajectory of light, giving rise to vortex-dependent shifts of optical beams. We report the orbit-orbit interaction of light in a plasmonic ellipse cavity, whose unique geometry facilitates the interplay when a vortex is considered in one of the foci of the ellipse. In this configuration, the orbit-orbit interaction is achieved by the interplay between the vortex of the source and the ellipse-induced transverse shift of the source beam, positioned at one of the focal points - thus inducing transverse vortex-dependent shifts at the second focal point. Strikingly, the orbit-orbit interaction of light significantly enhances the toolbox available for controlling light by leveraging the manifold orbital angular momentum states for vortex-controlled light manipulation - in contrast to light manipulation based on the spin-orbit interaction, which exploits the binary polarization helicity.</description>

      <title>Transient laser-induced periodic surface structures revealed by time-resolved EUV diffuse scattering</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.01696</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.01696v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The formation of permanent laser-induced periodic surface structures (LIPSS) on solid surfaces under impulsive laser irradiation above the damage threshold has been subject of extensive research. We demonstrate the formation of transient surface displacement patterns under femtosecond laser irradiation at fluences well below this threshold. Time-resolved extreme ultraviolet scattering measurements reveal distinct reciprocal-space features similar to those observed for permanent LIPSS but dissipating on the hundreds-of-picoseconds time scale. We show that the transient surface displacement patterns responsible for these features are produced via thermal expansion by the spatial modulation of absorbed laser intensity caused by scattering of the laser radiation by surface roughness and present a model accounting for the experimental observations. We suggest that our experiment revealed a universal phenomenon that will be observed on any strongly absorbing material under ultrafast laser irradiation.</description>

      <title>Approaching the Low Optical Loss Limit of Plasmonics using Potassium Metals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.01700</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.01700v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Plasmonics enables the miniaturization of photonic devices beyond the optical diffraction limit,yet its potential is hindered by inherently large ohmic losses. Hence, it is prudent to explore low loss alternatives to the current mainstay of plasmonics-the noble metals. In this work, we demonstrate the potential of potassium as a plasmonic material with intrinsically low losses in the optical region. The ultraflat, high quality potassium film, fabricated via a rapid slipping-assisted oxide-free crystallization process, achieves an experimentally observed optical damping rate of 3.7 meV,with a measured imaginary permittivity of approximately 0.1 across the entire visible to near-infrared range (400-2000 nm). Near field optical spectroscopic measurements further confirmed the reduced losses by revealing deeply subwavelength confinement of optical modes. This result enhances our understanding of the factors governing plasmonic materials and devices and establishes a new platform for exploring extreme light-matter interactions in a variety of plasmonic systems.</description>

      <title>Effects of Zero-Point Motion in the High Harmonic Generation Spectrum of Solids</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.01712</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.01712v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The interpretation of high-harmonic generation (HHG) in solids typically relies on phenomenological dephasing times far shorter than what is expected from microscopic scattering processes. Here we show that zero-point fluctuations associated with optical phonons naturally suppress long-range electronic coherences and generate clean harmonic spectra without introducing ad-hoc decoherence parameters. Using a 1D semiconductor composed of two distinct sites per unit cell and realistic phonon amplitudes, we demonstrate that random per-site optical-phonon jitter reproduces the spectral sharpening typically attributed to ultrafast $T_2$ dephasing. In contrast, acoustic phonons and local strain, whose distortions are correlated over nanometer scales, produce negligible spectral cleaning. We further show that such long-range site coherence leads to carrier-envelope-phase-dependent effects in the HHG spectrum driven by long pulses, but these effects collapse once optical-phonon-induced decoherence is included. Our results (i) identify optical zero-point motion as a key mechanism governing coherence in solid-state HHG, (ii) demonstrate that it can be qualitatively modeled in periodic solids through site-distance-dependent dephasing, and (iii) suggest that CEP-resolved measurements can probe electronic coherence lengths and atomic fluctuations in crystalline materials.</description>

      <title>On the origin and properties of dipolar recoil force and torque</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.01784</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.01784v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The recoil optical force and torque acting on an electromagnetic dipole are typically derived by computing the imbalance in radiated linear and angular electromagnetic momentum coming from the source, using Maxwell stress tensor integration. This quantifies the recoil's outcome without revealing its physical origin or the underlying forces that produce it. The recoil force and torque exist even in the absence of external illumination, such that an isolated dipole emitter can experience them. In contrast to the other terms, the recoil terms are odd under time reversal. To clarify their nature and properties, we re-derive the recoil force from first principles using the total Lorentz force on a system of charges that form a simultaneous electric and magnetic dipole. The results agree with the standard momentum-based derivation and reveal their ultimate origin from retardation effects -- arising from the finite speed of light -- in the mutual interactions between charges. This result provides fundamental insight into the recoil mechanism, offering a clearer conceptual foundation for future theoretical and experimental studies of light-induced forces.</description>

      <title>Dispersion-Mediated Space-Time States</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.01849</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.01849v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Space-time varying media enable unprecedented control over electromagnetic waves, yet most existing studies assume idealized, nondispersive materials and thus fail to capture the intrinsic frequency dispersion of realistic platforms. Here, we develop a general framework for dispersive space-time varying systems that rigorously identifies the physically allowed frequency transitions of waves scattered at uniformly moving interfaces. Unlike previous approaches, our method is valid for arbitrary dispersion profiles, including resonances, and does not rely on the commonly used frame hopping approach, allowing treatment of multiple-velocity and accelerated systems. Applying this framework to canonical Drude and Lorentz media, we uncover a family of dispersion-mediated space-time states that arise from the multiple frequency transitions permitted by material dispersion. These states extend beyond conventional nondispersive scattering, revealing qualitatively new regimes of space-time scattering regimes. Our results establish a rigorous foundation for the design of realistic space-time metamaterials, with immediate relevance to emerging experiments in epsilon-near-zero optical platforms and open pathways for dispersion-engineered wave manipulation.</description>

Abstract: The Transfer Matrix Method is a powerful numerical tool for simulating wave propagation in layered media. It has been widely applied in many fields, although its use is typically restricted to passive media. In this paper, we develop the transfer method to simulate optical nonlinear generation and give examples for processes such as difference frequency generation, spontaneous parametric down conversion, and four-wave mixing including generation of counter propagating waves. This framework enables accurate simulation of complex multilayer structures and resonant cavities, providing a versatile tool for designing nonlinear photonic devices.</description>

      <title>Laser Structured Optical Interposer for Ultra-dense Vertical Coupling of Multi-core Fibers to Silicon Photonic Chip</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.01972</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.01972v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Femtosecond laser writing in glass was harnessed to fabricate photonic circuits comprised of waveguides, micro-mirrors, and fiber sockets, in an optical interposer chip. The compact design enabled ultra-dense routing of 40 optical channels from six multi-core fibers, in a two-layer array, vertically coupling onto a 2D grid of silicon photonic grating couplers. Various photonic circuit designs were explored and tested, achieving an average single-pass insertion loss of 5.0 dB for the fully packaged system, with a minimum loss of 3.2 dB. The reasonably low loss and low-profile, compact package make such interposers an attractive option for densifying interconnects to address bottlenecks in optical networks, datacenters, and optical computing applications.</description>

      <title>Quasi-confined modes produced by the Lugiato-Lefever model with a localized pump and the pseudo-Raman term</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.00189</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.00189v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce an extended nonlinear Lugiato-Lefever equation (LLE) with the pseudo-stimulated-Raman-scattering (pseudo-SRS) cubic term, linear damping/gain, and spatial inhomogeneous (weakly or strongly localized) pump. The LLE is derived, in the extended adiabatic approximation, from the underlying Zakharov system (ZS), which includes a viscosity term, acting on its low-frequency (LF) component, and the pump supporting the high-frequency (HF) one. Dynamics of quasi-solitons in the model is addressed by means of analytical and numerical methods. The sech-based approximation for the quasi-soliton predicts it as a stable fixed point (FP) of the system of evolution equations for the moments of the system moments (the HF norm, wave momentum, and center-of-mass coordinate). The attraction basin of the FP is identified too. The prediction is corroborated by direct simulations of the full LLE. A quasi-singular mode, supported by the delta-functional pump, is briefly considered too.</description>

      <title>Multi-Mode Quantum Memories for High-Throughput Satellite Entanglement Distribution</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.00282</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.00282v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Quantum networking seeks to enable global entanglement distribution through terrestrial and free space channels; however, the exponential loss in these channels necessitates quantum repeaters with efficient, long lived quantum memories (QMs). Space based architectures, particularly satellite assisted links, offer a path to truly global connectivity, yet they demand QMs that are compatible with orbital factors such as infrared radiation and the unique challenges of operating aboard a satellite. In this work, we propose a multimode quantum memory (MMQM) for low Earth orbit (LEO) repeaters based on the atomic frequency comb (AFC) protocol. Our design integrates a hybrid alkali noble gas ensemble in an optical cavity, using alkali atoms for strong photon matter coupling and noble gas nuclear spins for minutes to hours coherence, all without the need for cryogenics. The architecture natively supports temporal and spectral multiplexing, enabling the storage of 100 modes to parallelize probabilistic operations and overcome light limited round trip times. Representative link budgets at $h = 500$ km with realistic apertures, $\eta_{\text{mem}}\gtrsim 70%$, and $t_{\text{buffer}}$ of several minutes predict improvements of up to two orders of magnitude in per pass success probability and instantaneous SKR relative to a memoryless dual downlink, with clear scaling in $N$. Our contributions are (i) a non cryogenic, space ready multimode memory, (ii) a systems analysis coupling mode count, storage time, and orbital geometry to achievable rate, and (iii) a near term implementation roadmap. Together, these results indicate feasibility with current to near term technology and provide a practical path toward a high rate, space enabled quantum internet.</description>

      <title>Hardware-Software Collaborative Computing of Photonic Spiking Reinforcement Learning for Robotic Continuous Control</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.00427</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.00427v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Robotic continuous control tasks impose stringent demands on the energy efficiency and latency of computing architectures due to their high-dimensional state spaces and real-time interaction requirements. Conventional electronic computing platforms face computational bottlenecks, whereas the fusion of photonic computing and spiking reinforcement learning (RL) offers a promising alternative. Here, we propose a novel computing architecture based on photonic spiking RL, which integrates the Twin Delayed Deep Deterministic policy gradient (TD3) algorithm with spiking neural network (SNN). The proposed architecture employs an optical-electronic hybrid computing paradigm wherein a silicon photonic Mach-Zehnder interferometer (MZI) chip executes linear matrix computations, while nonlinear spiking activations are performed in the electronic domain. Experimental validation on the Pendulum-v1 and HalfCheetah-v2 benchmarks demonstrates the system capability for software-hardware co-inference, achieving a control policy reward of 5831 on HalfCheetah-v2, a 23.33% reduction in convergence steps, and an action deviation below 2.2%. Notably, this work represents the first application of a programmable MZI photonic computing chip to robotic continuous control tasks, attaining an energy efficiency of 1.39 TOPS/W and an ultralow computational latency of 120 ps. Such performance underscores the promise of photonic spiking RL for real-time decision-making in autonomous and industrial robotic systems.</description>

      <title>Optimized spectral and interferometric techniques for the certification of ETPA</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.01117</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.01117v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The phenomenon of Entangled Two-Photon Absorption (ETPA) presents a persistent controversy in the literature, evidenced by a wide disparity in the reported values for the $\sigma_E$ cross-sections. Much of this discrepancy is attributed to the difficulty in discriminating ETPA from various background processes that can mimic its signal, such as linear absorption or scattering. Given this need to certify the presence of ETPA unequivocally, this work introduces a key strategy to isolate the ETPA contribution through its spectral signature. This involves modeling the molecule as a two-photon notch filter and inducing a controlled asymmetric overlap with the joint spectral intensity (JSI) of the incident photons. This asymmetry is used to generate a measurable distortion in the transmitted JSI, and, complementarily, as a reduction in the visibility of the Hong-Ou-Mandel (HOM) dip. To ensure the experimental feasibility of this technique, a comprehensive analysis of the experimental conditions required for its detection is presented, establishing the absorption efficiency limits that must be overcome given the constraints of entangled-photon-pair flux and detector noise. A preliminary experiment addressing the ETPA detection limits using the standard RhB dye is presented.</description>

Abstract: This paper presents a practical guide to prepare inorganic solutions that mimic the photoacoustic properties of whole blood at specific levels of oxygenation in the range of 700 nm to 850 nm, both in terms of optical absorption properties and the Gr{\"u}neisen coefficient. The goal is to provide aqueous solutions that can be injected in tissue-mimicking imaging phantoms to test the sensitivity and spectral capabilities of photoacoustic imaging systems operating at multiple wavelengths to estimate blood oxygenation.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2512.01538v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this work we introduce an effective approach to quantize the electromagnetic response of plasmonic metallic nanostructures. Their shape is arbitrary and they feature a realistic description of the frequency-dependent metal dielectric function that is based on experimental data. The derived quantum modes correctly reproduce the linear response macroscopic polarization of the nanoparticle upon external drive according to classical macroscopic Maxwell equations in the quasistatic limit. Such methodology paves the way for accurate modeling of plexcitonic system, where strong plasmon-molecule coupling and/or strong-driving fields call for a quantized description of the plasmonic response.</description>

Abstract: Cold-atom systems have emerged as a highly promising avenue for quantum-enhanced position, navigation, and timing applications. However, their wider adoption is currently hampered in part by the large footprint of the systems. In leveraging the miniaturisation possible through photonic integrated circuits, cold-atom sensors would be able to reach much wider commercial adoption. In this paper, we introduce a platform for evanescently trapping 87Rb using strip silicon nitride waveguides buried in silica using red- and blue-detuned fundamental and higher-order modes, providing a three-dimensional adjustable trap for BEC-based, chip-scale work in quantum science and technologies.</description>

      <title>Antibunching in locally driven dissipative Lieb lattices</title>

      <description>arXiv:2512.01645v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In Lieb lattices, geometric frustration and destructive interference of hopping cancels the occupation of certain sites, leading to flat-band physics. Here, we show numerically how, in the driven-dissipative Bose-Hubbard (DDBH) model arranged into Lieb lattices and related geometries, specific localised driving schemes can repurpose this interference to generate enhanced antibunching via a mechanism similar to the so-called unconventional photon blockade. Stochastic simulations using the positive-P method allow us to calculate occupations and second order correlations exactly for extended lattices. We use this to optimise the parameters for the possible observation of this effect in polariton micropillar experiments. This work demonstrates the possibility of using localised driving and interference effects to generate non-trivial quantum correlations in open quantum lattice systems.</description>

Abstract: We analyze the formal equivalence between the electromagnetic energy conservation law derived from Maxwell's equations in an optical microcavity and the conservation of a probability fluid associated with the de Broglie-Bohm theory for an effective massive particle describing a photon in this cavity. This work is part of a critical analysis of recent experiments [Nature \textbf{643}, 67-72 (2025)] carried out with a view to refuting the de Broglie-Bohm theory. Furthermore, the consequences of our analysis for microphotonics go far beyond these experiments. In particular, extensions that take into account photon spin and stochastic aspects associated with radiative or absorption losses are considered.</description>

      <title>Light drag in nonuniformly moving anisotropic media through the lens of gradient-index optics</title>

      <description>arXiv:2512.01718v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The trajectory of light rays propagating through a nonuniformly moving anisotropic medium is determined by considering the Fresnel drag experienced by the wave at each point along the ray. By showing that symmetries in the velocity field manifest as symmetries in the effective wave index representing the moving medium, methods classically employed to model gradient index media are then used to obtain analytical forms for the ray trajectory. When applied to isotropic media, the results are verified to be consistent with those obtained using an optical (Gordon) metric. The potential of this method to model light rays in anisotropic media is finally demonstrated by considering waves in a nonuniformly moving magnetized plasma, exposing how nonuniform motion and anisotropy can compete with one another.</description>

Abstract: We demonstrate simultaneous imaging at 0.549 THz and 1.012 THz with an optical overlay using a two-species atomic-vapour-based technique. The atomic vapour, comprising laser-pumped rubidium and caesium atoms contained within the same cell, is used to convert two narrowband terahertz signals to optical frequencies which can then be detected using standard CMOS sensors. We use the system to image and perform spectral analysis of material samples. As atomic vapour is optically transparent, by using optically-transparent terahertz lenses, we can achieve simultaneous optical imaging, allowing for potential integration of terahertz sensitivity into a range of optical imaging devices.</description>

Abstract: In this article, we report classical sensing with undetected light using octave spanning stimulated four-wave mixing from a plasmonic metasurface. The bidirectional nonlinear scattering due to inherent reflections from such thin nonlinear materials modifies their operation within a nonlinear interferometer. The theoretical model for visibility accounting for such bidirectionality as well as pulsed illumination accurately predicts visibility in the system as a function of transmission in the near-infrared seed (idler) arm. Spectrally resolving the visible signal emission evaluates the total dispersion within the interferometer, highlighting the prospect of ultrafast sensing with undetected photons.</description>

      <title>Optimizing Aperture Geometry in THz-TDS for Accurate Spectroscopy of Quantum Materials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.08609</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.08609v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Terahertz time-domain spectroscopy (THz-TDS) provides a powerful platform for investigating low-energy excitations in quantum materials. Because these materials are often limited in size, experimental setups typically rely on tightly focused beams and metallic holders with small apertures. In this work, we perform a systematic study of how aperture geometry influences THz signal transmission in a standard free-space configuration. By analyzing time- and frequency-domain data for circular apertures of varying diameters and thicknesses, we quantify the spatial and spectral filtering effects imposed by aperture size. We show that small apertures progressively attenuate low-frequency components of the transmitted signal, while higher-frequency content remains comparatively unaffected. These effects become especially significant for apertures smaller than typical THz beam waists, resulting in amplitude suppression and phase distortions that compromise the accuracy of frequency-domain analysis and optical parameter retrieval. To validate these observations, additional measurements were performed on a representative quantum material, confirming the practical relevance of the identified aperture effects. The transmitted intensity as a function of aperture diameter also provides a straightforward method for estimating the beam waist at the focus. In contrast, standard aperture thicknesses do not introduce measurable distortions, confirming the adequacy of treating thick, non-resonant apertures as dielectric slabs. These findings establish practical guidelines for aperture selection in THz-TDS and underscore the importance of preserving low-frequency response for reliable characterization of quantum materials.</description>

      <title>Formation of axially modulated plasma strings by filamentation of interfering femtosecond Bessel beams</title>

      <description>arXiv:2508.10163v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We numerically investigate the formation of axially modulated plasma strings through the filamentation of two interfering femtosecond Bessel beams. The constituent Bessel beams have different central spot sizes and propagate collinearly. Our results show that filamentation of these beams in air leads to the formation of intense axially modulated light filaments, and corrugated plasma strings with high modulation depths and tunable modulation periods. We find that the modulation periods of the intensity and the plasma density are identical and comparable to the modulation period of the intensity in the linear propagation regime. Furthermore, we show that, in the nonlinear propagation regime, the modulation period is independent of the pulse energy and can be tuned by selecting appropriate central spot sizes for the interfering Bessel beams. Finally, we propose a simple interferometric arrangement using a single axicon to generate two interfering Bessel beams with adjustable spot sizes enabling the creation of axially-modulated plasma strings with tunable periodicity at high input powers.</description>

Abstract: Harnessing quantum correlations between photons is an emerging frontier in optical spectroscopy, yet experimental demonstrations have largely remained limited to molecular systems at room temperature. Here, we investigate heralded emission detection (HED) under continuous-wave entangled-photon excitation of near-infrared (NIR)-emitting colloidal III-V quantum dot (QD) solids at low temperatures. We demonstrate the advantages of superconducting nanowire single-photon detectors (SNSPDs) for high time resolution ($\sim$72 ps) and large-area NIR avalanche photodiodes (APDs) for high emission count rates ($\sim$2000 cps). Second-order photon-correlation analysis reveals exciton lifetimes and fine-structure energy splittings. These results establish NIR colloidal QDs as a bright, tunable model system for quantum-light spectroscopy and highlight their compatibility with optical cavities as a further experimental control parameter.</description>

      <title>Towards a mobile quantitative phase imaging microscope with smartphone phase-detection sensors</title>

      <description>arXiv:2510.27662v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Quantitative phase imaging (QPI) enables visualization and quantitative extraction of the optical phase information of transparent samples. However, conventional QPI techniques typically rely on multi-frame acquisition or complex interferometric optics. In this work, we introduce Quad-Pixel Phase Gradient Imaging ($QP^{2}GI$), a single-shot quantitative phase imaging method based on a commercial quad-pixel phase detection autofocus (PDAF) sensor, where each microlens on the sensor covers a $2\times2$ pixel group. The phase gradients of the sample induce focal spot displacements under each microlens, which lead to intensity imbalances among the four pixels. By deriving the phase gradients of the sample from these imbalances, $QP^{2}GI$ reconstructs quantitative phase maps of the sample from a single exposure. We establish a light-propagation model to describe this process and evaluate its performance in a customized microscopic system. Experiments demonstrate that quantitative phase maps of microbeads and biological specimens can be reconstructed from a single acquisition, while low-coherence illumination improves robustness by suppressing coherence-related noise. These results reveal the potential of quad-pixel PDAF sensors as cost-effective platforms for single-frame QPI.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2511.09288v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this study, we propose a microfiber waveguide for temperature and air pressure measurement. To improve mechanical strength of the sensor, a C-shaped fiber is sandwiches between two single mode fibers (SMFs) by fusion splice. The microfiber waveguide is 3D printed between two SMFs to connect two fiber cores by two-photon polymerization technology. Due to multimode property of this printed waveguide, a Mach-Zehnder interferometer (MZI) is obtained. This sensor exhibits a high temperature sensitivity of 361 pm/{\deg}C at 25{\deg}C to 45{\deg}C and a high air pressure sensitivity of 55 pm/kPa from 300hpa to 1000hpa. The MZI sensor features significant advantages such as small size, high stability, and easy fabrication, without the need for complex post-processing, showing great potential and broad application prospects in many sensing applications.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2511.11274v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Polarization-sensitive optical coherence tomography (PS-OCT) extends OCT by analyzing the polarization states of backscattered light to quantify tissue birefringence. However, conventional implementations require polarization-diverse detection and are therefore incompatible with most commercial OCT systems. As a result, PS-OCT has largely remained restricted to specialized research groups, limiting its broader scientific and clinical use. Here, we present a modular PS-OCT framework that integrates with a standard spectral-domain OCT platform through a detachable rotating achromatic half-wave plate in the sample arm. This waveplate modulates both incident and reflected polarization states. Three or more repeated measurements at distinct waveplate orientations enable reconstruction of the sample's round-trip Jones matrix and the corresponding polarization properties. To mitigate random phase variations between repeated measurements, we introduce a retarder-constrained phase optimization strategy. We validate the framework with imaging of birefringent phantoms and the human retina in vivo, demonstrating reliable reconstruction of retardance and optic axis orientation. This approach requires only minimal hardware modification and is readily deployable on mainstream OCT systems. Lowering technical barriers paves the way for rapid and widespread deployment of PS-OCT across diverse biomedical applications in both research and clinical environments.</description>

      <title>Radiometric sensitivity and resolution of synthetic tracking imaging for orbital debris monitoring</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2211.09789</link>
      <description>arXiv:2211.09789v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We consider sampling and detection strategies for solar illuminated space debris. We argue that the lowest detectable debris cross section may be reduced by 10-100x by analysis of stacks of image frames collected at high rates rather than single frame data. In particular, instead of a pixel as a spatial region, the analysis is based on a "phase-space-pixel" which corresponds to an angular velocity and space region and whose intensity is computed by a weighted stacking of spatial pixels corresponding to a test debris trajectory within a wide camera field-of-view (FOV). To isolate debris signals from background, the exposure time is set to match the time it takes a debris to transit through the instantaneous field of view. Debris signatures are detected by multiscale X-ray processing of the data cube. Radiometric analysis of line integrals shows that sub-cm objects in Low Earth Orbit can be detected and assigned full orbital parameters by this approach.</description>

Abstract: Exceptional points (EPs) are remarkable spectral degeneracies in a non-Hermitian system's parameter space, where both eigenvalues and eigenstates coalesce. Here, we show that in non-Hermitian molecular chiral systems the position of EPs in the parameter space is enantiomer-specific. First, we show that encircling the EP of one enantiomer drives robust topological population transfer in the chiral molecule while its mirror twin remains unaffected, offering a new route for selective chiral control. Second, we reveal how resonant excitation of EPs in chiral molecules can amplify weak chiral effects, offering an alternative approach to the enhancement of chiral interactions. Third, we demonstrate that a twisted chiral fiber immersed in a liquid solution of chiral molecules exhibits topologically different behavior depending on the solution's enantiomeric excess, offering a new approach to the detection of molecular chirality. Our results combine high enantiosensitivity with topological robustness in chiral discrimination and control, paving the way for new approaches in the exploration of non-Hermitian and chiral phenomena.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2507.04865v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The theory of multiresonator quantum memory with atomic ensembles has been developed. Using the obtained analytical solutions, the basic physical properties of such memory are analyzed and optimal conditions for its implementation are determined. Advantages of this quantum memory and its experimental implementation in integrated optical schemes are discussed.</description>

      <title>Frequency domain laser ultrasound microscopy for nanometric layer thickness imaging with GHz elastic plate resonances</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.16000</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.16000v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Nanometric layer thickness imaging is crucial for fundamental research and characterization of micro fabricated devices. Here, we assess the potential of a non-contact opto-acoustic frequency domain laser ultrasound (FreDomLUS) microscopy technique for imaging nanometric thickness variations via GHz zero-group velocity (ZGV) elastic plate resonances. The method exploits the ZGV's lateral energy confinement that leads to sharp resonance peaks which can be effectively probed with the FreDomLUS technique at GHz acoustic frequencies. For demonstration purposes we introduced sub-10 nm height variation patterns in the topmost layer of solidly mounted bulk-acoustic wave resonators with a design frequency of around 1.7 GHz. They are raster-scanned to retrieve ZGV-frequencies from local acoustic spectra as a contrast quantity for imaging. We show how to retrieve quantitative height information by numerically calibrating the factor which inversely relates ZGV frequency change with the layer thickness change. Height variations in stacks with nominal thickness changes of 8 nm, 4 nm, and 1 nm can be resolved and indicate sub-nanometer depth resolution capabilities. The lateral resolution is studied by measuring the method's step edge function and it is found to be in the micrometer range. Atomic force microscopy imaging is used to validate the results.</description>

      <title>TPCNet: Triple physical constraints for Low-light Image Enhancement</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.22052</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.22052v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Low-light image enhancement is an essential computer vision task to improve image contrast and to decrease the effects of color bias and noise. Many existing interpretable deep-learning algorithms exploit the Retinex theory as the basis of model design. However, previous Retinex-based algorithms, that consider reflected objects as ideal Lambertian ignore specular reflection in the modeling process and construct the physical constraints in image space, limiting generalization of the model. To address this issue, we preserve the specular reflection coefficient and reformulate the original physical constraints in the imaging process based on the Kubelka-Munk theory, thereby constructing constraint relationship between illumination, reflection, and detection, the so-called triple physical constraints (TPCs)theory. Based on this theory, the physical constraints are constructed in the feature space of the model to obtain the TPC network (TPCNet). Comprehensive quantitative and qualitative benchmark and ablation experiments confirm that these constraints effectively improve the performance metrics and visual quality without introducing new parameters, and demonstrate that our TPCNet outperforms other state-of-the-art methods on 10 datasets.</description>
