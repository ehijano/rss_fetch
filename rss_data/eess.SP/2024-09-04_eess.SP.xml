      <title>Cognitive Networks and Performance Drive fMRI-Based State Classification Using DNN Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.00003</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.00003v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Deep neural network (DNN) models have demonstrated impressive performance in various domains, yet their application in cognitive neuroscience is limited due to their lack of interpretability. In this study we employ two structurally different and complementary DNN-based models, a one-dimensional convolutional neural network (1D-CNN) and a bidirectional long short-term memory network (BiLSTM), to classify individual cognitive states from fMRI BOLD data, with a focus on understanding the cognitive underpinnings of the classification decisions. We show that despite the architectural differences, both models consistently produce a robust relationship between prediction accuracy and individual cognitive performance, such that low performance leads to poor prediction accuracy. To achieve model explainability, we used permutation techniques to calculate feature importance, allowing us to identify the most critical brain regions influencing model predictions. Across models, we found the dominance of visual networks, suggesting that task-driven state differences are primarily encoded in visual processing. Attention and control networks also showed relatively high importance, however, default mode and temporal-parietal networks demonstrated negligible contribution in differentiating cognitive states. Additionally, we observed individual trait-based effects and subtle model-specific differences, such that 1D-CNN showed slightly better overall performance, while BiLSTM showed better sensitivity for individual behavior; these initial findings require further research and robustness testing to be fully established. Our work underscores the importance of explainable DNN models in uncovering the neural mechanisms underlying cognitive state transitions, providing a foundation for future work in this domain.</description>

      <title>Federated Sequence-to-Sequence Learning for Load Disaggregation from Unbalanced Low-Resolution Smart Meter Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.00007</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.00007v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The importance of Non-Intrusive Load Monitoring (NILM) has been increasingly recognized, given that NILM can enhance energy awareness and provide valuable insights for energy program design. Many existing NILM methods often rely on specialized devices to retrieve high-sampling complex signal data and focus on the high consumption appliances, hindering their applicability in real-world applications, especially when smart meters only provide low-resolution active power readings for households. In this paper, we propose a new approach using easily accessible weather data to achieve load disaggregation for a total of 12 appliances, encompassing both high and low consumption, in scenarios with very low sampling rates (hourly). Moreover, We develop a federated learning (FL) model that builds upon a sequence-to-sequence model to fulfil load disaggregation without data sharing. Our experiments demonstrate that the FL framework - L2GD can effectively handle statistical heterogeneity and avoid overfitting problems. By incorporating weather data, our approach significantly improves the performance of NILM.</description>

      <title>A Novel Approach to Classify Power Quality Signals Using Vision Transformers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.00025</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.00025v2 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: With the rapid integration of electronically interfaced renewable energy resources and loads into smart grids, there is increasing interest in power quality disturbances (PQD) classification to enhance the security and efficiency of these grids. This paper introduces a new approach to PQD classification based on the Vision Transformer (ViT) model. When a PQD occurs, the proposed approach first converts the power quality signal into an image and then utilizes a pre-trained ViT to accurately determine the class of the PQD. Unlike most previous works, which were limited to a few disturbance classes or small datasets, the proposed method is trained and tested on a large dataset with 17 disturbance classes. Our experimental results show that the proposed ViT-based approach achieves PQD classification precision and recall of 98.28% and 97.98%, respectively, outperforming recently proposed techniques applied to the same dataset.</description>

      <title>TimeSense: Multi-Person Device-free Indoor Localization via RTT</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.00030</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.00030v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Locating the persons moving through an environment without the necessity of them being equipped with special devices has become vital for many applications including security, IoT, healthcare, etc. Existing device-free indoor localization systems commonly rely on the utilization of Received Signal Strength Indicator (RSSI) and WiFi Channel State Information (CSI) techniques. However, the accuracy of RSSI is adversely affected by environmental factors like multi-path interference and fading. Additionally, the lack of standardization in CSI necessitates the use of specialized hardware and software. In this paper, we present TimeSense, a deep learning-based multi-person device-free indoor localization system that addresses these challenges. TimeSense leverages Time of Flight information acquired by the fine-time measurement protocol of IEEE 802.11-2016 standard. Specifically, the measured round trip time between the transmitter and receiver is influenced by the dynamic changes in the environment induced by human presence. TimeSense effectively detects this anomalous behavior using a stacked denoising auto-encoder model, thereby estimating the user's location. The system incorporates a probabilistic approach on top of the deep learning model to ensure seamless tracking of the users. The evaluation of TimeSene in two realistic environments demonstrates its efficacy, achieving a median localization accuracy of 1.57 and 2.65 meters. This surpasses the performance of state-of-the-art techniques by 49% and 103% in the two testbeds.</description>

      <title>ADformer: A Multi-Granularity Transformer for EEG-Based Alzheimer's Disease Assessment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.00032</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.00032v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Electroencephalogram (EEG) has emerged as a cost-effective and efficient method for supporting neurologists in assessing Alzheimer's disease (AD). Existing approaches predominantly utilize handcrafted features or Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)-based methods. However, the potential of the transformer architecture, which has shown promising results in various time series analysis tasks, remains underexplored in interpreting EEG for AD assessment. Furthermore, most studies are evaluated on the subject-dependent setup but often overlook the significance of the subject-independent setup. To address these gaps, we present ADformer, a novel multi-granularity transformer designed to capture temporal and spatial features to learn effective EEG representations. We employ multi-granularity data embedding across both dimensions and utilize self-attention to learn local features within each granularity and global features among different granularities. We conduct experiments across 5 datasets with a total of 525 subjects in setups including subject-dependent, subject-independent, and leave-subjects-out. Our results show that ADformer outperforms existing methods in most evaluations, achieving F1 scores of 75.19% and 93.58% on two large datasets with 65 subjects and 126 subjects, respectively, in distinguishing AD and healthy control (HC) subjects under the challenging subject-independent setup.</description>

      <title>Direction of Arrival Estimation with Sparse Subarrays</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.00033</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.00033v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper proposes design techniques for partially-calibrated sparse linear subarrays and algorithms to perform direction-of-arrival (DOA) estimation. First, we introduce array architectures that incorporate two distinct array categories, namely type-I and type-II arrays. The former breaks down a known sparse linear geometry into as many pieces as we need, and the latter employs each subarray such as it fits a preplanned sparse linear geometry. Moreover, we devise two Direction of Arrival (DOA) estimation algorithms that are suitable for partially-calibrated array scenarios within the coarray domain. The algorithms are capable of estimating a greater number of sources than the number of available physical sensors, while maintaining the hardware and computational complexity within practical limits for real-time implementation. To this end, we exploit the intersection of projections onto affine spaces by devising the Generalized Coarray Multiple Signal Classification (GCA-MUSIC) in conjunction with the estimation of a refined projection matrix related to the noise subspace, as proposed in the GCA root-MUSIC algorithm. An analysis is performed for the devised subarray configurations in terms of degrees of freedom, as well as the computation of the Cram\`er-Rao Lower Bound for the utilized data model, in order to demonstrate the good performance of the proposed methods. Simulations assess the performance of the proposed design methods and algorithms against existing approaches.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.00035v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study focuses on EEG-based BMI for detecting voluntary keystrokes, aiming to develop a reliable brain-computer interface (BCI) to simulate and anticipate keystrokes, especially for individuals with motor impairments. The methodology includes extensive segmentation, event alignment, ERP plot analysis, and signal analysis. Different deep learning models are trained to classify EEG data into three categories -- `resting state' (0), `d' key press (1), and `l' key press (2). Real-time keypress simulation based on neural activity is enabled through integration with a tkinter-based graphical user interface. Feature engineering utilized ERP windows, and the SVC model achieved 90.42% accuracy in event classification. Additionally, deep learning models -- MLP (89% accuracy), Catboost (87.39% accuracy), KNN (72.59%), Gaussian Naive Bayes (79.21%), Logistic Regression (90.81% accuracy), and a novel Bi-Directional LSTM-GRU hybrid model (89% accuracy) -- were developed for BCI keyboard simulation. Finally, a GUI was created to predict and simulate keystrokes using the trained MLP model.</description>

      <title>Needles in Needle Stacks: Meaningful Clinical Information Buried in Noisy Waveform Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.00041</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.00041v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Central Venous Lines (C-Lines) and Arterial Lines (A-Lines) are routinely used in the Critical Care Unit (CCU) for blood sampling, medication administration, and high-frequency blood pressure measurement. Judiciously accessing these lines is important, as over-utilization is associated with significant in-hospital morbidity and mortality. Documenting the frequency of line-access is an important step in reducing these adverse outcomes. Unfortunately, the current gold-standard for documentation is manual and subject to error, omission, and bias. The high-frequency blood pressure waveform data from sensors in these lines are often noisy and full of artifacts. Standard approaches in signal processing remove noise artifacts before meaningful analysis. However, from bedside observations, we characterized a distinct artifact that occurs during each instance of C-Line or A-Line use. These artifacts are buried amongst physiological waveform and extraneous noise. We focus on Machine Learning (ML) models that can detect these artifacts from waveform data in real-time - finding needles in needle stacks, in order to automate the documentation of line-access. We built and evaluated ML classifiers running in real-time at a major children's hospital to achieve this goal. We demonstrate the utility of these tools for reducing documentation burden, increasing available information for bedside clinicians, and informing unit-level initiatives to improve patient safety.</description>

      <title>AI-Powered Dynamic Fault Detection and Performance Assessment in Photovoltaic Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.00052</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.00052v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The intermittent nature of photovoltaic (PV) solar energy, driven by variable weather, leads to power losses of 10-70% and an average energy production decrease of 25%. Accurate loss characterization and fault detection are crucial for reliable PV system performance and efficiency, integrating this data into control signal monitoring systems. Computational modeling of PV systems supports technological, economic, and performance analyses, but current models are often rigid, limiting advanced performance optimization and innovation. Conventional fault detection strategies are costly and often yield unreliable results due to complex data signal profiles. Artificial intelligence (AI), especially machine learning algorithms, offers improved fault detection by analyzing relationships between input parameters (e.g., meteorological and electrical) and output metrics (e.g., production). Once trained, these models can effectively identify faults by detecting deviations from expected performance. This research presents a computational model using the PVlib library in Python, incorporating a dynamic loss quantification algorithm that processes meteorological, operational, and technical data. An artificial neural network (ANN) trained on synthetic datasets with a five-minute resolution simulates real-world PV system faults. A dynamic threshold definition for fault detection is based on historical data from a PV system at Universidad de los Andes. Key contributions include: (i) a PV system model with a mean absolute error of 6.0% in daily energy estimation; (ii) dynamic loss quantification without specialized equipment; (iii) an AI-based algorithm for technical parameter estimation, avoiding special monitoring devices; and (iv) a fault detection model achieving 82.2% mean accuracy and 92.6% maximum accuracy.</description>

      <title>Accelerometer-Based Multivariate Time-Series Dataset for Calf Behavior Classification</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.00053</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.00053v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Getting new insights on pre-weaned calf behavioral adaptation to routine challenges (transport, group relocation, etc.) and diseases (respiratory diseases, diarrhea, etc.) is a promising way to improve calf welfare in dairy farms. A classic approach to automatically monitoring behavior is to equip animals with accelerometers attached to neck collars and to develop machine learning models from accelerometer time-series. However, to be used for model development, data must be equipped with labels. Obtaining these labels requires annotating behaviors from direct observation or videos, a time-consuming and labor-intensive process. To address this challenge, we propose the ActBeCalf (Accelerometer Time-Series for Calf Behaviour classification) dataset: 30 pre-weaned dairy calves (Holstein Friesian and Jersey) were equipped with a 3D-accelerometer sensor attached to a neck-collar from one week of birth for 13 weeks. The calves were simultaneously filmed with a camera in each pen. At the end of the trial, behaviors were manually annotated from the videos using the Behavioral Observation Research Interactive Software (BORIS) by 3 observers using an ethogram with 23 behaviors. ActBeCalf contains 27.4 hours of accelerometer data aligned adequately with calf behaviors. The dataset includes the main behaviors, like lying, standing, walking, and running, and less prominent behaviors, such as sniffing, social interaction, and grooming. Finally, ActBeCalf was used for behavior classification with machine learning models: (i)two classes of behaviors, [active and inactive; model 1] and (ii)four classes of behaviors [running, lying, drinking milk, and 'other' class; model 2] to demonstrate its reliability. We got a balanced accuracy of 92% [model1] and 84% [model2]. ActBeCalf is a comprehensive and ready-to-use dataset for classifying pre-weaned calf behaviour from the acceleration time series.</description>

      <title>HiFAKES: High-frequency synthetic appliance signatures generator for non-intrusive load monitoring</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.00062</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.00062v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Non-intrusive load monitoring (NILM) rely on data-driven methods and require extensive datasets of power consumption over a long period of time. However, the scarcity of datasets negatively impacts the performance of current NILM algorithms. Further, while the vast majority of these datasets are made by collecting low-frequency sampling power consumption patterns, high-frequency datasets, which would significantly improve the accuracy of load identification, are comparatively few due to the time and costs that such data collection entail. As a response to these problems, synthetic datasets have been developed. Existing synthetic datasets for NILM, while useful, typically depend on large training datasets and are evaluated using a single aggregated test metric, which cannot precisely reflect the fidelity, diversity, and novelty of the data. To address this gap, we introduce HiFAKES, a novel physics-informed, training-free generative model designed to produce high-frequency sampling synthetic power signatures. HiFAKES generates synthetic data with superior fidelity and diversity. Indeed, the $\alpha$-precision and $\beta$-recall indicators are respectively about 2.5 times larger than those for existing models, this makes our proposed model highly effective for NILM applications. HiFAKES operates by generating reference signatures templates based on real appliance signatures data, and by replicating these with some features variations, thus simulating both known and novel appliances. A key advantage of this model is its ability to generate unlimited high-frequency synthetic appliance data from a single training example. The generated data closely mimics real-world power consumption, as demonstrated by comprehensive evaluations, including the so-called 3D metric ($\alpha$-precision, $\beta$-recall, authenticity) and domain classifier tests.</description>

      <title>Optical Semantic Communication through Multimode Fiber: From Symbol Transmission to Sentiment Analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.00066</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.00066v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose and validate a novel optical semantic transmission scheme using multimode fiber (MMF). By leveraging the frequency sensitivity of intermodal dispersion in MMFs, we achieve high-dimensional semantic encoding and decoding in the frequency domain. Our system maps symbols to 128 distinct frequencies spaced at 600 kHz intervals, demonstrating a seven-fold increase in capacity compared to conventional communication encoding. We further enhance spectral efficiency by implementing 4-level pulse amplitude modulation (PAM-4), achieving 9.12 bits/s/Hz without decoding errors. Additionally, we explore the application of this system for sentiment analysis using the IMDb movie review dataset. By encoding semantically similar symbols to adjacent frequencies, the system's noise tolerance is effectively improved, facilitating accurate sentiment analysis. This work highlights the potential of MMF-based semantic communication to enhance both capacity and robustness in optical communication systems, offering promising applications in bandwidth-constrained and noisy environments.</description>

      <title>Metamaterial-Inspired Quad-Band Notch Filter for LTE Band Receivers and WPT Applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.00074</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.00074v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A new compact quad-band notch filter (QBNF) based on the extended composite right and left-handed transmission line (E-CRLH TL) has been presented. As known, E-CRLH TL behaves like a quad-band structure. A microstrip TL which is loaded with an open-ended E-CRLH TL is presented as a QBNF. Four unwanted frequencies were used in a dual-band LTE receiver as four notch frequencies which must be eliminated (0.9 GHz, 1.3 GHz, 2.55 GHz, and 3.35 GHz). Also, this QBNF can be applied to simultaneous wireless power and data transfer (SWPDT) system to isolate the wireless power circuit from the data communication circuit. A design technique for the proposed QBNF is presented and its performance is validated using full-wave simulation results and theoretical analysis. The main advantage of this design is an overall rejection greater than 20dB at selected unwanted frequencies. Good agreements between the full-wave simulation and equivalent circuit model results have been achieved which verified the effectiveness of the proposed circuit model. The proposed QBNF is designed on an FR-4 substrate and the dimension of the proposed QBNF is 20X22 mm.</description>

      <title>SGP-RI: A Real-Time-Trainable and Decentralized IoT Indoor Localization Model Based on Sparse Gaussian Process with Reduced-Dimensional Inputs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.00078</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.00078v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Internet of Things (IoT) devices are deployed in the filed, there is an enormous amount of untapped potential in local computing on those IoT devices. Harnessing this potential for indoor localization, therefore, becomes an exciting research area. Conventionally, the training and deployment of indoor localization models are based on centralized servers with substantial computational resources. This centralized approach faces several challenges, including the database's inability to accommodate the dynamic and unpredictable nature of the indoor electromagnetic environment, the model retraining costs, and the susceptibility of centralized servers to security breaches. To mitigate these challenges we aim to amalgamate the offline and online phases of traditional indoor localization methods using a real-time-trainable and decentralized IoT indoor localization model based on Sparse Gaussian Process with Reduced-dimensional Inputs (SGP-RI), where the number and dimension of the input data are reduced through reference point and wireless access point filtering, respectively. The experimental results based on a multi-building and multi-floor static database as well as a single-building and single-floor dynamic database, demonstrate that the proposed SGP-RI model with less than half the training samples as inducing inputs can produce comparable localization performance to the standard Gaussian Process model with the whole training samples. The SGP-RI model enables the decentralization of indoor localization, facilitating its deployment to resource-constrained IoT devices, and thereby could provide enhanced security and privacy, reduced costs, and network dependency. Also, the model's capability of real-time training makes it possible to quickly adapt to the time-varying indoor electromagnetic environment.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.00080</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.00080v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Predicted Mean Vote (PMV) index is a widely accepted method in the building automation sector because it can precisely estimate indoor thermal comfort levels depending on a variety of environmental parameters. This study suggests an experimental setup for automated real-time optimization of heating, ventilation and air-conditioning (HVAC) operations in closed spaces utilizing PMV-based modelling and Multilayer perceptron (MLP) based prediction, with an experimental setup which includes ESP32 and BME280 sensor. The main objective of this paper is to employ the MLP algorithm and predicted mean vote model to dynamically predict comfort differences considering the fluctuations in environmental conditions such as temperature and humidity. The proposed method is implemented across various settings, encompassing both an anechoic chamber and laboratory environments. The findings indicate that the proposed approach effectively enhances the management of HVAC systems in confined areas, leading to higher energy efficiency and enhanced indoor thermal comfort. The effectiveness of the suggested solution is supported by experimental validation, which shows that significant energy savings are achieved while maintaining comfort levels for occupants within.</description>

      <title>On-device Learning of EEGNet-based Network For Wearable Motor Imagery Brain-Computer Interface</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.00083</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.00083v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Electroencephalogram (EEG)-based Brain-Computer Interfaces (BCIs) have garnered significant interest across various domains, including rehabilitation and robotics. Despite advancements in neural network-based EEG decoding, maintaining performance across diverse user populations remains challenging due to feature distribution drift. This paper presents an effective approach to address this challenge by implementing a lightweight and efficient on-device learning engine for wearable motor imagery recognition. The proposed approach, applied to the well-established EEGNet architecture, enables real-time and accurate adaptation to EEG signals from unregistered users. Leveraging the newly released low-power parallel RISC-V-based processor, GAP9 from Greeenwaves, and the Physionet EEG Motor Imagery dataset, we demonstrate a remarkable accuracy gain of up to 7.31\% with respect to the baseline with a memory footprint of 15.6 KByte. Furthermore, by optimizing the input stream, we achieve enhanced real-time performance without compromising inference accuracy. Our tailored approach exhibits inference time of 14.9 ms and 0.76 mJ per single inference and 20 us and 0.83 uJ per single update during online training. These findings highlight the feasibility of our method for edge EEG devices as well as other battery-powered wearable AI systems suffering from subject-dependant feature distribution drift.</description>

      <title>A Lightweight Human Pose Estimation Approach for Edge Computing-Enabled Metaverse with Compressive Sensing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.00087</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.00087v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The ability to estimate 3D movements of users over edge computing-enabled networks, such as 5G/6G networks, is a key enabler for the new era of extended reality (XR) and Metaverse applications. Recent advancements in deep learning have shown advantages over optimization techniques for estimating 3D human poses given spare measurements from sensor signals, i.e., inertial measurement unit (IMU) sensors attached to the XR devices. However, the existing works lack applicability to wireless systems, where transmitting the IMU signals over noisy wireless networks poses significant challenges. Furthermore, the potential redundancy of the IMU signals has not been considered, resulting in highly redundant transmissions. In this work, we propose a novel approach for redundancy removal and lightweight transmission of IMU signals over noisy wireless environments. Our approach utilizes a random Gaussian matrix to transform the original signal into a lower-dimensional space. By leveraging the compressive sensing theory, we have proved that the designed Gaussian matrix can project the signal into a lower-dimensional space and preserve the Set-Restricted Eigenvalue condition, subject to a power transmission constraint. Furthermore, we develop a deep generative model at the receiver to recover the original IMU signals from noisy compressed data, thus enabling the creation of 3D human body movements at the receiver for XR and Metaverse applications. Simulation results on a real-world IMU dataset show that our framework can achieve highly accurate 3D human poses of the user using only $82\%$ of the measurements from the original signals. This is comparable to an optimization-based approach, i.e., Lasso, but is an order of magnitude faster.</description>

      <title>Towards Sustainable Personalized On-Device Human Activity Recognition with TinyML and Cloud-Enabled Auto Deployment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.00093</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.00093v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Human activity recognition (HAR) holds immense potential for transforming health and fitness monitoring, yet challenges persist in achieving personalized outcomes and sustainability for on-device continuous inferences. This work introduces a wrist-worn smart band designed to address these challenges through a novel combination of on-device TinyML-driven computing and cloud-enabled auto-deployment. Leveraging inertial measurement unit (IMU) sensors and a customized 1D Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) for personalized HAR, users can tailor activity classes to their unique movement styles with minimal calibration. By utilising TinyML for local computations, the smart band reduces the necessity for constant data transmission and radio communication, which in turn lowers power consumption and reduces carbon footprint. This method also enhances the privacy and security of user data by limiting its transmission. Through transfer learning and fine-tuning on user-specific data, the system achieves a 37\% increase in accuracy over generalized models in personalized settings. Evaluation using three benchmark datasets, WISDM, PAMAP2, and the BandX demonstrates its effectiveness across various activity domains. Additionally, this work presents a cloud-supported framework for the automatic deployment of TinyML models to remote wearables, enabling seamless customization and on-device inference, even with limited target data. By combining personalized HAR with sustainable strategies for on-device continuous inferences, this system represents a promising step towards fostering healthier and more sustainable societies worldwide.</description>

      <title>NeuroLM: A Universal Multi-task Foundation Model for Bridging the Gap between Language and EEG Signals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.00101</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.00101v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent advancements for large-scale pre-training with neural signals such as electroencephalogram (EEG) have shown promising results, significantly boosting the development of brain-computer interfaces (BCIs) and healthcare. However, these pre-trained models often require full fine-tuning on each downstream task to achieve substantial improvements, limiting their versatility and usability, and leading to considerable resource wastage. To tackle these challenges, we propose NeuroLM, the first multi-task foundation model that leverages the capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs) by regarding EEG signals as a foreign language, endowing the model with multi-task learning and inference capabilities. Our approach begins with learning a text-aligned neural tokenizer through vector-quantized temporal-frequency prediction, which encodes EEG signals into discrete neural tokens. These EEG tokens, generated by the frozen vector-quantized (VQ) encoder, are then fed into an LLM that learns causal EEG information via multi-channel autoregression. Consequently, NeuroLM can understand both EEG and language modalities. Finally, multi-task instruction tuning adapts NeuroLM to various downstream tasks. We are the first to demonstrate that, by specific incorporation with LLMs, NeuroLM unifies diverse EEG tasks within a single model through instruction tuning. The largest variant NeuroLM-XL has record-breaking 1.7B parameters for EEG signal processing, and is pre-trained on a large-scale corpus comprising approximately 25,000-hour EEG data. When evaluated on six diverse downstream datasets, NeuroLM showcases the huge potential of this multi-task learning paradigm.</description>

      <title>Terahertz Channels in Atmospheric Conditions: Propagation Characteristics and Security Performance</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.00114</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.00114v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: With the growing demand for higher wireless data rates, the interest in extending the carrier frequency of wireless links to the terahertz (THz) range has significantly increased. For long-distance outdoor wireless communications, THz channels may suffer substantial power loss and security issues due to atmospheric weather effects. It is crucial to assess the impact of weather on high-capacity data transmission to evaluate wireless system link budgets and performance accurately. In this article, we provide an insight into the propagation characteristics of THz channels under atmospheric conditions and the security aspects of THz communication systems in future applications. We conduct a comprehensive survey of our recent research and experimental findings on THz channel transmission and physical layer security, synthesizing and categorizing the state-of-the-art research in this domain. Our analysis encompasses various atmospheric phenomena, including molecular absorption, scattering effects, and turbulence, elucidating their intricate interactions with THz waves and the resultant implications for channel modeling and system design. Furthermore, we investigate the unique security challenges posed by THz communications, examining potential vulnerabilities and proposing novel countermeasures to enhance the resilience of these high-frequency systems against eavesdropping and other security threats. Finally, we discuss the challenges and limitations of such high-frequency wireless communications and provide insights into future research prospects for realizing the 6G vision, emphasizing the need for innovative solutions to overcome the atmospheric hurdles and security concerns in THz communications.</description>

      <title>Quantum Kernel Principal Components Analysis for Compact Readout of Chemiresistive Sensor Arrays</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.00115</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.00115v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The rapid growth of Internet of Things (IoT) devices necessitates efficient data compression techniques to handle the vast amounts of data generated by these devices. In this context, chemiresistive sensor arrays (CSAs), a simple-to-fabricate but crucial component in IoT systems, generate large volumes of data due to their simultaneous multi-sensor operations. Classical principal component analysis (cPCA) methods, a common solution to the data compression challenge, face limitations in preserving critical information during dimensionality reduction. In this study, we present quantum principal component analysis (qPCA) as a superior alternative to enhance information retention. Our findings demonstrate that qPCA outperforms cPCA in various back-end machine-learning modeling tasks, particularly in low-dimensional scenarios when limited Quantum bits (qubits) can be accessed. These results underscore the potential of noisy intermediate-scale quantum (NISQ) computers, despite current qubit limitations, to revolutionize data processing in real-world IoT applications, particularly in enhancing the efficiency and reliability of CSA data compression and readout.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.00118</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.00118v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study explores the use of historical data from Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS) scintillation monitoring receivers to predict the severity of amplitude scintillation, a phenomenon where electron density irregularities in the ionosphere cause fluctuations in GNSS signal power. These fluctuations can be measured using the S4 index, but real-time data is not always available. The research focuses on developing a machine learning (ML) model that can forecast the intensity of amplitude scintillation, categorizing it into low, medium, or high severity levels based on various time and space-related factors. Among six different ML models tested, the XGBoost model emerged as the most effective, demonstrating a remarkable 77% prediction accuracy when trained with a balanced dataset. This work underscores the effectiveness of machine learning in enhancing the reliability and performance of GNSS signals and navigation systems by accurately predicting amplitude scintillation severity.</description>

      <title>BELT-2: Bootstrapping EEG-to-Language representation alignment for multi-task brain decoding</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.00121</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.00121v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The remarkable success of large language models (LLMs) across various multi-modality applications is well established. However, integrating large language models with humans, or brain dynamics, remains relatively unexplored. In this paper, we introduce BELT-2, a pioneering multi-task model designed to enhance both encoding and decoding performance from EEG signals. To bolster the quality of the EEG encoder, BELT-2 is the first work to innovatively 1) adopt byte-pair encoding (BPE)-level EEG-language alignment and 2) integrate multi-task training and decoding in the EEG domain. Inspired by the idea of \textbf{\textit{Bridging the Brain with GPT}}, we further connect the multi-task EEG encoder with LLMs by utilizing prefix-tuning on intermediary output from the EEG encoder. These innovative efforts make BELT-2 a pioneering breakthrough, making it the first work in the field capable of decoding coherent and readable sentences from non-invasive brain signals. Our experiments highlight significant advancements over prior techniques in both quantitative and qualitative measures, achieving a decoding performance with a BLEU-1 score of 52.2\% on the ZuCo dataset. Furthermore, BELT-2 shows a remarkable improvement ranging from 31\% to 162\% on other translation benchmarks.

      <title>Brant-X: A Unified Physiological Signal Alignment Framework</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.00122</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.00122v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Physiological signals serve as indispensable clues for understanding various physiological states of human bodies. Most existing works have focused on a single type of physiological signals for a range of application scenarios. However, as the body is a holistic biological system, the inherent interconnection among various physiological data should not be neglected. In particular, given the brain's role as the control center for vital activities, electroencephalogram (EEG) exhibits significant correlations with other physiological signals. Therefore, the correlation between EEG and other physiological signals holds potential to improve performance in various scenarios. Nevertheless, achieving this goal is still constrained by several challenges: the scarcity of simultaneously collected physiological data, the differences in correlations between various signals, and the correlation differences between various tasks. To address these issues, we propose a unified physiological signal alignment framework, Brant-X, to model the correlation between EEG and other signals. Our approach (1) employs the EEG foundation model to data-efficiently transfer the rich knowledge in EEG to other physiological signals, and (2) introduces the two-level alignment to fully align the semantics of EEG and other signals from different semantic scales. In the experiments, Brant-X achieves state-of-the-art performance compared with task-agnostic and task-specific baselines on various downstream tasks in diverse scenarios, including sleep stage classification, emotion recognition, freezing of gaits detection, and eye movement communication. Moreover, the analysis on the arrhythmia detection task and the visualization in case study further illustrate the effectiveness of Brant-X in the knowledge transfer from EEG to other physiological signals.

      <title>Leveraging Large Language Models for Wireless Symbol Detection via In-Context Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.00124</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.00124v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Deep neural networks (DNNs) have made significant strides in tackling challenging tasks in wireless systems, especially when an accurate wireless model is not available. However, when available data is limited, traditional DNNs often yield subpar results due to underfitting. At the same time, large language models (LLMs) exemplified by GPT-3, have remarkably showcased their capabilities across a broad range of natural language processing tasks. But whether and how LLMs can benefit challenging non-language tasks in wireless systems is unexplored. In this work, we propose to leverage the in-context learning ability (a.k.a. prompting) of LLMs to solve wireless tasks in the low data regime without any training or fine-tuning, unlike DNNs which require training. We further demonstrate that the performance of LLMs varies significantly when employed with different prompt templates. To solve this issue, we employ the latest LLM calibration methods. Our results reveal that using LLMs via ICL methods generally outperforms traditional DNNs on the symbol demodulation task and yields highly confident predictions when coupled with calibration techniques.</description>

      <title>Mirror contrastive loss based sliding window transformer for subject-independent motor imagery based EEG signal recognition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.00130</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.00130v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: While deep learning models have been extensively utilized in motor imagery based EEG signal recognition, they often operate as black boxes. Motivated by neurological findings indicating that the mental imagery of left or right-hand movement induces event-related desynchronization (ERD) in the contralateral sensorimotor area of the brain, we propose a Mirror Contrastive Loss based Sliding Window Transformer (MCL-SWT) to enhance subject-independent motor imagery-based EEG signal recognition. Specifically, our proposed mirror contrastive loss enhances sensitivity to the spatial location of ERD by contrasting the original EEG signals with their mirror counterparts-mirror EEG signals generated by interchanging the channels of the left and right hemispheres of the EEG signals. Moreover, we introduce a temporal sliding window transformer that computes self-attention scores from high temporal resolution features, thereby improving model performance with manageable computational complexity. We evaluate the performance of MCL-SWT on subject-independent motor imagery EEG signal recognition tasks, and our experimental results demonstrate that MCL-SWT achieved accuracies of 66.48% and 75.62%, surpassing the state-of-the-art (SOTA) model by 2.82% and 2.17%, respectively. Furthermore, ablation experiments confirm the effectiveness of the proposed mirror contrastive loss. A code demo of MCL-SWT is available at https://github.com/roniusLuo/MCL_SWT.</description>

      <title>Graph neural network-based lithium-ion battery state of health estimation using partial discharging curve</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.00141</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.00141v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Data-driven methods have gained extensive attention in estimating the state of health (SOH) of lithium-ion batteries. Accurate SOH estimation requires degradation-relevant features and alignment of statistical distributions between training and testing datasets. However, current research often overlooks these needs and relies on arbitrary voltage segment selection. To address these challenges, this paper introduces an innovative approach leveraging spatio-temporal degradation dynamics via graph convolutional networks (GCNs). Our method systematically selects discharge voltage segments using the Matrix Profile anomaly detection algorithm, eliminating the need for manual selection and preventing information loss. These selected segments form a fundamental structure integrated into the GCN-based SOH estimation model, capturing inter-cycle dynamics and mitigating statistical distribution incongruities between offline training and online testing data. Validation with a widely accepted open-source dataset demonstrates that our method achieves precise SOH estimation, with a root mean squared error of less than 1%.</description>

      <title>Analysis of Status Update in Wireless Networks with Successive Interference Cancellation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.00277</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.00277v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Data collection in an IoT environment requires simple and effective communication solutions to address resource constraints, ensure network efficiency, while achieving scalability. Efficiency is evaluated based on the timeliness of collected data (Age of Information), the energy spent per delivered unit of data, and the effectiveness in utilizing spectrum resources. This paper addresses a random multiple access adaptive system, in which a large number of devices send sporadic messages in non-periodic pattern. In particular, our analysis highlights the potential of Successive Interference Cancellation and identifies an adaptive parameter setting to maximize its benefits as the level of contention on the shared channel varies. An analytical model is defined, easily scalable with the number of nodes and yielding all the relevant metrics. Evidence of the accuracy of the model is given by comparing predicted results against simulations. The model is utilized to assess the trade-off between Age of Information and energy consumption, revealing a sharp relationship between the two. The considered approach lends itself to many generalizations and applications to massive machine-type communications and IoT networks.</description>

      <title>Fast Capacity Estimation in Ultra-dense Wireless Networks with Random Interference</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.00337</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.00337v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In wireless communication systems, the accurate and reliable evaluation of channel capacity is believed to be a fundamental and critical issue for terminals. However, with the rapid development of wireless technology, large-scale communication networks with significant random interference have emerged, resulting in extremely high computational costs for capacity calculation. In ultra-dense wireless networks with extremely large numbers of base stations (BSs) and users, we provide fast estimation methods for determining the capacity. We consider two scenarios according to the ratio of the number of users to the number of BSs, $\beta_m$. First, when $\beta_m\leq1$, the FIsher-Spiked Estimation (FISE) algorithm is proposed to determine the capacity by modeling the channel matrix with random interference as a Fisher matrix. Second, when $\beta_m&gt;1$, based on a closed-form expression for capacity estimation requiring solely simple computations, we prove that this estimation stabilizes and remains invariant with increasing $\beta_m$. Our methods can guarantee high accuracy on capacity estimation with low complexity, which is faster than the existing methods. Furthermore, our approaches exhibit excellent generality, free of network area shapes, BS and user distributions, and sub-network locations. Extensive simulation experiments across various scenarios demonstrate the high accuracy and robustness of our methods.</description>

      <title>Leaky Wave Antenna-Equipped RF Chipless Tags for Orientation Estimation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.00501</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.00501v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Accurate orientation estimation of an object in a scene is critical in robotics, aerospace, augmented reality, and medicine, as it supports scene understanding. This paper introduces a novel orientation estimation approach leveraging radio frequency (RF) sensing technology and leaky-wave antennas (LWAs). Specifically, we propose a framework for a radar system to estimate the orientation of a \textit{dumb} LWA-equipped backscattering tag, marking the first exploration of this method in the literature. Our contributions include a comprehensive framework for signal modeling and orientation estimation with multi-subcarrier transmissions, and the formulation of a maximum likelihood estimator (MLE). Moreover, we analyze the impact of imperfect tag location information, revealing that it minimally affects estimation accuracy. Exploiting related results, we propose an approximate MLE and introduce a low-complexity radiation-pointing angle-based estimator with near-optimal performance. We derive the feasible orientation estimation region of the latter and show that it depends mainly on the system bandwidth. Our analytical results are validated through Monte Carlo simulations and reveal that the low-complexity estimator achieves near-optimal accuracy and that its feasible orientation estimation region is also approximately shared by the other estimators. Finally, we show that the optimal number of subcarriers increases with sensing time under a power budget constraint.</description>

      <title>Over-the-Air Computation in Cell-Free Massive MIMO Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.00517</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.00517v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Over-the-air computation (AirComp) is considered as a communication-efficient solution for data aggregation and distributed learning by exploiting the superposition properties of wireless multi-access channels. However, AirComp is significantly affected by the uneven signal attenuation experienced by different wireless devices. Recently, Cell-free Massive MIMO (mMIMO) has emerged as a promising technology to provide uniform coverage and high rates by joint coherent transmission. In this paper, we investigate AirComp in Cell-free mMIMO systems, taking into account spatially correlated fading and channel estimation errors. In particular, we propose optimal designs of transmit coefficients and receive combing at different levels of cooperation among access points. Numerical results demonstrate that Cell-free mMIMO using fully centralized processing significantly outperforms conventional Cellular mMIMO with regard to the mean squared error (MSE). Moreover, we show that Cell-free mMIMO using local processing and large-scale fading decoding can achieve a lower MSE than Cellular mMIMO when the wireless devices have limited power budgets.</description>

      <title>Enhancing Multi-Stream Beamforming Through CQIs For 5G NR FDD Massive MIMO Communications: A Tuning-Free Scheme</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.00716</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.00716v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the fifth-generation new radio (5G NR) frequency division duplex (FDD) massive multiple-input and multiple-output (MIMO) systems, downlink beamforming relies on the acquisition of downlink channel state information (CSI). Codebook based limited feedback schemes have been proposed and widely used in practice to recover the downlink CSI with low communication overhead. In such schemes, the performance of downlink beamforming is determined by the codebook design and the codebook indicator feedback. However, limited by the quantization quality of the codebook, directly utilizing the codeword indicated by the feedback as the beamforming vector cannot achieve high performance. Therefore, other feedback values, such as channel qualification indicator (CQI), should be considered to enhance beamforming. In this paper, we present the relation between CQI and the optimal beamforming vectors, based on which an empirical Bayes based intelligent tuning-free algorithm is devised to learn the optimal beamforming vector and the associated regularization parameter. The proposed algorithm can handle different communication scenarios of MIMO systems, including single stream and multiple streams data transmission scenarios. Numerical results have shown the excellent performance of the proposed algorithm in terms of both beamforming vector acquisition and regularization parameter learning.</description>

      <title>Estimating Channels With Hundreds of Sub-Paths for MU-MIMO Uplink: A Structured High-Rank Tensor Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.00723</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.00723v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This letter introduces a structured high-rank tensor approach for estimating sub-6G uplink channels in multi-user multiple-input and multiple-output (MU-MIMO) systems. To tackle the difficulty of channel estimation in sub-6G bands with hundreds of sub-paths, our approach fully exploits the physical structure of channel and establishes the link between sub-6G channel model and a high-rank four-dimensional (4D) tensor Canonical Polyadic Decomposition (CPD) with three factor matrices being Vandermonde-constrained. Accordingly, a stronger uniqueness property is derived in this work. This model supports an efficient one-pass algorithm for estimating sub-path parameters, which ensures plug-in compatibility with the widely-used baseline. Our method performs much better than the state-of-the-art tensor-based techniques on the simulations adhering to the 3GPP 5G protocols.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.00724</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.00724v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Cardiac auscultation, an integral tool in diagnosing cardiovascular diseases (CVDs), often relies on the subjective interpretation of clinicians, presenting a limitation in consistency and accuracy. Addressing this, we introduce the BUET Multi-disease Heart Sound (BMD-HS) dataset - a comprehensive and meticulously curated collection of heart sound recordings. This dataset, encompassing 864 recordings across five distinct classes of common heart sounds, represents a broad spectrum of valvular heart diseases, with a focus on diagnostically challenging cases. The standout feature of the BMD-HS dataset is its innovative multi-label annotation system, which captures a diverse range of diseases and unique disease states. This system significantly enhances the dataset's utility for developing advanced machine learning models in automated heart sound classification and diagnosis. By bridging the gap between traditional auscultation practices and contemporary data-driven diagnostic methods, the BMD-HS dataset is poised to revolutionize CVD diagnosis and management, providing an invaluable resource for the advancement of cardiac health research. The dataset is publicly available at this link: https://github.com/mHealthBuet/BMD-HS-Dataset.</description>

      <title>Misaligned Over-The-Air Computation of Multi-Sensor Data with Wiener-Denoiser Network</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.00738</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.00738v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In data driven deep learning, distributed sensing and joint computing bring heavy load for computing and communication. To face the challenge, over-the-air computation (OAC) has been proposed for multi-sensor data aggregation, which enables the server to receive a desired function of massive sensing data during communication. However, the strict synchronization and accurate channel estimation constraints in OAC are hard to be satisfied in practice, leading to time and channel-gain misalignment. The paper formulates the misalignment problem as a non-blind image deblurring problem. At the receiver side, we first use the Wiener filter to deblur, followed by a U-Net network designed for further denoising. Our method is capable to exploit the inherent correlations in the signal data via learning, thus outperforms traditional methods in term of accuracy.

      <title>Leveraging parallelizability and channel structure in THz-band, Tbps channel-code decoding</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.00797</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.00797v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: As advancements close the gap between current device capabilities and the requirements for terahertz (THz)-band communications, the demand for terabit-per-second (Tbps) circuits is on the rise. This paper addresses the challenge of achieving Tbps data rates in THz-band communications by focusing on the baseband computation bottleneck. We propose leveraging parallel processing and pseudo-soft information (PSI) across multicarrier THz channels for efficient channel code decoding. We map bits to transmission resources using shorter code-words to enhance parallelizability and reduce complexity. Additionally, we integrate channel state information into PSI to alleviate the processing overhead of soft decoding. Results demonstrate that PSI-aided decoding of 64-bit code-words halves the complexity of 128-bit hard decoding under comparable effective rates, while introducing a 4 dB gain at a $10^{-3}$ block error rate. The proposed scheme approximates soft decoding with significant complexity reduction at a graceful performance cost.</description>

      <title>DMRA: An Adaptive Line Spectrum Estimation Method through Dynamical Multi-Resolution of Atoms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.00799</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.00799v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We proposed a novel dense line spectrum super-resolution algorithm, the DMRA, that leverages dynamical multi-resolution of atoms technique to address the limitation of traditional compressed sensing methods when handling dense point-source signals. The algorithm utilizes a smooth $\tanh$ relaxation function to replace the $\ell_0$ norm, promoting sparsity and jointly estimating the frequency atoms and complex gains. To reduce computational complexity and improve frequency estimation accuracy, a two-stage strategy was further introduced to dynamically adjust the number of the optimized degrees of freedom. The strategy first increases candidate frequencies through local refinement, then applies a sparse selector to eliminate insignificant frequencies, thereby adaptively adjusting the degrees of freedom to improve estimation accuracy. Theoretical analysis were provided to validate the proposed method for multi-parameter estimations. Computational results demonstrated that this algorithm achieves good super-resolution performance in various practical scenarios and outperforms the state-of-the-art methods in terms of frequency estimation accuracy and computational efficiency.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.00836v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The precision of link-level theoretical performance analysis for emerging wireless communication paradigms is critical. Recent studies have demonstrated the excellent fitting capabilities of the mixture gamma (MG) distribution in representing small-scale fading in outdoor terahertz (THz)-band scenarios. Our study establishes an in-depth performance analysis for outdoor point-to-point THz links under realistic configurations, incorporating MG small-scale fading combined with the misalignment effect. We derive closed-form expressions for the bit-error probability, outage probability, and ergodic capacity. Furthermore, we conduct an asymptotic analysis of these metrics at high signal-to-noise ratios and derive the necessary convergence conditions. Simulation results, leveraging precise measurement-based channel parameters in various configurations, closely align with the derived analytical equations.</description>

      <title>Throughput Optimization in Cache-aided Networks: An Opportunistic Probing and Scheduling Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.00905</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.00905v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper addresses the challenges of throughput optimization in wireless cache-aided cooperative networks. We propose an opportunistic cooperative probing and scheduling strategy for efficient content delivery. The strategy involves the base station probing the relaying channels and cache states of multiple cooperative nodes, thereby enabling opportunistic user scheduling for content delivery. Leveraging the theory of Sequentially Planned Decision (SPD) optimization, we dynamically formulate decisions on cooperative probing and stopping time. Our proposed Reward Expected Thresholds (RET)-based strategy optimizes opportunistic probing and scheduling. This approach significantly enhances system throughput by exploiting gains from local caching, cooperative transmission and time diversity. Simulations confirm the effectiveness and practicality of the proposed Media Access Control (MAC) strategy.</description>

      <title>Convolutional Beamspace Beamforming for Low-Complexity Far-Field and Near-Field MU-MIMO Communications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.00925</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.00925v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Inter-user interference (IUI) mitigation has been an essential issue for multi-user multiple-input multiple-output (MU-MIMO) communications. The commonly used linear processing schemes include the maximum-ratio combining (MRC), zero-forcing (ZF) and minimum mean squared error (MMSE) beamforming, which may result in the unfavorable performance or complexity as the antenna number grows. In this paper, we introduce a low-complexity linear beamforming solution for the IUI mitigation by using the convolutional beamspace (CBS) technique. Specifically, the dimension of channel matrix can be significantly reduced via the CBS preprocessing, thanks to its beamspace and spatial filtering effects. However, existing methods of the spatial filter design mainly benefit from the Vandermonde structure of channel matrix, which only holds for the far-field scenario with the uniform plane wave (UPW) model. As the antenna size increases, this characteristic may vanish in the near-field region of the array, where the uniform spherical wave (USW) propagation becomes dominant. To gain useful insights, we first investigate the beamforming design and performance analysis of the CBS-based beamforming based on the UPW model. Our results unveil that the proposed CBS-based MMSE beamforming is able to achieve a near-optimal performance but demands remarkably lower complexity than classical ZF and MMSE schemes. Furthermore, our analysis is also extended to the near-field case. To this end, a novel optimization-based CBS approach is proposed for preserving spatial filtering effects, thus rendering the compatibility of the CBS-based beamforming. Finally, numerical results are provided to demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed CBS-based beamforming method.</description>

      <title>Windowing Optimization for Fingerprint-Spectrum-Based Passive Sensing in Perceptive Mobile Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.00950</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.00950v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Perceptive mobile networks (PMN) have been widely recognized as a pivotal pillar for the sixth generation (6G) mobile communication systems. However, the asynchronicity between transmitters and receivers results in velocity and range ambiguity, which seriously degrades the sensing performance. To mitigate the ambiguity, carrier frequency offset (CFO) and time offset (TO) synchronizations have been studied in the literature. However, their performance can be significantly affected by the specific choice of the window functions harnessed. Hence, we set out to find superior window functions capable of improving the performance of CFO and TO estimation algorithms. We firstly derive a near-optimal window, and the theoretical synchronization mean square error (MSE) when utilizing this window. However, since this window is not practically achievable, we then test a practical "window function" by utilizing the multiple signal classification (MUSIC) algorithm, which may lead to excellent synchronization performance.</description>

      <title>Clutter Suppression, Time-Frequency Synchronization, and Sensing Parameter Association in Asynchronous Perceptive Vehicular Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.00969</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.00969v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Significant challenges remain for realizing precise positioning and velocity estimation in perceptive vehicular networks (PVN) enabled by the emerging integrated sensing and communication technology. First, complicated wireless propagation environment generates undesired clutter, which degrades the vehicular sensing performance and increases the computational complexity. Second, in practical PVN, multiple types of parameters individually estimated are not well associated with specific vehicles, which may cause error propagation in multiple-vehicle positioning. Third, radio transceivers in a PVN are naturally asynchronous, which causes strong range and velocity ambiguity. To overcome these challenges, 1) we introduce a moving target indication based joint clutter suppression and sensing algorithm, and analyze its clutter-suppression performance and the Cramer-Rao lower bound of the paired range-velocity estimation upon using the proposed clutter suppression algorithm; 2) we design algorithms for associating individual direction-of-arrival estimates with the paired range-velocity estimates based on "domain transformation"; 3) we propose the first viable carrier frequency offset (CFO) and time offset (TO) estimation algorithm that supports passive vehicular sensing in non-line-of-sight environments. This algorithm treats the delay-Doppler spectrum of the signals reflected by static objects as an environment-specific "fingerprint spectrum", which is shown to exhibit a circular shift property upon changing the CFO and/or TO. Then, the CFO and TO are efficiently estimated by acquiring the number of circular shifts, and we also analyse the mean squared error performance of the proposed time-frequency synchronization algorithm. Simulation results demonstrate the performance advantages of our algorithms under diverse configurations, while corroborating the theoretical analysis.</description>

      <title>Monitoring of water sorption and swelling of potato starch-glycerol extruded blend by magnetic resonance imaging and multivariate curve resolution</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.01018</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.01018v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Magnetic resonance microimaging (MR mu I) is an outstanding technique for studying water transfers in millimetric bio-based materials in a non-destructive and non-invasive manner. However, depending on the composition of the material, monitoring and quantification of these transfers can be very complex, and hence reliable image processing and analysis tools are necessary. In this study, a combination of MR mu I and multivariate curve resolution-alternating least squares (MCR-ALS) is proposed to monitor the water ingress into a potato starch extruded blend containing 20% glycerol that was shown to have interesting properties for biomedical, textile, and food applications. In this work, the main purpose of MCR is to provide spectral signatures and distribution maps of the components involved in the water uptake process that occurs over time with various kinetics. This approach allowed the description of the system evolution at a global (image) and a local (pixel) level, hence, permitted the resolution of two waterfronts, at two different times into the blend that could not be resolved by any other mathematical processing method usually used in magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). The results were supplemented by scanning electron microscopy (SEM) observations in order to interpret these two waterfronts in a biological and physico-chemical point of view.</description>

      <title>Massive Random Access in Cell-Free Massive MIMO Systems for High-Speed Mobility with OTFS Modulation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.01111</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.01111v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the research of next-generation wireless communication technologies, orthogonal time frequency space (OTFS) modulation is emerging as a promising technique for high-speed mobile environments due to its superior efficiency and robustness in doubly selective channels. Additionally, the cell-free architecture, which eliminates the issues associated with cell boundaries, offers broader coverage for radio access networks. By combining cell-free network architecture with OTFS modulation, the system may meet the demands of massive random access required by machine-type communication devices in high-speed scenarios. This paper explores a massive random access scheme based on OTFS modulation within a cell-free architecture. A transceiver model for uplink OTFS signals involving multiple access points (APs) is developed, where channel estimation with fractional channel parameters is approximated as a block sparse matrix recovery problem. Building on existing superimposed and embedded preamble schemes, a hybrid preamble scheme is proposed. This scheme leverages superimposed and embedded preambles to respectively achieve rough and accurate active user equipment (UEs) detection (AUD), as well as precise channel estimation, under the condition of supporting a large number of access UEs. Moreover, this study introduces a generalized approximate message passing and pattern coupling sparse Bayesian learning with Laplacian prior (GAMP-PCSBL-La) algorithm, which effectively captures block sparse features after discrete cosine transform (DCT), delivering precise estimation results with reduced computational complexity. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed scheme is effective and provides superior performance compared to other existing schemes.</description>

      <title>Orthogonal Time Frequency Multiplexing (OTFDM): A Novel Waveform Targeted for IMT-2030</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.01114</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.01114v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The rapid evolution of the International Mobile Telecommunications (IMT) landscape has prompted the International Telecommunications Union Working Party 5D (ITU WP5D) to outline the framework for IMT-2030 and beyond. This next-generation initiative seeks to meet the diverse demands of future networks, with key objectives including hyper-low latency, enhanced energy efficiency, and robust support for high mobility. Current 5th generation (5G) technologies employ waveforms like Orthogonal Frequency Division Multiplexing (OFDM) and Discrete Fourier Transform Spread Orthogonal Frequency Division Multiplexing (DFT-s-OFDM). However, these waveforms are insufficient to fully meet the stringent requirements of next-generation communication systems. This paper introduces a novel waveform, Orthogonal Time Frequency Division Multiplexing (OTFDM), designed to address the limitations of existing waveforms. OTFDM achieves ultra-low latency by enabling single-shot transmission of data and Reference Signals (RS) within a single symbol. Furthermore, OTFDM supports high mobility with improved resilience to Doppler shifts and enhances power amplifier efficiency through its low Peak-to-Average Power Ratio (PAPR) characteristics. The proposed waveform incorporates advanced signal processing techniques, including time-frequency multiplexing and frequency domain spectrum shaping, to mitigate inter-symbol interference (ISI). These techniques enable accurate per-symbol channel estimation, thus supporting higher-order modulations even at higher user speeds. Extensive simulations validate the efficacy of OTFDM, demonstrating its capability to support user speeds up to 500 Km/h with minimal RS overhead. This paper explores the technical aspects of OTFDM and discusses its potential implications for the next-generation wireless communication systems.</description>

      <title>Energy Harvesting Characterization in Cell-Free Massive MIMO Using Markov Chains</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.01127</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.01127v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper explores a discrete energy state transition model for energy harvesting (EH) in cell-free massive multiple-input multiple-output (CF-mMIMO) networks. Multiple-antenna access points (APs) provide wireless power and information to single-antenna UE equipment (UEs). The harvested energy at the UEs is used for both uplink (UL) training and data transmission. We investigate the energy transition probabilities based on the energy differential achieved in each coherence interval. A Markov chain-based stochastic process is introduced to characterize the evolving UE energy status. A detailed statistical model is developed for a non-linear EH circuit at the UEs, using the derived closed-form expressions for the mean and variance of the harvested energy. More specifically, simulation results confirm that the proposed Gamma distribution approximation can accurately capture the statistical behavior of the harvested energy. Furthermore, the energy state transitions are evaluated using the proposed Markov chain-based framework, while mathematical expressions for the self, positive and negative transition probabilities of the discrete energy states are also presented. Our numerical results depict that increasing the number of APs with a constant number of service antennas provides significant improvement in the positive energy state transition and reduces the negative transition probabilities of the overall network.</description>

      <title>Coordinated Half-Duplex/Full-Duplex Cooperative Rate-Splitting Multiple Access in Multi-Cell Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.01263</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.01263v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper explores downlink Cooperative Rate-Splitting Multiple Access (C-RSMA) in a multi-cell wireless network with the assistance of Joint-Transmission Coordinated Multipoint (JT-CoMP). In this network, each cell consists of a base station (BS) equipped with multiple antennas, one or more cell-center users (CCU), and multiple cell-edge users (CEU) located at the edge of the cells. Through JT-CoMP, all the BSs collaborate to simultaneously transmit the data to all the users including the CCUs and CEUs. To enhance the signal quality for the CEUs, CCUs relay the common stream to the CEUs by operating in either half-duplex (HD) or full-duplex (FD) decode-and-forward (DF) relaying mode. In this setup, we aim to jointly optimize the beamforming vectors at the BS, the allocation of common stream rates, the transmit power at relaying users, i.e., CCUs, and the time slot fraction, aiming to maximize the minimum achievable data rate. However, the formulated optimization problem is non-convex and is challenging to solve directly. To address this challenge, we employ change-of-variables, first-order Taylor approximations, and a low-complexity algorithm based on Successive Convex Approximation (SCA). We demonstrate through simulation results the efficacy of the proposed scheme, in terms of average achievable data rate, and we compare its performance to that of four baseline schemes, including HD/FD cooperative non-orthogonal multiple access (C-NOMA), NOMA, and RSMA without user cooperation. The results show that the proposed FD C-RSMA can achieve 25% over FD C-NOMA and the proposed HD C-RSMA can achieve 19% over HD C-NOMA respectively, when the BS transmit power is 20 dBm.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.01631v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper presents an analytical analysis of the Doppler spectrum in von Mises-Fisher (vMF) scattering channels. A closed-form expression for the Doppler spectrum is derived and used to investigate the impact of vMF scattering parameters, i.e., the mean direction and the degree of concentration of scatterers. The spectrum is observed to exhibit exponential behavior for the mobile antenna motion parallel to the mean direction of scatterers, while conforming to a Gaussian-like shape for the perpendicular motion. The validity of the obtained results is verified by comparison against the results of Monte Carlo simulations, where an exact match is observed.</description>

      <title>A novel and efficient parameter estimation of the Lognormal-Rician turbulence model based on k-Nearest Neighbor and data generation method</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.01694</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.01694v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we propose a novel and efficient parameter estimator based on $k$-Nearest Neighbor ($k$NN) and data generation method for the Lognormal-Rician turbulence channel. The Kolmogorov-Smirnov (KS) goodness-of-fit statistical tools are employed to investigate the validity of $k$NN approximation under different channel conditions and it is shown that the choice of $k$ plays a significant role in the approximation accuracy. We present several numerical results to illustrate that solving the constructed objective function can provide a reasonable estimate for the actual values. The accuracy of the proposed estimator is investigated in terms of the mean square error. The simulation results show that increasing the number of generation samples by two orders of magnitude does not lead to a significant improvement in estimation performance when solving the optimization problem by the gradient descent algorithm. However, the estimation performance under the genetic algorithm (GA) approximates to that of the saddlepoint approximation and expectation-maximization estimators. Therefore, combined with the GA, we demonstrate that the proposed estimator achieves the best tradeoff between the computation complexity and the accuracy.</description>

      <title>Frugal RIS-aided 3D Localization with CFO under LoS and NLoS Conditions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.01797</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.01797v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we investigate 3-D localization and frequency synchronization with multiple reconfigurable intelligent surfaces (RISs) in the presence of carrier frequency offset (CFO) for a stationary user equipment (UE). In line with the 6G goals of sustainability and efficiency, we focus on a frugal communication scenario with minimal spatial and spectral resources (i.e., narrowband single-input single-ouput system), considering both the presence and blockage of the line-of-sight (LoS) path between the base station (BS) and the UE. We design a generalized likelihood ratio test (GLRT)-based LoS detector, channel parameter estimation and localization algorithms, with varying complexity. To verify the efficiency of our estimators, we compare the root mean-squared error (RMSE) to the Cram\'er- Rao bound (CRB) of the unknown parameters. We also evaluate the sensitivity of our algorithms to the presence of uncontrolled multi-path components (MPC) and various levels of CFO. Simulation results showcase the effectiveness of the proposed algorithms under minimal hardware and spectral requirements, and a wide range of operating conditions, thereby confirming the viability of RIS-aided frugal localization in 6G scenarios.</description>

      <title>Inverting the sound speed profile from multi-beam echo sounder data and historical measurements -- a simulation study</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.01933</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.01933v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The ocean's opacity poses challenges for security, as new technology, e.g. underwater drones, offers new opportunities for illegal activities, such as smuggling and terrorism. A network of unmanned surface vehicles (USV) and autonomous underwater vehicles (AUV) offers a potential underwater surveillance solution, but demands high autonomy and compact hardware. For improved situational awareness and efficient operation, sonar performance models may provide the network with sensor coverage maps, but this requires constantly updated environmental information, in particular the present sound speed profile (SSP).
  We propose the inversion of SSPs from multibeam echo sounder (MBES) data in an environment with known topography. The method exploits the two-way travel time from the MBES to the bottom, comparing the measurements to modelled travel time for a proposed SSP model. An acoustic raytracer models the travel time for the SSP model. The inversion problem is shown to be non-unique when basing the cost function on the two-way travel time alone. This is resolved by incorporating a Tikhonov-type regularization term for inclusion of a priori knowledge on the SSPs in addition to the travel time in the final cost function. Empirical orthogonal functions (EOFs) are derived from a historical SSP data set, and variance for the EOF coefficients are determined from the same data set. The EOF coefficient distributions are assumed Gaussian and used in the regularization term to limit the search space of the inversion algorithm to physically feasible SSPs. A neural network determines the regularization parameters.
  The method's validity and sensitivity to errors is assessed using synthetic sonar data for the Norwegian Trench. The method accurately recovers SSPs with average root mean square errors of 0.83 m/s. For comparison, the error obtained using state-of-the-art climatology (WOA) is 2.6 m/s.</description>

      <title>AttDiCNN: Attentive Dilated Convolutional Neural Network for Automatic Sleep Staging using Visibility Graph and Force-directed Layout</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.01962</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.01962v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Sleep stages play an essential role in the identification of sleep patterns and the diagnosis of sleep disorders. In this study, we present an automated sleep stage classifier termed the Attentive Dilated Convolutional Neural Network (AttDiCNN), which uses deep learning methodologies to address challenges related to data heterogeneity, computational complexity, and reliable automatic sleep staging. We employed a force-directed layout based on the visibility graph to capture the most significant information from the EEG signals, representing the spatial-temporal features. The proposed network consists of three compositors: the Localized Spatial Feature Extraction Network (LSFE), the Spatio-Temporal-Temporal Long Retention Network (S2TLR), and the Global Averaging Attention Network (G2A). The LSFE is tasked with capturing spatial information from sleep data, the S2TLR is designed to extract the most pertinent information in long-term contexts, and the G2A reduces computational overhead by aggregating information from the LSFE and S2TLR. We evaluated the performance of our model on three comprehensive and publicly accessible datasets, achieving state-of-the-art accuracy of 98.56%, 99.66%, and 99.08% for the EDFX, HMC, and NCH datasets, respectively, yet maintaining a low computational complexity with 1.4 M parameters. The results substantiate that our proposed architecture surpasses existing methodologies in several performance metrics, thus proving its potential as an automated tool in clinical settings.</description>

      <title>Wireless Mobile Distributed-MIMO for 6G</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.02055</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.02055v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The paper proposes a new architecture for Distributed MIMO (D-MIMO) in which the base station (BS) jointly transmits with wireless mobile nodes to serve users (UEs) within a cell for 6G communication systems. The novelty of the architecture lies in the wireless mobile nodes participating in joint D-MIMO transmission with the BS (referred to as D-MIMO nodes), which are themselves users on the network. The D-MIMO nodes establish wireless connections with the BS, are generally near the BS, and ideally benefit from higher SNR links and better connections with edge-located UEs. These D-MIMO nodes can be existing handset UEs, Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs), or Vehicular UEs. Since the D-MIMO nodes are users sharing the access channel, the proposed architecture operates in two phases. First, the BS communicates with the D-MIMO nodes to forward data for the joint transmission, and then the BS and D-MIMO nodes jointly serve the UEs through coherent D-MIMO operation. Capacity analysis of this architecture is studied based on realistic 3GPP channel models, and the paper demonstrates that despite the two-phase operation, the proposed architecture enhances the system's capacity compared to the baseline where the BS communicates directly with the UEs.</description>

      <title>Channel Knowledge Map for Cellular-Connected UAV via Binary Bayesian Filtering</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.00016</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.00016v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Channel knowledge map (CKM) is a promising technology to enable environment-aware wireless communications and sensing. Link state map (LSM) is one particular type of CKM that aims to learn the location-specific line-of-sight (LoS) link probability between the transmitter and the receiver at all possible locations, which provides the prior information to enhance the communication quality of dynamic networks. This paper investigates the LSM construction for cellularconnected unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) by utilizing both the expert empirical mathematical model and the measurement data. Specifically, we first model the LSM as a binary spatial random field and its initial distribution is obtained by the empirical model. Then we propose an effective binary Bayesian filter to sequentially update the LSM by using the channel measurement. To efficiently update the LSM, we establish the spatial correlation models of LoS probability on the location pairs in both the distance and angular domains, which are adopted in the Bayesian filter for updating the probabilities at locations without measurements. Simulation results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm for LSM construction, which significantly outperforms the benchmark scheme, especially when the measurements are sparse.</description>

      <title>Objective Features Extracted from Motor Activity Time Series for Food Addiction Analysis Using Machine Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.00310</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.00310v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This study investigates machine learning algorithms to identify objective features for diagnosing food addiction (FA) and assessing confirmed symptoms (SC). Data were collected from 81 participants (mean age: 21.5 years, range: 18-61 years, women: 77.8%) whose FA and SC were measured using the Yale Food Addiction Scale (YFAS). Participants provided demographic and anthropometric data, completed the YFAS, the Zung Self-Rating Depression Scale, and the Dutch Eating Behavior Questionnaire, and wore an actimeter on the non-dominant wrist for a week to record motor activity. Analysis of the actimetric data identified significant statistical and entropy-based features that accurately predicted FA and SC using ML. The Matthews correlation coefficient (MCC) was the primary metric. Activity-related features were more effective for FA prediction (MCC=0.88) than rest-related features (MCC=0.68). For SC, activity segments yielded MCC=0.47, rest segments MCC=0.38, and their combination MCC=0.51. Significant correlations were also found between actimetric features related to FA, emotional, and restrained eating behaviors, supporting the model's validity. Our results support the concept of a human bionic suite composed of IoT devices and ML sensors, which implements health digital assistance with real-time monitoring and analysis of physiological indicators related to FA and SC.</description>

      <title>Resource Management for IRS-Assisted Full-Duplex Integrated Sensing, Communication and Computing Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.00364</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.00364v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we investigate an intelligent reflecting surface (IRS) assisted full-duplex (FD) integrated sensing, communication and computing system. Specifically, an FD base station (BS) provides service for uplink and downlink transmission, and a local cache is connected to the BS through a backhaul link to store data. Meanwhile, active sensing elements are deployed on the IRS to receive target echo signals. On this basis, in order to evaluate the overall performance of the system under consideration, we propose a system utility maximization problem while ensuring the sensing quality, expressed as the difference between the sum of communication throughput, total computation bits (offloading bits and local computation bits) and the total backhaul cost for content delivery. This makes the problem difficult to solve due to the highly non-convex coupling of the optimization variables. To effectively solve this problem, we first design the most effective caching strategy. Then, we develop an algorithm based on weighted minimum mean square error, alternative direction method of multipliers, majorization-minimization framework, semi-definite relaxation techniques, and several complex transformations to jointly solve the optimization variables. Finally, simulation results are provided to verify the utility performance of the proposed algorithm and demonstrate the advantages of the proposed scheme compared with the baseline scheme.</description>

      <title>Generalized Orthogonal Chirp Division Multiplexing in Doubly Selective Channels</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.00402</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.00402v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In recent years, orthogonal chirp division modulation (OCDM) has gained attention as a robust communication waveform due to its strong resistance to both time-domain and frequency-domain interference. However, similar to orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM), OCDM suffers from a high peak-to-average power ratio (PAPR), resulting in increased hardware costs and reduced energy efficiency of the transmitter's power amplifiers. In this work, we introduce a novel unitary transform called the Generalized Discrete Fresnel Transform (GDFnT) and propose a new waveform based on this transform, named Generalized Orthogonal Chirp Division Modulation (GOCDM). In GOCDM, data symbols from the constellation diagram are independently placed in the Generalized Fresnel (GF) domain. We derive the GF-domain channel matrix for the GOCDM system under time-frequency doubly selective channels and leverages the sparsity of the GF-domain channel matrix to design an iterative receiver based on the message-passing algorithm. Simulation results demonstrate that GOCDM achieves better PAPR performance than OCDM without compromising bit error rate (BER) performance.</description>

      <title>Energy-efficient Functional Split in Non-terrestrial Open Radio Access Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.00466</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.00466v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper investigates the integration of Open Radio Access Network (O-RAN) within non-terrestrial networks (NTN), and optimizing the dynamic functional split between Centralized Units (CU) and Distributed Units (DU) for enhanced energy efficiency in the network. We introduce a novel framework utilizing a Deep Q-Network (DQN)-based reinforcement learning approach to dynamically find the optimal RAN functional split option and the best NTN-based RAN network out of the available NTN-platforms according to real-time conditions, traffic demands, and limited energy resources in NTN platforms. This approach supports capability of adapting to various NTN-based RANs across different platforms such as LEO satellites and high-altitude platform stations (HAPS), enabling adaptive network reconfiguration to ensure optimal service quality and energy utilization. Simulation results validate the effectiveness of our method, offering significant improvements in energy efficiency and sustainability under diverse NTN scenarios.</description>

      <title>Rapid Gyroscope Calibration: A Deep Learning Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.00488</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.00488v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Low-cost gyroscope calibration is essential for ensuring the accuracy and reliability of gyroscope measurements. Stationary calibration estimates the deterministic parts of measurement errors. To this end, a common practice is to average the gyroscope readings during a predefined period and estimate the gyroscope bias. Calibration duration plays a crucial role in performance, therefore, longer periods are preferred. However, some applications require quick startup times and calibration is therefore allowed only for a short time. In this work, we focus on reducing low-cost gyroscope calibration time using deep learning methods. We propose a deep-learning framework and explore the possibilities of using multiple real and virtual gyroscopes to improve the calibration performance of single gyroscopes. To train and validate our approach, we recorded a dataset consisting of 169 hours of gyroscope readings, using 24 gyroscopes of two different brands. We also created a virtual dataset consisting of simulated gyroscope readings. The two datasets were used to evaluate our proposed approach. One of our key achievements in this work is reducing gyroscope calibration time by up to 89% using three low-cost gyroscopes.</description>

      <title>Communicating in the Mediumband:What it is and Why it Matters</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.00512</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.00512v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper, based on recent research, articulates the opportunities and challenges posed by an emerging area of study known as ``mediumband wireless communication'', which refers to digital radio-frequency (RF) wireless communication through mediumband channels. This class of channels that falls in the transitional region between the narrowband and broadband channels, in many ways, is unique and shows significant potential. For instance, the effect of a highly unfavourable non-line-of-sight (NLoS) propagation environment can be transformed into a significantly favourable condition without making any intervention on the original propagation environment, but by simply communicating in the mediumband. The more unfavourable a propagation environment for wireless communication, the higher the potential gain by communicating in the mediumband. In this paper, using lay language as much as possible, we elaborate the unique properties of mediumband channels and implications of communicating in the mediumband for wider wireless communication along with some future research directions.</description>

Abstract: We consider the frequency estimation of periodic signals using noisy time-of-arrival (TOA) information with missing (sparse) data contaminated with outliers. We tackle the problem from a mathematical optimization standpoint, formulating it as a linear regression with an unknown increasing integer independent variable and outliers. Assuming an upper bound on the variance of the noise, we derive an online, parallelizable, near-CRLB optimization-based algorithm amortized to a linear complexity. We demonstrate the outstanding robustness of our algorithm to noise and outliers by testing it against diverse randomly generated signals. Our algorithm handles outliers by design and yields precise estimations even with up to 20% of contaminated data.</description>

      <title>Two-Stage Hierarchical and Explainable Feature Selection Framework for Dimensionality Reduction in Sleep Staging</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.00565</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.00565v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Sleep is crucial for human health, and EEG signals play a significant role in sleep research. Due to the high-dimensional nature of EEG signal data sequences, data visualization and clustering of different sleep stages have been challenges. To address these issues, we propose a two-stage hierarchical and explainable feature selection framework by incorporating a feature selection algorithm to improve the performance of dimensionality reduction. Inspired by topological data analysis, which can analyze the structure of high-dimensional data, we extract topological features from the EEG signals to compensate for the structural information loss that happens in traditional spectro-temporal data analysis. Supported by the topological visualization of the data from different sleep stages and the classification results, the proposed features are proven to be effective supplements to traditional features. Finally, we compare the performances of three dimensionality reduction algorithms: Principal Component Analysis (PCA), t-Distributed Stochastic Neighbor Embedding (t-SNE), and Uniform Manifold Approximation and Projection (UMAP). Among them, t-SNE achieved the highest accuracy of 79.8%, but considering the overall performance in terms of computational resources and metrics, UMAP is the optimal choice.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.00634v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The cellular wireless networks are evolving towards acquiring newer capabilities, such as sensing, which will support novel use cases and applications. Many of these require indoor sensing capabilities, which can be realized by exploiting the perturbation in the indoor channel. In this work, we conduct an indoor channel measurement campaign to study these perturbations and develop AI-based algorithms for estimating sensing parameters. We develop several AI methods based on CNN and tree-based ensemble architectures for sensing. We show that the presence of a passive target like a person can be detected from the channel perturbation of a single link with more than 90 % accuracy with a simple CNN based AI algorithm. However, sensing the position of a passive target is far more challenging requiring more complex AI algorithms and deployments. We show that the position of the human in the indoor room can be estimated within the average position error of 0.7 m with a deployment having three links and employing complex AI architecture for position estimation. We also compare the results with the baseline algorithm to demonstrate the utility of the proposed method.</description>

      <title>An Optimized Binning and Probabilistic Slice Sharing Algorithm for Motion Correction in Abdominal DW-MRI</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.00798</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.00798v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Abdominal diffusion-weighted magnetic resonance imaging (DW-MRI) is a powerful, non-invasive technique for characterizing lesions and facilitating early diagnosis. However, respiratory motion during a scan can degrade image quality. Binning image slices into respiratory phases may reduce motion artifacts, but when the standard binning algorithm is applied to DW-MRI, reconstructed volumes are often incomplete because they lack slices along the superior-inferior axis. Missing slices create black stripes within images, and prolonged scan times are required to generate complete volumes. In this study, we propose a new binning algorithm to minimize missing slices. We acquired free-breathing and shallow-breathing abdominal DW-MRI scans on seven volunteers and used our algorithm to correct for motion in free-breathing scans. First, we drew the optimal rigid bin partitions in the respiratory signal using a dynamic programming approach, assigning each slice to one bin. We then designed a probabilistic approach for selecting some slices to belong in two bins. Our proposed binning algorithm resulted in significantly fewer missing slices than standard binning (p&lt;1.0e-16), yielding an average reduction of 82.98+/-6.07%. Our algorithm also improved lesion conspicuity and reduced motion artifacts in DW-MR images and Apparent Diffusion Coefficient (ADC) maps. ADC maps created from free-breathing images corrected for motion with our algorithm showed lower intra-subject variability compared to uncorrected free-breathing and shallow-breathing maps (p&lt;0.001). Additionally, shallow-breathing ADC maps showed more consistency with corrected free-breathing maps rather than uncorrected free-breathing maps (p&lt;0.01). Our proposed binning algorithm's efficacy in reducing missing slices increases anatomical accuracy and allows for shorter acquisition times compared to standard binning.</description>

      <title>Frequency-Position-Fluid Antenna Array for Ultra-dense Connectivity in Terahertz Beamforming Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.00941</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.00941v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The position-fluid antenna (PFA) architecture has become one of the appealing technologies to support ubiquitous connectivity demand in next-generation wireless systems. Specifically, allowing the antenna to adjust its physical position to one of the predefined ports within a fixed region can introduce additional spatial diversity and improve the signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio (SINR). In addition, frequency diversity is also widely-explored through frequency interleaving in the terahertz (THz) band. However, the operating bandwidth of one antenna is usually limited to 10% of the central frequency, which imposes a waste of the ultra-broad bandwidth in the THz band. In light of this, a frequency-position-fluid antenna (FPFA) system is proposed in this paper to facilitate ultra-dense connectivity. Specifically, antennas with non-overlapping operating frequency ranges are deployed at the base station (BS) to expand the total available bandwidth and provide frequency domain diversity, while the PFA-enabled users are capable of providing the spatial domain diversity. The channel model is first derived, based on which a channel correlation-based frequency allocation strategy is proposed. Then, a minimum-projection-based port selection algorithm is developed with singular-value-decomposition (SVD) precoders. Simulation results show that the proposed FPFA architecture exhibits steady performance with an increasing number of users, and outperforms the PFA and the fixed-antenna system in ultra-dense user deployment.</description>

      <title>Uplink Over-the-Air Aggregation for Multi-Model Wireless Federated Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.00978</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.00978v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose an uplink over-the-air aggregation (OAA) method for wireless federated learning (FL) that simultaneously trains multiple models. To maximize the multi-model training convergence rate, we derive an upper bound on the optimality gap of the global model update, and then, formulate an uplink joint transmit-receive beamforming optimization problem to minimize this upper bound. We solve this problem using the block coordinate descent approach, which admits low-complexity closed-form updates. Simulation results show that our proposed multi-model FL with fast OAA substantially outperforms sequentially training multiple models under the conventional single-model approach.</description>

      <title>Kalman Filtering for Precise Indoor Position and Orientation Estimation Using IMU and Acoustics on Riemannian Manifolds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.01002</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.01002v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Indoor tracking and pose estimation, i.e., determining the position and orientation of a moving target, are increasingly important due to their numerous applications. While Inertial Navigation Systems (INS) provide high update rates, their positioning errors can accumulate rapidly over time. To mitigate this, it is common to integrate INS with complementary systems to correct drift and improve accuracy. This paper presents a novel approach that combines INS with an acoustic Riemannian-based localization system to enhance indoor positioning and orientation tracking. The proposed method employs both the Extended Kalman Filter (EKF) and the Unscented Kalman Filter (UKF) for fusing data from the two systems. The Riemannian-based localization system delivers high-accuracy estimates of the target's position and orientation, which are then used to correct the INS data. A new projection algorithm is introduced to map the EKF or UKF output onto the Riemannian manifold, further improving estimation accuracy. Our results show that the proposed methods significantly outperform benchmark algorithms in both position and orientation estimation. The effectiveness of the proposed methods was evaluated through extensive numerical simulations and testing using our in-house experimental setup. These evaluations confirm the superior performance of our approach in practical scenarios.</description>

      <title>Bounds for Joint Detection and Decoding on the Binary-Input AWGN Channel</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.01119</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.01119v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: For asynchronous transmission of short blocks, preambles for packet detection contribute a non-negligible overhead. To reduce the required preamble length, joint detection and decoding (JDD) techniques have been proposed that additionally utilize the payload part of the packet for detection. In this paper, we analyze two instances of JDD, namely hybrid preamble and energy detection (HyPED) and decoder-aided detection (DAD). While HyPED combines the preamble with energy detection for the payload, DAD also uses the output of a channel decoder. For these systems, we propose novel achievability and converse bounds for the rates over the binary-input additive white Gaussian noise (BI-AWGN) channel. Moreover, we derive a general bound on the required blocklength for JDD. Both the theoretical bound and the simulation of practical codebooks show that the rate of DAD quickly approaches that of synchronous transmission.</description>

      <title>Nuclear Atomic Norm for parametric estimation of sparse channels</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.01166</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.01166v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Parametric channel estimation in mmWave not only enables the anticipated large spectral efficiency gains of \acs{MIMO} systems but also reveals important propagation parameters, allowing for a low complexity representation of the channel matrix. In this work, we propose to use atomic norm as a gridless multidimensional spectral estimation approach to address parametric channel estimation where both AoD and AoA are identified. The conditions for recovery of the propagation parameters are given depending on properties of the measurement matrix, and on structural features such as the antenna geometry or the number of scatters to resolve. The proposed methodology is compared against several state-of-the-art parametric approaches.</description>

      <title>Sample Complexity of the Sign-Perturbed Sums Method</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.01243</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.01243v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the sample complexity of the Sign-Perturbed Sums (SPS) method, which constructs exact, non-asymptotic confidence regions for the true system parameters under mild statistical assumptions, such as independent and symmetric noise terms. The standard version of SPS deals with linear regression problems, however, it can be generalized to stochastic linear (dynamical) systems, even with closed-loop setups, and to nonlinear and nonparametric problems, as well. Although the strong consistency of the method was rigorously proven, the sample complexity of the algorithm was only analyzed so far for scalar linear regression problems. In this paper we study the sample complexity of SPS for general linear regression problems. We establish high probability upper bounds for the diameters of SPS confidence regions for finite sample sizes and show that the SPS regions shrink at the same, optimal rate as the classical asymptotic confidence ellipsoids. Finally, the difference between the theoretical bounds and the empirical sizes of SPS confidence regions is investigated experimentally.</description>

      <title>Online Convex Optimization for On-Board Routing in High-Throughput Satellites</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.01488</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.01488v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The rise in low Earth orbit (LEO) satellite Internet services has led to increasing demand, often exceeding available data rates and compromising the quality of service. While deploying more satellites offers a short-term fix, designing higher-performance satellites with enhanced transmission capabilities provides a more sustainable solution. Achieving the necessary high capacity requires interconnecting multiple modem banks within a satellite payload. However, there is a notable gap in research on internal packet routing within extremely high-throughput satellites. To address this, we propose a real-time optimal flow allocation and priority queue scheduling method using online convex optimization-based model predictive control. We model the problem as a multi-commodity flow instance and employ an online interior-point method to solve the routing and scheduling optimization iteratively. This approach minimizes packet loss and supports real-time rerouting with low computational overhead. Our method is tested in simulation on a next-generation extremely high-throughput satellite model, demonstrating its effectiveness compared to a reference batch optimization and to traditional methods.</description>

      <title>Exploring Hannan Limitation for 3D Antenna Array</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.01566</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.01566v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Hannan Limitation successfully links the directivity characteristics of 2D arrays with the aperture gain limit, providing the radiation efficiency upper limit for large 2D planar antenna arrays. This demonstrates the inevitable radiation efficiency degradation caused by mutual coupling effects between array elements. However, this limitation is derived based on the assumption of infinitely large 2D arrays, which means that it is not an accurate law for small-size arrays. In this paper, we extend this theory and propose an estimation formula for the radiation efficiency upper limit of finite-sized 2D arrays. Furthermore, we analyze a 3D array structure consisting of two parallel 2D arrays. Specifically, we provide evaluation formulas for the mutual coupling strengths for both infinite and finite size arrays and derive the fundamental efficiency limit of 3D arrays. Moreover, based on the established gain limit of antenna arrays with fixed aperture sizes, we derive the achievable gain limit of finite size 3D arrays. Besides the performance analyses, we also investigate the spatial radiation characteristics of the considered 3D array structure, offering a feasible region for 2D phase settings under a given energy attenuation threshold. Through simulations, we demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed theories and gain advantages of 3D arrays for better spatial coverage under various scenarios.</description>

      <title>Smoothed Robust Phase Retrieval</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.01570</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.01570v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The phase retrieval problem in the presence of noise aims to recover the signal vector of interest from a set of quadratic measurements with infrequent but arbitrary corruptions, and it plays an important role in many scientific applications. However, the essential geometric structure of the nonconvex robust phase retrieval based on the $\ell_1$-loss is largely unknown to study spurious local solutions, even under the ideal noiseless setting, and its intrinsic nonsmooth nature also impacts the efficiency of optimization algorithms. This paper introduces the smoothed robust phase retrieval (SRPR) based on a family of convolution-type smoothed loss functions. Theoretically, we prove that the SRPR enjoys a benign geometric structure with high probability: (1) under the noiseless situation, the SRPR has no spurious local solutions, and the target signals are global solutions, and (2) under the infrequent but arbitrary corruptions, we characterize the stationary points of the SRPR and prove its benign landscape, which is the first landscape analysis of phase retrieval with corruption in the literature. Moreover, we prove the local linear convergence rate of gradient descent for solving the SRPR under the noiseless situation. Experiments on both simulated datasets and image recovery are provided to demonstrate the numerical performance of the SRPR.</description>

      <title>Classifier-Free Diffusion-Based Weakly-Supervised Approach for Health Indicator Derivation in Rotating Machines: Advancing Early Fault Detection and Condition Monitoring</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.01676</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.01676v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Deriving health indicators of rotating machines is crucial for their maintenance. However, this process is challenging for the prevalent adopted intelligent methods since they may take the whole data distributions, not only introducing noise interference but also lacking the explainability. To address these issues, we propose a diffusion-based weakly-supervised approach for deriving health indicators of rotating machines, enabling early fault detection and continuous monitoring of condition evolution. This approach relies on a classifier-free diffusion model trained using healthy samples and a few anomalies. This model generates healthy samples. and by comparing the differences between the original samples and the generated ones in the envelope spectrum, we construct an anomaly map that clearly identifies faults. Health indicators are then derived, which can explain the fault types and mitigate noise interference. Comparative studies on two cases demonstrate that the proposed method offers superior health monitoring effectiveness and robustness compared to baseline models.</description>

      <title>Low Layer Functional Split Management in 5G and Beyond: Architecture and Self-adaptation</title>

Abstract: Radio Access Network (RAN) disaggregation is emerging as a key trend in beyond 5G, as it offers new opportunities for more flexible deployments and intelligent network management. A relevant problem in disaggregated RAN is the functional split selection, which dynamically decides which baseband (BB) functions of a base station are kept close to the radio units and which ones are centralized. In this context, this paper firstly presents an architectural framework for supporting this concept relying on the O-RAN architecture. Then, the paper analyzes how the functional split can be optimized to adapt to the different load conditions while minimizing energy costs.</description>

      <title>Steered Response Power-Based Direction-of-Arrival Estimation Exploiting an Auxiliary Microphone</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.01776</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.01776v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Accurately estimating the direction-of-arrival (DOA) of a speech source using a compact microphone array (CMA) is often complicated by background noise and reverberation. A commonly used DOA estimation method is the steered response power with phase transform (SRP-PHAT) function, which has been shown to work reliably in moderate levels of noise and reverberation. Since for closely spaced microphones the spatial coherence of noise and reverberation may be high over an extended frequency range, this may negatively affect the SRP-PHAT spectra, resulting in DOA estimation errors. Assuming the availability of an auxiliary microphone at an unknown position which is spatially separated from the CMA, in this paper we propose to compute the SRP-PHAT spectra between the microphones of the CMA based on the SRP-PHAT spectra between the auxiliary microphone and the microphones of the CMA. For different levels of noise and reverberation, we show how far the auxiliary microphone needs to be spatially separated from the CMA for the auxiliary microphone-based SRP-PHAT spectra to be more reliable than the SRP-PHAT spectra without the auxiliary microphone. These findings are validated based on simulated microphone signals for several auxiliary microphone positions and two different noise and reverberation conditions.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.01850v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a comprehensive phase noise characterization of a mid-IR Cr:ZnS frequency comb. Despite their emergence as a platform for high-resolution dual-comb spectroscopy, detailed investigations into the phase noise of Cr:ZnS combs have been lacking. To address this, we use a recently proposed phase noise measurement technique that employs multi-heterodyne detection and subspace tracking. This allows for the measurement of the common mode, repetition-rate and high-order phase noise terms, and their corresponding scaling as a function of a comb-line number, using a single measurement set-up. We demonstrate that the comb under test is dominated by the common mode phase noise, while all the other phase noise terms are below the measurement noise floor (~ -120 dB rad^2/Hz), and are thereby not identifiable.</description>

      <title>Power Control and Random Serving Mode Allocation for CJT-NCJT Hybrid Mode Enabled Cell-Free Massive MIMO With Limited Fronthauls</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.01957</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.01957v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: With a great potential of improving the service fairness and quality for user equipments (UEs), cell-free massive multiple-input multiple-output (mMIMO) has been regarded as an emerging candidate for 6G network architectures. Under ideal assumptions, the coherent joint transmission (CJT) serving mode has been considered as an optimal option for cell-free mMIMO systems, since it can achieve coherent cooperation gain among the access points. However, when considering the limited fronthaul constraint in practice, the non-coherent joint transmission (NCJT) serving mode is likely to outperform CJT, since the former requires much lower fronthaul resources. In other words, the performance excellence and worseness of single serving mode (CJT or NCJT) depends on the fronthaul capacity, and any single transmission mode cannot perfectly adapt the capacity limited fronthaul. To explore the performance potential of the cell-free mMIMO system with limited fronthauls by harnessing the merits of CJT and NCJT, we propose a CJT-NCJT hybrid serving mode framework, in which UEs are allocated to operate on CJT or NCJT serving mode. To improve the sum-rate of the system with low complexity, we first propose a probability-based random serving mode allocation scheme. With a given serving mode, a successive convex approximation-based power allocation algorithm is proposed to maximize the system's sum-rate. Simulation results demonstrate the superiority of the proposed scheme.</description>

Abstract: Six-dimensional movable antenna (6DMA) is an emerging technology that is able to fully exploit the spatial variation of wireless channels by controlling the 3D positions and 3D rotations of distributed antennas/antenna surfaces at the transmitter/receiver. In this letter, we apply 6DMA at the base station (BS) to enhance its wireless sensing performance over a given set of regions. To this end, we first divide each region into a number of equal-size subregions and select one typical target location within each subregion. Then, we derive an expression for the Cramer-Rao bound (CRB) for estimating the directions of arrival (DoAs) from these typical target locations in all regions, which sheds light on the sensing performance of 6DMA enhanced systems in terms of a power gain and a geometric gain. Next, we minimize the CRB for DoA estimation via jointly optimizing the positions and rotations of all 6DMAs at the BS, subject to practical movement constraints, and propose an efficient algorithm to solve the resulting non-convex optimization problem sub-optimally. Finally, simulation results demonstrate the significant improvement in DoA estimation accuracy achieved by the proposed 6DMA sensing scheme as compared to various benchmark schemes, for both isotropic and directive antenna radiation patterns.</description>

      <title>UNSURE: Unknown Noise level Stein's Unbiased Risk Estimator</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.01985v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recently, many self-supervised learning methods for image reconstruction have been proposed that can learn from noisy data alone, bypassing the need for ground-truth references. Most existing methods cluster around two classes: i) Noise2Self and similar cross-validation methods that require very mild knowledge about the noise distribution, and ii) Stein's Unbiased Risk Estimator (SURE) and similar approaches that assume full knowledge of the distribution. The first class of methods is often suboptimal compared to supervised learning, and the second class is often impractical, as the noise level is generally unknown in real-world applications. In this paper, we provide a theoretical framework that characterizes this expressivity-robustness trade-off and propose a new approach based on SURE, but unlike the standard SURE, does not require knowledge about the noise level. Throughout a series of experiments, we show that the proposed estimator outperforms other existing self-supervised methods on various imaging inverse problems.</description>

Abstract: We are witnessing a transition to a new era where driverless cars will be pervasively connected to deliver significantly improved safety, traffic efficiency, and travel experiences. A diverse set of advanced vehicular use cases including connected autonomous vehicles will be made possible by building upon the emerging sixth-generation (6G) wireless networks. Among many 6G wireless technologies, the principal objective of this paper is to introduce the potential benefits of the hybrid integration of Vehicular Visible Light Communication (V VLC) and Vehicular Radio Frequency (V RF) communication systems by studying the impact of interference as well as various meteorological phenomenon viz. rain, fog and dry snow. In particular, we show that regardless of any meteorological impact, a properly configured link-aggregated hybrid V-VLC/V-RF system is capable of meeting stringent ultra high reliability (&gt;99.999%) and ultra-low latency (&lt;3 ms) requirements, making it a promising candidate for 6G Vehicle-to-Everything (V2X) Communications. To stimulate future research in the hybrid RF-VLC V2X space, we also highlight the potential challenges and research directions.</description>

      <title>Creating Temporally Correlated High-Resolution Profiles of Load Injection Using Constrained Generative Adversarial Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.12166</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.12166v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Traditional smart meters, which measure energy usage every 15 minutes or more and report it at least a few hours later, lack the granularity needed for real-time decision-making. To address this practical problem, we introduce a new method using generative adversarial networks (GAN) that enforces temporal consistency on its high-resolution outputs via hard inequality constraints using convex optimization. A unique feature of our GAN model is that it is trained solely on slow timescale aggregated historical energy data obtained from smart meters. The results demonstrate that the model can successfully create minute-by-minute temporally correlated profiles of power usage from 15-minute interval average power consumption information. This innovative approach, emphasizing inter-neuron constraints, offers a promising avenue for improved high-speed state estimation in distribution systems and enhances the applicability of data-driven solutions for monitoring and subsequently controlling such systems.</description>

      <title>A semidefinite programming approach for robust elliptic localization</title>

      <description>arXiv:2401.15619v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This short communication addresses the problem of elliptic localization with outlier measurements. Outliers are prevalent in various location-enabled applications, and can significantly compromise the positioning performance if not adequately handled. Instead of following the common trend of using $M$-estimation or adjusting the conventional least squares formulation by integrating extra error variables, we take a different path. Specifically, we explore the worst-case robust approximation criterion to bolster resistance of the elliptic location estimator against outliers. From a geometric standpoint, our method boils down to pinpointing the Chebyshev center of a feasible set, which is defined by the available bistatic ranges with bounded measurement errors. For a practical approach to the associated min-max problem, we convert it into the convex optimization framework of semidefinite programming (SDP). Numerical simulations confirm that our SDP-based technique can outperform a number of existing elliptic localization schemes in terms of positioning accuracy in Gaussian mixture noise.</description>

      <title>Joint and Robust Beamforming Framework for Integrated Sensing and Communication Systems</title>

      <description>arXiv:2402.09155v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) is widely recognized as a fundamental enabler for future wireless communications. In this paper, we present a joint communication and radar beamforming framework for maximizing a sum spectral efficiency (SE) while guaranteeing desired radar performance with imperfect channel state information (CSI) in multi-user and multi-target ISAC systems. To this end, we adopt either a radar transmit beam mean square error (MSE) or receive signal-to-clutter-plus-noise ratio (SCNR) as a radar performance constraint of a sum SE maximization problem. To resolve inherent challenges such as non-convexity and imperfect CSI, we reformulate the problems and identify first-order optimality conditions for the joint radar and communication beamformer. Turning the condition to a nonlinear eigenvalue problem with eigenvector dependency (NEPv), we develop an alternating method which finds the joint beamformer through power iteration and a Lagrangian multiplier through binary search. The proposed framework encompasses both the radar metrics and is robust to channel estimation error with low complexity. Simulations validate the proposed methods. In particular, we observe that the MSE and SCNR constraints exhibit complementary performance depending on the operating environment, which manifests the importance of the proposed comprehensive and robust optimization framework.</description>

      <title>Deep Cooperation in ISAC System: Resource, Node and Infrastructure Perspectives</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.02565v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: With the emerging Integrated Sensing and Communication (ISAC) technique, exploiting the mobile communication system with multi-domain resources, multiple network elements, and large-scale infrastructures to realize cooperative sensing is a crucial approach satisfying the requirements of high-accuracy and large-scale sensing in IoE. In this article, the deep cooperation in ISAC system including three perspectives is investigated. In the microscopic perspective, namely, within a single node, the sensing information carried by time-frequency-space-code domain resources is processed, such as phase compensation, coherent accumulation and other operations, thereby improving the sensing accuracy. In the mesoscopic perspective, the sensing accuracy could be improved through the cooperation of multiple nodes. We explore various multi-node cooperative sensing scenarios and present the corresponding challenges and future research trends. In the macroscopic perspective, the massive number of infrastructures from the same operator or different operators could perform cooperative sensing to extend the sensing coverage and improve the sensing continuity. We investigate network architecture, target tracking methods, and the large-scale sensing assisted digital twin construction. Simulation results demonstrate the superiority of multi-nodes and multi-resources cooperative sensing over single resource or node sensing. This article may provide a deep and comprehensive view on the cooperative sensing in ISAC system to enhance the performance of sensing, supporting the applications of IoE.</description>

      <title>A divide-and-conquer approach for sparse recovery of high dimensional signals</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.04688v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Compressed sensing (CS) techniques demand significant storage and computational resources, when recovering high-dimensional sparse signals. Block CS (BCS), a special class of CS, addresses both the storage and complexity issues by partitioning the sparse recovery problem into several sub-problems. In this paper, we derive a Welch bound-based guarantee on the reconstruction error with BCS. Our guarantee reveals that the reconstruction quality with BCS monotonically reduces with an increasing number of partitions. To alleviate this performance loss, we propose a sparse recovery technique that exploits correlation across the partitions of the sparse signal. Our method outperforms BCS in the moderate SNR regime, for a modest increase in the storage and computational complexities.</description>

      <title>Enhancing Physical Layer Security in Dual-Function Radar-Communication Systems with Hybrid Beamforming Architecture</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.07655</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.07655v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this letter, we investigate enhancing the physical layer security (PLS) for the dual-function radar-communication (DFRC) system with hybrid beamforming (HBF) architecture, where the base station (BS) achieves downlink communication and radar target detection simultaneously. We consider an eavesdropper intercepting the information transmitted from the BS to the downlink communication users with imperfectly known channel state information. Additionally, the location of the radar target is also imperfectly known by the BS. To enhance PLS in the considered DFRC system, we propose a novel HBF architecture, which introduces a new integrated sensing and security (I2S) symbol. The secure HBF design problem for DFRC is formulated by maximizing the minimum legitimate user communication rate subject to radar signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio, eavesdropping rate, hardware and power constraints. To solve this non-convex problem, we propose an alternating optimization based method to jointly optimize transmit and receive beamformers. Numerical simulation results validate the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm and show the superiority of the proposed I2S-aided HBF architecture for achieving DFRC and enhancing PLS.</description>

      <title>Near-Field Channel Estimation in Dual-Band XL-MIMO with Side Information-Assisted Compressed Sensing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.12620</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.12620v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Near-field communication comes to be an indispensable part of the future sixth generation (6G) communications at the arrival of the forth-coming deployment of extremely large-scale multiple-input-multiple-output (XL-MIMO) systems. Due to the huge array aperture and high-frequency bands, the electromagnetic radiation field is modeled by the spherical waves instead of the conventional planar waves, leading to severe weak sparsity to angular-domain near-field channel. Therefore, the channel estimation reminiscent of the conventional compression sensing (CS) approaches in the angular domain, judiciously utilized for low pilot overhead, may result in unprecedented challenges. To this end, this paper proposes a brand-new near-field channel estimation scheme by exploiting the naturally occurring useful side information. Specifically, we formulate the dual-band near-field communication model based on the fact that high-frequency systems are likely to be deployed with lower-frequency systems. Representative side information, i.e., the structural characteristic information derived by the sparsity ambiguity and the out-of-band spatial information stemming from the lower-frequency channel, is explored and tailored to materialize exceptional near-field channel estimation. Furthermore, in-depth theoretical analyses are developed to guarantee the minimum estimation error, based on which a suite of algorithms leveraging the elaborating side information are proposed. Numerical simulations demonstrate that the designed algorithms provide more assured results than the off-the-shelf approaches in the context of the dual-band near-field communications in both on- and off-grid scenarios, where the angle of departures/arrivals are discretely or continuously distributed, respectively.</description>

      <title>Compressive Beam Alignment for Indoor Millimeter-Wave Systems</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.07965v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The dynamic nature of indoor environments poses unique challenges for next-generation millimeter-wave (mmwave) connectivity. These challenges arise from blockages due to mobile obstacles, mm-wave signal scattering caused by indoor surfaces, and user phased antenna array imperfections. Traditional compressed sensing (CS) based beam alignment techniques enable swift mm-wave connectivity with a limited number of measurements. These techniques, however, rely on prior knowledge of the communication channel model and the user's array manifold to design the sensing matrix and minimize angle quantization errors. This limits their effectiveness in dynamic environments. This paper proposes a novel CS-based beam alignment technique for mm-wave systems operating in indoor environments. Unlike prior work that rely on knowledge of the user's antenna architecture, communication codebook, and channel, the proposed technique is agnostic to these factors. The proposed formulation eliminates angle quantization errors by mapping the recovered angular directions onto the user's specific codebook. This is achieved by exploiting the energy compaction property of the Discrete Cosine Transform (DCT) to compress and identify the strongest cluster locations in the transform domain for robust beamforming. Experimental results at 60 GHz demonstrate successful recovery of the mm-wave power distribution in the angular domain, facilitating accurate beam alignment with limited measurements compared to exhaustive search solutions.</description>

      <title>Efficient UAV Hovering, Resource Allocation, and Trajectory Design for ISAC with Limited Backhaul Capacity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.16888</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.16888v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we investigate the joint resource allocation and trajectory design for a multi-user, multi-target unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV)-enabled integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) system, where the link capacity between a ground base station (BS) and the UAV is limited. The UAV conducts target sensing and information transmission in orthogonal time slots to prevent interference. As is common in practical systems, sensing is performed while the UAV hovers, allowing the UAV to acquire high-quality sensing data. Subsequently, the acquired sensing data is offloaded to the ground BS for further processing. We jointly optimize the UAV trajectory, UAV velocity, beamforming for the communication users, power allocated to the sensing beam, and time of hovering for sensing to minimize the power consumption of the UAV while ensuring the communication quality of service (QoS) and successful sensing. Due to the prohibitively high complexity of the resulting non-convex mixed integer non-linear program (MINLP), we employ a series of transformations and optimization techniques, including semidefinite relaxation, big-M method, penalty approach, and successive convex approximation, to obtain a low-complexity suboptimal solution. Our simulation results reveal that 1) the proposed design achieves significant power savings compared to two baseline schemes; 2) stricter sensing requirements lead to longer sensing times, highlighting the challenge of efficiently managing both sensing accuracy and sensing time; 3) the optimized trajectory design ensures precise hovering directly above the targets during sensing, enhancing sensing quality and enabling the application of energy-focused beams; and 4) the proposed trajectory design balances the capacity of the backhaul link and the downlink rate of the communication users.</description>

      <title>Belief Propagation-based Rotation and Translation Estimation for Rigid Body Localization</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.09232v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We propose a novel solution to the rigid body localization (RBL) problem, in which the three-dimensional (3D) rotation and translation is estimated by only utilizing the range measurements between the wireless sensors on the rigid body and the anchor sensors. The proposed framework first constructs a linear Gaussian belief propagation (GaBP) algorithm to estimate the absolute sensor positions utilizing the range-based received signal model, which is used for the reconstruction of the RBL transformation model, linearized with a small-angle approximation. In light of the reformulated system, a second bivariate GaBP is designed to directly estimate the 3D rotation angles and translation distances, with an interference cancellation (IC) refinement to improve the angle estimation performance. The effectiveness of the proposed method is verified via numerical simulations, highlighting the superior performance of the proposed method against the state-of-the-art (SotA) techniques for the position, rotation, and translation estimation performance.</description>

      <title>Classification of Heart Sounds Using Multi-Branch Deep Convolutional Network and LSTM-CNN</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.10689v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper presents a fast and cost-effective method for diagnosing cardiac abnormalities with high accuracy and reliability using low-cost systems in clinics. The primary limitation of automatic diagnosing of cardiac diseases is the rarity of correct and acceptable labeled samples, which can be expensive to prepare. To address this issue, two methods are proposed in this work. The first method is a unique Multi-Branch Deep Convolutional Neural Network (MBDCN) architecture inspired by human auditory processing, specifically designed to optimize feature extraction by employing various sizes of convolutional filters and audio signal power spectrum as input. In the second method, called as Long short-term memory-Convolutional Neural (LSCN) model, Additionally, the network architecture includes Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) network blocks to improve feature extraction in the time domain. The innovative approach of combining multiple parallel branches consisting of the one-dimensional convolutional layers along with LSTM blocks helps in achieving superior results in audio signal processing tasks. The experimental results demonstrate superiority of the proposed methods over the state-of-the-art techniques. The overall classification accuracy of heart sounds with the LSCN network is more than 96%. The efficiency of this network is significant compared to common feature extraction methods such as Mel Frequency Cepstral Coefficients (MFCC) and wavelet transform. Therefore, the proposed method shows promising results in the automatic analysis of heart sounds and has potential applications in the diagnosis and early detection of cardiovascular diseases.</description>

      <title>CardioLab: Laboratory Values Estimation from Electrocardiogram Features -- An Exploratory Study</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.18629v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Introduction: Laboratory value represents a cornerstone of medical diagnostics, but suffers from slow turnaround times, and high costs and only provides information about a single point in time. The continuous estimation of laboratory values from non-invasive data such as electrocardiogram (ECG) would therefore mark a significant frontier in healthcare monitoring. Despite its transformative potential, this domain remains relatively underexplored within the medical community.
  Methods: In this preliminary study, we used a publicly available dataset (MIMIC-IV-ECG) to investigate the feasibility of inferring laboratory values from ECG features and patient demographics using tree-based models (XGBoost). We define the prediction task as a binary prediction problem of predicting whether the lab value falls into low or high abnormalities. The model performance can then be assessed using AUROC.
  Results: Our findings demonstrate promising results in the estimation of laboratory values related to different organ systems based on a small yet comprehensive set of features. While further research and validation are warranted to fully assess the clinical utility and generalizability of ECG-based estimation in healthcare monitoring, our findings lay the groundwork for future investigations into approaches to laboratory value estimation using ECG data. Such advancements hold promise for revolutionizing predictive healthcare applications, offering faster, non-invasive, and more affordable means of patient monitoring.</description>

      <title>Guiding Wireless Signals with Arrays of Metallic Linear Fresnel Reflectors: A Low-cost, Frequency-versatile, and Practical Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.19179</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.19179v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This study presents a novel mechanical metallic reflector array to guide wireless signals to the point of interest, thereby enhancing received signal quality. Comprised of numerous individual units, this device, which acts as a linear Fresnel reflector (LFR), facilitates the reflection of incoming signals to a desired location. Leveraging geometric principles, we present a systematic approach for redirecting beams from an Access Point (AP) toward User Equipment (UE) positions. This methodology is geared towards optimizing beam allocation, thereby maximizing the number of beams directed towards the UE. Ray tracing simulations conducted for two 3D wireless communication scenarios demonstrate significant increases in path gains and received signal strengths (RSS) by at least 50dB with strategically positioned devices.</description>

      <title>Cooperative Beam Selection for RIS-Aided Terahertz MIMO Networks via Multi-Task Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2207.02597</link>
      <description>arXiv:2207.02597v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Reconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS) have been cast as a promising alternative to alleviate blockage vulnerability and enhance coverage capability for terahertz (THz) communications. Owing to large-scale array elements at transceivers and RIS, the codebook based beamforming can be utilized in a computationally efficient manner. However, the codeword selection for analog beamforming is an intractable combinatorial optimization (CO) problem. To this end, by taking the CO problem as a classification problem, a multi-task learning based analog beam selection (MTL-ABS) framework is developed to implement cooperative beam selection concurrently at transceivers and RIS. In addition, residual network and self-attention mechanism are used to combat the network degradation and mine intrinsic THz channel features. Finally, the network convergence is analyzed from a blockwise perspective, and numerical results demonstrate that the MTL-ABS framework greatly decreases the beam selection overhead and achieves near optimal sum-rate compared with heuristic search based counterparts.</description>

      <title>On the limits of neural network explainability via descrambling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2301.07820</link>
      <description>arXiv:2301.07820v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We characterize the exact solutions to neural network descrambling--a mathematical model for explaining the fully connected layers of trained neural networks (NNs). By reformulating the problem to the minimization of the Brockett function arising in graph matching and complexity theory we show that the principal components of the hidden layer preactivations can be characterized as the optimal explainers or descramblers for the layer weights, leading to descrambled weight matrices. We show that in typical deep learning contexts these descramblers take diverse and interesting forms including (1) matching largest principal components with the lowest frequency modes of the Fourier basis for isotropic hidden data, (2) discovering the semantic development in two-layer linear NNs for signal recovery problems, and (3) explaining CNNs by optimally permuting the neurons. Our numerical experiments indicate that the eigendecompositions of the hidden layer data--now understood as the descramblers--can also reveal the layer's underlying transformation. These results illustrate that the SVD is more directly related to the explainability of NNs than previously thought and offers a promising avenue for discovering interpretable motifs for the hidden action of NNs, especially in contexts of operator learning or physics-informed NNs, where the input/output data has limited human readability.</description>

      <title>A Gaussian Copula Approach to the Performance Analysis of Fluid Antenna Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.07506</link>
      <description>arXiv:2309.07506v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper investigates the performance of a single-user fluid antenna system (FAS), by exploiting a class of elliptical copulas to describe the dependence structure amongst the fluid antenna positions (ports). By expressing the well-known Jakes' model in terms of the Gaussian copula, we consider two cases: (i) the general case, i.e., any arbitrary correlated fading distribution; and (ii) the specific case, i.e., correlated Nakagami-$m$ fading. For both scenarios, we first derive analytical expressions for the cumulative distribution function (CDF) and probability density function (PDF) of the equivalent channel in terms of multivariate normal distribution. Then we obtain the outage probability (OP) and the delay outage rate (DOR) to analyze the performance of FAS. By employing the popular rank correlation coefficients such as Spearman's $\rho$ and Kendall's $\tau$ , we measure the degree of dependency in correlated arbitrary fading channels and illustrate how the Gaussian copula can be accurately connected to Jakes' model in FAS. Our numerical results demonstrate that increasing the size of FAS provides lower OP and DOR, but the system performance saturates as the number of antenna ports increases. In addition, our results indicate that FAS provides better performance compared to conventional single-fixed antenna systems even when the size of fluid antenna is small.</description>

      <title>Deep Learning-based Target-To-User Association in Integrated Sensing and Communication Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.12801</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.12801v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In Integrated Sensing and Communication (ISAC) systems, matching the radar targets with communication user equipments (UEs) is functional to several communication tasks, such as proactive handover and beam prediction. In this paper, we consider a radar-assisted communication system where a base station (BS) is equipped with a multiple-input-multiple-output (MIMO) radar that has a double aim: (i) associate vehicular radar targets to vehicular equipments (VEs) in the communication beamspace and (ii) predict the beamforming vector for each VE from radar data. The proposed target-to-user (T2U) association consists of two stages. First, vehicular radar targets are detected from range-angle images, and, for each, a beamforming vector is estimated. Then, the inferred per-target beamforming vectors are matched with the ones utilized at the BS for communication to perform target-to-user (T2U) association. Joint multi-target detection and beam inference is obtained by modifying the you only look once (YOLO) model, which is trained over simulated range-angle radar images. Simulation results over different urban vehicular mobility scenarios show that the proposed T2U method provides a probability of correct association that increases with the size of the BS antenna array, highlighting the respective increase of the separability of the VEs in the beamspace. Moreover, we show that the modified YOLO architecture can effectively perform both beam prediction and radar target detection, with similar performance in mean average precision on the latter over different antenna array sizes.</description>

      <title>Movable Antenna-Enabled Co-Frequency Co-Time Full-Duplex Wireless Communication</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.17049</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.17049v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Movable antenna (MA) provides an innovative way to arrange antennas that can contribute to improved signal quality and more effective interference management. This technology is especially beneficial for co-frequency co-time full-duplex (CCFD) wireless communication, which struggles with self-interference (SI) that usually overpowers the desired incoming signals. By dynamically repositioning transmit/receive antennas, we can mitigate the SI and enhance the reception of incoming signals. Thus, this paper proposes a novel MA-enabled point-to-point CCFD system and formulates the minimum achievable rate of two CCFD terminals. To maximize the minimum achievable rate and determine the positions of MAs, we introduce a solution based on projected particle swarm optimization (PPSO), which can circumvent common suboptimal positioning issues. Moreover, simulation results reveal that the PPSO method leads to better performance compared to the conventional alternating position optimization (APO). The results also demonstrate that an MA-enabled CCFD system outperforms the one using fixed-position antennas (FPAs).</description>

      <title>Interpretation of Intracardiac Electrograms Through Textual Representations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.01115</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.01115v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Understanding the irregular electrical activity of atrial fibrillation (AFib) has been a key challenge in electrocardiography. For serious cases of AFib, catheter ablations are performed to collect intracardiac electrograms (EGMs). EGMs offer intricately detailed and localized electrical activity of the heart and are an ideal modality for interpretable cardiac studies. Recent advancements in artificial intelligence (AI) has allowed some works to utilize deep learning frameworks to interpret EGMs during AFib. Additionally, language models (LMs) have shown exceptional performance in being able to generalize to unseen domains, especially in healthcare. In this study, we are the first to leverage pretrained LMs for finetuning of EGM interpolation and AFib classification via masked language modeling. We formulate the EGM as a textual sequence and present competitive performances on AFib classification compared against other representations. Lastly, we provide a comprehensive interpretability study to provide a multi-perspective intuition of the model's behavior, which could greatly benefit the clinical use.</description>

      <title>On the Performance of RIS-Aided Spatial Modulation for Downlink Transmission</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.02893</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.02893v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this study, we explore the performance of a reconfigurable reflecting surface (RIS)-assisted transmit spatial modulation (SM) system for downlink transmission, wherein the deployment of RIS serves the purpose of blind area coverage within the channel. At the receiving end, we present three detectors, i.e., maximum likelihood (ML) detector, two-stage ML detection, and greedy detector to recover the transmitted signal. By utilizing the ML detector, we initially derive the conditional pair error probability expression for the proposed scheme. Subsequently, we leverage the central limit theorem (CLT) to obtain the probability density function of the combined channel. Following this, the Gaussian-Chebyshev quadrature method is applied to derive a closed-form expression for the unconditional pair error probability and establish the union tight upper bound for the average bit error probability (ABEP). Furthermore, we derive a closed-form expression for the ergodic capacity of the proposed RIS-SM scheme. Monte Carlo simulations are conducted not only to assess the complexity and reliability of the three detection algorithms but also to validate the results obtained through theoretical derivation results.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.17318v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The performance bounds of near-field sensing are studied for circular arrays, focusing on the impact of bandwidth and array size. The closed-form Cramer-Rao bound (CRBs) for angle and distance estimation are derived, revealing the scaling laws of the CRBs with bandwidth and array size. Contrary to expectations, enlarging array size does not always enhance sensing performance. Furthermore, the asymptotic CRBs are analyzed under different conditions, unveiling that the derived expressions include the existing results as special cases. Finally, the derived expressions are validated through numerical results.</description>

      <title>An RF-Domain Leakage Cancellation Scheme for FMCW Radars</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.15969</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.15969v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper proposes a novel solution to address the leakage from the transmitter (TX) to the receiver (RX) in frequency-modulated continuous-wave (FMCW) radars. The proposed scheme replicates the leakage using an in-phase and quadrature mixer (IQ-mixer) and performs leakage cancellation in the radio-frequency (RF) domain. This approach utilizes a Wilkinson power combiner after the RX antenna to subtract the replicated leakage signal from the received signal, ensuring that only the true target signal reaches the low-noise amplifier (LNA). This scheme enhances the dynamic range and the receiver's ability to discern proximate targets from previously indistinguishable low beat-frequency clutter. In addition, the proposed technique incorporates a second IQ-mixer based complex modulator in the transmitter to tune the leakage beat frequency. This allows for accurate estimation of the leakage amplitude and phase without additional hardware. Simulation results show more than 20 dB of leakage cancellation.</description>

      <title>Downlink CCM Estimation via Representation Learning with Graph Regularization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.18865</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.18865v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we propose an algorithm for downlink (DL) channel covariance matrix (CCM) estimation for frequency division duplexing (FDD) massive multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) communication systems with base station (BS) possessing a uniform linear array (ULA) antenna structure. We consider a setting where the UL CCM is mapped to DL CCM by a mapping function. We first present a theoretical error analysis of learning a nonlinear embedding by constructing a mapping function, which points to the importance of the Lipschitz regularity of the mapping function for achieving high estimation performance. Then, based on the theoretical ground, we propose a representation learning algorithm as a solution for the estimation problem, where Gaussian RBF kernel interpolators are chosen to map UL CCMs to their DL counterparts. The proposed algorithm is based on the optimization of an objective function that fits a regression model between the DL CCM and UL CCM samples in the training dataset and preserves the local geometric structure of the data in the UL CCM space, while explicitly regulating the Lipschitz continuity of the mapping function in light of our theoretical findings. The proposed algorithm surpasses benchmark methods in terms of three error metrics as shown by simulations.</description>

      <title>Movable Antennas Meet Intelligent Reflecting Surface: When Do We Need Movable Antennas?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.15668</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.15668v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Intelligent reflecting surface (IRS) and movable antenna (MA)/fluid antenna (FA) techniques have both received increasing attention in the realm of wireless communications due to their ability to reconfigure and improve wireless channel conditions. In this paper, we investigate the integration of MAs/FAs into an IRS-assisted wireless communication system. In particular, we consider the downlink transmission from a multi-MA base station (BS) to a single-antenna user with the aid of an IRS, aiming to maximize the user's received signal-to-noise ratio (SNR), by jointly optimizing the BS/IRS active/passive beamforming and the MAs' positions. Due to the similar capability of MAs and IRS for channel reconfiguration, we first conduct theoretical analyses of the performance gain of MAs over conventional fixed-position antennas (FPAs) under the line-of-sight (LoS) BS-IRS channel and derive the conditions under which the performance gain becomes more or less significant. Next, to solve the received SNR maximization problem, we propose an alternating optimization (AO) algorithm that decomposes it into two subproblems and solve them alternately. Numerical results are provided to validate our analytical results and evaluate the performance gains of MAs over FPAs under different setups.</description>

      <title>Study And Implementation of Unitary Gates in Quantum Computation Using Schrodinger Dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.17035</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.17035v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This thesis explores the concept of realizing quantum gates using physical systems like atoms and oscillators perturbed by electric and magnetic fields. The basic idea is that if a time-independent Hamiltonian $H_0$ is perturbed by a time-varying Hamiltonian of the form $f(t)V$, where $f(t)$ is a scalar function of time and $V$ is a Hermitian operator that does not commute with $H_0$, then a large class of unitary operators can be realized via the Schrodinger evolution corresponding to the time-varying Hamiltonian $H_0+f(t)V$. This is a consequence of the Baker-Campbell-Hausdorff formula in Lie groups and Lie algebras. The thesis addresses two problems based on this idea: first, taking a Harmonic oscillator and perturbing it with a time-independent anharmonic term, and then computing $U_g=e^{-\iota T H_1}$. Then, perturbing the harmonic Hamiltonian with a linear time-dependent term, and calculating the unitary evolution corresponding to $H(t)$ at time $T$. This gate can be expressed as $U(T)=U(T,\epsilon,f)=T\{e^{-\iota\int_0^TH(t)dt}\}$.The anharmonic gate $U_g$ is replaced by a host of commonly used gates in quantum computation, such as controlled unitary gates and quantum Fourier transform gates. The control electric field is selected appropriately. The thesis also addresses the controllability issue, determining under what conditions there exists a scalar real valued function of time $f(t), 0\leq t\leq T$ such that if $|\psi_\iota\rangle$ is any initial wave function and $|\psi_f\rangle$ is any final wave function, then $U(T,f)|\psi_i\rangle=|\psi_f\rangle$. A partial solution was obtained by replacing the unitary evolution kernel by its Dyson series truncated version. In all design procedures, the gates that appear are infinite-dimensional, with an interaction between the atom and the electromagnetic field modulated by a controllable function of time.</description>
