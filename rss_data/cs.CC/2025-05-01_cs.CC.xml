      <title>Multicut Problems in Almost-Planar Graphs: The Dependency of Complexity on the Demand Pattern</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.21624</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.21624v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Given a graph $G$, a set $T$ of terminal vertices, and a demand graph $H$ on $T$, the \textsc{Multicut} problem asks for a set of edges of minimum weight that separates the pairs of terminals specified by the edges of $H$.
  The \textsc{Multicut} problem can be solved in polynomial time if the number of terminals and the genus of the graph is bounded (Colin de Verdi\`ere [Algorithmica, 2017]).
  Focke et al.~[SoCG 2024] characterized which special cases of Multicut are fixed-parameter tractable parameterized by the number of terminals on planar graphs. Moreover, they precisely determined how the parameter genus influences the complexity and presented partial results of this form for graphs that can be made planar by the deletion of $\pi$ edges. We complete the picture on how this parameter $\pi$ influences the complexity of different special cases and precisely determine the influence of the crossing number.
  Formally, let $\mathcal{H}$ be any class of graphs (satisfying a mild closure property) and let Multicut$(\mathcal{H})$ be the special case when the demand graph $H$ is in $\mathcal{H}$. Our fist main results is showing that if $\mathcal{H}$ has the combinatorial property of having bounded distance to extended bicliques, then Multicut$(\mathcal{H})$ on unweighted graphs is FPT parameterized by the number $t$ of terminals and $\pi$. For the case when $\mathcal{H}$ does not have this combinatorial property,
  Focke et al.~[SoCG 2024] showed that $O(\sqrt{t})$ is essentially the best possible exponent of the running time; together with our result, this gives a complete understanding of how the parameter $\pi$ influences complexity on unweighted graphs.
  Our second main result is giving an algorithm whose existence shows that that the parameter crossing number behaves analogously if we consider weighted graphs.</description>

      <title>Concurrency Constrained Scheduling with Tree-Like Constraints</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.21502</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.21502v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper investigates concurrency-constrained scheduling problems, where the objective is to construct a schedule for a set of jobs subject to concurrency restrictions. Formally, we are given a conflict graph $G$ defined over a set of $n$ jobs, where an edge between two jobs in $G$ indicates that these jobs cannot be executed concurrently. Each job may have distinct attributes, such as processing time, due date, weight, and release time. The goal is to determine a schedule that optimizes a specified scheduling criterion while adhering to all concurrency constraints. This framework offers a versatile model for analyzing resource allocation problems where processes compete for shared resources, such as access to shared memory. From a theoretical perspective, it encompasses several classical graph coloring problems, including Chromatic Number, Sum Coloring, and Interval Chromatic Number.
  Given that even the simplest concurrency-constrained scheduling problems are NP-hard for general conflict graphs, this study focuses on conflict graphs with bounded treewidth. Our results establish a dichotomy: Some problems in this setting can be solved in FPT time, while others are shown to be XALP-complete for treewidth as parameter. Along the way, we generalize several previously known results on coloring problems for bounded treewidth graphs. Several of the FPT algorithms are based on the insight that completion times are bounded by the Grundy number of the conflict graph - the fact that this number is bounded by the product of treewidth and the logarithm of the number of vertices then leads to the FPT time bound.</description>

      <title>Complexities of Well-Quasi-Ordered Substructural Logics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.21674</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.21674v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Substructural logics are formal logical systems that omit familiar structural rules of classical and intuitionistic logic such as contraction, weakening, exchange (commutativity), and associativity. This leads to a resource-sensitive logical framework that has proven influential beyond mathematical logic and its algebraic semantics, across theoretical computer science, linguistics, and philosophical logic. The set of theorems of a substructural logic is recursively enumerable and, in many cases, recursive. These logics also possess an intricate mathematical structure that has been the subject of research for over six decades.
  We undertake a comprehensive study of substructural logics possessing an underlying well-quasi-order (wqo), using established ordinal-indexed fast-growing complexity classes to classify the complexity of their deducibility (quasiequational) and provability (equational) problems. This includes substructural logics with weak variants of contraction and weakening, and logics with weak or even no exchange. We further consider infinitely many axiomatic extensions over the base systems.
  We establish a host of decidability and complexity bounds, many of them tight, by developing new techniques in proof theory, well-quasi-order theory (contributing new length theorems), the algebraic semantics of substructural logics via residuated lattices, algebraic proof theory, and novel encodings of counter machines. Classifying the computational complexity of substructural logics (and the complexity of the word problem and of the equational theory of their algebraic semantics) reveals how subtle variations in their design influence their algorithmic behavior, with the decision problems often reaching Ackermannian or even hyper-Ackermannian complexity.</description>

      <title>Computing Polynomial Representation in Subrings of Multivariate Polynomial Rings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.21708</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.21708v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Let $\mathcal{R} = \mathbb{K}[x_1, \dots, x_n]$ be a multivariate polynomial ring over a field $\mathbb{K}$ of characteristic 0. Consider $n$ algebraically independent elements $g_1, \dots, g_n$ in $\mathcal{R}$. Let $\mathcal{S}$ denote the subring of $\mathcal{R}$ generated by $g_1, \dots, g_n$, and let $h$ be an element of $\mathcal{S}$. Then, there exists a unique element ${f} \in \mathbb{K}[u_1, \dots, u_n]$ such that $h = f(g_1, \dots, g_n)$.
  In this paper, we provide an algorithm for computing ${f}$, given $h$ and $g_1, \dots, g_n$. The complexity of our algorithm is linear in the size of the input, $h$ and $g_1, \dots, g_n$, and polynomial in $n$ when the degree of $f$ is fixed. Previous works are mostly known when $f$ is a symmetric polynomial and $g_1, \dots, g_n$ are elementary symmetric, homogeneous symmetric, or power symmetric polynomials.</description>

      <title>Formalizing the notions of non-interactive and interactive algorithms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.19037</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.19037v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: An earlier paper gives an account of a quest for a satisfactory formalization of the classical informal notion of an algorithm. That notion only covers algorithms that are deterministic and non-interactive. In this paper, an attempt is made to generalize the results of that quest first to a notion of an algorithm that covers both deterministic and non-deterministic algorithms that are non-interactive and then further to a notion of an algorithm that covers both deterministic and non-deterministic algorithms that are interactive. The notions of an non-interactive proto-algorithm and an interactive proto-algorithm are introduced. Non-interactive algorithms and interactive algorithms are expected to be equivalence classes of non-interactive proto-algorithms and interactive proto-algorithms, respectively, under an appropriate equivalence relation. On both non-interactive proto-algorithms and interactive proto-algorithms, three equivalence relations are defined. Two of them are deemed to be bounds for an appropriate equivalence relation and the third is likely an appropriate one.</description>

      <title>Centrality of shortest paths: Algorithms and complexity results</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.08019</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.08019v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The degree centrality of a node, defined as the number of nodes adjacent to it, is often used as a measure of importance of a node to the structure of a network. This metric can be extended to paths in a network, where the degree centrality of a path is defined as the number of nodes adjacent to it. In this paper, we reconsider the problem of finding the most degree-central shortest path in an unweighted network. We propose a polynomial algorithm with the worst-case running time of $O(|E||V|^2\Delta(G))$, where $|V|$ is the number of vertices in the network, $|E|$ is the number of edges in the network, and $\Delta(G)$ is the maximum degree of the graph. We conduct a numerical study of our algorithm on synthetic and real-world networks and compare our results to the existing literature. In addition, we show that the same problem is NP-hard when a weighted graph is considered. Furthermore, we consider other centrality measures, such as the betweenness and closeness centrality, showing that the problem of finding the most betweenness-central shortest path is solvable in polynomial time and finding the most closeness-central shortest path is NP-hard, regardless of whether the graph is weighted or not.</description>

      <title>How to Construct Random Unitaries</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.10116</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.10116v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The existence of pseudorandom unitaries (PRUs) -- efficient quantum circuits that are computationally indistinguishable from Haar-random unitaries -- has been a central open question, with significant implications for cryptography, complexity theory, and fundamental physics. In this work, we close this question by proving that PRUs exist, assuming that any quantum-secure one-way function exists. We establish this result for both (1) the standard notion of PRUs, which are secure against any efficient adversary that makes queries to the unitary $U$, and (2) a stronger notion of PRUs, which are secure even against adversaries that can query both the unitary $U$ and its inverse $U^\dagger$. In the process, we prove that any algorithm that makes queries to a Haar-random unitary can be efficiently simulated on a quantum computer, up to inverse-exponential trace distance.</description>
