      <title>Nuclear Beavers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.12055</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.12055v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Nuclear physics is a very abstract field with little accessibility for wider audiences, and yet it is a field of physics with far reaching implications for everyday life. The Nuclear Beavers demonstration is a hands-on experience that offers an intuitive lens into nuclear structure and decay. We aim to provide a more accessible entry point for students and educators by substituting complex nuclear structures and interactions with tactile building blocks following well-defined rules, thereby opening nuclear physics concepts to the general public.</description>

      <title>Updating the Complex Systems Keyword Diagram Using Collective Feedback and Latest Literature Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.11997</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.11997v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The complex systems keyword diagram generated by the author in 2010 has been used widely in a variety of educational and outreach purposes, but it definitely needs a major update and reorganization. This short paper reports our recent attempt to update the keyword diagram using information collected from the following multiple sources: (a) collective feedback posted on social media, (b) recent reference books on complex systems and network science, (c) online resources on complex systems, and (d) keyword search hits obtained using OpenAlex, an open-access bibliographic catalogue of scientific publications. The data (a), (b) and (c) were used to incorporate the research community's internal perceptions of the relevant topics, whereas the data (d) was used to obtain more objective measurements of the keywords' relevance and associations from publications made in complex systems science. Results revealed differences and overlaps between public perception and actual usage of keywords in publications on complex systems. Four topical communities were obtained from the keyword association network, although they were highly intertwined with each other. We hope that the resulting network visualization of complex systems keywords provides a more up-to-date, accurate topic map of the field of complex systems as of today.</description>

      <title>A stochastic approach in physics exercises of mathematics education</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.04076</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.04076v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present a method for incorporating a stochastic point of view into physics exercises of mathematics education. The core of our method is the randomization of some inputs, the system model used does not differ from what we would use in the deterministic approach. We consider exercises from the theory of projectile motion and statics. The outputs of stochastic models are random variables, and we usually determine their probability distributions, expected values, variances, and relative standard deviations, and the probabilities of some events related to them are also calculated. Students and teachers familiar with elementary probability theory and mechanics may find these exercises useful for understanding some basic concepts of stochastic mechanics.</description>

      <title>The Quantum Technology Job Market: Data Driven Analysis of 3641 Job Posts</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.19004</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.19004v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The rapid advancement of Quantum Technology (QT) has created a growing demand for a specialized workforce, spanning across academia and industry. This study presents a quantitative analysis of the QT job market by systematically extracting and classifying thousands of job postings worldwide. The classification pipeline leverages large language models (LLMs) whilst incorporating a "human-in-the-loop" validation process to ensure reliability, achieving an F1-score of 89%: a high level of accuracy. The research identifies key trends in regional job distribution, degree and skill requirements, and the evolving demand for QT-related roles. Findings reveal a strong presence of the QT job market in the United States and Europe, with increasing corporate demand for engineers, software developers, and PhD-level researchers. Despite growing industry applications, the sector remains in its early stages, dominated by large technology firms and requiring significant investment in education and workforce development. The study highlights the need for targeted educational programs, interdisciplinary collaboration, and industry-academic partnerships to bridge the QT workforce gap.</description>
