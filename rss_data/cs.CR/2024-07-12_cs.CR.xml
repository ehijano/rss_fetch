      <title>Benchmarking GNNs Using Lightning Network Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.07916</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.07916v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Bitcoin Lightning Network is a layer 2 protocol designed to facilitate fast and inexpensive Bitcoin transactions. It operates by establishing channels between users, where Bitcoin is locked and transactions are conducted off-chain until the channels are closed, with only the initial and final transactions recorded on the blockchain. Routing transactions through intermediary nodes is crucial for users without direct channels, allowing these routing nodes to collect fees for their services. Nodes announce their channels to the network, forming a graph with channels as edges. In this paper, we analyze the graph structure of the Lightning Network and investigate the statistical relationships between node properties using machine learning, particularly Graph Neural Networks (GNNs). We formulate a series of tasks to explore these relationships and provide benchmarks for GNN architectures, demonstrating how topological and neighbor information enhances performance. Our evaluation of several models reveals the effectiveness of GNNs in these tasks and highlights the insights gained from their application.</description>

      <title>Non-Cooperative Backdoor Attacks in Federated Learning: A New Threat Landscape</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.07917</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.07917v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Despite the promise of Federated Learning (FL) for privacy-preserving model training on distributed data, it remains susceptible to backdoor attacks. These attacks manipulate models by embedding triggers (specific input patterns) in the training data, forcing misclassification as predefined classes during deployment. Traditional single-trigger attacks and recent work on cooperative multiple-trigger attacks, where clients collaborate, highlight limitations in attack realism due to coordination requirements. We investigate a more alarming scenario: non-cooperative multiple-trigger attacks. Here, independent adversaries introduce distinct triggers targeting unique classes. These parallel attacks exploit FL's decentralized nature, making detection difficult. Our experiments demonstrate the alarming vulnerability of FL to such attacks, where individual backdoors can be successfully learned without impacting the main task. This research emphasizes the critical need for robust defenses against diverse backdoor attacks in the evolving FL landscape. While our focus is on empirical analysis, we believe it can guide backdoor research toward more realistic settings, highlighting the crucial role of FL in building robust defenses against diverse backdoor threats.

      <title>Detecting new obfuscated malware variants: A lightweight and interpretable machine learning approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.07918</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.07918v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Machine learning has been successfully applied in developing malware detection systems, with a primary focus on accuracy, and increasing attention to reducing computational overhead and improving model interpretability. However, an important question remains underexplored: How well can machine learning-based models detect entirely new forms of malware not present in the training data? In this study, we present a machine learning-based system for detecting obfuscated malware that is not only highly accurate, lightweight and interpretable, but also capable of successfully adapting to new types of malware attacks. Our system is capable of detecting 15 malware subtypes despite being exclusively trained on one malware subtype, namely the Transponder from the Spyware family. This system was built after training 15 distinct random forest-based models, each on a different malware subtype from the CIC-MalMem-2022 dataset. These models were evaluated against the entire range of malware subtypes, including all unseen malware subtypes. To maintain the system's streamlined nature, training was confined to the top five most important features, which also enhanced interpretability. The Transponder-focused model exhibited high accuracy, exceeding 99.8%, with an average processing speed of 5.7 microseconds per file. We also illustrate how the Shapley additive explanations technique can facilitate the interpretation of the model predictions. Our research contributes to advancing malware detection methodologies, pioneering the feasibility of detecting obfuscated malware by exclusively training a model on a single or a few carefully selected malware subtypes and applying it to detect unseen subtypes.</description>

      <title>A Trustworthy AIoT-enabled Localization System via Federated Learning and Blockchain</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.07921</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.07921v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: There is a significant demand for indoor localization technology in smart buildings, and the most promising solution in this field is using RF sensors and fingerprinting-based methods that employ machine learning models trained on crowd-sourced user data gathered from IoT devices. However, this raises security and privacy issues in practice. Some researchers propose to use federated learning to partially overcome privacy problems, but there still remain security concerns, e.g., single-point failure and malicious attacks. In this paper, we propose a framework named DFLoc to achieve precise 3D localization tasks while considering the following two security concerns. Particularly, we design a specialized blockchain to decentralize the framework by distributing the tasks such as model distribution and aggregation which are handled by a central server to all clients in most previous works, to address the issue of the single-point failure for a reliable and accurate indoor localization system. Moreover, we introduce an updated model verification mechanism within the blockchain to alleviate the concern of malicious node attacks. Experimental results substantiate the framework's capacity to deliver accurate 3D location predictions and its superior resistance to the impacts of single-point failure and malicious attacks when compared to conventional centralized federated learning systems.</description>

      <title>Vulnerability Detection in Smart Contracts: A Comprehensive Survey</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.07922</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.07922v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the growing field of blockchain technology, smart contracts exist as transformative digital agreements that execute transactions autonomously in decentralised networks. However, these contracts face challenges in the form of security vulnerabilities, posing significant financial and operational risks. While traditional methods to detect and mitigate vulnerabilities in smart contracts are limited due to a lack of comprehensiveness and effectiveness, integrating advanced machine learning technologies presents an attractive approach to increasing effective vulnerability countermeasures. We endeavour to fill an important gap in the existing literature by conducting a rigorous systematic review, exploring the intersection between machine learning and smart contracts. Specifically, the study examines the potential of machine learning techniques to improve the detection and mitigation of vulnerabilities in smart contracts. We analysed 88 articles published between 2018 and 2023 from the following databases: IEEE, ACM, ScienceDirect, Scopus, and Google Scholar. The findings reveal that classical machine learning techniques, including KNN, RF, DT, XG-Boost, and SVM, outperform static tools in vulnerability detection. Moreover, multi-model approaches integrating deep learning and classical machine learning show significant improvements in precision and recall, while hybrid models employing various techniques achieve near-perfect performance in vulnerability detection accuracy.
  By integrating state-of-the-art solutions, this work synthesises current methods, thoroughly investigates research gaps, and suggests directions for future studies. The insights gathered from this study are intended to serve as a seminal reference for academics, industry experts, and bodies interested in leveraging machine learning to enhance smart contract security.</description>

      <title>Synthetic Data: Revisiting the Privacy-Utility Trade-off</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.07926</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.07926v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Synthetic data has been considered a better privacy-preserving alternative to traditionally sanitized data across various applications. However, a recent article challenges this notion, stating that synthetic data does not provide a better trade-off between privacy and utility than traditional anonymization techniques, and that it leads to unpredictable utility loss and highly unpredictable privacy gain. The article also claims to have identified a breach in the differential privacy guarantees provided by PATEGAN and PrivBayes. When a study claims to refute or invalidate prior findings, it is crucial to verify and validate the study. In our work, we analyzed the implementation of the privacy game described in the article and found that it operated in a highly specialized and constrained environment, which limits the applicability of its findings to general cases. Our exploration also revealed that the game did not satisfy a crucial precondition concerning data distributions, which contributed to the perceived violation of the differential privacy guarantees offered by PATEGAN and PrivBayes. We also conducted a privacy-utility trade-off analysis in a more general and unconstrained environment. Our experimentation demonstrated that synthetic data achieves a more favorable privacy-utility trade-off compared to the provided implementation of k-anonymization, thereby reaffirming earlier conclusions.</description>

      <title>A Comprehensive Survey on the Security of Smart Grid: Challenges, Mitigations, and Future Research Opportunities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.07966</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.07966v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this study, we conduct a comprehensive review of smart grid security, exploring system architectures, attack methodologies, defense strategies, and future research opportunities. We provide an in-depth analysis of various attack vectors, focusing on new attack surfaces introduced by advanced components in smart grids. The review particularly includes an extensive analysis of coordinated attacks that incorporate multiple attack strategies and exploit vulnerabilities across various smart grid components to increase their adverse impact, demonstrating the complexity and potential severity of these threats. Following this, we examine innovative detection and mitigation strategies, including game theory, graph theory, blockchain, and machine learning, discussing their advancements in counteracting evolving threats and associated research challenges. In particular, our review covers a thorough examination of widely used machine learning-based mitigation strategies, analyzing their applications and research challenges spanning across supervised, unsupervised, semi-supervised, ensemble, and reinforcement learning. Further, we outline future research directions and explore new techniques and concerns. We first discuss the research opportunities for existing and emerging strategies, and then explore the potential role of new techniques, such as large language models (LLMs), and the emerging threat of adversarial machine learning in the future of smart grid security.</description>

      <title>Privacy-Preserving Data Deduplication for Enhancing Federated Learning of Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.08152</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.08152v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Deduplication is a vital preprocessing step that enhances machine learning model performance and saves training time and energy. However, enhancing federated learning through deduplication poses challenges, especially regarding scalability and potential privacy violations if deduplication involves sharing all clients' data. In this paper, we address the problem of deduplication in a federated setup by introducing a pioneering protocol, Efficient Privacy-Preserving Multi-Party Deduplication (EP-MPD). It efficiently removes duplicates from multiple clients' datasets without compromising data privacy. EP-MPD is constructed in a modular fashion, utilizing two novel variants of the Private Set Intersection protocol. Our extensive experiments demonstrate the significant benefits of deduplication in federated learning of large language models. For instance, we observe up to 19.61% improvement in perplexity and up to 27.95% reduction in running time. EP-MPD effectively balances privacy and performance in federated learning, making it a valuable solution for large-scale applications.</description>

      <title>Model-agnostic clean-label backdoor mitigation in cybersecurity environments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.08159</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.08159v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The training phase of machine learning models is a delicate step, especially in cybersecurity contexts. Recent research has surfaced a series of insidious training-time attacks that inject backdoors in models designed for security classification tasks without altering the training labels. With this work, we propose new techniques that leverage insights in cybersecurity threat models to effectively mitigate these clean-label poisoning attacks, while preserving the model utility. By performing density-based clustering on a carefully chosen feature subspace, and progressively isolating the suspicious clusters through a novel iterative scoring procedure, our defensive mechanism can mitigate the attacks without requiring many of the common assumptions in the existing backdoor defense literature. To show the generality of our proposed mitigation, we evaluate it on two clean-label model-agnostic attacks on two different classic cybersecurity data modalities: network flows classification and malware classification, using gradient boosting and neural network models.</description>

      <title>Automatic Generation of Web Censorship Probe Lists</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.08185</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.08185v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Domain probe lists--used to determine which URLs to probe for Web censorship--play a critical role in Internet censorship measurement studies. Indeed, the size and accuracy of the domain probe list limits the set of censored pages that can be detected; inaccurate lists can lead to an incomplete view of the censorship landscape or biased results. Previous efforts to generate domain probe lists have been mostly manual or crowdsourced. This approach is time-consuming, prone to errors, and does not scale well to the ever-changing censorship landscape.
  In this paper, we explore methods for automatically generating probe lists that are both comprehensive and up-to-date for Web censorship measurement. We start from an initial set of 139,957 unique URLs from various existing test lists consisting of pages from a variety of languages to generate new candidate pages. By analyzing content from these URLs (i.e., performing topic and keyword extraction), expanding these topics, and using them as a feed to search engines, our method produces 119,255 new URLs across 35,147 domains. We then test the new candidate pages by attempting to access each URL from servers in eleven different global locations over a span of four months to check for their connectivity and potential signs of censorship. Our measurements reveal that our method discovered over 1,400 domains--not present in the original dataset--we suspect to be blocked. In short, automatically updating probe lists is possible, and can help further automate censorship measurements at scale.</description>

      <title>AoA-Based Physical Layer Authentication in Analog Arrays under Impersonation Attacks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.08282</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.08282v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We discuss the use of angle of arrival (AoA) as an authentication measure in analog array multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) systems. A base station equipped with an analog array authenticates users based on the AoA estimated from certified pilot transmissions, while active attackers manipulate their transmitted signals to mount impersonation attacks. We study several attacks of increasing intensity (captured through the availability of side information at the attackers) and assess the performance of AoA-based authentication using one-class classifiers. Our results show that some attack techniques with knowledge of the combiners at the verifier are effective in falsifying the AoA and compromising the security of the considered type of physical layer authentication.</description>

      <title>Performance Evaluation of Hashing Algorithms on Commodity Hardware</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.08284</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.08284v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Hashing functions, which are created to provide brief and erratic digests for the message entered, are the primary cryptographic primitives used in blockchain networks. Hashing is employed in blockchain networks to create linked block lists, which offer safe and secure distributed repository storage for critical information. Due to the unique nature of the hash search problem in blockchain networks, the most parallelization of calculations is possible. This technical report presents a performance evaluation of three popular hashing algorithms Blake3, SHA-256, and SHA-512. These hashing algorithms are widely used in various applications, such as digital signatures, message authentication, and password storage. It then discusses the performance metrics used to evaluate the algorithms, such as hash rate/throughput and memory usage. The evaluation is conducted on a range of hardware platforms, including desktop and VMs. The evaluation includes synthetic benchmarks. The results of the evaluation show that Blake3 generally outperforms both SHA-256 and SHA-512 in terms of throughput and latency. However, the performance advantage of Blake3 varies depending on the specific hardware platform and the size of the input data. The report concludes with recommendations for selecting the most suitable hashing algorithm for a given application, based on its performance requirements and security needs. The evaluation results can also inform future research and development efforts to improve the performance and security of hashing algorithms.</description>

      <title>Preventing Radio Fingerprinting through Friendly Jamming</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.08311</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.08311v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Radio Frequency fingerprinting enables a passive receiver to recognize and authenticate a transmitter without the need for cryptographic tools. Authentication is achieved by isolating specific features of the transmitted signal that are unique to the transmitter's hardware. Much research has focused on improving the effectiveness and efficiency of radio frequency fingerprinting to maximize its performance in various scenarios and conditions, while little research examined how to protect devices from being subject to radio fingerprinting in the wild.
  In this paper, we explore a novel point of view. We examine the hostile usage of radio frequency fingerprinting, which facilitates the unauthorized tracking of wireless devices in the field by malicious entities. We also suggest a method to sanitize the transmitted signal of its fingerprint using a jammer, deployed on purpose to improve devices' anonymity on the channel while still guaranteeing the link's quality of service. Our experimental results and subsequent analysis demonstrate that a friendly jammer can effectively block a malicious eavesdropper from recognizing and tracking a device without affecting the quality of the wireless link, thereby restoring the privacy of the user when accessing the radio spectrum.</description>

      <title>Cyber Attacks on Maritime Assets and their Impacts on Health and Safety Aboard: A Holistic View</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.08406</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.08406v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: There has been an unprecedented digitization drive in the industrial sector, especially in the maritime industry. The profusion of intelligent electronic devices and IOT-enabled cyber-physical systems (CPS) has helped in the efficient use of resources and increased convenience. CPS has enabled real-time remote command and control of industrial assets. Unlike the relatively isolated legacy systems, the intertwined nature of Information Technology(IT) and Operations Technology(OT) brought by Industry 4.0 has increased the complexity of the systems, thereby increasing the attack surface. This work explores the possible consequences of these attacks from a more holistic view, focusing on high-risk assets such as offshore oil rigs, offshore wind farms, and autonomous vessels. The attacks have become more aggressive with the proliferation of such technologies, disrupting the physical process, causing fire and explosion hazards, and endangering human life and environmental health. The possible attack scenarios, the attack vectors, and their physical consequences have been discussed from the perspective of personnel safety and health, along with known security breaches of such nature. To the best of the authors' knowledge, seldom has any work been done that accentuates the possible human and environmental impacts of such attacks.</description>

      <title>On the (In)Security of LLM App Stores</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.08422</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.08422v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: LLM app stores have seen rapid growth, leading to the proliferation of numerous custom LLM apps. However, this expansion raises security concerns. In this study, we propose a three-layer concern framework to identify the potential security risks of LLM apps, i.e., LLM apps with abusive potential, LLM apps with malicious intent, and LLM apps with exploitable vulnerabilities. Over five months, we collected 786,036 LLM apps from six major app stores: GPT Store, FlowGPT, Poe, Coze, Cici, and Character.AI. Our research integrates static and dynamic analysis, the development of a large-scale toxic word dictionary (i.e., ToxicDict) comprising over 31,783 entries, and automated monitoring tools to identify and mitigate threats. We uncovered that 15,146 apps had misleading descriptions, 1,366 collected sensitive personal information against their privacy policies, and 15,996 generated harmful content such as hate speech, self-harm, extremism, etc. Additionally, we evaluated the potential for LLM apps to facilitate malicious activities, finding that 616 apps could be used for malware generation, phishing, etc. Our findings highlight the urgent need for robust regulatory frameworks and enhanced enforcement mechanisms.</description>

      <title>Enhancing Privacy of Spatiotemporal Federated Learning against Gradient Inversion Attacks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.08529</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.08529v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Spatiotemporal federated learning has recently raised intensive studies due to its ability to train valuable models with only shared gradients in various location-based services. On the other hand, recent studies have shown that shared gradients may be subject to gradient inversion attacks (GIA) on images or texts. However, so far there has not been any systematic study of the gradient inversion attacks in spatiotemporal federated learning. In this paper, we explore the gradient attack problem in spatiotemporal federated learning from attack and defense perspectives. To understand privacy risks in spatiotemporal federated learning, we first propose Spatiotemporal Gradient Inversion Attack (ST-GIA), a gradient attack algorithm tailored to spatiotemporal data that successfully reconstructs the original location from gradients. Furthermore, we design an adaptive defense strategy to mitigate gradient inversion attacks in spatiotemporal federated learning. By dynamically adjusting the perturbation levels, we can offer tailored protection for varying rounds of training data, thereby achieving a better trade-off between privacy and utility than current state-of-the-art methods. Through intensive experimental analysis on three real-world datasets, we reveal that the proposed defense strategy can well preserve the utility of spatiotemporal federated learning with effective security protection.</description>

      <title>Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures (TTPs) in Interpreted Malware: A Zero-Shot Generation with Large Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.08532</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.08532v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Nowadays, the open-source software (OSS) ecosystem suffers from security threats of software supply chain (SSC) attacks. Interpreted OSS malware plays a vital role in SSC attacks, as criminals have an arsenal of attack vectors to deceive users into installing malware and executing malicious activities. In this paper, we introduce tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs) proposed by MITRE ATT\&amp;CK into the interpreted malware analysis to characterize different phases of an attack lifecycle. Specifically, we propose GENTTP, a zero-shot approach to extracting a TTP of an interpreted malware package. GENTTP leverages large language models (LLMs) to automatically generate a TTP, where the input is a malicious package, and the output is a deceptive tactic and an execution tactic of attack vectors. To validate the effectiveness of GENTTP, we collect two datasets for evaluation: a dataset with ground truth labels and a large dataset in the wild. Experimental results show that GENTTP can generate TTPs with high accuracy and efficiency. To demonstrate GENTTP's benefits, we build an LLM-based Chatbot from 3,700+ PyPI malware's TTPs. We further conduct a quantitative analysis of malware's TTPs at a large scale. Our main findings include: (1) many OSS malicious packages share a relatively stable TTP, even with the increasing emergence of malware and attack campaigns, (2) a TTP reflects characteristics of a malware-based attack, and (3) an attacker's intent behind the malware is linked to a TTP.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.08535v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Automated Cryptographic Validation Protocol (ACVP) is an existing protocol that is used to validate a software or hardware cryptographic module automatically. In this work, we present a system providing the method and tools to produce well-covering tests in ACVP format for cryptographic libraries. The system achieves better coverage than existing fuzzing methods by using a hybrid approach to fuzzing cryptographic primitives. In addition, the system offers a framework that allows to creates easily and securely create testing modules for cryptographic libraries. The work demonstrates how this system has been used to improve automated testing of NSS (Network Security Services), a popular cryptographic library, detect its vulnerabilities and suggest ways to improve and further develop the ACVP test format.</description>

      <title>SpiralShard: Highly Concurrent and Secure Blockchain Sharding via Linked Cross-shard Endorsement</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.08651</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.08651v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Blockchain sharding improves the scalability of blockchain systems by partitioning the whole blockchain state, nodes, and transaction workloads into different shards. However, existing blockchain sharding systems generally suffer from a small number of shards, resulting in limited concurrency. The main reason is that existing sharding systems require large shard sizes to ensure security. To enhance the concurrency of blockchain sharding securely, we propose SpiralShard. The intuition is to allow the existence of some shards with a larger fraction of malicious nodes (i.e., corrupted shards), thus reducing shard sizes. SpiralShard can configure more and smaller shards for higher concurrency at the same network size. To ensure security with the existence of corrupted shards, we propose the Linked Cross-shard Endorsement (LCE) protocol. According to our LCE protocol, the blocks of each shard are sequentially verified and endorsed by a group of shards before being finalized. As a result, a corrupted shard can eliminate forks with the help of the other shards. We implement SpiralShard based on Harmony and conduct extensive evaluations. Experimental results show that, compared with Harmony, SpiralShard achieves around 19x throughput gain under a large network size with 4,000+ nodes.</description>

      <title>Mon CH\`ERI &lt;3 Adapting Capability Hardware Enhanced RISC with Conditional Capabilities</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.08663v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Up to 10% of memory-safety vulnerabilities in languages like C and C++ stem from uninitialized variables. This work addresses the prevalence and lack of adequate software mitigations for uninitialized memory issues, proposing architectural protections in hardware. Capability-based addressing, such as the University of Cambridge's CHERI, mitigates many memory defects, including spatial and temporal safety violations at an architectural level. However, current CHERI designs do not handle undefined behavior from uninitialized variables. We extend the CHERI capability model to include "conditional capabilities", enabling memory-access policies based on prior operations. This allows enforcement of policies that satisfy memory safety objectives such as "no reads to memory without at least one prior write" (Write-before-Read). We present our architecture extension, compiler support, and a detailed evaluation of our approach using the QEMU full-system simulator and our modified FPGA-based CHERI-RISCV softcore. Our evaluation shows Write-before-Read conditional capabilities are practical, with high detection accuracy while adding a small (~3.5%) overhead to the existing CHERI architecture.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.08708v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Long contexts of recent LLMs have enabled a new use case: asking models to find security vulnerabilities in entire codebases. To evaluate model performance on this task, we introduce eyeballvul: a benchmark designed to test the vulnerability detection capabilities of language models at scale, that is sourced and updated weekly from the stream of published vulnerabilities in open-source repositories. The benchmark consists of a list of revisions in different repositories, each associated with the list of known vulnerabilities present at that revision. An LLM-based scorer is used to compare the list of possible vulnerabilities returned by a model to the list of known vulnerabilities for each revision. As of July 2024, eyeballvul contains 24,000+ vulnerabilities across 6,000+ revisions and 5,000+ repositories, and is around 55GB in size.</description>

      <title>Cryptography in the Common Haar State Model: Feasibility Results and Separations</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.07908v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Common random string model is a popular model in classical cryptography. We study a quantum analogue of this model called the common Haar state (CHS) model. In this model, every party participating in the cryptographic system receives many copies of one or more i.i.d Haar random states. We study feasibility and limitations of cryptographic primitives in this model and its variants:
  - We present a construction of pseudorandom function-like states with security against computationally unbounded adversaries, as long as the adversaries only receive (a priori) bounded number of copies. By suitably instantiating the CHS model, we obtain a new approach to construct pseudorandom function-like states in the plain model.
  - We present separations between pseudorandom function-like states (with super-logarithmic length) and quantum cryptographic primitives, such as interactive key agreement and bit commitment, with classical communication. To show these separations, we prove new results on the indistinguishability of identical versus independent Haar states against LOCC (local operations, classical communication) adversaries.</description>

      <title>BriDe Arbitrager: Enhancing Arbitrage in Ethereum 2.0 via Bribery-enabled Delayed Block Production</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.08537</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.08537v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The advent of Ethereum 2.0 has introduced significant changes, particularly the shift to Proof-of-Stake consensus. This change presents new opportunities and challenges for arbitrage. Amidst these changes, we introduce BriDe Arbitrager, a novel tool designed for Ethereum 2.0 that leverages Bribery-driven attacks to Delay block production and increase arbitrage gains. The main idea is to allow malicious proposers to delay block production by bribing validators/proposers, thereby gaining more time to identify arbitrage opportunities. Through analysing the bribery process, we design an adaptive bribery strategy. Additionally, we propose a Delayed Transaction Ordering Algorithm to leverage the delayed time to amplify arbitrage profits for malicious proposers. To ensure fairness and automate the bribery process, we design and implement a bribery smart contract and a bribery client. As a result, BriDe Arbitrager enables adversaries controlling a limited (&lt; 1/4) fraction of the voting powers to delay block production via bribery and arbitrage more profit. Extensive experimental results based on Ethereum historical transactions demonstrate that BriDe Arbitrager yields an average of 8.66 ETH (16,442.23 USD) daily profits. Furthermore, our approach does not trigger any slashing mechanisms and remains effective even under Proposer Builder Separation and other potential mechanisms will be adopted by Ethereum.</description>

      <title>RAIFLE: Reconstruction Attacks on Interaction-based Federated Learning with Adversarial Data Manipulation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.19163</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.19163v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Federated learning has emerged as a promising privacy-preserving solution for machine learning domains that rely on user interactions, particularly recommender systems and online learning to rank. While there has been substantial research on the privacy of traditional federated learning, little attention has been paid to the privacy properties of these interaction-based settings. In this work, we show that users face an elevated risk of having their private interactions reconstructed by the central server when the server can control the training features of the items that users interact with. We introduce RAIFLE, a novel optimization-based attack framework where the server actively manipulates the features of the items presented to users to increase the success rate of reconstruction. Our experiments with federated recommendation and online learning-to-rank scenarios demonstrate that RAIFLE is significantly more powerful than existing reconstruction attacks like gradient inversion, achieving high performance consistently in most settings. We discuss the pros and cons of several possible countermeasures to defend against RAIFLE in the context of interaction-based federated learning. Our code is open-sourced at https://github.com/dzungvpham/raifle.</description>

      <title>NeuroIDBench: An Open-Source Benchmark Framework for the Standardization of Methodology in Brainwave-based Authentication Research</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.08656</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.08656v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Biometric systems based on brain activity have been proposed as an alternative to passwords or to complement current authentication techniques. By leveraging the unique brainwave patterns of individuals, these systems offer the possibility of creating authentication solutions that are resistant to theft, hands-free, accessible, and potentially even revocable. However, despite the growing stream of research in this area, faster advance is hindered by reproducibility problems. Issues such as the lack of standard reporting schemes for performance results and system configuration, or the absence of common evaluation benchmarks, make comparability and proper assessment of different biometric solutions challenging. Further, barriers are erected to future work when, as so often, source code is not published open access. To bridge this gap, we introduce NeuroIDBench, a flexible open source tool to benchmark brainwave-based authentication models. It incorporates nine diverse datasets, implements a comprehensive set of pre-processing parameters and machine learning algorithms, enables testing under two common adversary models (known vs unknown attacker), and allows researchers to generate full performance reports and visualizations. We use NeuroIDBench to investigate the shallow classifiers and deep learning-based approaches proposed in the literature, and to test robustness across multiple sessions. We observe a 37.6% reduction in Equal Error Rate (EER) for unknown attacker scenarios (typically not tested in the literature), and we highlight the importance of session variability to brainwave authentication. All in all, our results demonstrate the viability and relevance of NeuroIDBench in streamlining fair comparisons of algorithms, thereby furthering the advancement of brainwave-based authentication through robust methodological practices.</description>

      <title>Clap: a Semantic-Preserving Optimizing eDSL for Plonkish Proof Systems</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.12115v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Plonkish is a popular circuit format for developing zero-knowledge proof systems that powers a number of major projects in the blockchain space, responsible for holding billions of dollars and processing millions of transactions per day. These projects, including zero-knowledge rollups, rely on highly hand-optimized circuits whose correctness comes at the cost of time-consuming testing and auditing.
  In this paper, we present Clap, the first Rust eDSL with a proof system agnostic circuit format, facilitating extensibility, automatic optimizations, and formal assurances for the resultant constraint system. Clap casts the problem of producing Plonkish constraint systems and their witness generators as a semantic-preserving compilation problem. Soundness and completeness of the transformation guarantees the absence of subtle bugs caused by under- or over-constraining. Our experimental evaluation shows that its automatic optimizations achieve better performance compared to manual circuit optimization. The optimizer can also be used to automatically derive custom gates from circuit descriptions.</description>

      <title>Optimal Sharding for Scalable Blockchains with Deconstructed SMR</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.08252</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.08252v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Sharding is proposed to enhance blockchain scalability. However, a size-security dilemma where every shard must be large enough to ensure its security constrains the efficacy of individual shards and the degree of sharding itself. Most existing sharding solutions therefore rely on either weakening the adversary or making stronger assumptions on network links.
  This paper presents Arete, an optimally scalable blockchain sharding protocol designed to resolve the dilemma based on an observation that if individual shards can tolerate a higher fraction of (Byzantine) faults, we can securely create smaller shards in a larger quantity. The key idea of Arete, therefore, is to improve the security resilience/threshold of shards by dividing the blockchain's State Machine Replication (SMR) process itself. Similar to modern blockchains, Arete first decouples SMR in three steps: transaction dissemination, ordering, and execution. However, unlike other blockchains, for Arete, a single ordering shard performs the ordering task while multiple processing shards perform the dissemination and execution of blocks. As processing shards do not run consensus, each of those can tolerate up to half compromised nodes. Moreover, the SMR process in the ordering shard is lightweight as it only operates on the block digests. Second, Arete considers safety and liveness against Byzantine failures separately to improve the safety threshold further while tolerating temporary liveness violations in a controlled manner. Apart from the creation of more optimal-size shards, such a deconstructed SMR scheme also empowers us to devise a novel certify-order-execute architecture to fully parallelize transaction handling, thereby improving the performance of sharded blockchain systems. We implement Arete and evaluate it on a geo-distributed AWS environment, showing that Arete outperforms the state-of-the-art sharding protocol.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.19845v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Jailbreak attacks on large language models (LLMs) involve inducing these models to generate harmful content that violates ethics or laws, posing a significant threat to LLM security. Current jailbreak attacks face two main challenges: low success rates due to defensive measures and high resource requirements for crafting specific prompts. This paper introduces Virtual Context, which leverages special tokens, previously overlooked in LLM security, to improve jailbreak attacks. Virtual Context addresses these challenges by significantly increasing the success rates of existing jailbreak methods and requiring minimal background knowledge about the target model, thus enhancing effectiveness in black-box settings without additional overhead. Comprehensive evaluations show that Virtual Context-assisted jailbreak attacks can improve the success rates of four widely used jailbreak methods by approximately 40% across various LLMs. Additionally, applying Virtual Context to original malicious behaviors still achieves a notable jailbreak effect. In summary, our research highlights the potential of special tokens in jailbreak attacks and recommends including this threat in red-teaming testing to comprehensively enhance LLM security.</description>

Abstract: Nowadays, threat reports from cybersecurity vendors incorporate detailed descriptions of attacks within unstructured text. Knowing vulnerabilities that are related to these reports helps cybersecurity researchers and practitioners understand and adjust to evolving attacks and develop mitigation plans. This paper aims to aid cybersecurity researchers and practitioners in choosing attack extraction methods to enhance the monitoring and sharing of threat intelligence. In this work, we examine five feature extraction methods (TF-IDF, LSI, BERT, MiniLM, RoBERTa) and find that Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency (TF-IDF) outperforms the other four methods with a precision of 75\% and an F1 score of 64\%. The findings offer valuable insights to the cybersecurity community, and our research can aid cybersecurity researchers in evaluating and comparing the effectiveness of upcoming extraction methods.</description>

Abstract: Vulnerabilities in software security can remain undiscovered even after being exploited. Linking attacks to vulnerabilities helps experts identify and respond promptly to the incident. This paper introduces VULDAT, a classification tool using a sentence transformer MPNET to identify system vulnerabilities from attack descriptions. Our model was applied to 100 attack techniques from the ATT&amp;CK repository and 685 issues from the CVE repository. Then, we compare the performance of VULDAT against the other eight state-of-the-art classifiers based on sentence transformers. Our findings indicate that our model achieves the best performance with F1 score of 0.85, Precision of 0.86, and Recall of 0.83. Furthermore, we found 56% of CVE reports vulnerabilities associated with an attack were identified by VULDAT, and 61% of identified vulnerabilities were in the CVE repository.</description>

Abstract: In this paper, we address the challenge of differential privacy in the context of graph cuts, specifically focusing on the minimum $k$-cut and multiway cut problems. We introduce edge-differentially private algorithms that achieve nearly optimal performance for these problems.
  For the multiway cut problem, we first provide a private algorithm with a multiplicative approximation ratio that matches the state-of-the-art non-private algorithm. We then present a tight information-theoretic lower bound on the additive error, demonstrating that our algorithm on weighted graphs is near-optimal for constant $k$. For the minimum $k$-cut problem, our algorithms leverage a known bound on the number of approximate $k$-cuts, resulting in a private algorithm with optimal additive error $O(k\log n)$ for fixed privacy parameter. We also establish a information-theoretic lower bound that matches this additive error. Additionally, we give an efficient private algorithm for $k$-cut even for non-constant $k$, including a polynomial-time 2-approximation with an additive error of $\widetilde{O}(k^{1.5})$.</description>

Abstract: Privacy is a central challenge for systems that learn from sensitive data sets, especially when a system's outputs must be continuously updated to reflect changing data. We consider the achievable error for differentially private continual release of a basic statistic - the number of distinct items - in a stream where items may be both inserted and deleted (the turnstile model). With only insertions, existing algorithms have additive error just polylogarithmic in the length of the stream $T$. We uncover a much richer landscape in the turnstile model, even without considering memory restrictions. We show that every differentially private mechanism that handles insertions and deletions has worst-case additive error at least $T^{1/4}$ even under a relatively weak, event-level privacy definition. Then, we identify a parameter of the input stream, its maximum flippancy, that is low for natural data streams and for which we give tight parameterized error guarantees. Specifically, the maximum flippancy is the largest number of times that the contribution of a single item to the distinct elements count changes over the course of the stream. We present an item-level differentially private mechanism that, for all turnstile streams with maximum flippancy $w$, continually outputs the number of distinct elements with an $O(\sqrt{w} \cdot poly\log T)$ additive error, without requiring prior knowledge of $w$. We prove that this is the best achievable error bound that depends only on $w$, for a large range of values of $w$. When $w$ is small, the error of our mechanism is similar to the polylogarithmic in $T$ error in the insertion-only setting, bypassing the hardness in the turnstile model.</description>

      <title>Resilience of Entropy Model in Distributed Neural Networks</title>

Abstract: Distributed deep neural networks (DNNs) have emerged as a key technique to reduce communication overhead without sacrificing performance in edge computing systems. Recently, entropy coding has been introduced to further reduce the communication overhead. The key idea is to train the distributed DNN jointly with an entropy model, which is used as side information during inference time to adaptively encode latent representations into bit streams with variable length. To the best of our knowledge, the resilience of entropy models is yet to be investigated. As such, in this paper we formulate and investigate the resilience of entropy models to intentional interference (e.g., adversarial attacks) and unintentional interference (e.g., weather changes and motion blur). Through an extensive experimental campaign with 3 different DNN architectures, 2 entropy models and 4 rate-distortion trade-off factors, we demonstrate that the entropy attacks can increase the communication overhead by up to 95%. By separating compression features in frequency and spatial domain, we propose a new defense mechanism that can reduce the transmission overhead of the attacked input by about 9% compared to unperturbed data, with only about 2% accuracy loss. Importantly, the proposed defense mechanism is a standalone approach which can be applied in conjunction with approaches such as adversarial training to further improve robustness. Code will be shared for reproducibility.</description>
