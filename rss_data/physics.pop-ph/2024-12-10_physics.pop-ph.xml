      <title>Epidemiology of the Living Dead: A social Force Model of a Zombie Outbreak</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.05444</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.05444v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We adapt the social force model of crowd dynamics to capture the evacuation during a zombie outbreak from an academic building. Individuals navigate the building, opening doors, and evacuate to the nearest exit. Zombies chase the uninfected individuals, and once caught there is a probability of a susceptible individual being infected or killed, or for the zombie to be killed by the person being attacked. We find that the speed of the zombies plays a crucial role in the dynamics of the evacuation, the rate of infection, and the number of casualties during the outbreak. The model leads to insights that may be relevant to other, less fictitious, emergency situations.</description>

      <title>Indigenous knowledges and kinship as a model for our future in outer space</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.06669</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.06669v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Commercial endeavours have already compromised our relationship with space. The Artemis Accords are creating a framework that will commercialize the Moon and further impact that relation. To confront that impact, a number of organizations have begun to develop new principles of sustainability in space, many of which are borne out of the capitalist and colonial frameworks that have harmed water, nature, peoples and more on Earth. Indigenous methodologies and ways of knowing offer different paths for living in relationship with space and the Moon. While Indigenous knowledges are not homogeneous, there are lessons we can use from some of common methods. In this talk we will review some Indigenous methodologies, including the concept of kinship and discuss how kinship can inform our actions both on Earth and in space.</description>

      <title>Overview of Indigenous rights and outer space for the IAU-CPS Policy Hub</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.06675</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.06675v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: As part of the mission of the International Astronomical Union Centre for the Protection of the Dark and Quiet Sky from Satellite Constellation Interference (IAU-CPS) Policy Hub to consider national and international regulations about the usage and sustainability in outer space, we also included discussion specific to the rights of Indigenous peoples with respect to outer space under the context of the United Nations Declaration for the Rights of Indigenous Peoples (UNDRIP). In this work, we review how some of the articles of UNDRIP require various actors in the use and exploitation of outer space including satellite companies, nation states, and professional/academic astronomy to consult and support Indigenous peoples/nations and respect Indigenous sovereignties. This work is concluded with recommendations for consulting and collaborating with Indigenous peoples and recommendations for moving from the traditional colonial exploitation of outer space and building an anti-colonial future in relationship with outer space.</description>

      <title>Hallmarks of Deception in Asset-Exchange Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.06761</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.06761v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the transient and steady-state dynamics of the Bennati-Dregulescu-Yakovenko money game in the presence of probabilistic cheaters, who can misrepresent their financial status by claiming to have no money. We derive the steady-state wealth distribution per player analytically and show how the presence of hidden cheaters can be inferred from the relative variance of wealth per player. In scenarios with a finite number of cheaters amidst an infinite pool of honest players, we identify a critical probability of cheating at which the total wealth owned by the cheaters experiences a second-order discontinuity. Below this point, the probability to lose money is larger than the probability to gain; conversely, above this point, the direction is reversed. Additionally, we establish a threshold probability at which cheaters collectively possess more than half of the total wealth in the game. Lastly, we provide bounds on the rate at which both cheaters and honest players can gain or lose wealth, contributing to a deeper understanding of deception in asset exchange models.</description>
