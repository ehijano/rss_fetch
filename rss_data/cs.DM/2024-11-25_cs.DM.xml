      <title>The connected Grundy coloring problem: Formulations and a local-search enhanced biased random-key genetic algorithm</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.14533</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.14533v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Given a graph G=(V,E), a connected Grundy coloring is a proper vertex coloring that can be obtained by a first-fit heuristic on a connected vertex sequence. A first-fit coloring heuristic is one that attributes to each vertex in a sequence the lowest-index color not used for its preceding neighbors. A connected vertex sequence is one in which each element, except for the first one, is connected to at least one element preceding it. The connected Grundy coloring problem consists of obtaining a connected Grundy coloring maximizing the number of colors. In this paper, we propose two integer programming (IP) formulations and a local-search enhanced biased random-key genetic algorithm (BRKGA) for the connected Grundy coloring problem. The first formulation follows the standard way of partitioning the vertices into color classes while the second one relies on the idea of representatives in an attempt to break symmetries. The BRKGA encompasses a local search procedure using a newly proposed neighborhood. A theoretical neighborhood analysis is also presented. Extensive computational experiments indicate that the problem is computationally demanding for the proposed IP formulations. Nonetheless, the formulation by representatives outperforms the standard one for the considered benchmark instances. Additionally, our BRKGA can find high-quality solutions in low computational times for considerably large instances, showing improved performance when enhanced with local search and a reset mechanism. Moreover we show that our BRKGA can be easily extended to successfully tackle the Grundy coloring problem, i.e., the one without the connectivity requirements.</description>

      <title>Reducibility among NP-Hard graph problems and boundary classes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.14553</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.14553v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Many NP-hard graph problems become easy for some classes of graphs, such as coloring is easy for bipartite graphs, but NP-hard in general. So we can ask question like when does a hard problem become easy? What is the minimum substructure for which the problem remains hard? We use the notion of boundary classes to study such questions. In this paper, we introduce a method for transforming the boundary class of one NP-hard graph problem into a boundary class for another problem. If $\Pi$ and $\Gamma$ are two NP-hard graph problems where $\Pi$ is reducible to $\Gamma$, we transform a boundary class of $\Pi$ into a boundary class of $\Gamma$. More formally if $\Pi$ is reducible to $\Gamma$, where the reduction is bijective and it maps hereditary classes of graphs to hereditary classes of graphs, then $X$ is a boundary class of $\Pi$ if and only if the image of $X$ under the reduction is a boundary class of $\Gamma$. This gives us a relationship between boundary classes and reducibility among several NP-hard problems. To show the strength of our main result, we apply our theorem to obtain some previously unknown boundary classes for a few graph problems namely; vertex-cover, clique, traveling-salesperson, bounded-degree-spanning-tree, subgraph-isomorphism and clique-cover.</description>

      <title>Construction of Toroidal Polyhedra corresponding to perfect Chains of wild Tetrahedra</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.14924</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.14924v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In 1957, Steinhaus proved that a chain of regular tetrahedra, meeting face-to-face and forming a closed loop does not exist. Over the years, various modifications of this statement have been considered and analysed. Weakening the statement by only requiring the tetrahedra of a chain to be wild, i.e. having all faces congruent, results in various examples of such chains. In this paper, we elaborate on the construction of these chains of wild tetrahedra. We therefore introduce the notions of chains and clusters of wild tetrahedra and relate these structures to simplicial surfaces. We establish that clusters and chains of wild tetrahedra can be described by polyhedra in Euclidean 3-space. As a result, we present methods to construct toroidal polyhedra arising from chains and provide a census of such toroidal polyhedra consisting of up to 20 wild tetrahedra. Here, we classify toroidal polyhedra with respect to self-intersections and reflection symmetries. We further prove the existence of an infinite family of toroidal polyhedra emerging from chains of wild tetrahedra and present clusters of wild tetrahedra that yield polyhedra of higher genera.</description>

      <title>Retrieving Top-k Hyperedge Triplets: Models and Applications</title>

      <description>arXiv:2311.07783v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Complex systems frequently exhibit multi-way, rather than pairwise, interactions. These group interactions cannot be faithfully modeled as collections of pairwise interactions using graphs and instead require hypergraphs. However, methods that analyze hypergraphs directly, rather than via lossy graph reductions, remain limited. Hypergraph motifs hold promise in this regard, as motif patterns serve as building blocks for larger group interactions which are inexpressible by graphs. Recent work has focused on categorizing and counting hypergraph motifs based on the existence of nodes in hyperedge intersection regions. Here, we argue that the relative sizes of hyperedge intersections within motifs contain varied and valuable information. We propose a suite of efficient algorithms for finding top-k triplets of hyperedges based on optimizing the sizes of these intersection patterns. This formulation uncovers interesting local patterns of interaction, finding hyperedge triplets that either (1) are the least similar with each other, (2) have the highest pairwise but not groupwise correlation, or (3) are the most similar with each other. We formalize this as a combinatorial optimization problem and design efficient algorithms based on filtering hyperedges. Our comprehensive experimental evaluation shows that the resulting hyperedge triplets yield insightful information on real-world hypergraphs. Our approach is also orders of magnitude faster than a naive baseline implementation.</description>

      <title>The Chromatic Number of Kneser Hypergraphs via Consensus Division</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.09016</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.09016v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We show that the Consensus Division theorem implies lower bounds on the chromatic number of Kneser hypergraphs, offering a novel proof for a result of Alon, Frankl, and Lov\'{a}sz (Trans. Amer. Math. Soc., 1986) and for its generalization by K\v{r}\'{\i}\v{z} (Trans. Amer. Math. Soc., 1992). Our approach is applied to study the computational complexity of the total search problem Kneser$^p$, which given a succinct representation of a coloring of a $p$-uniform Kneser hypergraph with fewer colors than its chromatic number, asks to find a monochromatic hyperedge. We prove that for every prime $p$, the Kneser$^p$ problem with an extended access to the input coloring is efficiently reducible to a quite weak approximation of the Consensus Division problem with $p$ shares. In particular, for $p=2$, the problem is efficiently reducible to any non-trivial approximation of the Consensus Halving problem on normalized monotone functions. We further show that for every prime $p$, the Kneser$^p$ problem lies in the complexity class $\mathsf{PPA}$-$p$. As an application, we establish limitations on the complexity of the Kneser$^p$ problem, restricted to colorings with a bounded number of colors.</description>

      <title>Introducing q-deformed binomial coefficients of words</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.05838</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.05838v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Gaussian binomial coefficients are q-analogues of the binomial coefficients of integers. On the other hand, binomial coefficients have been extended to finite words, i.e., elements of the finitely generated free monoids. In this paper we bring together these two notions by introducing q-analogues of binomial coefficients of words. We study their basic properties, e.g., by extending classical formulas such as the q-Vandermonde and Manvel's et al. identities to our setting. As a consequence, we get information about the structure of the considered words: these q-deformations of binomial coefficients of words contain much richer information than the original coefficients. From an algebraic perspective, we introduce a q-shuffle and a family q-infiltration products for non-commutative formal power series. Finally, we apply our results to generalize a theorem of Eilenberg characterizing so-called p-group languages. We show that a language is of this type if and only if it is a Boolean combination of specific languages defined through q-binomial coefficients seen as polynomials over $\mathbb{F}_p$.</description>

      <title>Polynomial Bounds of CFLOBDDs against BDDs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.01525</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.01525v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Binary Decision Diagrams (BDDs) are widely used for the representation of Boolean functions. Context-Free-Language Ordered Decision Diagrams (CFLOBDDs) are a plug-compatible replacement for BDDs -- roughly, they are BDDs augmented with a certain form of procedure call. A natural question to ask is, ``For a given family of Boolean functions $F$, what is the relationship between the size of a BDD for $f \in F$ and the size of a CFLOBDD for $f$?'' Sistla et al. established that there are best-case families of functions, which demonstrate an inherently exponential separation between CFLOBDDs and BDDs. They showed that there are families of functions $\{ f_n \}$ for which, for all $n = 2^k$, the CFLOBDD for $f_n$ (using a particular variable order) is exponentially more succinct than any BDD for $f_n$ (i.e., using any variable order). However, they did not give a worst-case bound -- i.e., they left open the question, ``Is there a family of functions $\{ g_i \}$ for which the size of a CFLOBDD for $g_i$ must be substantially larger than a BDD for $g_i$?'' For instance, it could be that there is a family of functions for which the BDDs are exponentially more succinct than any corresponding CFLOBDDs.
  This paper studies such questions, and answers the second question posed above in the negative. In particular, we show that by using the same variable ordering in the CFLOBDD that is used in the BDD, the size of a CFLOBDD for any function $h$ cannot be far worse than the size of the BDD for $h$. The bound that relates their sizes is polynomial: If BDD $B$ for function $h$ is of size $|B|$ and uses variable ordering $\textit{Ord}$, then the size of the CFLOBDD $C$ for $h$ that also uses $\textit{Ord}$ is bounded by $O(|B|^3)$.
  The paper also shows that the bound is tight: there is a family of functions for which $|C|$ grows as $\Omega(|B|^3)$.</description>
