      <title>Beyond the surface: hydrodynamical N-body simulations of the interacting dwarf galaxies NGC 5238 and UGC 8760</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.12284</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.12284v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: From deep imaging data obtained with the Large Binocular Telescope as part of the Smallest Scale of Hierarchy Survey (SSH), we have discovered low-surface brightness tidal features around NGC 5238 and UGC 8760, two nearby and relatively isolated dwarf galaxies with stellar masses of approximately $10^8 M_\odot$ and $2\times10^7 M_\odot$, respectively. In this study, we present detailed hydrodynamical $N$-body simulations that explain the observed faint substructures as the outcome of interactions between the dwarf galaxies and smaller satellite systems. We show that the asymmetric stellar distribution of NGC 5238 and the low-luminosity substructures observed to the northeast of UGC 8760 can be well attributed to recent interactions with smaller galaxies, each with a stellar mass roughly a few $10^5 M_\odot$, 50 times less massive than their respective hosts. In the simulations, these satellites have stellar and dark-matter masses consistent with the ones predicted by $\Lambda$CDM cosmology and share properties similar to those of local dwarf galaxies with similar stellar masses. The satellite-to-main galaxy mass ratio is approximately 1:10 in both cases. This satellite population aligns closely with predictions from cosmological simulations in terms of the number and mass relative to the host galaxy mass.</description>

      <title>Massive Star Cluster Formation II. Runaway Stars as Fossils of Sub-Cluster Mergers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.12286</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.12286v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Two main mechanisms have classically been proposed for the formation of runaway stars. The binary supernova scenario (BSS) suggests that a massive star in a binary explodes as a supernova, ejecting its companion. The dynamical ejection scenario suggests that a star is ejected through a strong dynamical encounter between multiple stars. We propose a third mechanism for the formation of runaway stars: the sub-cluster ejection scenario (SCES), where an infalling sub-cluster of stars is ejected out of the cluster by a slingshot interaction with the contracting gravitational potential of the assembling cluster. We demonstrate the SCES in a star-by-star simulation of a young massive cluster forming from a $10^6\rm~M_\odot$ gas cloud using the Torch framework. This star cluster forms hierarchically through a sequence of sub-cluster mergers, determined by the initial turbulent, spherical initial conditions of the gas. We find that these mergers drive the formation of runaway stars in our model. Late-forming sub-clusters fall into the central potential, where they are ejected on a slingshot trajectory, forming groups of runaway stars that are distributed highly anisotropically. Runaways formed by the same SCES share similar ages, velocities, and ejection directions. Surveying observations, we identify several SCES candidate groups with anisotropic ejection directions. The SCES is capable of producing runaway binaries: two wide dynamical binaries in infalling sub-clusters were tightened through ejection. This allows for another velocity kick via subsequent BSS, which is a promising avenue for producing hypervelocity stars unbound to the Galaxy. The SCES occurs when sub-cluster formation is resolved. We expect non-spherical initial gas distributions to increase runaway star numbers. The observation of groups of runaway stars formed via SCES thus reveals the assembly history of their natal clusters.</description>

      <title>Close Binary Fractions in accreted and in-situ Halo Stars</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.12335</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.12335v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The study of binary stars in the Galactic halo provides crucial insights into the dynamical history and formation processes of the Milky Way. In this work, we aim to investigate the binary fraction in a sample of accreted and in-situ halo stars, focusing on short-period binaries. Utilising data from Gaia DR3, we analysed the radial velocity (RV) uncertainty $\sigma_{\mathrm{RV}}$ distribution of a sample of main-sequence stars. We used a novel Bayesian framework to model the dependence in $\sigma_{\mathrm{RV}}$ of single and binary systems allowing us to estimate binary fractions $F$ in a sample of bright ($G_{\mathrm{RVS}}$ &lt; 12) Gaia sources. We selected the samples of in-situ and accreted halo stars based on estimating the 6D phase space information and affiliating the stars to the different samples on an action-angle vs energy ($L_{\mathrm{z}}-E$) diagram. Our results indicate a higher, though not significant, binary fraction in accreted stars compared to the in-situ halo sample. We further explore binary fractions using cuts in $E$ and $L_z$ and find a higher binary fraction in both high-energy and prograde orbits that might be explained by differences in metallicity. By cross-matching our Gaia sample with APOGEE DR17 catalogue, we confirm the results of previous studies on higher binary fractions in metal-poor stars and find the fractions of accreted and in-situ halo stars consistent with this trend. Our finding provides new insights into binary stars' formation processes and dynamical evolution in the primordial Milky Way Galaxy and its accreted dwarf Galaxies.</description>

      <title>Unveiling the Complex Circumgalactic Medium: A Comparative Study of Merging and Non-Interacting Galaxy Groups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.12348</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.12348v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: While most galaxies live in group environments where they undergo an accelerated evolution, the characteristics of their circumgalactic medium (CGM) remain uncertain. We present an analysis of the CGM of two galaxy groups in different stages of interaction: (G1) a close pair of galaxies ($z=0.043$) separated by 87 kpc that do not show signs of interactions and (G2) four merging galaxies ($z=0.098$) separated by 10 kpc. We present spatially-resolved Keck/KCWI galaxy observations and HST/COS quasar spectra (G1 at 48 kpc and G2 at 100 kpc away) to quantify both the resolved galaxy and CGM properties in these two different group environments. G1 contains two typical star-forming galaxies with no evidence of strong outflows. G2 contains two star-forming, one post-starburst and one quiescent galaxy. Both groups have a range of CGM detected metal lines (HI, CII, SiII, SiIII, NV and OVI). Despite G2 being twice as far from the quasar, G2 has $\log (N(HI)/{\rm cm}^{-2})=17.33$, compared to $\log (N(HI)/{\rm cm}^{-2})=16.43$ for G1. We find that the CGM of the merging galaxies (G2) is more kinematically complex, is in a higher ionisation state, spans a wider range of metallicities and column densities, has smaller cloud sizes, and is inconsistent with the simple superposition model that seems to match well with G1. We conclude that the complexity of the CGM in merging galaxies surpasses that of not strongly interacting galaxies, suggesting that mergers play a significant role in shaping the intricate structure of the CGM.</description>

      <title>The influence of ionized gas kinematics on HII galaxies. The cases of Tol 1004-296 and Tol 0957-278</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.12361</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.12361v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Blue Compact Galaxies (BCGs), also known as \HII\ galaxies, are dwarf, star-forming objects with relatively simple dynamics, which allows for the investigation of star formation mechanisms in a cleaner manner compared to late-type objects. In this study, we have examined various characteristics of the interstellar medium, in connection with the kinematics and dynamics of ionized gas, in Tol 1004-296 and Tol 0957-278. These two objects were observed using the SOAR Integral Field Spectrometer (SIFS) attached to the Southern Observatory for Astrophysical Research (SOAR). Both galaxies were observed with two gratings: one with medium resolution for monochromatic and abundance maps, and another with high resolution for kinematics and profile analysis. Additionally, we conducted an analysis on the velocity and velocity dispersion maps using intensity-velocity dispersion (I - $\sigma$) and velocity-velocity dispersion (Vr - $\sigma$) diagrams. Neither object exhibits a rotation pattern, and only Tol 1004-296 shows a velocity gradient between the two principal knots. However, the study reveals the significant role played by velocity dispersion in the star formation process. Specifically, we identified a relationship between monochromatic intensity, metallicity, and velocity dispersion, where high emission corresponds to low metallicity and low velocity dispersion. Tol 1004-296, in particular, exhibits a distinctive linear high velocity dispersion pattern between the two main knots, suggesting that both star formation sites are pushing the gas in opposite directions.</description>

      <title>On the Origin of Fast Rotating Stars. I. Photometric calibration and results of AO-assisted BVRI+Halpha imaging of NGC330 with SAMI/SOAR</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.12429</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.12429v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: H$\alpha$ emission is a clear indicator of circumstellar activity in Be stars, historically employed to assess the classical Be star (CBe) population in young open clusters (YOCs). The YOC NGC330 in the Small Magellanic Cloud exhibits a large known fraction of {CBe} stars and was selected for a pilot study to establish a comprehensive methodology for identifying H$\alpha$ emitters in the Magellanic Clouds, encompassing the entire B-type spectral range. Using the SOAR Adaptative Module Imager (SAMI), we investigated the stellar population of NGC330 using multi-band BVRI+H$\alpha$ imaging. We identified H$\alpha$ emitters within the entire V-band range covered by SAMI/SOAR observations ($V\lesssim22$), comprising the complete B-type stellar population and offering a unique opportunity to explore the Be phenomenon across all spectral sub-classes. The stellar radial distribution shows a clear bimodal pattern between the most massive (B5 or earlier) and the lower-mass main-sequence objects (later than B6) within the cluster. The former is concentrated towards the cluster center (showing a dispersion of $\sigma=4.26\pm0.20$ pc), whereas the latter extends across larger radii ($\sigma=10.83\pm0.65$ pc), indicating mass stratification within NGC330. The total fraction of emitters is $4.4\pm0.5\%$, notably smaller than previous estimates from flux- or seeing-limited observations. However, a higher fraction of H$\alpha$ emitters is observed among higher-mass stars ($32.8\pm3.4\%$) than within lower-mass ($4.4\pm0.9\%$). Consequently, the putative CBe population exhibits distinct dynamical characteristics compared to the bulk of the stellar population in NGC330. These findings highlight the significance of the current observations in providing a complete picture of the CBe population in NGC330.</description>

      <title>The origin of large emission line widths in massive galaxies at redshifts $z\sim 3-4$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.12501</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.12501v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a sample of 22 massive galaxies with stellar masses $&gt;10^{10} M_{\odot}$ at $3&lt;z&lt;4$ with deep H and K-band high resolution spectra (R=3500-3000) from Keck/MOSFIRE and VLT/KMOS near-infrared spectrographs. We find a large fraction have strong [OIII]5007 and H$\beta$ emission lines with large line widths ($\sigma$ 100 -- 450 km/s). We measure the sizes of our galaxies from Hubble Space Telescope images and consider the potential kinematic scaling relations of our sample; and rule out an explanation for these broad lines in terms of galaxy-wide kinematics. Based on consideration of the [OIII]5007 $/$ H$\beta$ flux ratios, their location in the Mass--Excitation diagram, and the derived bolometric luminosities, we conclude that Active Galactic Nuclei (AGN) and their Narrow Line Regions most likely give rise to this emission. At redshifts $3&lt;z&lt;4$, we find significantly high AGN fractions in massive galaxies, ranging from 60--70\% for the mass range $10&lt;\log(M_{\star}/M_{\odot})&lt;11$, with a lower limit 30\% for all galaxies within that redshift range when we apply our most stringent AGN criteria. We also find a considerably lower AGN fraction in massive quiescent galaxies, ranging from 20-30\%. These fractions of AGN point to the period between $3&lt;z&lt;4$ being a time of heightened activity for the development of supermassive black holes in the massive end of the galaxy population and provide evidence for their role in the emergence of the first massive quenched galaxies at this epoch.</description>

      <title>Chemical evolution of the Galactic bulge with different stellar populations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.12585</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.12585v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The metallicity distribution function (MDF) of the Galactic bulge features a multi-peak shape, with a metal-poor peak at [Fe/H]=-0.3 dex and a metal-rich peak at [Fe/H]=+0.3 dex. This bimodality is also seen in [alpha/Fe] versus [Fe/H] ratios, indicating different stellar populations in the bulge. We aim to replicate the observed MDF by proposing a scenario where the metal-poor bulge stars formed in situ during an intense star formation burst, while the metal-rich stars formed during a second burst and/or were accreted from the inner Galactic disk due to a growing bar. We used a chemical evolution model that tracks various chemical species with detailed nucleosynthesis, focusing on Fe production from both Type Ia supernovae and massive stars, including rotating massive stars with varying velocities. Our model also accounts for gas infall, outflow, and the effect of stellar migration. Results are compared to 13,000 stars from the SDSS/APOGEE survey within 3.5 kpc of the Galactic center. Our model successfully reproduces the double-peak shape of the bulge MDF and the alpha-element abundance trends relative to Fe by assuming (i) a multi-burst star formation history with a 250 Myr quenching of the first burst and (ii) stellar migration from the inner disk due to a growing bar. We estimate that about 40% of the bulge-bar's stellar mass originates from the inner disk. Nucleosynthesis models that assume either no rotation for massive stars or a rotational velocity distribution favoring slow rotation at high metallicities best match the observed MDF and [alpha/Fe] and [Ce/Fe] versus [Fe/H] abundance patterns.</description>

      <title>Cosmic very small dust grains as a natural laboratory of mesoscopic physics: Modeling thermal and optical properties of graphite grains</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.12632</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.12632v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Cosmic very small dust grains (VSGs) contain 100 to 10,000 atoms, making it a mesoscopic system with specific thermal and optical characteristics due to the finite number of atoms within each grain. This paper focuses on graphite VSGs which contain free electrons. The energy level statistics devised by Kubo (1962, J.Phys.Soc.Jpn., 17, 975-986) were used for the first time to understand the thermal properties of free electrons in graphite VSGs. We showed that the shape irregularity of the grains allows graphite VSGs to absorb or emit photons at sub-millimeter wavelengths or longer; otherwise, the frequency is limited to above a few THz. Additionally, we considered the decrease in Debye temperature due to the surface effect. VSGs have an extremely small volume, resulting in limited thermal energy storage, especially at low temperatures. Since a VSG is able to emit a photon with energy smaller than its internal energy, this determines the maximum frequency of the emitted photon. We developed a Monte-Carlo simulation code to track the thermal history of a dust grain, considering the stochastic heating from the absorption of ambient photons and radiative cooling. This approach was applied to the interstellar environment to compute the spectral energy distributions from the interstellar graphite dust grains. The results showed that graphite VSGs emit not only the mid-infrared excess emission, but also a surplus emission from sub-millimeter to millimeter wavelengths.</description>

      <title>Multiple chemical tracers finally unveil the intricate NGC\,1333 IRAS\,4A outflow system. FAUST XVI</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.12735</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.12735v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The exploration of outflows in protobinary systems presents a challenging yet crucial endeavour, offering valuable insights into the dynamic interplay between protostars and their evolution. In this study, we examine the morphology and dynamics of jets and outflows within the IRAS\,4A protobinary system. This analysis is based on ALMA observations of SiO(5--4), H$_2$CO(3$_{0,3}$--2$_{0,3}$), and HDCO(4$_{1,4}$--3$_{1,3}$) with a spatial resolution of $\sim$150\,au. Leveraging an astrochemical approach involving the use of diverse tracers beyond traditional ones has enabled the identification of novel features and a comprehensive understanding of the broader outflow dynamics. Our analysis reveals the presence of two jets in the redshifted emission, emanating from IRAS\,4A1 and IRAS\,4A2, respectively. Furthermore, we identify four distinct outflows in the region for the first time, with each protostar, 4A1 and 4A2, contributing to two of them. We characterise the morphology and orientation of each outflow, challenging previous suggestions of bends in their trajectories. The outflow cavities of IRAS\,4A1 exhibit extensions of 10$''$ and 13$''$ with position angles (PA) of 0$^{\circ}$ and -12$^{\circ}$, respectively, while those of IRAS\,4A2 are more extended, spanning 18$''$ and 25$''$ with PAs of 29$^{\circ}$ and 26$^{\circ}$. We propose that the misalignment of the cavities is due to a jet precession in each protostar, a notion supported by the observation that the more extended cavities of the same source exhibit lower velocities, indicating they may stem from older ejection events.</description>

      <title>Expanded Sample of Small Magellanic Cloud Ultraviolet Dust Extinction Curves: Correlations between the 2175 A bump, q_pah, UV extinction shape, and N(HI)/A(V)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.12792</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.12792v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Small Magellanic Cloud (SMC) shows a large variation in ultraviolet (UV) dust extinction curves, ranging from Milky Way-like (MW) to significantly steeper curves with no detectable 2175 A bump. This result is based on a sample of only nine sightlines. From HST/STIS and IUE spectra of OB stars, we have measured UV extinction curves along 32 SMC sightlines where eight of these curves were published previously. We find 16 sightlines with steep extinction with no detectable 2175 A bump, four sightlines with MW-like extinction with a detectable 2175 A bump, two sightlines with fairly flat UV extinction and weak/absent 2175 A bumps, and 10 sightlines with unreliable curves due to low SMC dust columns. Our expanded sample shows that the sightlines with and without the 2175 A bump are located throughout the SMC and not limited to specific regions. The average extinction curve of the 16 bumpless sightlines is very similar to the previous average based on four sightlines. We find no correlation between dust column and the strength of the 2175 A bump. We test the hypothesis that the 2175 A bump is due to the same dust grains that are responsible for the mid-infrared carbonaceous (PAH) emission features and find they are correlated, confirming recent work in the MW. Overall, the slope of the UV extinction increases as the amplitudes of the 2175 A bump and far-UV curvature decrease. Finally, the UV slope is correlated with $N(HI)/A(V)$ and the 2175 A bump and nonlinear far-UV rise amplitudes are anti-correlated with $N(HI)/A(V)$.</description>

Abstract: Broad H$\alpha$ and H$\beta$ emission lines (FWHM &gt; 1,000 km s$^{-1}$) are incredibly efficient tracers of the high-velocity clouds encircling Active Galactic Nuclei (AGN). As a result, we search for these broad line AGN in the Sloan Digital Sky Survey's Mapping Nearby Galaxies at Apache Point Observatory (MaNGA) catalog. We identify 301 broad-line H$\alpha$ galaxies and 801 broad-line H$\beta$ galaxies in the catalog. In total, we detect 1,042 unique broad-line galaxies with luminosities between 10$^{37}$ - 10$^{43}$ erg s$^{-1}$ and inferred supermassive black hole masses between 10$^{5}$ - 10$^{10}$ $M_{\odot}$; 60 feature both broad H$\alpha$ and broad H$\beta$ emission. We also determine that the broad line region radius ranges between 0.01 - 46 light days, with a median radius of 0.1 light days (0.02 pc) for our broad H$\beta$ sample. In addition, we find that both samples feature a higher fraction of galaxy mergers (44% for the broad H$\alpha$ sample and 43% for the broad H$\beta$ sample), compared to the full MaNGA galaxy sample (26%), which suggests that merger-driven fueling is strongly active in our sample.</description>

      <title>Deep HST/UVIS imaging of the candidate dark galaxy CDG-1</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.12907</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.12907v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: CDG-1 is a tight grouping of four likely globular clusters in the Perseus cluster, and a candidate dark galaxy with little or no diffuse light. Here we provide new constraints on the luminosity of any underlying stellar emission, using HST/UVIS F200LP imaging. No diffuse emission is detected, with a 2$\sigma$ upper limit of F200LP&gt;28.1 mag/arcsec$^2$ on the 5'' scale of CDG-1. This surface brightness limit corresponds to a 2$\sigma$ lower limit of &gt;0.5 for the fraction of the total luminosity that is in the form of globular clusters. The most likely alternative, although improbable, is that CDG-1 is a chance grouping of four globular clusters in the halo of the Perseus galaxy IC312.</description>

      <title>GA-NIFS: Witnessing the complex assembly of a massive star-forming system at $z=5.7$</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.12955v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present observations of the $z\sim5.7$ Lyman-break galaxy HZ10 with the JWST/NIRSpec IFU in high and low spectral resolution (G395H, $R\sim2700$ and PRISM, $R\sim100$, respectively), as part of the GA-NIFS program. By spatially resolving the source, we find evidence for three spatially and spectrally distinct regions of line emission along with one region of strong continuum emission, all within a projected distance of $&lt;10$kpc. The R2700 data features strong detections in H$\beta$, [OIII]$\lambda\lambda4959{,}5007$, [NII]$\lambda\lambda6548{,}6584$, H$\alpha$, and [SII]$\lambda\lambda6716{,}6731$. The R100 data additionally contains a strong detection of the Ly$\alpha$ break, rest-UV continuum, and [OII]$\lambda\lambda3726{,}3729$. None of the detected lines present strong evidence for AGN excitation from line diagnostic diagrams, and no high-ionisation lines are detected. Using the detected lines, we constrain the electron density $\left( \rm \log_{10}\left( n_e / cm^{-3}\right)\sim2.5-3.3\right)$ and metallicity ($\sim0.5-0.7$ solar) in each component. Spaxel-by-spaxel fits of each cube reveal a strong east-west velocity gradient and significant line asymmetries (indicating tidal features or outflows). The western component features a very red UV slope ($\beta_{UV}\sim-1$) and significant H$\alpha$ emission, suggesting an evolved population and active star formation. From a comparison to high resolution [CII]$158\mu$m imaging obtained with the Atacama Large Millimetre/submillimetre Array (ALMA), we find that the continuum emitter is associated with a gas-poor stellar population. Altogether, these data suggest that HZ10 represents an ongoing merger, with a complex distribution of stars, gas, and dust $&lt;1$Gyr after the Big Bang.</description>

      <title>Systematic comparison of neural networks used in discovering strong gravitational lenses</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.12975v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Efficient algorithms are being developed to search for strong gravitational lens systems owing to increasing large imaging surveys. Neural networks have been successfully used to discover galaxy-scale lens systems in imaging surveys such as the Kilo Degree Survey, Hyper-Suprime Cam (HSC) Survey and Dark Energy Survey over the last few years. Thus, it has become imperative to understand how some of these networks compare, their strengths and the role of the training datasets as most of the networks make use of supervised learning algorithms. In this work, we present the first-of-its-kind systematic comparison and benchmarking of networks from four teams that have analysed the HSC Survey data. Each team has designed their training samples and developed neural networks independently but coordinated apriori in reserving specific datasets strictly for test purposes. The test sample consists of mock lenses, real (candidate) lenses and real non-lenses gathered from various sources to benchmark and characterise the performance of each of the network. While each team's network performed much better on their own constructed test samples compared to those from others, all networks performed comparable on the test sample with real (candidate) lenses and non-lenses. We also investigate the impact of swapping the training samples amongst the teams while retaining the same network architecture. We find that this resulted in improved performance for some networks. These results have direct implications on measures to be taken for lens searches with upcoming imaging surveys such as the Rubin-Legacy Survey of Space and Time, Roman and Euclid.</description>

      <title>A Model for Eruptive Mass Loss in Massive Stars</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.12274</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.12274v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Eruptive mass loss in massive stars is known to occur, but the mechanism(s) are not yet well-understood. One proposed physical explanation appeals to opacity-driven super-Eddington luminosities in stellar envelopes. Here, we present a 1D model for eruptive mass loss and implement this model in the MESA stellar evolution code. The model identifies regions in the star where the energy associated with a locally super-Eddington luminosity exceeds the binding energy of the overlaying envelope. The material above such regions is ejected from the star. Stars with masses $10-100~M_\odot$ at solar and SMC metallicities are evolved through core helium burning, with and without this new eruptive mass-loss scheme. We find that eruptive mass loss of up to $\sim10^{-2}~M_\odot \mathrm{yr}^{-1}$ can be driven by this mechanism, and occurs in a vertical band on the HR diagram between $3.5 \lesssim \log(T_\mathrm{eff}/\mathrm{K}) \lesssim 4.0$. This predicted eruptive mass loss prevents stars of initial masses $\gtrsim20~M_\odot$ from evolving to become red supergiants, with the stars instead ending their lives as blue supergiants, and therefore offers a possible explanation for the observed lack of red supergiants in that mass regime.</description>

      <title>Damping Wing-Like Features in the Stacked Ly$\alpha$ Forest: Potential Neutral Hydrogen Islands at $z&lt;6$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.12275</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.12275v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recent quasar absorption line observations suggest that reionization may end as late as $z \approx 5.3$. As a means to search for large neutral hydrogen islands at $z&lt;6$, we revisit long dark gaps in the Ly$\beta$ forest in VLT/X-Shooter and Keck/ESI quasar spectra. We stack the Ly$\alpha$ forest corresponding to the edges of these Ly$\beta$ dark gaps and identify a damping wing-like extended absorption profile. The average redshift of the stacked forest is $z=5.8$. By comparing these observations with reionization simulations, we infer that such a damping wing-like feature can be naturally explained if these gaps are at least partially created by neutral islands. Conversely, simulated dark gaps lacking neutral hydrogen struggle to replicate the observed damping wing features. Furthermore, this damping wing-like profile implies that the volume-averaged neutral hydrogen fraction must be $\langle x_{\rm HI} \rangle \geq 6.1 \pm 3.9\%$ at $z = 5.8$. Our results offer robust evidence that reionization extends below $z=6$.</description>

      <title>Verification of astrometrically accelerating stars from Hipparcos and Gaia: I. Methodology and application to HIP 44842</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.12315</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.12315v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A large number of candidate binary stars with apparent acceleration on the sky has emerged from analysis of astrometric data collected by the Hipparcos, Tycho-2, and Gaia space missions. Although the apparent acceleration can serve as a relatively reliable indicator of binarity, it provides scarce information about the orbital and physical parameters of the components. With an emphasis on the search for stellar-mass black holes and neutron stars hidden in binary systems, we start a broader effort to characterize the most promising candidates using follow-up ground-based observations. Accurate quantification of orbital and physical parameters of systems with dim or invisible companions requires combination of Hipparcos, Gaia, and precision spectroscopic measurements. In this paper, we review the necessary steps in this implementation and describe the improved Hipparcos-Gaia sample of long-term astrometric accelerations which includes correction of sky-correlated systematic errors using the vector spherical decomposition method. As an example, we study one Hipparcos star with a large acceleration, HIP 44842, where the companion is revealed to be a normal main sequence star.</description>

      <title>iSHELL $K$-band Survey of Class I and Flat Spectrum Sources: Magnetic field measurements in the protostellar phase</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.12451</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.12451v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We perform the first magnetic field strength survey of Class I and Flat Spectrum (FS) sources using $K$-band observations with iSHELL. We obtained new observations of 42 Class I and FS sources and additionally included 10 sources from the archive. We detect photospheric lines in 44 of the sources, in addition to Br$\gamma$, H$_2$, and CO emission in several objects. We model the photospheric absorption lines of 32 Class I and FS sources and measure their magnetic field strengths, $K$-band temperatures, gravities, projected rotational velocities, and infrared veiling values. We put the physical properties of Class I and FS sources in context by comparing them to the values derived for a sample of Class II sources. We find that a) the average magnetic field strength of Class I and FS sources $\langle B \rangle=2.0\pm0.15$ kG is consistent with the average magnetic field strength of Class II sources $\langle B \rangle=1.8\pm0.15$ kG, and b) the average gravity of Class I and FS objects $\log{g}=3.43\pm0.07$ is lower than the average gravity of Class II sources $\log{g}=3.75\pm0.04$, although there is significant overlap between both gravity distributions. Furthermore, using stellar evolutionary models, we deduce that Class I and FS sources have a median age of $\sim$0.6 Myr, and are, as a group, younger than the Class II stars with a median age of $\sim$3 Myr. Our results confirm that Class I and FS sources host strong magnetic fields on their photospheres. Thus, it is likely that these sources accrete disk material through a magnetosphere similar to the more evolved T Tauri stars.</description>

      <title>WST - Widefield Spectroscopic Telescope: Motivation, science drivers and top-level requirements for a new dedicated facility</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.12518</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.12518v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we describe the wide-field spectroscopic survey telescope (WST) project. WST is a 12-metre wide-field spectroscopic survey telescope with simultaneous operation of a large field-of-view (3 sq. degree), high-multiplex (20,000) multi-object spectrograph (MOS), with both a low and high-resolution modes, and a giant 3x3 arcmin2 integral field spectrograph (IFS). In scientific capability, these specifications place WST far ahead of existing and planned facilities. In only 5 years of operation, the MOS would target 250 million galaxies and 25 million stars at low spectral resolution, plus 2 million stars at high resolution. Without need for pre-imaged targets, the IFS would deliver 4 billion spectra offering many serendipitous discoveries. Given the current investment in deep imaging surveys and noting the diagnostic power of spectroscopy, WST will fill a crucial gap in astronomical capability and work in synergy with future ground and space-based facilities. We show how it can address outstanding scientific questions in the areas of cosmology; galaxy assembly, evolution, and enrichment, including our own Milky Way; the origin of stars and planets; and time domain and multi-messenger astrophysics. WST's uniquely rich dataset may yield unforeseen discoveries in many of these areas. The telescope and instruments are designed as an integrated system and will mostly use existing technology, with the aim to minimise the carbon footprint and environmental impact. We will propose WST as the next European Southern Observatory (ESO) project after completion of the 39-metre ELT.</description>

      <title>Constraints on the (re-)orientation of star-disk systems through infall</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.12670</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.12670v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: It has been consensus that star-disk systems accrete most of their mass and angular momentum during the collapse of a prestellar core, such that the rotational direction of a system is equivalent to the net rotation of the core. Recent results, however, indicate that stars experience post-collapse or late infall, during which the star and its disk is refreshed with material from the protostellar environment through accretion streamers. Apart from adding mass to the star-disk system, infall potentially supplies a substantial amount of angular momentum as the infalling material is initially not bound to the collapsing prestellar core. We investigate the orientation of infall on star-disk systems by analyzing the properties of accreting tracer particles in 3D magnetohydrodynamical simulations of a molecular cloud that is (4 pc)$^3$ in volume. In contrast to the traditional picture, where the rotational axis is inherited from the collapse of a coherent pre-stellar core, the orientation of star-disk systems can change substantially during the accretion process. In agreement with previous results that show larger contributions of late infall for increasing stellar masses, infall is more likely to lead to a prolonged change in orientation for stars of higher final mass. On average, brown dwarfs and very low mass stars are more likely to form and accrete all of their mass as part of a multiple system, while stars with final masses above a few 0.1 M$_{\odot}$ are more likely to accrete part of their mass as single stars. Finally, we find an overall trend: the post-collapse accretion phase is more anisotropic than the early collapse phase. This result is consistent with a scenario, where mass accretion from infall occurs via infalling streamers along a preferred direction, while the initial collapse is less anisotropic albeit the fact that material is funneled through accretion channels.</description>

      <title>No signature of the birth environment of exoplanets from their host stars' Mahalanobis phase space</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.12741</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.12741v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The architectures of extrasolar planetary systems often deviate considerably from the ``standard" model for planet formation, which is largely based on our own Solar System. In particular, gas giants on close orbits are not predicted by planet formation theory and so some process(es) are thought to move the planets closer to their host stars. Recent research has suggested that Hot Jupiter host stars display a different phase space compared to stars that do not host Hot Jupiters. This has been attributed to these stars forming in star-forming regions of high stellar density, where dynamical interactions with passing stars have perturbed the planets. We test this hypothesis by quantifying the phase space of planet-hosting stars in dynamical N-body simulations of star-forming regions. We find that stars that retain their planets have a higher phase space than non-hosts, regardless of their initial physical density. This is because an imprint of the kinematic substructure from the regions birth is retained, as these stars have experienced fewer and less disruptive encounters than stars whose planets have been liberated and become free-floating. However, host stars whose planets remain bound but have had their orbits significantly altered by dynamical encounters are also primarily found in high phase space regimes. We therefore corroborate other research in this area which has suggested the high phase space of Hot Jupiter host stars is not caused by dynamical encounters or stellar clustering, but rather reflects an age bias in that these stars are (kinematically) younger than other exoplanet host stars.</description>

      <title>Schwarzschild Modeling of Barred S0 Galaxy NGC 4371</title>

      <description>arXiv:2310.00497v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We apply the barred Schwarzschild method developed by Tahmasebzadeh et al. (2022) to a barred S0 galaxy, NGC 4371, observed by IFU instruments from the TIMER and ATLAS3D projects. We construct the gravitational potential by combining a fixed black hole mass, a spherical dark matter halo, and stellar mass distribution deprojected from $3.6$ $\mu$m S$^4$G image considering an axisymmetric disk and a triaxial bar. We independently modeled kinematic data from TIMER and ATLAS3D. Both models fit the data remarkably well. We find a consistent bar pattern speed from the two sets of models, with $\Omega_{\rm p} = 23.6 \pm 2.8 \hspace{.08cm} \mathrm{km \hspace{.04cm} s^{-1} \hspace{.04cm} kpc^{-1} }$. The dimensionless bar rotation parameter is determined to be $ R_{\rm cor}/R_{\rm bar}=1.9 \pm 0.3$, indicating a slow bar in NGC 4371. Additionally, our model predicts a high amount of dark matter within the bar region ($M_{\rm DM}/ M_{\rm total}$ $\sim 0.51 \pm 0.06$), which, aligned with the predictions of cosmological simulations, indicates that fast bars are generally found in baryon-dominated disks. Based on the best-fitting model, we further decompose the galaxy into multiple 3D orbital structures, including a BP/X bar, a classical bulge, a nuclear disk, and a main disk. The BP/X bar is not perfectly included in the input 3D density model, but BP/X-supporting orbits are picked through the fitting to the kinematic data. This is the first time a real barred galaxy has been modeled utilizing the Schwarzschild method including a 3D bar.</description>

      <title>VLBI Detection of an Active Radio Source Potentially Driving 100-kpc Scale Emission in the Ultraluminous Infrared Galaxy IRAS F01004$-$2237</title>

Abstract: The nearby ultraluminous infrared galaxy (ULIRG) IRAS F01004$-$2237 exhibits 100-kpc scale continuum emission at radio wavelengths. The absence of extended X-ray emission in IRAS F01004$-$2237 has suggested an active galactic nucleus (AGN) origin for the extended radio emission, whose properties and role in merging systems still need to be better understood. We present the results of multi-frequency observations of IRAS F01004$-$2237 conducted by the Very Long Baseline Array at 2.3 and 8.4 GHz. Compact 8.4-GHz continuum emission was detected on a 1-pc scale in the nuclear region with an intrinsic brightness temperature of $10^{8.1}$ K suggesting that the radio source is originated from an AGN, potentially driving the extended emission. In contrast, no significant emission was observed at 2.3 GHz, indicating the presence of low-frequency absorption. This absorption cannot be attributed solely to synchrotron self-absorption; alternatively, free-free absorption due to thermal plasma is mainly at work in the spectrum. From combined perspectives, including mid-infrared and X-ray data, the AGN is obscured in a dense environment. The kinetic power of the nonthermal jet, as inferred from the extended emission, can play a more important role in dispersing the surrounding medium than the thermal outflow in IRAS F01004$-$2237. These findings hint that jet activities in ULIRGs may contribute to AGN feedback during galaxy evolution induced by merger events.</description>

      <title>Galactic Structure From Binary Pulsar Accelerations: Beyond Smooth Models</title>

Abstract: We measure the line-of-sight accelerations of 26 binary pulsars due to the Milky Way's gravitational potential, and produce a 3-dimensional map of the acceleration field of the Galaxy. Acceleration measurements directly give us the change in the line-of-sight velocity at present day, without requiring any assumptions inherent to kinematic modeling. We measure the Oort limit ($\rho_0=0.062\pm0.017$ \msun/pc$^3$) and the dark matter density in the midplane ($\rho_{0,\textrm{DM}}=-0.010\pm0.018$ \msun/pc$^3$); these values are similar to, but have smaller uncertainties than previous pulsar timing measurements of these quantities. Here, we provide for the first time, values for the Oort constants and the slope of the rotation curve from direct acceleration measurements. We find that $A=15.4\pm2.6$ km/s/kpc and $B=-13.1\pm2.6$ km/s/kpc (consistent with results from \textit{Gaia}), and the slope of the rotation curve near the Sun is $-2\pm5$ km/s/kpc. We show that the Galactic acceleration field is clearly asymmetric, but due to data limitations it is not yet clear which physical processes drive this asymmetry. We provide updated models of the Galactic potential that account for various sources of disequilibrium; these models are incompatible with commonly used kinematic potentials. This indicates that use of kinematically derived Galactic potentials in precision tests (e.g., in tests of general relativity with pulsar timing) may be subject to larger uncertainties than reported. The acceleration data indicates that the mass of the Galaxy within the Solar circle is $2.3 \times 10^{11}$ M$_\odot$, roughly twice as large as currently accepted models. Additionally, the residuals of the acceleration data compared to existing Galactic models have a dependence on radial position; this trend can be explained if the Sun has an additional acceleration away from the Galactic center.</description>

      <title>On the Determination of Stellar Mass and Binary Fraction of Open Clusters within 500 pc from the Sun</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.11853</link>

Abstract: We investigated the stellar mass function and the binary fraction of 114 nearby open clusters (OCs) using the high-precision photometric data from Gaia Data Release 3 (Gaia DR3). We estimated the mass of member stars by using a ridge line (RL) that is better in line with the observed color-magnitude diagram (CMD), thus obtaining more accurate stellar mass and binary mass ratio ($q$) at the low-mass region. By analyzing the present-day mass function (PDMF) of star clusters, we found that 108 OCs follow a two-stage power-law distribution, whereas 6 OCs present a single power-law PDMF. Subsequently, we fitted the high(low)-mass index of PDMF ($dN/dm \propto m^{-\alpha}$), denoted as $\alpha_{\rm h}$($\alpha_{\rm l}$), and segmentation point $m_{\rm c}$. For our cluster sample, the median values of $\alpha_{\rm h}$ and $\alpha_{\rm l}$ are 2.65 and 0.95, respectively, which are approximately consistent with the initial mass function (IMF) results provided by Kroupa (2001). We utilized the cumulative radial number distribution of stars with different masses to quantify the degree of mass segregation. We found a significant positive correlation between the state of dynamical evolution and mass segregation in OCs. We also estimated the fraction of binary stars with $q \geq 0.5$, ranging from 6% to 34% with a median of 17%. Finally, we provided a catalog of 114 nearby cluster properties, including the total mass, the binary fraction, the PDMF, and the dynamical state.</description>
