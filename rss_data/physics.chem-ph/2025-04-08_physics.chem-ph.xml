      <title>Local-density correlation functional from the force-balance equation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.03779</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.03779v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The force-balance equation of time-dependent density-functional theory presents a promising route towards obtaining approximate functionals, however, so far, no practical correlation functionals have been derived this way. In this work, starting from a correlated wavefunction proposed originally by Colle and Salvetti [Theoret. Chim. Acta 37, 329 (1975)], we derive an analytical correlation-energy functional for the ground state based on the force-balance equation. The new functional is compared to the local-density correlation of the homogeneous electron gas and we find an increased performance for atomic systems, while it performs slightly worse on solids. From this point onward, the new force-based correlation functional can be systematically improved.</description>

      <title>A greener process for poly-L-lactic acid production and chemical upcycling under mild conditions using highly active alkali-metal based catalysts</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.03811</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.03811v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Non-toxic potassium and sodium metal compounds have been prepared with a bulky aryloxide ligand MOR 1 y 2 as well, their counterparts containing a crown ether bonded to the alkali metal 3 y 4 and fully characterized. The activity of compounds 1 to 4 as catalysts for the ring-opening polymerization process of LLA have been studied, showing that they are extremely active and able to polymerize LLA within a few minutes under mild conditions, achieving PLLA with high molecular weight, similar to the commercial ones. For derivatives 3 and 4, the crown ether coordination to the alkali metal affects the nuclearity of the compounds and consequently its activity, giving a more controlled polymerization. As well the use of BnOH as co-initiator allowed a better control over the polymerization. Detailed studies of the polymerization mechanism have been performed, which confirmed an anionic mechanism in absence of a co-initiator. Furthermore, the nature of the mechanisms provokes the epimerization of the lactide and the existence of D-isomers in the PLLA. Since the percentage of d-isomer content in the polymeric chain as well as its distribution can strongly change the properties of PLLA a detailed analysis has been performed. As expected, the different isotacticity leads to a strong variation on the thermal properties. We have also compared the mechanical properties of the different synthetized PLLA, and we clearly observed that the epimerization reactions lead to an increase of the PLLA flexibility compared with commercial PLAs. Furthermore, the alkali metal compounds prepared not only polymerize, as well in the presence of an alcohol they can depolymerized PLLA within 15 min to give alkyl lactates, allowing the easy upcycling of commercial PLLAs.</description>

      <title>Approximate normalizations for approximate density functionals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.03845</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.03845v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: It seems self-evident that a density functional calculation should be normalized to the number of electrons in the system. We present multiple examples where the accuracy of the approximate energy is improved (sometimes greatly) by violating this basic principle. In one dimension, we explicitly derive the appropriate correction to the normalization. Beyond one dimension, Weyl asymptotics for energy levels yield these corrections for any cavity. We include examples with Coulomb potentials and the exchange energy of atoms to illustrate relevance to realistic calculations.</description>

      <title>Excitation Energies from the Entanglement Coupled Cluster Model for Doublets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.04459</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.04459v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present excitation energies for molecular doublets from a spin-adapted formulation of coupled cluster singles and doubles theory. The entanglement coupled cluster approach represents an unconventional take on the notorious problem of spin adaptation for open-shell species. In this approach, the high-spin open-shell molecular system is coupled to non-interacting bath orbitals to form a total closed-shell system. In entanglement coupled cluster theory, many of the attractive features of the spin-adapted closed-shell coupled cluster is retained: an unambiguous definition of the cluster operator and a terminating Baker-Campbell-Hausdorff expansion. The result is a spin-adapted coupled cluster theory for open-shell species. The model produces excitation energies of a quality comparable to the closed-shell counterpart. Additionally, some ionized states that cannot be modeled accurately with the alternative equation-of-motion approach for ionized states, can be described with the entanglement coupled cluster singles and doubles model.</description>

      <title>Pruned-ADAPT-VQE: compacting molecular ans\"atze by removing irrelevant operators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.04652</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.04652v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The adaptive derivative-assembled pseudo-Trotter variational quantum eigensolver (ADAPT-VQE) is one of the most widely used algorithms for electronic structure calculations. It adaptively selects operators based on their gradient, constructing ans\"atze that continuously evolve to match the energy landscape, helping avoid local traps and barren plateaus. However, this flexibility in reoptimization can lead to the inclusion of redundant or inefficient operators that have almost zero amplitude, barely contributing to the ansatz. We identify three phenomena responsible for the appearance of these operators: poor operator selection, operator reordering, and fading operators. In this work, we propose an automated, cost-free refinement method that removes unnecessary operators from the ansatz without disrupting convergence. Our approach evaluates each operator after ADAPT-VQE optimization by using a function that considers both its amplitude and position in the ansatz, striking a balance between eliminating low-amplitude operators while preserving the natural reduction of coefficients as the ansatz grows. Additionally, a dynamic threshold based on the amplitudes of recent operators enables efficient convergence. We apply this method to several molecular systems and find that it reduces ansatz size and accelerates convergence, particularly in cases with flat energy landscapes. The refinement process incurs no additional computational cost and consistently improves or maintains ADAPT-VQE performance.</description>

      <title>Towards ab initio Realizations of Collins' Conjecture</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.04692</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.04692v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: An ab initio approach formulated under an entropy-inspired repartitioning of the electronic Hamiltonian is presented. This ansatz produces orbital eigenvalues each shifted by entropic contributions expressed as subsets of scaled pair correlation energy terms present in second-order Moller-Plesset (MP) perturbation theory. Under the auspices of Collins' conjecture, which suggests that the electron correlation energy is approximately proportional to the Jaynes entropy of the one-electron density matrix, we introduce a parameter that controls the accuracy of the resultant one-electron density at the MP2 level. By tuning the density in a somewhat automated way, we achieve one-electron densities on par with those from full configuration interaction for single-bond dissociation. This parameter can then be used to add a Collins'-like static correlation correction to the energy functional, capturing both dynamical and nondynamical correlation effects in many-electron systems. The performance of the proposed method and its related variants approaches the accuracy of generalized valence bond theory for estimating single bond dissociation energies (BDEs) for set of small, closed-shell molecules composed of first and second row elements. Our results hold implications for reincorporating the missing (static) correlation energy in regularized perturbation theories that is typically discarded. Finally, we propose a generic parameter set (accurate to within 7% on average) that could be used for strongly-correlated systems in general.</description>

      <title>Global approximations to the error function of real argument for vectorized computation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.05068</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.05068v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The error function of real argument can be uniformly approximated to a given accuracy by a single closed-form expression for the whole variable range either in terms of addition, multiplication, division, and square root operations only, or also using the exponential function. The coefficients have been tabulated for up to 128-bit precision. Tests of a computer code implementation using the standard single- and double-precision floating-point arithmetic show good performance and vectorizability.</description>

      <title>Chirality-Driven Magnetization Emerges from Relativistic Four-Current Dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.03781</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.03781v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Chirality-induced spin selectivity (CISS) is a striking quantum phenomenon in which electron transport through chiral molecules leads to spin polarization -- even in the absence of magnetic fields or magnetic components. Although observed in systems such as DNA, helicenes, proteins, and polymers, the fundamental physical origin of CISS remains unresolved. Here, we introduce a time-dependent relativistic four-current framework, in which charge and current densities evolve according to the time-dependent variational principle. Real-time relativistic four-current simulations enable direct analysis of helical currents and induced magnetization dynamics. Applied to helicenes -- axially chiral molecules lacking stereocenters -- our simulations reveal curvature-induced helical electron currents that generate spontaneous magnetic fields aligned along the molecular axis. These fields are handedness-dependent and reach magnitudes of $10^{-1}$~Tesla per single helicene strand. Our results suggest that CISS may arise from intrinsic, relativistic curvature-induced helical currents and the associated magnetic fields within chiral molecules. This four-current mechanism offers a self-contained explanation for spin selectivity, independent of interfacial effects or strong spin-orbit coupling. Furthermore, our results lead to several testable hypotheses that can be explored in experiments.</description>

      <title>Slide and Twist: Manipulating Polarization in Multilayer Hexagonal Boron-Nitride</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.04004</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.04004v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This study explores the world of across-layer sliding ferroelectricity in multilayer hexagonal boron nitride (hBN) and gallium nitride (hGaN), aiming to control out-of-plane polarization. By investigating the effects of sliding single or dual layers in various hBN stacking configurations, we uncover methods for reversing polarization with energy barriers between 5 and 30 meV/f.u., making these methods experimentally viable. Our results show that single-interface sliding is more energetically favorable, with lower barriers compared to multiple interfaces. Certain pathways reveal stable polarization plateaus, where polarization remains constant during specific sliding phases, promising robust polarization control. Moreover, rotated multilayer structures maintain consistent net out-of-plane polarization across different rotation angles. In trilayer ABT structures, rotating the top layer and sliding the bottom layer can reverse polarization, expanding device design possibilities. While the primary focus is on hBN, similar phenomena in hGaN suggest broader applicability for this class of polar materials. The identified energy barriers support the feasibility of fabricating devices based on these multilayer structures.</description>

      <title>The Zintl-Klemm Concept in the Amorphous State: A Case Study of Na-P Battery Anodes</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.04920v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Zintl-Klemm concept has long been used to explain and predict the bonding, and thereby the structures, of crystalline solid-state materials. We apply this concept to the amorphous state, examining as an example the diverse disordered Na-P phases that can form in sodium-ion battery anodes. Using first-principles simulations combined with state-of-the-art machine-learning methods, we provide atomic-scale insight into the structural and energetic behaviour of amorphous Na-P phases. We evaluate the applicability of the Zintl-Klemm rules in the amorphous state and discuss implications for future work.</description>

      <title>Machine learning interatomic potential can infer electrical response</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.05169</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.05169v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Modeling the response of material and chemical systems to electric fields remains a longstanding challenge. Machine learning interatomic potentials (MLIPs) offer an efficient and scalable alternative to quantum mechanical methods but do not by themselves incorporate electrical response. Here, we show that polarization and Born effective charge (BEC) tensors can be directly extracted from long-range MLIPs within the Latent Ewald Summation (LES) framework, solely by learning from energy and force data. Using this approach, we predict the infrared spectra of bulk water under zero or finite external electric fields, ionic conductivities of high-pressure superionic ice, and the phase transition and hysteresis in ferroelectric PbTiO$_3$ perovskite. This work thus extends the capability of MLIPs to predict electrical response--without training on charges or polarization or BECs--and enables accurate modeling of electric-field-driven processes in diverse systems at scale.</description>

      <title>Discovery of the 7-ring PAH Cyanocoronene (C$_{24}$H$_{11}$CN) in GOTHAM Observations of TMC-1</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.05232</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.05232v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present the synthesis and laboratory rotational spectroscopy of the 7-ring polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon (PAH) cyanocoronene (C$_{24}$H$_{11}$CN) using a laser-ablation assisted cavity-enhanced Fourier transform microwave spectrometer. A total of 71 transitions were measured and assigned between 6.8--10.6\,GHz. Using these assignments, we searched for emission from cyanocoronene in the GBT Observations of TMC-1: Hunting Aromatic Molecules (GOTHAM) project observations of the cold dark molecular cloud TMC-1 using the 100\,m Green Bank Telescope (GBT). We detect a number of individually resolved transitions in ultrasensitive X-band observations and perform a Markov Chain Monte Carlo analysis to derive best-fit parameters, including a total column density of $N(\mathrm{C}_{24}\mathrm{H}_{11}\mathrm{CN}) = 2.69^{+0.26}_{-0.23} \times 10^{12}\,\mathrm{cm}^{-2}$ at a temperature of $6.05^{+0.38}_{-0.37}\,$K. A spectral stacking and matched filtering analysis provides a robust 17.3$\,\sigma$ significance to the overall detection. The derived column density is comparable to that of cyano-substituted naphthalene, acenaphthylene, and pyrene, defying the trend of decreasing abundance with increasing molecular size and complexity found for carbon chains. We discuss the implications of the detection for our understanding of interstellar PAH chemistry and highlight major open questions and next steps.</description>

      <title>Graph automorphism group of the dissociation microequilibrium of polyprotic acids</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.09692v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The dissociation micro-states (DMS) of an $N$-protic acid are described using set theory notation. This facilitates the mathematical description of the dissociation micro-equilibrium (DME). In particular, the DME constants are easily obtained in terms of the dissociation equilibrium constants and the molar fractions of the DMSs. Representing of the DMEs in terms of graph theory allows to identify permutations between DMSs that preserve the vertex-edge connectivity of the graph. These permutations, along with their composition, allow us to identify the direct product of the cyclic group $C_2$, and the symmetric group $S_N$, $C_2\times S_N$, as the graph automorphism group of the micro-dissociation of $N$-protic acids.</description>

      <title>Anomalous propagators and the particle-particle channel: Bethe-Salpeter equation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.13167v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The Bethe-Salpeter equation has been extensively employed to compute the two-body electron-hole propagator and its poles which correspond to the neutral excitation energies of the system. Through a different time-ordering, the two-body Green's function can also describe the propagation of two electrons or two holes. The corresponding poles are the double ionization potentials and double electron affinities of the system. In this work, a Bethe-Salpeter equation for the two-body particle-particle propagator is derived within the linear-response formalism using a pairing field and anomalous propagators. This framework allows us to compute kernels corresponding to different self-energy approximations ($GW$, $T$-matrix, and second-Born) as in the usual electron-hole case. The performance of these various kernels is gauged for singlet and triplet valence double ionization potentials using a set of 23 small molecules. The description of double core hole states is also analyzed.</description>

      <title>Excited-State-Specific Kohn-Sham Formalism for the Asymmetric Hubbard Dimer</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.14945</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.14945v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Building on our recent study [https://doi.org/10.1021/acs.jpclett.3c02052, J. Phys. Chem. Lett. 14, 8780 (2023)], we explore the generalization of the ground-state Kohn-Sham (KS) formalism of density-functional theory (DFT) to the (singlet) excited states of the asymmetric Hubbard dimer at half-filling. While we found that the KS-DFT framework can be straightforwardly generalized to the highest-lying doubly-excited state, the treatment of the first excited state presents significant challenges. Specifically, using a density-fixed adiabatic connection, we show that the density of the first excited state lacks non-interacting $v$-representability. However, by employing an analytic continuation of the adiabatic path, we demonstrate that the density of the first excited state can be generated by a complex-valued external potential in the non-interacting case. More practically, by performing state-specific KS calculations with exact and approximate correlation functionals -- each state possessing a distinct correlation functional -- we observe that spurious stationary solutions of the KS equations may arise due to the approximate nature of the functional.</description>

      <title>Impact of Parametrizations of the One-Body Reduced Density Matrix on the Energy Landscape</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.18996</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.18996v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Many electronic structure methods rely on the minimization of the energy of the system with respect to the one-body reduced density matrix (1-RDM). To formulate a minimization algorithm, the 1-RDM is often expressed in terms of its eigenvectors via an orthonormal transformation and its eigenvalues. This transformation drastically alters the energy landscape. Especially in 1-RDM functional theory this means that the convexity of the energy functional is lost. We show that degeneracies in the occupation numbers can lead to additional critical points which are classified as saddle points. Using a Cayley or Householder parametrization for the orthonormal transformation, no extra critical points arise. In case of Given's rotations or the exponential, additional critical points can arise, which are of no concern in practical minimization. These findings provide an explanation for the success of recent minimization procedures using second-order information.</description>

      <title>A low-cost four-component relativistic coupled cluster linear response theory based on perturbation sensitive natural spinors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.23144</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.23144v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present an efficient implementation of four-component linear response coupled cluster singles and doubles (4c-LRCCSD) theory that enables accurate and computationally efficient calculation of polarizabilities for systems containing heavy elements. We have observed that the frozen natural spinor (FNS)-based truncation scheme is not suitable for linear response properties, as it leads to larger errors in static and dynamic polarizability values. In this work, we have introduced a "perturbation-sensitive" density to construct the natural spinor basis, termed FNS++. Using FNS++, we achieve excellent accuracy when compared to experimental data and other theoretical results, even after truncating nearly 70% of the total virtual spinors. We also present pilot applications of 4c-LRCCSD with a canonical basis to calculate the polarizability spectra of 3d transition metals. By employing the FNS++-based 4c-LRCCSD, we have been able to compute polarizabilities for systems with over 1200 virtual spinors, maintaining low computational cost and excellent accuracy.</description>

      <title>Silk: A promising natural blend of amino acids for efficient CO$_2$ capture</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.01129</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.01129v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In recent years, various highly porous solid sorbents have drawn a significant research interest as promising carbon capture material. However, the issues of high synthesis cost, limited CO$_2$ adsorption capacity, slow adsorption-desorption kinetics, high sorbent regeneration temperature, and poor operational stability remain challenges to overcome before their practical implementation. In contrast, natural silk-fibroin, a blend of various amino acids, could be a promising material to realize low-cost carbon capture technology due to its amine-like CO$_2$ capture behavior, light weight, natural abundance, scalable processing, and biocompatibility. Here, we present mulberry silk-derived silk-fibroin aerogel that exhibits a high specific surface area and a remarkably high CO$_2$ adsorption capacity (~3.65 mmol CO$_2$/gm sorbent at 0.15 atm CO$_2$), making it competitive with state-of-the-art solid sorbents and superior to all amino acid-based solid sorbents. The thermogravimetry analysis reveals that the thermal degradation temperature of silk-fibroin aerogel is around 250 {\deg}C, significantly higher than conventional amines used for carbon capture. Furthermore, the silk-fibroin-based sorbent demonstrates rapid adsorption-desorption kinetics, complete regeneration at a temperature as low as 60 {\deg}C, promising stability over multiple adsorption-desorption cycles, and maintaining its adsorption capacity under humid conditions. Overall, this study highlights natural silk's promising carbon capture potential, which is demanding further exploration.</description>

      <title>Transfer learning from first-principles calculations to experiments with chemistry-informed domain transformation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.02848</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.02848v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Simulation-to-Real (Sim2Real) transfer learning, the machine learning technique that efficiently solves a real-world task by leveraging knowledge from computational data, has received increasing attention in materials science as a promising solution to the scarcity of experimental data. We proposed an efficient transfer learning scheme from first-principles calculations to experiments based on the chemistry-informed domain transformation, that integrates the heterogeneous source and target domains by harnessing the underlying physics and chemistry. The proposed method maps the computational data from the simulation space (source domain) into the space of experimental data (target domain). During this process, these qualitatively different domains are efficiently integrated by a couple of prior knowledge of chemistry, (1) the statistical ensemble, and (2) the relationship between source and target quantities. As a proof-of-concept, we predict the catalyst activity for the reverse water-gas shift reaction by using the abundant first-principles data in addition to the experimental data. Through the demonstration, we confirmed that the transfer learning model exhibits positive transfer in accuracy and data efficiency. In particular, a significantly high accuracy was achieved despite using a few (less than ten) target data in domain transformation, whose accuracy is one order of magnitude smaller than that of a full scratch model trained with over 100 target data. This result indicates that the proposed method leverages the high prediction performance with few target data, which helps to save the number of trials in real laboratories.</description>

Abstract: Multi-particle correlations of exciton-polaritons and reservoir-excitons in the strong light-matter coupling regime dictate the quantum dynamics of optical microcavities. In this letter, we examine the many-body exciton-polariton dynamics in a Fabry-P\'erot microcavity of a two-dimensional metal-halide semiconductor over timescales involving polariton ($\ll 1$\,ps) and exciton ($\gg 1$\,ps) scattering. We find enhanced exciton nonlinear dynamics in the microcavity versus the bare semiconductor, concomitant with ultrafast polariton scattering dynamics. We measure, by means of coherent spectroscopy, the coupling between exciton-polaritons, bright excitons, and reservoir-excitons that highlight the complex scattering landscape that fundamentally drives polariton condensation.</description>

      <title>Extended dissipaton theory with application to adatom-graphene composite</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.00669v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we present the extended dissipaton theory, including the dissipaton-equation-of-motion formalism and the equivalent dissipaton-embedded quantum master equation. These are exact, non-Markovian, and non-perturbative theories, capable of handling not only linear but also quadratic environmental couplings. These scenarios are prevalent in a variety of strongly correlated electronic systems, including mesoscopic nanodevices and superconductors. As a demonstration, we apply the present theory to simulate the spectral functions of an adatom on a graphene substrate. We analyze the spectral peaks in the presence of the graphene substrate and compare them to those obtained in conventional metal environments. The adatom's spectral functions reveal intricate behaviors arising from the band structure of graphene.</description>

      <title>Sulfur and sulfur-oxide compounds as potential optically active defects on SWCNTs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.18283</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.18283v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Semiconducting single-walled carbon nanotubes (SWCNT) functionalized with covalent defects are a promising class of optoelectronic materials with strong, tunable photoluminescence and demonstrated single photon emission. Here, we investigate sulfur-oxide containing compounds as a new class of optically active dopants on (6,5) SWCNT. Experimentally, it has been found that when the SWCNT is exposed to sodium dithionite, the resulting compound displays a red-shifted and bright photoluminescence peak that is characteristic of these covalent defects. We perform density functional theory calculations on the possible adsorbed compounds that may be the source of this red-shifted state (S, SO, SO2 and SO3). We predict that the two smallest molecules strongly bind to the SWCNT with binding energies of ~ 1.5-1.8 eV and 0.56 eV for S and SO, respectively, and introduce in-gap electronic states into the bandstructure of the tube consistent with the measured red-shift of (0.1-0.3) eV, consistent with measurements. In contrast, the larger compounds are found to be either unbound or weakly physisorbed with no appreciable impact on the electronic structure of the tube, indicating that they are unlikely to occur. Overall, our study suggests that sulfur-based compounds are promising new dopants for (6,5) SWCNT with tunable electronic properties.</description>

      <title>Learning classical density functionals for ionic fluids</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.02556v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Accurate and efficient theoretical techniques for describing ionic fluids are highly desirable for many applications across the physical, biological and materials sciences. With a rigorous statistical mechanical foundation, classical density functional theory (cDFT) is an appealing approach, but the competition between strong Coulombic interactions and steric repulsion limits the accuracy of current approximate functionals. Here, we extend a recently presented machine learning (ML) approach [Samm\"uller et al., Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA, 120, e2312484120 (2023)] designed for systems with short-ranged interactions to ionic fluids. By adopting ideas from local molecular field theory, the framework we present amounts to using neural networks to learn the local relationship between the one-body direct correlation functions and inhomogeneous density profiles for a "mimic'' short-ranged system, with effects of long-ranged interactions accounted for in a mean-field, yet well-controlled, manner. By comparing to results from molecular simulations, we show that our approach accurately describes the structure and thermodynamics of prototypical models for electrolyte solutions and ionic liquids, including size-asymmetric and multivalent systems. The framework we present acts as an important step toward extending ML approaches for cDFT to systems with accurate interatomic potentials.</description>

      <title>Quantization of Visible Light by a Ni$_2$ Molecular Optical Resonator</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.01444</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.01444v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The quantization of an optical field is a frontier in quantum optics with implications for both fundamental science and technological applications. Here, we demonstrate that a dinickel complex (Ni$_2$) traps and quantizes classical visible light, behaving as an individual quantum system or the Jaynes Cummings molecule.The composite system forms through coherently coupling the two level NiNi charge transfer transition with the local scattering field, which produces nonclassical light featuring photon anti bunching and squeezed states, as verified by a sequence of discrete photonic modes in the incoherent resonance fluorescence. Notably, in this Ni$_2$ system, the collective coupling of N molecule ensembles scales as N, distinct from the Tavis-Cummings model, which allows easy achievement of ultrastrong coupling. This is exemplified by a vacuum Rabi splitting of 1.2 eV at the resonance (3.25 eV) and a normalized coupling rate of 0.18 for the N = 4 ensemble. The resulting quantum light of single photonic modes enables driving the molecule field interaction in cavity free solution, which profoundly modifies the electronic states. Our results establish Ni$_2$ as a robust platform for quantum optical phenomena under ambient conditions, offering new pathways for molecular physics, polaritonic chemistry and quantum information processing.</description>

      <title>Quadruply Bonded Mo$_2$ Molecules Acting as an Inborn Emitter-Resonator Quantum System in Free Space</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.01453</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.01453v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In recent decades, significant progress has been made in construction and study of individual quantum systems consisting of the basic single matter and energy particles, i.e., atoms and photons, which show great potentials in quantum computation and communication. Here, we demonstrate that the quadruply-bonded Mo$_2$ unit of the complex can trap photons of visible light under ambient conditions, producing intense local electromagnetic (EM) field that features squeezed states, photon antibunching, and vacuum Rabi splitting. Our results show that both the electronic and vibrational states of the Mo$_2$ molecule are modified by coherent coupling with the scattered photons of the Mo$_2$ unit, as evidenced by the Rabi doublet4 and the Mollow triplet in the incoherent resonance fluorescence and the Raman spectra. The Mo$_2$ molecule, acting as an independent emitter-resonator integrated quantum system, allows optical experiments to be conducted in free space, enabling fundamental quantum phenomena to be observed through conventional spectroscopic instrumentation. This provides a new platform for study of field effects and quantum electrodynamics (QED) in the optical domain. The insights gained from this study advance our understanding in metal-metal bond chemistry, molecular physics and quantum optics, with applications in quantum information processing, optoelectronic devices and control of chemical reactivity.</description>

      <title>The Moving Born-Oppenheimer Approximation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.17557</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.17557v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We develop a mixed quantum-classical framework, dubbed the Moving Born-Oppenheimer Approximation (MBOA), to describe the dynamics of slow degrees of freedom (DOFs) coupled to fast ones. As in the Born-Oppenheimer Approximation (BOA), the fast degrees of freedom adiabatically follow a state that depends on the slow ones. Unlike the BOA, this state depends on both the positions and the momenta of the slow DOFs. We study several model systems: a spin-1/2 particle and a spinful molecule moving in a spatially inhomogeneous magnetic field, and a gas of fast particles coupled to a piston. The MBOA reveals rich dynamics for the slow degree of freedom, including reflection, dynamical trapping, and mass renormalization. It also significantly modifies the state of the fast DOFs. For example, the spins in the molecule are entangled and squeezed, while the gas of fast particles develops gradients that are synchronized with the motion of the piston for a long time. The MBOA can be used to describe both classical and quantum systems and has potential applications in molecular dynamics, state preparation, and quantum sensing.</description>

      <title>Review of the Electrochemical Double Layer Theory and Its Applications in Battery Electrode Materials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.18202</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.18202v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The interface plays a critical role in electrochemical systems, driving the development of various theories to investigate properties at nanoscale and microscale levels, including the electrictrochemical double layer (EDL) theory and continuum theory. However, the application of EDL theory within the realm of battery electrode materials has not been clearly defined according to material type. The diverse range of materials and their intricate interactions with interface theories often lead to misunderstandings. This review meticulously outlines the origins and principles of the EDL theory. Additionally, it categorizes battery electrode materials into two main groups: semiconductors and conductors. A comprehensive examination is presented on the implementation of EDL and other interface theories, accompanied by a comparative evaluation of the fundamental models and experiments described. The review also explores the potential advancements of EDL and other interface theories, as well as their application in electrode materials. This exhaustive review serves as an invaluable resource for scholars in electrochemistry and materials science, aiding in their understanding of interface theories, their scope of applicability, and the integration of these theories with practical experimental approaches.</description>
