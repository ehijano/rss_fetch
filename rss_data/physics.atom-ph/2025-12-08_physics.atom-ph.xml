      <title>Microwave electrometry with quantum-limited resolutions in a Rydberg atom array</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.05413</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.05413v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Microwave (MW) field sensing is foundational to modern technology, yet its evolution, reliant on classical antennas, is constrained by fundamental physical limits on field, temporal, and spatial resolutions. Here, we demonstrate an MW electrometry that simultaneously surpasses these constraints by using individual Rydberg atoms in an optical tweezer array as coherent sensors. This approach achieves a field sensitivity within 13% of the standard quantum limit, a response time that exceeds the Chu limit by more than 11 orders of magnitude, and in-situ near-field mapping with {\lambda}/3000 spatial resolution. This work establishes Rydberg-atom arrays as a powerful platform that unites quantum-limited sensitivity, nanosecond-scale response time, and sub-micrometer resolution, opening new avenues in quantum metrology and precision electromagnetic field imaging.</description>

      <title>Analysis of collision shift assessments in ion-based clocks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.05474</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.05474v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider back-ground gas collision shifts in ion-based clocks. We give both a classical and quantum description of a collision between an ion and a polarizable particle with a simple hard-sphere repulsion. Both descriptions give consistent results, which shows that a collision shift bound is determined by the classical Langevin collision rate reduced by a readily calculated factor describing the decoupling of the clock laser from the ion due to the recoil motion. We also show that the result holds when using a more general Lennard-Jones potential to describe the interaction between the ion and its collision partner. This leads to a simple bound for the collision shift applicable to any single ion clock without resorting to large-scale Monte-Carlo simulations or determination of molecular potential energy curves describing the collision. It also provides a relatively straightforward means to measure the relevant collision rate.</description>

      <title>Nuclear spin quenching of the $^2S_{1/2}\rightarrow {^2}F_{7/2} $ electric octupole transition in $^{173}$Yb$^+$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.05872</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.05872v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We report the coherent excitation of the highly forbidden $^2S_{1/2} \rightarrow {^2}F_{7/2}$ clock transition in the odd isotope $^{173}\mathrm{Yb}^+$ with nuclear spin $I = 5/2$, and reveal the hyperfine-state-dependent, nuclear spin induced quenching of this transition. The inferred lifetime of the $F_e = 4$ hyperfine state is one order of magnitude shorter than the unperturbed ${^2}F_{7/2}$ clock state of $^{171}\mathrm{Yb}^+$. This reduced lifetime lowers the required optical power for coherent excitation of the clock transition, thereby reducing the AC Stark shift caused by the clock laser. Using a 3-ion Coulomb crystal, we experimentally demonstrate an approximately 20-fold suppression of the AC Stark shift, a critical improvement for the scalability of future multi-ion $\mathrm{Yb}^+$ clocks. Furthermore, we report the $|^2S_{1/2},F_g=3\rangle~\rightarrow~|^2F_{7/2},F_e=6\rangle$ unquenched reference transition frequency as $642.11917656354(43)$ THz, along with the measured hyperfine splitting and calculated quadratic Zeeman sensitivities of the ${^2}F_{7/2}$ clock state. Our results pave the way toward multi-ion optical clocks and quantum computers based on $^{173}\mathrm{Yb}^+$.</description>

      <title>Mechanical Stability of 2D Ti2COx MXenes Under Compression Using Reactive Molecular Dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.05166</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.05166v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The compressive and post-buckling behavior of Ti2C and Ti2CO2 MXene nanosheets is studied using large-scale reactive molecular dynamics simulations. Nanosheets are subjected to uniaxial, biaxial, and shear loads to investigate their buckling modes, atomic-level deformation mechanisms, and failure characteristics. The results indicate that classical continuum mechanics significantly overestimates the buckling strains. Nanosheets exhibit higher resistance to buckling along the armchair direction than along the zigzag direction. Although atomic-scale defects reduce the buckling stress, they influence deformation only locally and do not alter the global buckling mode shapes. Lateral confinement pressure, such as that caused by polymerization-induced shrinkage in MXene-polymer composites, substantially increases the buckling stress. Oxygen surface termination increases the buckling stress from approximately 1 GPa to 3.5 GPa and reduces directional anisotropy in the elastic response. Under large compressive strains, Ti2CO2 nanosheets fracture, whereas Ti2C nanosheets retain structural integrity at strains exceeding 0.35. Atomistic analysis reveals opposite stress states in the top and bottom Ti layers due to curvature-induced strain gradients. Under biaxial compression, the nanosheet buckles in a dome-like shape, whereas shear loads produce elliptical deflection modes. The presented findings stimulate future studies on MXene morphological transformations, such as the development of nanotube, nanoscroll, and folded architectures.</description>

      <title>Squeezing Classical Antiferromagnets into Quantum Spin Liquids via Global Cavity Fluctuations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.05630</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.05630v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Cavity quantum electrodynamics with atomic ensembles is typically associated with collective spin phenomena, such as superradiance and spin squeezing, in which the atoms evolve collectively as a macroscopic spin ($S\sim N/2$) on the Bloch sphere. Surprisingly, we show that the tendency toward a collective spin description need not imply collective spin phenomena; rather, it can be exploited to generate new forms of strongly correlated quantum matter. The key idea is to use uniform cavity-mediated interactions to energetically project the system into the total-spin singlet sector ($S=0$) - a highly entangled subspace where the physics is governed entirely by cavity fluctuations. Focusing on Rydberg atom arrays coupled to a single-mode cavity, we show that global cavity fluctuations can effectively squeeze classical antiferromagnets into quantum spin liquids, characterized by non-local entanglement, fractionalized excitations, and emergent gauge fields. This work suggests that cavity QED can be a surprising resource for inducing strongly correlated phenomena, which could be explored in the new generation of hybrid tweezer-cavity platforms.</description>

      <title>Quenching dynamics of vortex in spin-orbit coupled Bose-Einstein condensates</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.05691</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.05691v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the ground states and rich dynamics of vortices in spin-orbit coupled Bose-Einstein condensates (BEC) subject to position-dependent detuning. Such a detuning plays the role of an effective rotational frequency, causing the generation of a synthetic magnetic field. Through scanning the detuning gradient, we numerically obtain static vortex lattice structures containing 1 to 6 vortices using the coupled Gross-Pitaevskii equations. When quenching detuning gradient below its initial value, the vortex lattices exhibit interesting periodic rotation motion, and their dynamical stability can persist for up to 1000ms. In particular, depending on the detuning gradient, the twin vortices exhibit either a scissors-like rotational oscillation or a clockwise periodic rotation, reflecting the response to the magnetic field gradient experienced by the condensates. We fit the numerical results to quantitatively analyze the relation between rotation dynamics and magnetic field gradients. When quenching the detuning gradient beyond its initial value, additional vortices appear. Our findings may motivate further experimental studies of vortex dynamics in synthetic magnetic fields and offer insights for engineering a BEC-based magnetic field gradiometer.</description>

      <title>Computer simulations of the Stark effect in the helium-beta complex of krypton in ICF conditions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.05903</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.05903v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: There is an ongoing interest in using spectroscopy in inertial confinement fusion (ICF) experiments, where dopants such as krypton can provide vital information about the temperature and density of the imploding plasma. While the most advanced tools for calculating Stark profiles are computer simulation models (CSMs), their application to complex lineshapes under the extreme conditions of ICF experiments is computationally challenging. In this manuscript, we present results of several CSM realizations applied to the Stark shape of the krypton He-beta line and its satellites at ICF-relevant conditions (ne = 1e24 to 1e25 cm-3, Te = 3keV). We demonstrate that codes with the same underlying physics but different numerical approaches yield identical results and analyze the differences in the line profile caused by various physical effects.</description>

      <title>Imaging atomic scattering potential in centroidal diffraction of elastic electrons</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.04466v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The Fraunhofer diffraction of quantum particles from materials with sharp electron-density edges or symmetric bond structures is ubiquitous. In contrast, diffraction from atoms with characteristic asymptotically-diffused electron distribution is far less intuitive, although known for many years. The current study unravels an unusual diffraction mechanism of elastic electrons from diffused atomic diffractors. Consequently, the fringe pattern converted to the Fourier reciprocal space maps out the effective scattering potential, which is not accessible in direct measurements. This may benefit benchmarking theory models, advances in atom-holography, plasma and astrophysical diagnostics, and accessing time-resolved potential landscapes. The study employs relativistic partial wave analysis with atoms modeled in the Dirac-Fock formalism and performs e-Cd measurements in absolute scale. Analysis for Mg, Ba, and Ra targets demonstrates the universality of the mechanism.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2511.02716v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We derive formulas and perform calculations of nonadiabatic corrections to rates of electric quadrupole transitions in the hydrogen molecule. These corrections can be represented in terms of the quadrupole moment curve $D^{(1)}(R)$, similarly to the Born-Oppenheimer one, $D^{(0)}(R)$, derived originally by Wolniewicz. Numerical results change E2 transition rates for the fundamental band by as much as 0.4 - 12\% depending on rotational quantum numbers.</description>

      <title>Demonstration of magic dressing of $^3$He</title>

      <description>arXiv:2512.02443v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A common concern in high-precision neutron electric dipole moment (nEDM) experiments is that of magnetic field stability. For static fields, this problem can be mitigated through the use of a superconducting holding field coil, which when operated in persistent current mode serves to stabilize the magnetic field. However, such a solution is not viable when time-varying magnetic fields are present, as is the case for the spin dressing mode of the proposed nEDMSF (nEDM super-fluid) experiment. This experiment features an oscillating magnetic field to dress the gyromagnetic ratios of $^3$He and neutrons to the same value, a condition known as critical dressing. Fluctuations in the dressing field amplitude have the potential to disrupt this condition. Here, we investigate a modification to spin dressing, termed ``magic dressing,'' which renders the system insensitive to small variations in dressing field amplitude. We further demonstrate the utility of this method for the single spin-species case using a sample of polarized $^3$He. We find a dramatic increase in transverse relaxation time in the presence of magnetic field gradients.</description>

Abstract: We report the first observation of the magnetic-field-induced (5d10 6s2)1S0-(5d10 6s6p)3P0 transition in a bosonic isotope of mercury, 198Hg, realized in an optical lattice clock. We characterize this new isotope, determining key features such as the quadratic Zeeman shift, the probe light shift, and the magic frequency. We also report a first comparison between the 198Hg optical lattice clock and 87Sr. In this comparison, the 198Hg clock has a relative frequency stability of 6x10-16/sqrt(tau/s) and a total relative systematic uncertainty of 6.9x10-16. This comparison yields the first direct determination of the 198Hg/87Sr optical frequency ratio: 198Hg/87Sr = 2.629 315 734 684 118 1, with the same relative uncertainty.</description>

      <title>Two-Mode Bosonic State Tomography with Single-Shot Joint-Parity Measurement of a Trapped Ion</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.12628v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The full characterization of a continuous-variable quantum system is a challenging problem. For the trapped-ion system, a number of methods of measuring the quantum states have been developed, including the measurement of the Q quasiprobability function and the density-matrix elements in the Fock basis, but these approaches are often slow and difficult to scale to multimode states. Here, we demonstrate a novel and powerful scheme for measuring a continuous-variable quantum state that uses the direct single-shot measurement of the joint parity of the phonon states of a trapped ion. We drive a spin-dependent bichromatic beam-splitter interaction that coherently exchanges phonons between different harmonic oscillator modes of the ion. This interaction encodes the joint-parity information into the relative phase between the two spin states, enabling measurement of the combined phonon-number parity across multiple modes in a single shot. Leveraging this capability, we directly measure multimode Wigner quasiprobability distributions to perform quantum state tomography of an entangled coherent state, and calculate various quantum informational quantities with a model-based estimation of the density matrix. We further show that the single-shot joint-parity measurement can be used to detect parity-flip errors in real time. By postselecting the parity-measurement outcomes, we experimentally demonstrate the partial recovery of coherence, effectively implementing an error-mitigation technique. Lastly, we identify the various sources of error affecting the fidelity of the spin-dependent beam-splitter operation and study the feasibility of high-fidelity operations. The interaction studied in this work can be extended to more than two modes, and is highly relevant to continuous-variable quantum computing and quantum metrology.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2507.02278v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Quantum lock-in amplification raises the detection sensitivity of magnetic fields to unprecedented levels by phase-locked pumping the Zeeman levels of a single trapped atom. However, random spin precessions limits the useful detection range of arming times for locking high-contrast signals. To extend this range imposed by the uncertainty limit, quadrature spin squeezing can be introduced, on top of the phase-locking mechanism. We propose a detection scheme using an atomic ensemble whose collected spin is pumped by two lasers for simultaneous squeezing and phase locking. We derive the optimal $\pi/2$-pulse and $\pi$-pulse schemes that accomplishes this concurrent action and prove that the resulting phase sensitivity is enhanced while the usable detection window for phase locking is widened.</description>

      <title>Temperature-Dependent Evolution of Coherence, Entropy, and Photon Statistics in Photoluminescence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.01953</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.01953v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Photoluminescence (PL) is a fundamental light-matter interaction in which absorbed photons are re-emitted, playing a key role in science and engineering. It is commonly modeled by introducing a non-zero chemical potential into Planck's law to capture its deviation from thermal emission. In this work, we establish, for the first time to our knowledge, a fundamental relationship that expresses the chemical potential as a function of temperature, material properties, and excitation conditions, enabling a treatment of PL analogous to Planck's law with thermal radiation. This formulation allows for the analysis of temperature-dependent PL properties, including spectral emission, entropy, temporal coherence, and photon statistics, capturing the transition from narrowband pump-induced to broadband thermal emission. Notably, we identify a temperature range where the emission rate is quasi-conserved, associated with the previously reported blueshift. This is followed by a rapid transition to thermal behavior, reflected in both the chemical potential and entropy. Conversely, the coherence time and photon statistics evolve smoothly across the entire temperature range. Alongside its scientific contribution, this framework provides a foundation for designing temperature-tunable light sources, enabling control over coherence length and photon statistics.</description>

Abstract: We present the results of our quantum annealing computations of the permanent electric dipole
  moments of several molecules. By applying an electric field as a perturbation and measuring the
  corresponding energy responses, the molecular electric dipole moments are obtained numerically
  through the finite field method. The ground-state electronic wavefunctions and energies are obtained
  using the quantum annealer eignsolver algorithm. This work provides a pathway for the computation
  of molecular properties in the quantum annealing paradigm.</description>
