      <title>Stiefel optimization is NP-hard</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.02839</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.02839v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We show that linearly constrained linear optimization over a Stiefel or Grassmann manifold is NP-hard in general. We show that the same is true for unconstrained quadratic optimization over a Stiefel manifold. We will establish the nonexistence of FPTAS for these optimization problems over a Stiefel manifold. As an aside we extend our results to flag manifolds. Combined with earlier findings, this shows that manifold optimization is a difficult endeavor -- even the simplest problems like LP and unconstrained QP are already NP-hard on the most common manifolds.</description>

      <title>On the Smoothed Complexity of Combinatorial Local Search</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2211.07547</link>
      <description>arXiv:2211.07547v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We propose a unifying framework for smoothed analysis of combinatorial local optimization problems, and show how a diverse selection of problems within the complexity class PLS can be cast within this model. This abstraction allows us to identify key structural properties, and corresponding parameters, that determine the smoothed running time of local search dynamics. We formalize this via a black-box tool that provides concrete bounds on the expected maximum number of steps needed until local search reaches an exact local optimum. This bound is particularly strong, in the sense that it holds for any starting feasible solution, any choice of pivoting rule, and does not rely on the choice of specific noise distributions that are applied on the input, but it is parameterized by just a global upper bound $\phi$ on the probability density. The power of this tool can be demonstrated by instantiating it for various PLS-hard problems of interest to derive efficient smoothed running times (as a function of $\phi$ and the input size).
  Most notably, we focus on the important local optimization problem of finding pure Nash equilibria in Congestion Games, that has not been studied before from a smoothed analysis perspective. Specifically, we propose novel smoothed analysis models for general and Network Congestion Games, under various representations, including explicit, step-function, and polynomial resource latencies. We study PLS-hard instances of these problems and show that their standard local search algorithms run in polynomial smoothed time.
  Finally, we present further applications of our framework to a wide range of additional combinatorial problems, including local Max-Cut in weighted graphs, the Travelling Salesman problem (TSP) under the $k$-opt local heuristic, and finding pure equilibria in Network Coordination Games.</description>

      <title>Hereditary First-Order Logic: the tractable quantifier prefix classes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.10860</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.10860v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Many computational problems can be modelled as the class of all finite structures $\mathbb A$ that satisfy a fixed first-order sentence $\phi$ hereditarily, i.e., we require that every (induced) substructure of $\mathbb A$ satisfies $\phi$. We call the corresponding computational problem the hereditary model checking problem for $\phi$, and denote it by Her$(\phi)$.
  We present a complete description of the quantifier prefixes for $\phi$ such that Her$(\phi)$ is in P; we show that for every other quantifier prefix there exists a formula $\phi$ with this prefix such that Her$(\phi)$ is coNP-complete. Specifically, we show that if $Q$ is of the form $\forall^\ast\exists\forall^\ast$ or of the form $\forall^\ast\exists^\ast$, then Her$(\phi)$ can be solved in polynomial time whenever the quantifier prefix of $\phi$ is $Q$. Otherwise, $Q$ contains $\exists \exists \forall$ or $\exists \forall \exists$ as a subword, and in this case, there is a first-order formula $\phi$ whose quantifier prefix is $Q$ and Her$(\phi)$ is coNP-complete. Moreover, we show that there is no algorithm that decides for a given first-order formula $\phi$ whether Her$(\phi)$ is in P (unless P$=$NP).</description>
