      <title>Sound Matching an Analogue Levelling Amplifier Using the Newton-Raphson Method</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.10706</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.10706v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Automatic differentiation through digital signal processing algorithms for virtual analogue modelling has recently gained popularity. These algorithms are typically more computationally efficient than black-box neural networks that rely on dense matrix multiplications. Due to their differentiable nature, they can be integrated with neural networks and jointly trained using gradient descent algorithms, resulting in more efficient systems. Furthermore, signal processing algorithms have significantly fewer parameters than neural networks, allowing the application of the Newton-Raphson method. This method offers faster and more robust convergence than gradient descent at the cost of quadratic storage. This paper presents a method to emulate analogue levelling amplifiers using a feed-forward digital compressor with parameters optimised via the Newton-Raphson method. We demonstrate that a digital compressor can successfully approximate the behaviour of our target unit, the Teletronix LA-2A. Different strategies for computing the Hessian matrix are benchmarked. We leverage parallel algorithms for recursive filters to achieve efficient training on modern GPUs. The resulting model is made into a VST plugin and is open-sourced at https://github.com/aim-qmul/4a2a.</description>

      <title>Local Density-Based Anomaly Score Normalization for Domain Generalization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.10951</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.10951v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: State-of-the-art anomalous sound detection (ASD) systems in domain-shifted conditions rely on projecting audio signals into an embedding space and using distance-based outlier detection to compute anomaly scores. One of the major difficulties to overcome is the so-called domain mismatch between the anomaly score distributions of a source domain and a target domain that differ acoustically and in terms of the amount of training data provided. A decision threshold that is optimal for one domain may be highly sub-optimal for the other domain and vice versa. This significantly degrades the performance when only using a single decision threshold, as is required when generalizing to multiple data domains that are possibly unseen during training while still using the same trained ASD system as in the source domain. To reduce this mismatch between the domains, we propose a simple local-density-based anomaly score normalization scheme. In experiments conducted on several ASD datasets, we show that the proposed normalization scheme consistently improves performance for various types of embedding-based ASD systems and yields better results than existing anomaly score normalization approaches.</description>

      <title>Length-Aware Rotary Position Embedding for Text-Speech Alignment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.11084</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.11084v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Many recent text-to-speech (TTS) systems are built on transformer architectures and employ cross-attention mechanisms for text-speech alignment. Within these systems, rotary position embedding (RoPE) is commonly used to encode positional information in text and speech representations. In this work, we introduce length-aware RoPE (LARoPE), a simple yet effective extension of RoPE that improves text-speech alignment. Unlike RoPE, which relies on absolute indices, LARoPE computes relative distances between query and key positions using length-normalized indices. Experimental results show that LARoPE consistently outperforms RoPE, offering faster loss convergence, more accurate text-speech alignment, and higher overall TTS quality. Furthermore, LARoPE demonstrates greater resilience to variations in utterance duration and maintains stable performance in extended speech generation up to 30 seconds, whereas RoPE suffers from notable degradation. Notably, our method achieves a state-of-the-art word error rate on a standard zero-shot TTS benchmark.</description>

      <title>EEND-SAA: Enrollment-Less Main Speaker Voice Activity Detection Using Self-Attention Attractors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.11957</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.11957v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Voice activity detection (VAD) is essential in speech-based systems, but traditional methods detect only speech presence without identifying speakers. Target-speaker VAD (TS-VAD) extends this by detecting the speech of a known speaker using a short enrollment utterance, but this assumption fails in open-domain scenarios such as meetings or customer service calls, where the main speaker is unknown. We propose EEND-SAA, an enrollment-less, streaming-compatible framework for main-speaker VAD, which identifies the primary speaker without prior knowledge. Unlike TS-VAD, our method determines the main speaker as the one who talks more steadily and clearly, based on speech continuity and volume. We build our model on EEND using two self-attention attractors in a Transformer and apply causal masking for real-time use. Experiments on multi-speaker LibriSpeech mixtures show that EEND-SAA reduces main-speaker DER from 6.63% to 3.61% and improves F1 from 0.9667 to 0.9818 over the SA-EEND baseline, achieving state-of-the-art performance under conditions involving speaker overlap and noise.</description>

      <title>Multimodal Deep Learning for ATCO Command Lifecycle Modeling and Workload Prediction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.10522</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.10522v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Air traffic controllers (ATCOs) issue high-intensity voice commands in dense airspace, where accurate workload modeling is critical for safety and efficiency. This paper proposes a multimodal deep learning framework that integrates structured data, trajectory sequences, and image features to estimate two key parameters in the ATCO command lifecycle: the time offset between a command and the resulting aircraft maneuver, and the command duration. A high-quality dataset was constructed, with maneuver points detected using sliding window and histogram-based methods. A CNN-Transformer ensemble model was developed for accurate, generalizable, and interpretable predictions. By linking trajectories to voice commands, this work offers the first model of its kind to support intelligent command generation and provides practical value for workload assessment, staffing, and scheduling.</description>

      <title>Combining Audio and Non-Audio Inputs in Evolved Neural Networks for Ovenbird</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.10566</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.10566v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In the last several years the use of neural networks as tools to automate species classification from digital data has increased. This has been due in part to the high classification accuracy of image classification through Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN). In the case of audio data CNN based recognizers are used to automate the classification of species in audio recordings by using information from sound visualization (i.e., spectrograms). It is common for these recognizers to use the spectrogram as their sole input. However, researchers have other non-audio data, such as habitat preferences of a species, phenology, and range information, available that could improve species classification. In this paper we present how a single-species recognizer neural network's accuracy can be improved by using non-audio data as inputs in addition to spectrogram information. We also analyze if the improvements are merely a result of having a neural network with a higher number of parameters instead of combining the two inputs. We find that networks that use the two different inputs have a higher classification accuracy than networks of similar size that use only one of the inputs.</description>

      <title>WeaveMuse: An Open Agentic System for Multimodal Music Understanding and Generation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.11183</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.11183v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Agentic AI has been standardized in industry as a practical paradigm for coordinating specialized models and tools to solve complex multimodal tasks. In this work, we present WeaveMuse, a multi-agent system for music understanding, symbolic composition, and audio synthesis. Each specialist agent interprets user requests, derives machine-actionable requirements (modalities, formats, constraints), and validates its own outputs, while a manager agent selects and sequences tools, mediates user interaction, and maintains state across turns. The system is extendable and deployable either locally, using quantization and inference strategies to fit diverse hardware budgets, or via the HFApi to preserve free community access to open models. Beyond out-of-the-box use, the system emphasizes controllability and adaptation through constraint schemas, structured decoding, policy-based inference, and parameter-efficient adapters or distilled variants that tailor models to MIR tasks. A central design goal is to facilitate intermodal interaction across text, symbolic notation and visualization, and audio, enabling analysis-synthesis-render loops and addressing cross-format constraints. The framework aims to democratize, implement, and make accessible MIR tools by supporting interchangeable open-source models of various sizes, flexible memory management, and reproducible deployment paths.</description>

      <title>Revisiting Meter Tracking in Carnatic Music using Deep Learning Approaches</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.11241</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.11241v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Beat and downbeat tracking, jointly referred to as Meter Tracking, is a fundamental task in Music Information Retrieval (MIR). Deep learning models have far surpassed traditional signal processing and classical machine learning approaches in this domain, particularly for Western (Eurogenetic) genres, where large annotated datasets are widely available. These systems, however, perform less reliably on underrepresented musical traditions. Carnatic music, a rich tradition from the Indian subcontinent, is renowned for its rhythmic intricacy and unique metrical structures (t\=alas). The most notable prior work on meter tracking in this context employed probabilistic Dynamic Bayesian Networks (DBNs). The performance of state-of-the-art (SOTA) deep learning models on Carnatic music, however, remains largely unexplored.
  In this study, we evaluate two models for meter tracking in Carnatic music: the Temporal Convolutional Network (TCN), a lightweight architecture that has been successfully adapted for Latin rhythms, and Beat This!, a transformer-based model designed for broad stylistic coverage without the need for post-processing. Replicating the experimental setup of the DBN baseline on the Carnatic Music Rhythm (CMR$_f$) dataset, we systematically assess the performance of these models in a directly comparable setting. We further investigate adaptation strategies, including fine-tuning the models on Carnatic data and the use of musically informed parameters. Results show that while off-the-shelf models do not always outperform the DBN, their performance improves substantially with transfer learning, matching or surpassing the baseline. These findings indicate that SOTA deep learning models can be effectively adapted to underrepresented traditions, paving the way for more inclusive and broadly applicable meter tracking systems.</description>

      <title>FuseCodec: Semantic-Contextual Fusion and Supervision for Neural Codecs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.11425</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.11425v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Speech tokenization enables discrete representation and facilitates speech language modeling. However, existing neural codecs capture low-level acoustic features, overlooking the semantic and contextual cues inherent to human speech. While recent efforts introduced semantic representations from self-supervised speech models or incorporated contextual representations from pre-trained language models, challenges remain in aligning and unifying the semantic and contextual representations. We introduce FuseCodec, which unifies acoustic, semantic, and contextual representations through strong cross-modal alignment and globally informed supervision. We propose three complementary techniques: (i) Latent Representation Fusion, integrating semantic and contextual features directly into the encoder latent space for robust and unified representation learning; (ii) Global Semantic-Contextual Supervision, supervising discrete tokens with globally pooled and broadcasted representations to enhance temporal consistency and cross-modal alignment; and (iii) Temporally Aligned Contextual Supervision, strengthening alignment by dynamically matching contextual and speech tokens within a local window for fine-grained token-level supervision. We further introduce FuseCodec-TTS, demonstrating our methodology's applicability to zero-shot speech synthesis. Empirically, FuseCodec achieves state-of-the-art performance in LibriSpeech, surpassing EnCodec, SpeechTokenizer, and DAC in transcription accuracy, perceptual quality, intelligibility, and speaker similarity. Results highlight the effectiveness of contextually and semantically guided tokenization for speech tokenization and downstream tasks. Code and pretrained models are available at https://github.com/mubtasimahasan/FuseCodec.</description>

      <title>Room acoustics affect communicative success in hybrid meeting spaces: a pilot study</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.11709</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.11709v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Since the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020, universities and companies have increasingly integrated hybrid features into their meeting spaces, or even created dedicated rooms for this purpose. While the importance of a fast and stable internet connection is often prioritized, the acoustic design of seminar rooms is frequently overlooked. Poor acoustics, particularly excessive reverberation, can lead to issues such as misunderstandings, reduced speech intelligibility or cognitive and vocal fatigue. This pilot study investigates whether room acoustic interventions in a seminar room at Graz University of Technology support better communication in hybrid meetings. For this purpose, we recorded two groups of persons twice, once before and once after improving the acoustics of the room. Our findings -- despite not reaching statistical significance due to the small sample size - indicate clearly that our spatial interventions improve communicative success in hybrid meetings. To make the paper accessible also for readers from the speech communication community, we explain room acoustics background, relevant for the interpretation of our results.</description>

      <title>The Whole Is Bigger Than the Sum of Its Parts: Modeling Individual Annotators to Capture Emotional Variability</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.11956</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.11956v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Emotion expression and perception are nuanced, complex, and highly subjective processes. When multiple annotators label emotional data, the resulting labels contain high variability. Most speech emotion recognition tasks address this by averaging annotator labels as ground truth. However, this process omits the nuance of emotion and inter-annotator variability, which are important signals to capture. Previous work has attempted to learn distributions to capture emotion variability, but these methods also lose information about the individual annotators. We address these limitations by learning to predict individual annotators and by introducing a novel method to create distributions from continuous model outputs that permit the learning of emotion distributions during model training. We show that this combined approach can result in emotion distributions that are more accurate than those seen in prior work, in both within- and cross-corpus settings.</description>

      <title>YuE: Scaling Open Foundation Models for Long-Form Music Generation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.08638</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.08638v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We tackle the task of long-form music generation--particularly the challenging \textbf{lyrics-to-song} problem--by introducing YuE, a family of open foundation models based on the LLaMA2 architecture. Specifically, YuE scales to trillions of tokens and generates up to five minutes of music while maintaining lyrical alignment, coherent musical structure, and engaging vocal melodies with appropriate accompaniment. It achieves this through (1) track-decoupled next-token prediction to overcome dense mixture signals, (2) structural progressive conditioning for long-context lyrical alignment, and (3) a multitask, multiphase pre-training recipe to converge and generalize. In addition, we redesign the in-context learning technique for music generation, enabling versatile style transfer (e.g., converting Japanese city pop into an English rap while preserving the original accompaniment) and bidirectional generation. Through extensive evaluation, we demonstrate that YuE matches or even surpasses some of the proprietary systems in musicality and vocal agility. In addition, fine-tuning YuE enables additional controls and enhanced support for tail languages. Furthermore, beyond generation, we show that YuE's learned representations can perform well on music understanding tasks, where the results of YuE match or exceed state-of-the-art methods on the MARBLE benchmark.

      <title>M2D-CLAP: Exploring General-purpose Audio-Language Representations Beyond CLAP</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.22104</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.22104v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Contrastive language-audio pre-training (CLAP), which learns audio-language representations by aligning audio and text in a common feature space, has become popular for solving audio tasks. However, CLAP's audio features lack generalizability, whereas self-supervised learning (SSL) models offer general-purpose features that perform well across diverse audio tasks. We aim to develop a broadly applicable audio representation and hypothesize that a model that learns both general audio and CLAP features should achieve our goal, which we call a general-purpose audio-language representation. To implement our hypothesis, we propose M2D-CLAP, the first approach to jointly learn effective general audio and CLAP features. It extends an SSL masked modeling duo (M2D) by incorporating CLAP and utilizes LLM-based sentence embeddings. The training process consists of multiple stages. In the first stage, generalizable audio features are pre-trained via a multitask objective combining M2D and CLAP, with CLAP leveraging LLM-based semantic embeddings to distill semantic knowledge into them. In the following stages, CLAP features are pre-trained and refined with guidance from the learned audio features. Experiments demonstrated that M2D-CLAP learns high-performing general audio features (e.g., AudioSet mAP of 49.0, SOTA results in music tasks) and CLAP features, thereby enabling a general-purpose audio-language representation.</description>

      <title>Reducing Object Hallucination in Large Audio-Language Models via Audio-Aware Decoding</title>

Abstract: Large Audio-Language Models (LALMs) can take audio and text as the inputs and answer questions about the audio. While prior LALMs have shown strong performance on standard benchmarks, there has been alarming evidence that LALMs can hallucinate what is presented in the audio. To mitigate the hallucination of LALMs, we introduce Audio-Aware Decoding (AAD), a lightweight inference-time strategy that uses contrastive decoding to compare the token prediction logits with and without the audio context. By contrastive decoding, AAD promotes the tokens whose probability increases when the audio is present. We conduct our experiment on object hallucination datasets with three LALMs and show that AAD improves the F1 score by 0.046 to 0.428. We also show that AAD can improve the accuracy on general audio QA datasets like Clotho-AQA by 5.4% to 10.3%. We conduct thorough ablation studies to understand the effectiveness of each component in AAD.</description>

      <title>From perception to production: how acoustic invariance facilitates articulatory learning in a self-supervised vocal imitation model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.05849</link>

Abstract: Human infants face a formidable challenge in speech acquisition: mapping extremely variable acoustic inputs into appropriate articulatory movements without explicit instruction. We present a computational model that addresses the acoustic-to-articulatory mapping problem through self-supervised learning. Our model comprises a feature extractor that transforms speech into latent representations, an inverse model that maps these representations to articulatory parameters, and a synthesizer that generates speech outputs. Experiments conducted in both single- and multi-speaker settings reveal that intermediate layers of a pre-trained wav2vec 2.0 model provide optimal representations for articulatory learning, significantly outperforming MFCC features. These representations enable our model to learn articulatory trajectories that correlate with human patterns, discriminate between places of articulation, and produce intelligible speech. Critical to successful articulatory learning are representations that balance phonetic discriminability with speaker invariance -- precisely the characteristics of self-supervised representation learning models. Our findings provide computational evidence consistent with developmental theories proposing that perceptual learning of phonetic categories guides articulatory development, offering insights into how infants might acquire speech production capabilities despite the complex mapping problem they face.</description>

      <title>CoPlay: Audio-agnostic Cognitive Scaling for Acoustic Sensing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.10796</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.10796v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Acoustic sensing manifests great potential in various applications that encompass health monitoring, gesture interface and imaging by leveraging the speakers and microphones on smart devices. However, in ongoing research and development in acoustic sensing, one problem is often overlooked: the same speaker, when used concurrently for sensing and other traditional applications (like playing music), could cause interference in both making it impractical to use in the real world. The strong ultrasonic sensing signals mixed with music would overload the speaker's mixer. To confront this issue of overloaded signals, current solutions are clipping or down-scaling, both of which affect the music playback quality and also sensing range and accuracy. To address this challenge, we propose CoPlay, a deep learning based optimization algorithm to cognitively adapt the sensing signal. It can 1) maximize the sensing signal magnitude within the available bandwidth left by the concurrent music to optimize sensing range and accuracy and 2) minimize any consequential frequency distortion that can affect music playback. In this work, we design a deep learning model and test it on common types of sensing signals (sine wave or Frequency Modulated Continuous Wave FMCW) as inputs with various agnostic concurrent music and speech. First, we evaluated the model performance to show the quality of the generated signals. Then we conducted field studies of downstream acoustic sensing tasks in the real world. A study with 12 users proved that respiration monitoring and gesture recognition using our adapted signal achieve similar accuracy as no-concurrent-music scenarios, while clipping or down-scaling manifests worse accuracy. A qualitative study also manifests that the music play quality is not degraded, unlike traditional clipping or down-scaling methods.</description>

      <title>Evaluating Automatic Speech Recognition Systems for Korean Meteorological Experts</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.18444</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.18444v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper explores integrating Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) into natural language query systems to improve weather forecasting efficiency for Korean meteorologists. We address challenges in developing ASR systems for the Korean weather domain, specifically specialized vocabulary and Korean linguistic intricacies. To tackle these issues, we constructed an evaluation dataset of spoken queries recorded by native Korean speakers. Using this dataset, we assessed various configurations of a multilingual ASR model family, identifying performance limitations related to domain-specific terminology. We then implemented a simple text-to-speech-based data augmentation method, which improved the recognition of specialized terms while maintaining general-domain performance. Our contributions include creating a domain-specific dataset, comprehensive ASR model evaluations, and an effective augmentation technique. We believe our work provides a foundation for future advancements in ASR for the Korean weather forecasting domain.</description>

      <title>SonicSieve: Bringing Directional Speech Extraction to Smartphones Using Acoustic Microstructures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.10793</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.10793v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Imagine placing your smartphone on a table in a noisy restaurant and clearly capturing the voices of friends seated around you, or recording a lecturer's voice with clarity in a reverberant auditorium. We introduce SonicSieve, the first intelligent directional speech extraction system for smartphones using a bio-inspired acoustic microstructure. Our passive design embeds directional cues onto incoming speech without any additional electronics. It attaches to the in-line mic of low-cost wired earphones which can be attached to smartphones. We present an end-to-end neural network that processes the raw audio mixtures in real-time on mobile devices. Our results show that SonicSieve achieves a signal quality improvement of 5.0 dB when focusing on a 30{\deg} angular region. Additionally, the performance of our system based on only two microphones exceeds that of conventional 5-microphone arrays.</description>

      <title>Spectral and Rhythm Feature Performance Evaluation for Category and Class Level Audio Classification with Deep Convolutional Neural Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.07756</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.07756v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Next to decision tree and k-nearest neighbours algorithms deep convolutional neural networks (CNNs) are widely used to classify audio data in many domains like music, speech or environmental sounds. To train a specific CNN various spectral and rhythm features like mel-scaled spectrograms, mel-frequency cepstral coefficients (MFCC), cyclic tempograms, short-time Fourier transform (STFT) chromagrams, constant-Q transform (CQT) chromagrams and chroma energy normalized statistics (CENS) chromagrams can be used as digital image input data for the neural network. The performance of these spectral and rhythm features for audio category level as well as audio class level classification is investigated in detail with a deep CNN and the ESC-50 dataset with 2,000 labeled environmental audio recordings using an end-to-end deep learning pipeline. The evaluated metrics accuracy, precision, recall and F1 score for multiclass classification clearly show that the mel-scaled spectrograms and the mel-frequency cepstral coefficients (MFCC) perform significantly better then the other spectral and rhythm features investigated in this research for audio classification tasks using deep CNNs.</description>
