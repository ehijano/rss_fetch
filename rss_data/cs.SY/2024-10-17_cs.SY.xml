      <title>Low-Power Encoding for PAM-3 DRAM Bus</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.12990</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.12990v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The 3-level pulse amplitude modulation (PAM-3) signaling is expected to be widely used in memory interfaces for its greater voltage margins compared to PAM-4. To maximize the benefit of PAM-3, we propose three low-power data encoding algorithms: PAM3-DBI, PAM3-MF, and PAM3-SORT. With the DRAM memory traces from the gem5 computer architecture simulator running benchmarks, we evaluate the energy efficiency of our three PAM-3 encoding techniques. The experimental results show the proposed algorithms can reduce termination power for high-speed memory links significantly by 41% to 90% for benchmark programs.</description>

      <title>Two-Timescale Linear Stochastic Approximation: Constant Stepsizes Go a Long Way</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.13067</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.13067v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Previous studies on two-timescale stochastic approximation (SA) mainly focused on bounding mean-squared errors under diminishing stepsize schemes. In this work, we investigate {\it constant} stpesize schemes through the lens of Markov processes, proving that the iterates of both timescales converge to a unique joint stationary distribution in Wasserstein metric. We derive explicit geometric and non-asymptotic convergence rates, as well as the variance and bias introduced by constant stepsizes in the presence of Markovian noise. Specifically, with two constant stepsizes $\alpha &lt; \beta$, we show that the biases scale linearly with both stepsizes as $\Theta(\alpha)+\Theta(\beta)$ up to higher-order terms, while the variance of the slower iterate (resp., faster iterate) scales only with its own stepsize as $O(\alpha)$ (resp., $O(\beta)$). Unlike previous work, our results require no additional assumptions such as $\beta^2 \ll \alpha$ nor extra dependence on dimensions. These fine-grained characterizations allow tail-averaging and extrapolation techniques to reduce variance and bias, improving mean-squared error bound to $O(\beta^4 + \frac{1}{t})$ for both iterates.</description>

      <title>Cyber C2: Achieving Scrutability and Agency in Cyberspace Operations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.13076</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.13076v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Our thesis is that operating in cyberspace is challenging because cyberspace exhibits extreme variety, high malleability, and extreme velocity. These properties make cyberspace largely inscrutable and limits one's agency in cyberspace, where agency is the ability to exert influence to transform the state or behaviour of the environment. With this thesis, we explore the nature of cyberspace, command and control (C2), and diagnose the challenges for cyber C2, with treatment to follow in future work.</description>

      <title>BOXR: Body and head motion Optimization framework for eXtended Reality</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.13084</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.13084v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The emergence of standalone XR systems has enhanced user mobility, accommodating both subtle, frequent head motions and substantial, less frequent body motions. However, the pervasively used M2D latency metric, which measures the delay between the most recent motion and its corresponding display update, only accounts for head motions. This oversight can leave users prone to motion sickness if significant body motion is involved. Although existing methods optimize M2D latency through asynchronous task scheduling and reprojection methods, they introduce challenges like resource contention between tasks and outdated pose data. These challenges are further complicated by user motion dynamics and scene changes during runtime. To address these issues, we for the first time introduce the C2D latency metric, which captures the delay caused by body motions, and present BOXR, a framework designed to co-optimize both body and head motion delays within an XR system. BOXR enhances the coordination between M2D and C2D latencies by efficiently scheduling tasks to avoid contentions while maintaining an up-to-date pose in the output frame. Moreover, BOXR incorporates a motion-driven visual inertial odometer to adjust to user motion dynamics and employs scene-dependent foveated rendering to manage changes in the scene effectively. Our evaluations show that BOXR significantly outperforms state-of-the-art solutions in 11 EuRoC MAV datasets across 4 XR applications across 3 hardware platforms. In controlled motion and scene settings, BOXR reduces M2D and C2D latencies by up to 63% and 27%, respectively and increases frame rate by up to 43%. In practical deployments, BOXR achieves substantial reductions in real-world scenarios up to 42% in M2D latency and 31% in C2D latency while maintaining remarkably low miss rates of only 1.6% for M2D requirements and 1.0% for C2D requirements.</description>

      <title>Coordinated Dispatch of Energy Storage Systems in the Active Distribution Network: A Complementary Reinforcement Learning and Optimization Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.13223</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.13223v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The complexity and nonlinearity of active distribution network (ADN), coupled with the fast-changing renewable energy (RE), necessitate advanced real-time and safe dispatch approach. This paper proposes a complementary reinforcement learning (RL) and optimization approach, namely SA2CO, to address the coordinated dispatch of the energy storage systems (ESSs) in the ADN. The proposed approach leverages RL's capability to make fast decision and address the model inaccuracies, while optimization methods ensure the ADN security. Furthermore, a hybrid data-driven and expert-experience auxiliary neural network is formulated as a rapid security assessment component in the SA2CO algorithm, enabling dynamic switching between RL and optimization methodologies. Simulation results demonstrate the proposed method's effectiveness and scalability in achieving real-time, safe, and economical dispatch of multiple ESSs in the ADN, surpassing the performance of the state-of-the-art RL and optimization methods.</description>

      <title>A Critical Review of Proton Exchange Membrane Fuel Cells Matter Transports and Voltage Polarisation for Modelling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.13323</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.13323v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Technologies based on the use of hydrogen are promising for future energy requirements in a more sustainable world. Consequently, modelling fuel cells is crucial, for instance, to optimize their control to achieve excellent performance, to test new materials and configurations on a limited budget, or to consider their degradation for improved lifespan. To develop such models, a comprehensive study is required, encompassing both well-established and the latest governing laws on matter transport and voltage polarisation for Proton Exchange Membrane Fuel Cells (PEMFCs). Recent articles often rely on outdated or inappropriate equations, lacking clear explanations regarding their background. Indeed, inconsistent understanding of theoretical and experimental choices or model requirements hinders comprehension and contributes to the misuse of these equations. Additionally, specific researches are needed to construct more accurate models. This study aims to offer a comprehensive understanding of the current state-of-the-art in PEMFC modeling. It clarifies the corresponding governing equations, their usage conditions, and assumptions, thus serving as a foundation for future developments. The presented laws and equations are applicable in most multi-dimensional, dynamic, and two-phase PEMFC models.</description>

      <title>Assessing the techno-economic benefits of LEMs for different grid topologies and prosumer shares</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.13330</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.13330v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The shift towards decentralized and renewable energy sources has introduced significant challenges to traditional power systems, necessitating innovative market designs. Local energy markets present a viable solution for integrating distributed energy resources such as photovoltaic systems, electric vehicles, and heat pumps within various grid topologies. This study investigates the techno-economic benefits of local energy markets compared to conventional market designs, focusing on their impact on average energy prices and operational peak power, using a self-developed agent-based energy system simulation tool. Through comprehensive simulations across the countryside, rural, suburban, and urban grid topologies with varying penetration levels of the distributed energy resources, totaling 400 simulation setups, we demonstrate that local energy markets can enhance economic efficiency and grid stability with 99 % of the scenarios boasting lower average energy prices and 80 % lower operational peak power levels. Our findings suggest that local energy markets can play a role in the future energy system, especially in areas with high shares of PV and HP, provided that additional infrastructure, management costs, and bureaucratic complexity are kept to a minimum.</description>

      <title>Dynamic Input Mapping Inversion for Algebraic Loop-Free Control in Hydraulic Actuators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.13389</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.13389v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The application of nonlinear control schemes to electro-hydraulic actuators often requires several alterations in the design of the controllers during their implementation. This is to overcome the challenges that frequently arise from the inherent complexity of such control algorithms owning to model nonlinearities. Moreover, advanced control solutions for this type of systems often introduce input algebraic loops and chatter, which considerably degrade the tracking performance. This study presents a nonlinear control architecture for hydraulic actuators that comprises low-complexity modules, based on well-established designs that facilitate robust high performance in tracking without introducing the aforementioned limitations. Specifically, the proposed solution consists of two variants of a position controller for the hydraulic cylinder and a dynamic input-mapping inversion module to avoid algebraic loops in the control input. The stability of the closed-loop system is analysed using arguments from Lyapunov theory for cascaded non-autonomous nonlinear systems. The effectiveness of the proposed solution is evaluated on a high-fidelity simulator of a wind turbine pitch system. Appropriate quantitative metrics are finally defined to evaluate the closed-loop system performance in comparison to state-of-the-art nonlinear design.</description>

      <title>Cooperative Visual Convex Area Coverage using a Tessellation-free Strategy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.13422</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.13422v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The objective in this article is to develop a control strategy for coverage purposes of a convex region by a fleet of Mobile Aerial Agents (MAAs). Each MAA is equipped with a downward facing camera that senses a convex portion of the area while its altitude flight is constrained. Rather than relying on typical Voronoi-like tessellations of the area to be covered, a scheme focusing on the assignment to each MAA of certain parts of the mosaic of the current covered area is proposed. A gradient ascent algorithm is then employed to increase in a monotonic manner the covered area by the MAA-fleet. Simulation studies are offered to illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed scheme.</description>

      <title>Byzantine-Resilient Output Optimization of Multiagent via Self-Triggered Hybrid Detection Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.13454</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.13454v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: How to achieve precise distributed optimization despite unknown attacks, especially the Byzantine attacks, is one of the critical challenges for multiagent systems. This paper addresses a distributed resilient optimization for linear heterogeneous multi-agent systems faced with adversarial threats. We establish a framework aimed at realizing resilient optimization for continuous-time systems by incorporating a novel self-triggered hybrid detection approach. The proposed hybrid detection approach is able to identify attacks on neighbors using both error thresholds and triggering intervals, thereby optimizing the balance between effective attack detection and the reduction of excessive communication triggers. Through using an edge-based adaptive self-triggered approach, each agent can receive its neighbors' information and determine whether these information is valid. If any neighbor prove invalid, each normal agent will isolate that neighbor by disconnecting communication along that specific edge. Importantly, our adaptive algorithm guarantees the accuracy of the optimization solution even when an agent is isolated by its neighbors.</description>

      <title>Performance Analysis of a Photovoltaic System with Thermoelectric Generator and Phase Change Material; An Experimental Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.13455</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.13455v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study explores the integration of thermoelectric generators (TEGs) and phase change materials (PCMs) to enhance the efficiency of photovoltaic (PV) panels in high-temperature conditions. An AP-PM-20 Polycrystalline PV panel, SP-1848-27145 Bismuth Telluride TEG, and paraffin wax PCM in an aluminum container were used. Four configurations were tested: standalone PV, PV-PCM, PV-TEG-PCM, and PV-PCM-TEG, under identical conditions from 10:30 AM to 6:00 PM at 25-minute intervals. Data on PV and TEG voltage, current, and solar irradiance were collected and analyzed. The results show significant performance improvements: the PV-PCM configuration boosted power output by 68.04%, while PV-PCM-TEG and PV-TEG-PCM configurations improved efficiency by 43.06% and 37.51%, respectively. Efficiency gains relative to the standalone PV system were 33.33% for PV-PCM, 25.76% for PV-PCM-TEG, and 21.21% for PV-TEG-PCM, demonstrating the effectiveness of PCMs and TEGs in enhancing PV performance.</description>

      <title>Methodologies for offshore wind power plants stability analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.13521</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.13521v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The development of larger Offshore Wind Power Plants (OWPPs) is moving towards multi-vendor setups, ultimately aiming to establish Energy hubs. These structures are characterized by installations from different vendors sharing the same connection or closely interconnected points. Control interactions among Wind Turbine (WT) converters and power systems have been detected, and this critical phenomenon can significantly impact the dynamic stability of the system. Various stability analysis methods have been proposed to analyze the interactions between OWPPs at the Point-of-Connection (PoC) and the power system. However, stability studies rarely consider the complex offshore transmission system behind the PoC. Generally, the overall OWPP is blamed for the instability. However, since it is a complex system, it is important to understand which part of the OWPP behind the PoC is causing the problem or is likely to become unstable under certain conditions. Therefore, this paper provides a detailed overview of the advantages and limitations of the current system screening indexes used to design the OWPP, and the stability analysis methods. Each method is discussed, and the appropriate methods, depending on OWPP structure, are evaluated and discussed. The analysis indicates that a combination of time domain and frequency domain methods is necessary for enhancing the definition of stability boundaries.</description>

      <title>Design of Unitless Normalized Measure of Nonlinearity for State Estimation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.13539</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.13539v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The paper deals with measures of nonlinearity. In state estimation, they are utilized i) to select a suitable state estimation algorithm by assessing the nonlinearity of a system model, ii) to adapt the estimation algorithm structure or parameters, or iii) to indicate the possible effect of strong nonlinearity that leads to estimate credibility loss. This paper summarizes the state of the art of nonlinearity measures, focusing on the mean-square-error-based measure of nonlinearity. Its weak point related to unit selection is illustrated, and based on this, requirements for a new measure of nonlinearity are formulated. A new nonlinearity measure that is both unitless and normalized is designed. Its properties are demonstrated using numerical tracking experiments.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.13700v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we explore the property of eventual exponential positivity (EEP) in complex matrices. We show that this property holds for the real part of the matrix exponential for a certain class of complex matrices. Next, we present the relation between the spectral properties of the Laplacian matrix of an unsigned digraph with complex edge-weights and the property of real EEP. Finally, we show that the Laplacian flow system of a network is stable when the negated Laplacian admits real EEP. Numerical examples are presented to demonstrate the results.</description>

      <title>Assessing the Optimistic Bias in the Natural Inflow Forecasts: A Call for Model Monitoring in Brazil</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.13763</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.13763v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Hydroelectricity accounted for roughly 66% of the total generation in Brazil in 2023 and addressed most of the intermittency of wind and solar generation. Thus, one of the most important steps in the operation planning of this country is the forecast of the natural inflow energy (NIE) time series, an approximation of the energetic value of the water inflows. To manage water resources over time, the Brazilian system operator performs long-term forecasts for the NIE to assess the water values through long-term hydrothermal planning models, which are then used to define the short-term merit order in day-ahead scheduling. Therefore, monitoring optimistic bias in NIE forecasts is crucial to prevent an optimistic view of future system conditions and subsequent riskier storage policies. In this article, we investigate and showcase strong evidence of an optimistic bias in the official NIE forecasts, with predicted values consistently exceeding the observations over the past 12 years in the two main subsystems (Southeast and Northeast). Rolling window out-of-sample tests conducted with real data demonstrate that the official forecast model exhibits a statistically significant bias of 6%, 13%, 18%, and 23% for 1, 6, 12, and 24 steps ahead in the Southeast subsystem, and 19%, 57%, 80%, and 108% in the Northeast.</description>

      <title>AI-Driven Autonomous Control of Proton-Boron Fusion Reactors Using Backpropagation Neural Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.12871</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.12871v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Proton-boron (p-11B) fusion presents a promising path towards sustainable, neutron-free energy generation. However, its implementation is hindered by extreme operational conditions, such as plasma temperatures exceeding billions of degrees and the complexity of controlling high-energy particles. Traditional control systems face significant challenges in managing the highly dynamic and non-linear behavior of the plasma. In this paper, we propose a novel approach utilizing backpropagation-based neural networks to autonomously control key parameters in a proton-boron fusion reactor. Our method leverages real-time feedback and learning from physical data to adapt to changing plasma conditions, offering a potential breakthrough in stable and efficient p-11B fusion. Furthermore, we expand on the scalability and generalization of our approach to other fusion systems and future AI technologies.</description>

      <title>Kapitza-Inspired Stabilization of Non-Foster Circuits via Time Modulations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.12976</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.12976v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: With his formal analysis in 1951, the physicist Pyotr Kapitza demonstrated that an inverted pendulum with an externally vibrating base can be stable in its upper position, thus overcoming the force of gravity. Kapitza's work is an example that an originally unstable system can become stable after a minor perturbation of its properties or initial conditions is applied. Inspired by his ideas, we show how non-Foster circuits can be stabilized with the application of external \textit{electrical vibration}, i.e., time modulations. Non-Foster circuits are highly appreciated in the engineering community since their bandwidth characteristics are not limited by passive-circuits bounds. Unfortunately, non-Foster circuits are usually unstable and they must be stabilized prior to operation. Here, we focus on the study of non-Foster $L(t)C$ circuits with time-varying inductors and time-invariant negative capacitors. We find an intrinsic connection between Kapitza's inverted pendulum and non-Foster $L(t)C$ resonators. Moreover, we show how positive time-varying modulations of $L(t)&gt;0$ can overcome and stabilize non-Foster negative capacitances $C&lt;0$. These findings open up an alternative manner of stabilizing electric circuits with the use of time modulations, and lay the groundwork for application of, what we coin \textit{Vibrational Electromagnetics}, in more complex media.</description>

      <title>GyroCopter: Differential Bearing Measuring Trajectory Planner for Tracking and Localizing Radio Frequency Sources</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.13081</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.13081v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Autonomous aerial vehicles can provide efficient and effective solutions for radio frequency (RF) source tracking and localizing problems with applications ranging from wildlife conservation to search and rescue operations. Existing lightweight, low-cost, bearing measurements-based methods with a single antenna-receiver sensor system configurations necessitate in situ rotations, leading to substantial measurement acquisition times restricting searchable areas and number of measurements. We propose a GyroCopter for the task. Our approach plans the trajectory of a multi-rotor unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) whilst utilizing UAV flight dynamics to execute a constant gyration motion to derive "pseudo-bearing" measurements to track RF sources. The gyration-based pseudo-bearing approach: i) significantly reduces the limitations associated with in situ rotation bearing; while ii) capitalizing on the simplicity, affordability, and lightweight nature of signal strength measurement acquisition hardware to estimate bearings. This method distinguishes itself from other pseudo-bearing approaches by eliminating the need for additional hardware to maintain simplicity, lightweightness and cost-effectiveness. To validate our approach, we derived the optimal rotation speed and conducted extensive simulations and field missions with our GyroCopter to track and localize multiple RF sources. The results confirm the effectiveness of our method, highlighting its potential as a practical and rapid solution for RF source localization tasks.</description>

      <title>Optimal Covariance Steering of Linear Stochastic Systems with Hybrid Transitions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.13222</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.13222v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This work addresses the problem of optimally steering the state covariance of a linear stochastic system from an initial to a target, subject to hybrid transitions. The nonlinear and discontinuous jump dynamics complicate the control design for hybrid systems. Under uncertainties, stochastic jump timing and state variations further intensify this challenge. This work aims to regulate the hybrid system's state trajectory to stay close to a nominal deterministic one, despite uncertainties and noises. We address this problem by directly controlling state covariances around a mean trajectory, and this problem is termed the Hybrid Covariance Steering (H-CS) problem. The jump dynamics are approximated to the first order by leveraging the Saltation Matrix. When the jump dynamics are nonsingular, we derive an analytical closed-form solution to the H-CS problem. For general jump dynamics with possible singularity and changes in the state dimensions, we reformulate the problem into a convex optimization over path distributions by leveraging Schrodinger's Bridge duality to the smooth covariance control problem. The covariance propagation at hybrid events is enforced as equality constraints to handle singularity issues. The proposed convex framework scales linearly with the number of jump events, ensuring efficient, optimal solutions. This work thus provides a computationally efficient solution to the general H-CS problem. Numerical experiments are conducted to validate the proposed method.</description>

      <title>Railway LiDAR semantic segmentation based on intelligent semi-automated data annotation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.13383</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.13383v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Automated vehicles rely on an accurate and robust perception of the environment. Similarly to automated cars, highly automated trains require an environmental perception. Although there is a lot of research based on either camera or LiDAR sensors in the automotive domain, very few contributions for this task exist yet for automated trains. Additionally, no public dataset or described approach for a 3D LiDAR semantic segmentation in the railway environment exists yet. Thus, we propose an approach for a point-wise 3D semantic segmentation based on the 2DPass network architecture using scans and images jointly. In addition, we present a semi-automated intelligent data annotation approach, which we use to efficiently and accurately label the required dataset recorded on a railway track in Germany. To improve performance despite a still small number of labeled scans, we apply an active learning approach to intelligently select scans for the training dataset. Our contributions are threefold: We annotate rail data including camera and LiDAR data from the railway environment, transfer label the raw LiDAR point clouds using an image segmentation network, and train a state-of-the-art 3D LiDAR semantic segmentation network efficiently leveraging active learning. The trained network achieves good segmentation results with a mean IoU of 71.48% of 9 classes.</description>

      <title>Linear-Threshold Network Models for Describing and Analyzing Brain Dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.13710</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.13710v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Over the past two decades, an increasing array of control-theoretic methods have been used to study the brain as a complex dynamical system and better understand its structure-function relationship. This article provides an overview on one such family of methods, based on the linear-threshold rate (LTR) dynamics, which arises when modeling the spiking activity of neuronal populations and their impact on each other. LTR dynamics exhibit a wide range of behaviors based on network topologies and inputs, including mono- and multi-stability, limit cycles, and chaos, allowing it to be used to model many complex brain processes involving fast and slow inhibition, multiple time and spatial scales, different types of neural behavior, and higher-order interactions. Here we investigate how the versatility of LTR dynamics paired with concepts and tools from systems and control can provide a computational theory for explaining the dynamical mechanisms enabling different brain processes. Specifically, we illustrate stability and stabilization properties of LTR dynamics and how they are related to goal-driven selective attention, multistability and its relationship with declarative memory, and bifurcations and oscillations and their role in modeling seizure dynamics in epilepsy. We conclude with a discussion on additional properties of LTR dynamics and an outlook on other brain processess that for which they might be play a similar role.</description>

      <title>Adaptive Subsampling and Learned Model Improve Spatiotemporal Resolution of Tactile Skin</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.13847</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.13847v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: High-speed tactile arrays are essential for real-time robotic control in unstructured environments, but high pixel counts limit readout rates of most large tactile arrays to below 100Hz. We introduce ACTS - adaptive compressive tactile subsampling - a method that efficiently samples tactile matrices and reconstructs interactions using sparse recovery and a learned tactile dictionary. Tested on a 1024-pixel sensor array (32x32), ACTS increased frame rates by 18X compared to raster scanning, with minimal error. For the first time in large-area tactile skin, we demonstrate rapid object classification within 20ms of contact, high-speed projectile detection, ricochet angle estimation, and deformation tracking through enhanced spatiotemporal resolution. Our method can be implemented in firmware, upgrading existing low-cost, flexible, and robust tactile arrays into high-resolution systems for large-area spatiotemporal touch sensing.</description>

Abstract: Online learning algorithms for dynamical systems provide finite time guarantees for control in the presence of sequentially revealed cost functions. We pose the classical linear quadratic tracking problem in the framework of online optimization where the time-varying reference state is unknown a priori and is revealed after the applied control input. We show the equivalence of this problem to the control of linear systems subject to adversarial disturbances and propose a novel online gradient descent based algorithm to achieve efficient tracking in finite time. We provide a dynamic regret upper bound scaling linearly with the path length of the reference trajectory and a numerical example to corroborate the theoretical guarantees.</description>

      <title>Fault Diagnosis and Prognosis Capabilities for Wind Turbine Hydraulic Pitch Systems</title>

      <description>arXiv:2312.09018v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Wind energy is the leading non-hydro renewable technology. Increasing reliability is a key factor in reducing the downtime of high-power wind turbines installed in remote off-shore places, where maintenance is costly and less reactive. Defects in the pitch system are responsible for up to 20% of a wind turbine downtime.Thus, monitoring such defects is essential for avoiding it. This paper presents a generic assessment of the diagnosis capabilities in hydraulic pitch systems, which are used in high-power wind turbines. A mathematical model of the non-linear system dynamics is presented along with a description of the most frequent faults that occur. Structural analysis is used to assess which defects can be detected in the pitch system. The structural properties are furthermore explored to investigate the possibility of reducing the amount of sensors without compromising the fault diagnosis capabilities. Robustness to model uncertainty is finally addressed and generic principles for estimating the detectable magnitude of wear and tear are presented.</description>

      <title>3D Guidance Law for Flexible Target Enclosing with Inherent Safety</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.16312</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.16312v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we address the problem of enclosing an arbitrarily moving target in three dimensions by a single pursuer while ensuring the pursuer's safety by preventing collisions with the target. The proposed guidance strategy steers the pursuer to a safe region of space surrounding and excluding the target, allowing it to maintain a certain distance from the latter while offering greater flexibility in positioning and converging to any orbit within this safe zone. We leverage the concept of the Lyapunov Barrier Function as a powerful tool to constrain the distance between the pursuer and the target within asymmetric bounds, thereby ensuring the pursuer's safety within the predefined region. Further, we demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed guidance law in managing arbitrarily maneuvering targets and other uncertainties (such as vehicle/autopilot dynamics and external disturbances) by enabling the pursuer to consistently achieve stable global enclosing behaviors by switching between stable enclosing trajectories within the safe region whenever necessary, even in response to aggressive target maneuvers. To attest to the merits of our work, we conduct experimental tests with various plant models, including a high-fidelity quadrotor model within Software-in-the-loop (SITL) simulations, encompassing various challenging target maneuver scenarios and requiring only relative information for successful execution.</description>

      <title>Deep DeePC: Data-enabled predictive control with low or no online optimization using deep learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.16338</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.16338v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Data-enabled predictive control (DeePC) is a data-driven control algorithm that utilizes data matrices to form a non-parametric representation of the underlying system, predicting future behaviors and generating optimal control actions. DeePC typically requires solving an online optimization problem, the complexity of which is heavily influenced by the amount of data used, potentially leading to expensive online computation. In this paper, we leverage deep learning to propose a highly computationally efficient DeePC approach for general nonlinear processes, referred to as Deep DeePC. Specifically, a deep neural network is employed to learn the DeePC vector operator, which is an essential component of the non-parametric representation of DeePC. This neural network is trained offline using historical open-loop input and output data of the nonlinear process. With the trained neural network, the Deep DeePC framework is formed for online control implementation. At each sampling instant, this neural network directly outputs the DeePC operator, eliminating the need for online optimization as conventional DeePC. The optimal control action is obtained based on the DeePC operator updated by the trained neural network. To address constrained scenarios, a constraint handling scheme is further proposed and integrated with the Deep DeePC to handle hard constraints during online implementation. The efficacy and superiority of the proposed Deep DeePC approach are demonstrated using two benchmark process examples.</description>

      <title>Improved Small-Signal L2 Gain Analysis for Nonlinear Systems</title>

      <description>arXiv:2309.08034v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: TheL2-gain characterizes a dynamical system's input-output properties, but can be difficult to determine for nonlinear systems. Previous work designed a nonconvex optimization problem to simultaneously search for a continuous piecewise affine (CPA) storage function and an upper bound on the small-signal L2-gain of a dynamical system over a triangulated region about the origin. This work improves upon those results by establishing a tighter upper-bound on a system's gain using a convex optimization problem. By reformulating the relationship between the Hamilton-Jacobi inequality and L2-gain as a linear matrix inequality and then developing novel LMI error bounds for a triangulation, tighter gain bounds are derived and computed more efficiently. Additionally, a combined quadratic and CPA storage function is considered to expand the nonlinear systems this optimization problem is applicable to. Numerical results demonstrate the tighter upper bound on a dynamical system's gain.</description>

      <title>Active risk aversion in SIS epidemics on networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.02204</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.02204v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present and analyze an actively controlled Susceptible-Infected-Susceptible (actSIS) model of interconnected populations to study how risk aversion strategies, such as social distancing, affect network epidemics. A population using a risk aversion strategy reduces its contact rate with other populations when it perceives an increase in infection risk. The network actSIS model relies on two distinct networks. One is a physical contact network that defines which populations come into contact with which other populations and thus how infection spreads. The other is a communication network, such as an online social network, that defines which populations observe the infection level of which other populations and thus how information spreads. We prove that the model, with these two networks and populations using risk aversion strategies, exhibits a transcritical bifurcation in which an endemic equilibrium emerges. For regular graphs, we prove that the endemic infection level is uniform across populations and reduced by the risk aversion strategy, relative to the network SIS endemic level. We show that when communication is sufficiently sparse, this initially stable equilibrium loses stability in a secondary bifurcation. Simulations show that a new stable solution emerges with nonuniform infection levels.</description>

      <title>Concurrent Design Optimization of Powertrain Component Modules in a Family of Electric Vehicles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.03167</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.03167v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present a modeling and optimization framework to design powertrains for a family of electric vehicles, focusing on the concurrent sizing of their motors and batteries. Whilst tailoring these component modules to each individual vehicle type can minimize energy consumption, it can result in high production costs due to the variety of component modules to be realized for the family of vehicles, driving the Total Costs of Ownership (TCO) high. Against this backdrop, we explore modularity and standardization strategies whereby we jointly design unique motor and battery modules to be installed in all the vehicles in the family, using a different number of these modules when needed. Such an approach results in higher production volumes of the same component module, entailing significantly lower manufacturing costs due to Economy-of-Scale (EoS) effects, and hence a potentially lower TCO for the family of vehicles. To solve the resulting one-size-fits-all problem, we instantiate a nested framework consisting of an inner convex optimization routine which jointly optimizes the modules' sizes and the powertrain operation of the entire family, for given driving cycles and modules' multiplicities. Likewise, we devise an outer loop comparing each configuration to identify the minimum-TCO solution with global optimality guarantees. Finally, we showcase our framework on a case study for the Tesla vehicle family in a benchmark design problem, considering the Model S, Model 3, Model X, and Model Y. Our results show that, compared to an individually tailored design, the application of our concurrent design optimization framework achieves a significant reduction of the production costs for a minimal increase in operational costs, ultimately lowering the family TCO in the benchmark design problem by 3.5\%.</description>

      <title>Chattering Phenomena in Time-Optimal Control for High-Order Chain-of-Integrator Systems with Full State Constraints (Extended Version)</title>

Abstract: Time-optimal control for high-order chain-of-integrator systems with full state constraints remains an open and challenging problem within the discipline of optimal control. The behavior of optimal control in high-order problems lacks precise characterization, and even the existence of the chattering phenomenon, i.e., the control switches for infinitely many times over a finite period, remains unknown and overlooked. This paper establishes a theoretical framework for chattering phenomena in the considered problem, providing novel findings on the uniqueness of state constraints inducing chattering, the upper bound of switching times in an unconstrained arc during chattering, and the convergence of states and costates to the chattering limit point. For the first time, this paper proves the existence of the chattering phenomenon in the considered problem. The chattering optimal control for 4th-order problems with velocity constraints is precisely solved, providing an approach to plan time-optimal snap-limited trajectories. Other cases of order $n\leq4$ are proved not to allow chattering. The conclusions rectify a longstanding misconception in the industry concerning the time-optimality of S-shaped trajectories with minimal switching times.</description>

      <title>Wireless Resource Optimization in Hybrid Semantic/Bit Communication Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.04162</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.04162v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recently, semantic communication (SemCom) has shown great potential in significant resource savings and efficient information exchanges, thus naturally introducing a novel and practical cellular network paradigm where two modes of SemCom and conventional bit communication (BitCom) coexist. Nevertheless, the involved wireless resource management becomes rather complicated and challenging, given the unique background knowledge matching and time-consuming semantic coding requirements in SemCom. To this end, this paper jointly investigates user association (UA), mode selection (MS), and bandwidth allocation (BA) problems in a hybrid semantic/bit communication network (HSB-Net). Concretely, we first identify a unified performance metric of message throughput for both SemCom and BitCom links. Next, we specially develop a knowledge matching-aware two-stage tandem packet queuing model and theoretically derive the average packet loss ratio and queuing latency. Combined with practical constraints, we then formulate a joint optimization problem for UA, MS, and BA to maximize the overall message throughput of HSB-Net. Afterward, we propose an optimal resource management strategy by utilizing a Lagrange primal-dual transformation method and a preference list-based heuristic algorithm with polynomial-time complexity. Numerical results not only demonstrate the accuracy of our analytical queuing model, but also validate the performance superiority of our proposed strategy compared with different benchmarks.</description>
