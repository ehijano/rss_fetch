      <title>Individual and cooperative superexchange enhancement in cuprates</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.17596</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.17596v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: It is now widely accepted that the antiferromagnetic coupling within high temperature superconductors strongly exhibits a profound correlation with the upper limit of superconducting transition temperature these materials can reach. Thus, accurately calculating the positive and negative mechanisms that influence magnetic coupling in specific materials is crucial for the exploration of superconductivity at higher temperatures. Nevertheless, it is notoriously difficult to establish a complete description of electron correlations employing ab initio theories because of the large number of orbitals involved. In this study, we tackle the challenge of achieving high-level ab initio wave function theory calculations, which allow an explicit treatment of electron correlations associated with a large number of high-energy orbitals. We elucidate the atomic-shell-wise contributions to the superexchange coupling in the lanthanum cuprate, including individual effects of high-energy orbitals (Cu 4d, 5d, 4f, 5p) and cooperative effects between the core and these high-energy orbitals. Specifically, the prominent contributions from Cu 4d, 5d, 4f and 5p give rise to a rich collection of previously unexamined superexchange channels. We propose a p-d-f model to universally account for the contributions of high-energy orbitals at copper sites. Our calculations and physical rationalizations offer a more robust theoretical foundation for investigating cuprate-type high-temperature superconductors.</description>

      <title>Spin disorder state induced by Mg$^{2+}$ doping in a Kitaev material Na$_{3}$Co$_{2}$SbO$_{6}$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.17948</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.17948v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Due to the dominant Kitaev exchange interactions, the cobaltate, Na$_{3}$Co$_{2}$SbO$_{6}$, has been considered to be approximate to the Kitaev quantum spin liquid (QSL). Here, we investigate both magnetic dilution and chemical pressure effects of Na$_{3}$Co$_{2}$SbO$_{6}$ by the substitutions of Mg$^{2+}$ for Co$^{2+}$ through the structural, optical, magnetic and thermodynamic measurements. No structural transition has been observed, and the bandgaps remain constant in all doping levels. Combining with the magnetic and thermodynamic measurements, we find that the antiferromagnetic transition temperature is continuously suppressed with increasing Mg doping levels and completely disappears at $x=0.2$. Interestingly, when the doping level $x$ is larger than 0.2, neither long-range magnetic order nor spin glass state has been detected, and the specific heat has a residual linear term at zero field. All features indicate that Na$_{3}$(Co$_{2-x}$Mg$_{x}$)SbO$_{6}$ system enters into a novel spin disorder (NSD) state.</description>

      <title>Universal Optical Conductivity from Quantum Geometry in Quadratic Band-Touching Semimetals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.18372</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.18372v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Exploring the quantum geometric properties of solids beyond their topological aspects has become a key focus in current solid-state physics research. We derive the geometric formula for optical conductivity from the quantum metric tensor, applicable to the low-energy regime. This general formulation also depends on the detailed shape of the band dispersion in addition to the geometric properties of the Bloch wave function. We demonstrate, however, that for quadratic band-touching (QBT) semimetals, the optical conductivity simplifies to $\sigma = (e^2/8\hbar)d^2_\mathrm{max}$ when the light frequency exceeds a critical threshold, where $d_\mathrm{max}$ represents the maximum Hilbert-Schmidt quantum distance around the band-crossing point. This result indicates that the optical conductivity of QBT semimetals is universal and determined entirely by quantum geometry, independent of other details of the band structure. Furthermore, under time-reversal and rotational symmetries, $d_\mathrm{max}$ is restricted to discrete values of 0 or 1, leading to a quantized universal optical conductivity. Through first-principles calculations, we show that our findings are applicable to real materials, including bilayer graphene, Pd$_3$P$_2$S$_8$, and other realistic material candidates. Our work underscores the critical role of quantum geometry in governing optical properties, which can be probed through standard optical methods.</description>

      <title>A Promising Method for Strongly Correlated Electrons in Two Dimensions: Gutzwiller-Guided Density Matrix Renormalization Group</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.18374</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.18374v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The study of strongly correlated electron systems remains a fundamental challenge in condensed matter physics, particularly in two-dimensional (2D) systems hosting various exotic phases of matter including quantum spin liquids, unconventional superconductivity, and topological orders. Although Density Matrix Renormalization Group (DMRG) has established itself as a pillar for simulating one-dimensional quantum systems, its application to 2D systems has long been hindered by the notorious ``local minimum'' issues. Recent methodological breakthroughs have addressed this challenge by incorporating Gutzwiller-projected wavefunctions as initial states for DMRG simulations. This hybrid approach, referred to as DMRG guided by Gutzwiller-projected wave functions (or Gutzwiller-guided DMRG), has demonstrated remarkable improvements in accuracy, efficiency, and the ability to explore exotic quantum phases such as topological orders. This review examines the theoretical underpinnings of this approach, details key algorithmic developments, and showcases its applications in recent studies of 2D quantum systems.</description>

      <title>Quantum Geometry and Many-Body Landau-Zener Tunneling in Time-dependent Quantum Systems with Instantaneous Quantum Integrability</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.18396</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.18396v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study quantum geometric effects in time-dependent quantum many-body systems quenched from integrable systems through a unitary transformation whose phase operator is linear in time. We establish a theorem stating that the Berry connection matrix thus all associated geometric quantities of the time-dependent many-body system, can be precisely characterized by excitations up to two-particle processes derived from the quantum integrable system. This geometric characterization provides a powerful lens for analyzing dynamical transitions in driven many-body settings. To illustrate the many-body geometric influence, we analyze a prototypical time-dependent Ising chain subjected to both a small longitudinal field and a slowly rotating transverse field, whose low-energy physics in the scaling limit is instantaneously governed by the quantum $E_8$ integrable field theory. Focusing on the quantum geometric potential (QGP), we show the QGP continuously suppresses the instantaneous energy gaps with decreasing longitudinal field, thereby enhancing many-body Landau-Zener tunneling as evidenced by the Loschmidt echo and its associated spectral entropy. The critical threshold for the longitudinal field strength is determined, where the spectral entropy linearly increases with system size and exhbits hyperscaling behavior when approaching to the threshold. When the longitudinal field passes the threshold and decreases toward zero, the QGP continuously leads to vanishing instantaneous energy gaps involving more low-energy excitations, resulting in increasing spectral entropy indicative of many-body Landau-Zener tunneling. Our results unveil telltale quantum geometric signatures in time-dependent many-body systems, elucidating the intricate interplay between quantum geometry and dynamics.</description>

      <title>Triangular lattice magnet GdGa$_2$ with short-period spin cycloids and possible skyrmion phases</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.18457</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.18457v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The two-dimensional triangular lattice (TAL) is a model system of magnetic frustration and competing interactions, where skyrmion spin vortices can be induced by a vertical magnetic field $B$. We target the binary compound GdGa$_2$ with an undistorted TAL of Gd$^{3+}$ Heisenberg moments. At higher temperature ($T &gt; 5$ K, $B = 0$, phase II), we reveal the cycloidal spin textures in GdGa$_2$ via resonant elastic X-ray scattering (REXS). Further, a transition with strong magneto-elastic response occurs when cooling into the zero-field ground state ($T &lt; 5$ K, phase I). We also report the thermodynamic phase boundaries of $B$-induced magnetic A-phases, which are suppressed by an in-plane magnetic field and which have enhanced resistivity due to the partial opening of a charge gap. In analogy to Gd$_2$PdSi$_3$ and GdRu$_2$Si$_2$, these phases may represent a superposition of various cycloids, possibly a N\'eel skyrmion lattice. Our work lays the basis for further studies of the magnetic phase diagram of GdGa$_2$.</description>

      <title>Nanometric skyrmion lattice from anisotropic exchange interactions in a centrosymmetric host</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.18632</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.18632v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Skyrmion formation in centrosymmetric magnets without Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interactions was originally predicted from unbiased numerical techniques. However, no attempt has yet been made, by comparison to a real material, to determine the salient interaction terms and model parameters driving spin-vortex formation. We identify a Hamiltonian with anisotropic exchange couplings, local ion anisotropy, and four-spin interactions, which is generally applicable to this class of compounds. In the representative system Gd3Ru4Al12, anisotropic exchange drives a fragile balance between helical, skyrmion lattice, and transverse conical (cycloidal) orders. The model is severely constrained by the experimentally observed collapse of the SkL with a small in-plane magnetic field. For the zero-field helical state, we further anticipate that spins can be easily rotated out of the spiral plane by a tilted magnetic field or applied current.</description>

      <title>Screening in Hubbard models with long-range interactions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.18639</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.18639v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We provide solid evidence for the long-standing presumption that model Hamiltonians with short-range interactions faithfully reproduce the physics of the long-range Coulomb interaction in real materials. For this aim, we address a generic Hubbard model that captures the quantum phase transitions between metal, Mott insulator, and charge-density-wave insulator, in the absence of Fermi-surface nesting. By comparing the quantum phase diagrams for the $1/r$-Hubbard model on a half-filled chain with nearest-neighbor and $1/r$-long-range interactions, we argue that the inclusion of long-range interactions is not crucial for a proper description of interacting many-electron systems. To this end, we employ the Density Matrix Renormalization Group method on finite lattices and antiperiodic boundary conditions to determine the quantum phase transitions between the metallic Luttinger liquid for weak interactions, the Mott-Hubbard insulator for dominant on-site interactions, and the charge-density wave insulator for dominant inter-site interactions. The two phase diagrams qualitatively agree inasmuch as the quantum phase transitions are continuous in both cases. Moreover, simple Hartree-Fock theory and the atomic limit provide renormalization factors that allow us to quantitatively map the two phase diagrams onto each other. As a practical advantage, our findings imply that computational efforts can be reduced tremendously by using models with short-range interactions only.</description>

      <title>Effective field theory for triple-Q magnetic orders on a hexagonal lattice</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.18649</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.18649v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We develop a comprehensive Ginzburg-Landau theory describing triple-Q magnetic orders on hexagonal lattices, focusing on $O(N)$ models with $N=2$ and $N=3$. Through systematic analysis of symmetry-allowed terms in the free energy, we establish complete phase diagrams governed by competing interaction parameters. Our theory reveals distinct magnetic configurations including single-Q, double-Q, and triple-Q states, each characterized by unique symmetry breaking patterns and collective excitations. The framework provides fundamental insights into complex magnetic orders recently observed in materials such as $\alpha$-RuCl$_3$ and Na$_2$Co$_2$TeO$_6$, where the interplay between geometric frustration and multiple ordering vectors leads to exotic magnetic states. Our results establish clear connections between microscopic interactions, broken symmetries, and experimentally observable properties, offering a powerful tool for understanding and predicting novel magnetic phases in frustrated magnets.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.18885v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider the valence bond solid (VBS) state built of singlet pairs of fundamental representations and projected onto adjoint representations of the exceptional Lie group G$_2$. The two-point correlation function in the VBS state is non-vanishing only for nearest neighbours, but possesses finite string order. We construct a parent Hamiltonian for the VBS state, which constitutes the G$_2$ analog of the famous AKLT chain.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.18936v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate phase transitions in a non-Hermitian Su-Schrieffer-Heeger (SSH) with an imaginary chemical potential via Krylov spread complexity and Krylov fidelity. The spread witnesses the PT-transition for the non-Hermitian Bogoliubov vacuum of the SSH Hamiltonian, where the spectrum goes from purely real to complex (oscillatory dynamics to damped oscillations). In addition, it also witnesses the transition occurring in the PT-broken phase, where the spectrum goes from complex to purely imaginary (damped oscillations to sheer decay). For a purely imaginary spectrum, the Krylov spread fidelity, which measures how the time-dependent spread reaches its stationary state value, serves as a probe of previously undetected dynamical phase transitions.</description>

      <title>Observation of Persistent Zero Modes and Superconducting Vortex Doublets in UTe$_2$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.17450</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.17450v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Superconducting vortices can reveal electron pairing details and nucleate topologically protected states. Yet, vortices of bulk spin-triplet superconductors have never been visualized. Recently, UTe$_2$ has emerged as a nominative spin-triplet superconductor, but its superconducting order parameter is elusive, and whether time-reversal symmetry is broken remains unsettled. Here, we visualize superconducting vortices on the (011) surface of ultra-clean UTe$_2$ single crystals ($T_c=2.1 K$) using scanning tunneling microscopy (STM). We introduce $\frac{d^2 I}{dV^2}$ imaging as an effective method for vortex visualization in superconductors with substantial residual zero-energy density of states (DOS), as in UTe$_2$. Anisotropic single-flux-quantum vortices, with coherence lengths of $\sim$ 12 nm (4 nm) parallel (perpendicular) to the a-axis, form a triangular vortex lattice (VL) under small out-of-plane magnetic fields. The vortex size decreases at higher fields, suggesting multi-band superconductivity. The robustness of vortex structures and VL against magnetic field polarity and cooling history strongly supports time-reversal invariant superconductivity. Spatially non-splitting and spectroscopically narrow zero-bias peaks (ZBPs) of differential conductance at vortex cores (VCs) persist up $8T$, well beyond the Pauli limit ($3.9T$), consistent with Majorana zero modes (MZMs) in a topological vortex line protected by a combination of mirror, time-reversal, and particle-hole symmetries. Close examination of vortex structures reveals a mirror-asymmetric doublet $--$ one with a singular core and another with an enhanced energy gap. Such unconventional vortices in a non-chiral $p$-wave superconductor could originate from the induction of a subdominant order parameter close to the VCs.</description>

      <title>Long-range magnetic perturbations at Bi2Te3/Cr2Te3 interfaces induced by chemical diffusion and proximity effects</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.17568</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.17568v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The heterointerface between topological insulators and magnetic materials provides a crucial platform for investigating exotic electronic and magnetic phases, with implications for both fundamental studies and potential applications. A key challenge is determining the spatial extent of magnetic perturbation across the interface. In this study, we grew Bi2Te3 films with mixed thicknesses of 5 and 6 quintuple layers (QLs) on a thick ferromagnetic Cr2Te3 film. Chemical analysis indicates gradual Cr diffusion across the interface into Bi2Te3, reaching up to the 4th QL, while the 5th and 6th QL remain free of Cr. Despite the absence of direct Cr incorporation, quasiparticle interference imaging using spectroscopic scanning tunneling microscopy reveals strong backscattering on the 5th QL surface. This suggests an intrinsic magnetic proximity effect, which breaks time-reversal symmetry without magnetic doping, extending into the 5th QLs. Although variations may exist across different systems, the large magnetic perturbation length scale observed here is a valuable guiding principle for engineering exotic electronic and magnetic states at heterointerfaces between topological insulators and magnetic materials.</description>

Abstract: The intermetallic quasi-one-dimensional binary superconductor V$_2$Ga$_5$ was recently found to exhibit a topologically nontrivial normal state, making it a natural candidate for a topological superconductor (TSC). By combining dc-magnetization, nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR), and muon-spin rotation ({$\mu$SR) measurements on high-quality V$_2$Ga$_5$ single crystals, we investigate the electronic properties of its normal- and superconducting (SC) ground states. NMR measurements in the normal state indicate a strong anisotropy in both the line shifts and the relaxation rates. Such anisotropy persists also in the superconducting state, as shown by the magnetization- and $\mu$SR-spectroscopy results. In the latter case, data collected at different temperatures, pressures, and directions of the magnetic field evidence a fully-gapped, strongly anisotropic superconductivity. At the same time, hydrostatic pressure is shown to only lower the $T_c$ value, but not to change the superfluid density nor its temperature dependence. Lastly, we discuss the search for topological signatures in the normal state of V$_2$Ga$_5$, as well as a peak splitting in the FFT of the $\mu$SR spectrum, possibly related to an unconventional vortex lattice. Our results suggest that V$_2$Ga$_5$ is a novel system, whose anisotropy plays a key role in determining its unusual electronic properties.</description>

      <title>Optical signatures of noncentrosymmetric structural distortion in altermagnetic MnTe</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.17742</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.17742v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The hexagonal MnTe is a prime material candidate for altermagnets, an emerging class of magnetic compounds characterized by the nontrivial interplay of antiparallel spin arrangements with their underlying crystal structures. Recognizing precise knowledge of crystal symmetry as the cornerstone of the spin-group classification scheme, we report here a native inversion-symmetry-breaking structural distortion in this compound that has previously been overlooked. Through optical polarimetry experiments and first-principle calculations, we show that MnTe belongs to the noncentrosymmetric $D_{3h}$ group, effectively resolving key inconsistencies in the earlier interpretations of Raman spectroscopy data. Our finding impacts the symmetry analysis of MnTe within the altermagnetic class and sheds light on the mechanism of its magneto-controllable N\'eel order.</description>

      <title>Imaging Odd-Parity Quasiparticle Interference in the Superconductive Surface State of UTe2</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.17761</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.17761v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Although no known material definitely exhibits intrinsic topological superconductivity, where a spin-triplet electron pairing potential $\Delta(k)$ has odd parity, UTe2 is now the leading candidate. Ideally, the parity of $\Delta(k)$ might be established by using Bogoliubov quasiparticle interference (QPI) imaging, a recognized technique for $\Delta(k)$ determination in complex superconductors. However, odd-parity superconductors should support a topological quasiparticle surface band (QSB) on crystal termination surfaces only for energies within the superconductive energy gap. The QPI should then be dominated by the QSB electronic structure and only reveal bulk $\Delta(k)$ characteristics excursively. Here, by using a superconducting scan-tip to achieve $\sim$ 10 $\mu$eV energy resolution QPI for UTe2 studies, we discover and visualize the in-gap quasiparticle interference patterns of its QSB. QPI visualization then yields a characteristic sextet $q_{i}:i$ = 1-6 of interference wavevectors from which we establish QSB dispersions, and their existence only for energies $|E| \leq \Delta_{\text{max}}$ within the range of Fermi momenta projected onto the (0-11) crystal surface. Quantitative evaluation of this sextet $q_{i}$ then demonstrates precisely how the QSB is projected from the subtending bulk Fermi surface. Finally, a novel theoretical framework has been developed to predict the QPI signatures of a topological QSB at this (0-11) surface. Its predictions are demonstrably consistent with the experimental results if the bulk $\Delta(k)$ exhibits time-reversal conserving, odd-parity, a-axis nodal, B3u symmetry. Ultimately, these new techniques adumbrate a novel spectroscopic approach to identification of intrinsic topological superconductors and their superconductive topological surface states.</description>

      <title>Strain manipulation of charge density wave and Mott-insulating states in monolayer VTe2</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.17901</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.17901v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Monolayer vanadium ditelluride (VTe2) has recently been shown to host a Mott-insulating state that is intertwined with a 2{\sqrt{3}}*2{\sqrt{3}} charge density wave (CDW) order. However, the physical mechanisms driving the emergence of CDW order and its relationship with the Mott-insulating state are still not well understood. Unveiling the underlying physical mechanisms and exploring effective methods to modulate both CDW order and Mott-insulating state in monolayer VTe2 is therefore important. In this study, we systematically investigate the electronic band structure, phonon dispersion, and electron-phonon coupling (EPC) of monolayer VTe2 under the influence of biaxial strain. Our results reveal that the formation of CDW orders primarily arises from strong EPC effects. The narrowing of the bandwidth due to the CDW order, combined with the correlation effect of the V-3d orbital, collectively drives the system into a Mott-insulating state. Furthermore, we find that compressive strain significantly enhances the CDW order, while tensile strain suppresses it. Notably, beyond a threshold of {\epsilon} = 2% tensile strain, the CDW instability is entirely suppressed, paving the way for the emergence of a superconducting state. Our results establish that the CDW, Mott, and superconducting states in monolayer VTe2 can be effectively modulated through strain engineering, thereby advancing the understanding of the complex interplay between these correlated quantum states in VTe2.</description>

      <title>Large $N$ Wess-Zumino model at finite temperature and large chemical potential in $3d$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.17999</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.17999v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider the supersymmetric Wess-Zumino model at large $N$ in $(2+1)$ dimension. We introduce a chemical potential($\mu$) at finite temperature($T$). The non-trivial fixed point of this model is described by a pair of coupled gap equations. This fixed point behaves as a thermal CFT for all values of the coupling. We find that at large chemical potential these coupled equations simplify and solutions become analytically tractable. We solve them analytically for all values of the coupling at this limit. The solutions admit a systematic series expansion in $\frac{T}{\mu}$. Thus, using the solutions of the gap equation at large chemical potential we can evaluate the analytic form of the partition function, stress tensor and spin-1 current as a perturbative expansion in orders of $\frac{T}{\mu}$. Applying the OPE inversion formula on the scalar and fermion two point functions of the theory, we compute higher spin currents at large $\mu$.</description>

      <title>Emergent supercounterfluid and quantum phase diagram of two-component interacting bosons in one-dimensional optical lattice</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.18154v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Motivated by a recent experiment that realizes nearest-neighbor dipolar couplings in an optical lattice [C. Lagoin, $\textit{et al.}$, Nature $\textbf{609}$, 485 (2022)], we study a one-dimensional version of the two-component extended Bose-Hubbard model via the density-matrix renormalization group method. By using the nearest-neighbor and on-site interaction parameters from the experiment, we start by mapping the quantum phase diagram in the hopping parameters $t_{A}\mbox{-}t_{B}$ plane with boson densities $\rho_{A}=\rho_{B}=1/2$. In addition to the density wave phase reported in the experiment, we find several regimes of superfluidity when one or two hopping parameters are large enough, and interestingly there is a supercounterfluid phase at moderate and comparable hopping parameters. The universality classes of these phase transitions are analyzed from the correlation functions, excitation gaps, and entanglement entropy. In particular, a Berezinskii-Kosterlitz-Thouless type is recognized several gapped-to-gapless transitions. In addition, we also study the quantum phase transitions when varying $\rho_{B}$ from 0 to 1 while keeping $\rho_A = 1/2$. We identify a supersolid phase in a wide range of $1/2&lt;\rho_B&lt;1$. Our work paves the way for realizing exotic many-body phases in cold atom experiments upon proper tuning of experimental parameters.</description>

      <title>Emergent ferromagnetic ladder excitations in heavy fermion superconductor CeSb$_{2}$</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.18439v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Low-dimensional spin fluctuations play a crucial role in unconventional superconductors, with quasi-one-dimensional spin excitations potentially linked with spin-triplet superconductivity. The heavy fermion superconductor CeSb$_2$ exhibits an unusual large inverted S-shaped upper critical field that suggests a possible triplet pairing state within its pressure-induced superconducting dome. Using inelastic neutron scattering, we discover quasi-one-dimensional magnetic excitations in CeSb$_2$ emerging from nearly square Ce layers with minor orthorhombic deformation. We show that the data are well described by a ferromagnetic spin ladder model, where the "rungs" of the ladder straddle Ce bilayers. Moreover, we find that diffuse excitations akin to those in the ordered phase persist well above $T_{\rm N}$, suggesting that quasi-one-dimensional ferromagnetic paramagnons may significantly contribute to the unusual superconductivity that appears under pressure once magnetic order is suppressed.</description>

      <title>First Computation of Entanglement Dynamics in the SYK Model on Quantum Computers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.18580</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.18580v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Sachdev-Ye-Kitaev (SYK) model, fundamental to quantum chaos, many-body physics, and holographic duality, features random all-to-all quartic or higher-order interactions, exhibiting both maximal chaos and exact solvability--yet its entanglement entropy has remained challenging and never been measured on a real quantum device. We overcome this limitation by presenting the first measurement of entanglement entropy growth under the SYK Hamiltonian using IBM's superconducting quantum computer. We implement an optimized version of swap-based many-body interference protocol, alleviating the challenges posed by IBM's limited qubit connectivity. Additionally, to reduce the statistical uncertainty in the randomized measurement protocol, we expand the unitary ensemble, which increases the volume of quantum circuits that are difficult to execute on current quantum computers. We tackle this challenge for the first time by parallelizing these quantum circuits through quantum multi-programming--establishing a foundation for how tailored innovations reveal complex quantum dynamics within current hardware constraints.</description>

Abstract: Configurational entropy can impact crystallization processes, tipping the scales between structures of nearly equal internal energy. Using alloyed single crystals of Gd2PdSi3 in the AlB2-type structure, we explore the formation of complex layer sequences made from alternating, two-dimensional triangular and honeycomb slabs. A four-period and an eight-period stacking sequence are found to be very close in internal energy, the latter being favored by entropy associated with covering the full configuration space of interlayer bonds. Possible consequences of polytype formation on magnetism in Gd2PdSi3 are discussed.</description>

      <title>Dome-like pressure-temperature phase diagram of the cooperative Jahn--Teller distortion in NaNiO$_2$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.18833</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.18833v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: NaNiO$_2$ is a Ni$^{3+}$-containing layered material consisting of alternating triangular networks of Ni and Na cations, separated by octahedrally-coordinated O anions. At ambient pressure, it features a collinear Jahn--Teller distortion below $T^\mathrm{JT}_\mathrm{onset}\approx480$ K, which disappears in a first-order transition on heating to $T^\mathrm{JT}_\mathrm{end}\approx500$ K, corresponding to the increase in symmetry from monoclinic to rhombohedral. It was previously studied by variable-pressure neutron diffraction [ACS Inorganic Chemistry 61.10 (2022): 4312-4321] and found to exhibit an increasing $T^\mathrm{JT}_\mathrm{onset}$ with pressure up to ~5 GPa. In this work, powdered NaNiO$_2$ was studied via variable-pressure synchrotron x-ray diffraction up to pressures of ~67 GPa at 294 K and 403 K. Suppression of the collinear Jahn--Teller ordering is observed via the emergence of a high-symmetry rhombohedral phase, with the onset pressure occurring at ~18 GPa at both studied temperatures. Further, a discontinuous decrease in unit cell volume is observed on transitioning from the monoclinic to the rhombohedral phase. These results taken together suggest that in the vicinity of the transition, application of pressure causes the Jahn--Teller transition temperature, $T^\mathrm{JT}_\mathrm{onset}$, to decrease rapidly. We conclude that the pressure-temperature phase diagram of the cooperative Jahn--Teller distortion in NaNiO$_2$ is dome-like.</description>

      <title>Impact of Nonlocal Coulomb Repulsion on Superconductivity and Density-Wave Orders in Bilayer Nickelates</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.18877</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.18877v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The recent discovery of high-temperature superconductivity in pressurized bilayer nickelate La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$ and its thin films has sparked significant interest in understanding their pairing mechanism and correlated states. While previous theoretical studies have mainly focused on onsite Coulomb interactions, the role of nonlocal Coulomb repulsion has been neglected, leaving its effect unexplored and elusive. In this work, we comprehensively explore the effect of nonlocal Coulomb repulsion on both superconductivity and density-wave orders in the presence of onsite interactions by performing functional renormalization group calculations. We find that interlayer repulsion suppresses the interlayer intra-orbital $s_{\pm}$-wave pairing and spin-density-wave order, while driving a transition to an interlayer inter-orbital $d_{x^2-y^2}$-wave pairing and a mirror-symmetry breaking charge order. This transition occurs across a wide range of charge doping and is independent of the presence of the $\gamma$ pocket around M point. Remarkably, the critical scale of the $d_{x^2-y^2}$-wave superconductivity is significantly lower than that of the $s_{\pm}$-wave superconductivity, suggesting that the former pairing is unlikely to account for the observed high-$T_c$ superconductivity. Additionally, the intralayer nearest-neighbor repulsion promotes an in-plane charge density wave order with a vector of $(\pi,\pi)$. Our findings highlight profound impact of nonlocal Coulomb repulsion and the robustness of interlayer pairing associated with the bilayer structure and multi-orbital nature, advancing the understanding of the complex correlation effects within bilayer nickelates.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.18946v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We theoretically predict the in-plane magnetic field-induced orbital Fulde-Ferrell-Larkin-Ovchinnikov (FFLO) superconducting states in twisted WSe$_2$ homobilayers (tWSe$_2$), focusing on its dependence on layer polarization and Fermi surface geometry. For unpolarized layers, finite-momentum pairing emerges only at low temperatures and above a critical field $B_{c1,\parallel}$. When layer symmetry is broken, finite-momentum pairing is stabilized at any nonzero field, with a critical temperature higher than that of the zero-momentum state. Notably, we identify a phase transition, which separates two distinct FFLO phases, when there are two separate Fermi pockets residing in the two moir\'e mini-valleys associated with opposite layers. We further discuss the effects of twist angles and applied field directions. Our findings establish tWSe$_2$ as a promising platform for realizing and manipulating FFLO states via twist angle, displacement field, and filling factor.</description>

      <title>Magnetic monopole relaxation effects in spin ice Dy$_2$Ti$_2$O$_7$</title>

      <description>arXiv:2202.02801v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Spin ice compounds enable the exploration of the dynamics of magnetic monopoles in condensed matter systems. In this study, we use ac calorimetry to probe the dynamical response of the heat capacity of the classical spin-ice compounds Dy$_2$Ti$_2$O$_7$ at low temperatures (0.5-5 K). Using frequencies of 0.01-500 Hz, we find a strong frequency dependence in the measured heat capacity and are able to study thermal relaxation effects on the corresponding timescales. The relaxation time $\tau$ is determined from the frequency dependence of the heat capacity as the characteristic frequency below which the heat capacity saturates. The extracted $\tau$ shows a divergent behavior below 1 K reaching $\sim$6 s at 0.65 K, similar to the relaxation time seen in previous studies. Corresponding specific heat shows a maximum around this temperature. Performing dynamic Monte Carlo simulations, we verify that the specific heat frequency response has its origin in the slow magnetic monopole dynamics indigenous to spin ice. We find a timescale of 20 ms per Monte Carlo step at 4 K in contrast to 2.5 ms mentioned in previous studies by other techniques.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2305.07222v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: High-resolution angle- and spin-resolved photoemission spectroscopy (ARPES) of the triple-layered ruthenate Sr$_4$Ru$_3$O$_{10}$ reveals features of the electronic structure that extend our understanding of the layered strontium ruthenates. The spectra near the Fermi energy are very different from the non-magnetic analogues Sr$_2$RuO$_4$ and Sr$_3$Ru$_2$O$_7$ with distinct Fermi surfaces for wide electron-like minority spin bands around the zone center and narrow hole-like majority spin Fermi surface contours around the zone corners. The most dramatic results are two narrow spectral peaks $\sim$30 meV below the Fermi-level, a spin-minority hole-like band at the Brillouin zone center, and a spin-majority saddle-band van Hove singularity at the zone edge, which exhibits almost 100\% spin-polarization at low temperature, and a strong temperature dependent coherence-incoherence crossover attributed to Hund metal correlations. Quantitative comparison of the ARPES to spin-polarized density functional theory (DFT) calculations identify the specific antibonding and nonbonding orbital origins of the narrow bands, with a prediction of different spatial localization in the central and outer layers. This is shown to be consistent with experimental ARPES multi-zone matrix element intensity variations, and implicates outer-layer-specific control of the in-plane metamagnetism. The renormalization of the bands relative to the mean-field DFT, the demonstration of spin-polarized oxygen bands, and of spin-minority and spin-majority band-crossing hybridization, provide a more complete picture of the magnetism which displays aspects of both delocalized and local moment behavior.</description>

      <title>Darkness in interlayer and charge density wave states of 2H-TaS2</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.24086v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The wave-like nature of electrons is evident from quantum interference effects observed during the photoemission process. When there are different nuclei in the unit cell of a crystal and/or structural distortions, photo-electron wavefunctions can interfere, giving rise to peculiar intensity modulation of the spectrum, which can also hide energy states in a photoemission experiment. The 2H phase of transition metal dichalcogenides, with two nonequivalent layers per unit cell and charge density wave distortion, is an optimal platform for such effects to be observed. Here, we discover undetectable states in 2H-TaS2, interpreting high-resolution angular resolved photoemission spectroscopy considering interference effects of the correlated electron wave functions. In addition, phase mismatching induced by the charge density wave distortion, results in evident signature of the phase transition in the photoemission spectrum. Our results highlight the importance of quantum interference, electronic correlations and structural distortion to understand the physics of layered materials.</description>

      <title>Gross-Neveu-Yukawa SO(2) and SO(3) tensorial criticality</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.16842v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate the relativistic SO(2)- and SO(3)-invariant Gross-Neveu-Yukawa field theories for real, rank-two, symmetric, traceless tensor order parameters coupled to $N_{\text{f}}$ flavors of two-component Dirac fermions. These field theories arise as an effective description of fractionalized spin-orbital liquids. The two theories are the simplest and special cases of the more general class of field theories with SO($N$) symmetric tensor order parameter coupled to Dirac fermions, in which the symmetry is low enough to allow only one, and not the usual two quartic self-interaction terms. Using two-loop renormalization group near the upper critical dimension, we demonstrate that the theory exhibits a new critical fixed point for $N=3$ and the concomitant continuous phase transition for any value of $N_{\text{f}}$. For $N=2$ the theory is equivalent to the chiral XY model. We discuss the crucial role of the symmetry-allowed sextic self-interactions in the selection of the ground state configuration in the case of SO(3). The universal quantities such as the the anomalous dimensions of order parameters and fermions, the correlation length exponent, and the mass gap ratio between order parameter and fermion masses are computed up to $\epsilon^{2}$ order.</description>

      <title>Thermodynamics, elastic anomalies and excitations in the field induced phases of CeRh2As2</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.02537v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The tetragonal heavy fermion compound CeRh2As2 exhibits unconventional superconductivity accompanied by other broken symmetry phases that have been identified as presumably small moment intrinsic antiferromagnetism at low magnetic fields and induced quadrupolar order at higher in-plane fields. The latter may extend to very large pulsed-field range. The phase boundaries can be investigated by following thermodynamic anomalies like specific heat, magnetocaloric coefficient, thermal expansion and magnetostriction. We calculate their discontinuities and identify the influence of the field induced quadrupole on them. Furthermore we investigate the elastic constant anomalies which are determined by the static homogeneous quadrupolar RPA response functions. We present a calculation of these anomalies for the appropriate symmetry mode both in the disordered and ordered regime and investigate their change with applied field. In addition we consider the dynamical momentum dependent magnetic susceptibility and the associated dispersion of low energy magnetic modes and how their characteristics change across the phase boundary.</description>

Abstract: We express Kitaev's exact solution of spin models on the honeycomb lattice as a special case of a higher dimensional duality between staggered Majorana fermions and Pauli spins. General models with bilinear nearest neighbor couplings of spins and external magnetic fields are soluble in this way. Each model gives rise to an infinite number of single particle fermion Schrodinger equations, depending on the choice of discrete gauge field flux.</description>

      <title>Anomalies of Coset Non-Invertible Symmetries</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.00105v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Anomalies of global symmetries provide important information on the quantum dynamics. We show the dynamical constraints can be organized into three classes: genuine anomalies, fractional topological responses, and integer responses that can be realized in symmetry-protected topological (SPT) phases. Coset symmetry can be present in many physical systems including quantum spin liquids, and the coset symmetry can be a non-invertible symmetry. We introduce twists in coset symmetries, which modify the fusion rules and the generalized Frobenius-Schur indicators. We call such coset symmetries twisted coset symmetries, and they are labeled by the quadruple $(G,K,\omega_{D+1},\alpha_D)$ in $D$ spacetime dimensions where $G$ is a group and $K\subset G$ is a discrete subgroup, $\omega_{D+1}$ is a $(D+1)$-cocycle for group $G$, and $\alpha_{D}$ is a $D$-cochain for group $K$. We present several examples with twisted coset symmetries using lattice models and field theory, including both gapped and gapless systems (such as gapless symmetry-protected topological phases). We investigate the anomalies of general twisted coset symmetry, which presents obstructions to realizing the coset symmetry in (gapped) symmetry-protected topological phases. We show that finite coset symmetry $G/K$ becomes anomalous when $G$ cannot be expressed as the bicrossed product $G=H\Join K$, and such anomalous coset symmetry leads to symmetry-enforced gaplessness in generic spacetime dimensions. We illustrate examples of anomalous coset symmetries with $A_5/\mathbb{Z}_2$ symmetry, with realizations in lattice models.</description>

      <title>Crystal field splittings and magnetic ground state of the square-lattice antiferromagnets YbBi2ClO4 and YbBi2IO4 with Jeff = 1/2</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.09739</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.09739v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We report on the crystal field level splitting and magnetic ground state of the Jeff = 1/2 square lattice antiferromagnets YbBi2ClO4 and YbBi2IO4 using powder inelastic neutron scattering (INS) and neutron diffraction measurements. Both compounds exhibit a well-isolated $\Gamma_{7}$ doublet ground state under a tetragonal crystal field environment, confirming a robust Jeff = 1/2 picture with slight XY-type anisotropic character in the g-tensor. Notably, the ground state wave functions closely resemble the $\Gamma_{7}$ doublet expected in the perfect cubic limit, consistent with the nearly cubic ligand configuration of eight O2- ions surrounding Yb3+. Below TN =0.21 K, YbBi2IO4 exhibits a stripe long-range magnetic order characterized by an ordering wave vector qm = (1/2, 0, 0) or its symmetry-equivalent (0, 1/2, 0), with magnetic moments aligned along qm. The ordered moment is approximately 79 % of the classical prediction, significantly larger than expected from the isotropic J1-J2 model, suggesting the possible involvement of exchange anisotropy in explaining this observation. We show that symmetry-allowed XXZ and bond-dependent anisotropic exchange terms in a square lattice can play a critical role in stabilizing the stripe order and suppressing the moment reduction as observed. These findings establish YbBi2ClO4 and YbBi2IO4 as unique platforms for exploring rich Jeff = 1/2 magnetism from two less investigated perspectives: (i) on a square lattice and (ii) within a (nearly) cubic ligand environment.</description>

      <title>Slow Oscillations of the Transverse Magnetoresistance in HoTe3</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.13302v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Slow oscillations of the magnetoresistance periodic in the inverse magnetic field with a frequency of 3.4 T have been identified in HoTe3. The temperature dependence of the oscillation amplitude is close to exponential even at low temperatures. This may be attributed to the existence of soft modes in the system and allows the estimation of the electron scattering rate on these modes. In the region of magnetic fields exceeding 1 T, the oscillations can be described as interference oscillations associated with the splitting of the band structure due to the bilayer structure of HoTe3. The obtained data have allowed us to calculate the ratio tb/tz~7.7 of the hopping integrals between layers within each bilayer (tb) and between the adjacent bilayers (tz) to estimate these integrals as tb ~ 2 meV and tz ~ 0.26 meV.</description>

Abstract: Quantum phase transitions are highly remarkable phenomena manifesting in quantum many-body systems. However, their precise identifications in equilibrium systems pose significant theoretical and experimental challenges. Thus far, dynamical detection protocols employing global quantum quenches have been proposed, wherein transitions are discerned via global nonequilibrium excitations. In this work, we demonstrate that quantum phase transitions can be detected through localized out-of-equilibrium excitations induced by local quantum quenches. While the resulting dynamics after the quench is influenced by both the local quench operation and the intrinsic dynamics of the quantum system, the effects of the former are exclusively extracted using the cutting-edge framework called quantum reservoir probing (QRP). Through the QRP, we find that the impacts of the local quenches vary across different quantum phases and are significantly suppressed by quantum fluctuations amplified near quantum critical points; consequently, phase boundaries are precisely delineated. We demonstrate that the QRP can detect quantum phase transitions in the paradigmatic integrable and nonintegrable quantum spin systems, and even topological quantum phase transitions, all within the identical framework employing local quantum quenches and single-site observables.</description>

      <title>Deriving the non-perturbative gravitational dual of quantum Liouville theory from BCFT operator algebra</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.03179v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We demonstrate that, by utilizing the boundary conformal field theory (BCFT) operator algebra of the Liouville CFT, one can express its path-integral on any Riemann surface as a three dimensional path-integral with appropriate boundary conditions, generalising the recipe for rational CFTs \cite{Hung:2019bnq, Brehm:2021wev, Chen:2022wvy, Cheng:2023kxh}. This serves as a constructive method for deriving the \textit{quantum} holographic dual of the CFT, which reduces to Einstein gravity in the large central charge limit. As a byproduct, the framework provides an explicit discrete state-sum of a 3D non-chiral topological theory constructed from quantum $6j$ symbols of $\mathcal{U}_q(sl(2,\mathbb{R}))$ with non-trivial boundary conditions, representing a long-sought non-perturbative discrete formulation of 3D pure gravity with negative cosmological constant, at least within a class of three manifolds. This constitutes the first example of an exact holographic tensor network that reproduces a known irrational CFT with a precise quantum gravitational interpretation.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.07772v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The spectral and transport properties of strongly correlated metals, such as SrVO$_3$ (SVO), are widely attributed to electron-electron ($e$-$e$) interactions, with lattice vibrations (phonons) playing a secondary role. Here, using first-principles electron-phonon ($e$-ph) and dynamical mean field theory calculations, we show that $e$-ph interactions play an essential role in SVO: they govern the electron scattering and resistivity in a wide temperature range above 30 K, and induce an experimentally observed kink in the spectral function. In contrast, the $e$-$e$ interactions control quasiparticle renormalizations and low temperature transport, and enhance the $e$-ph coupling. We clarify the origin of the near $T^2$ temperature dependence of the resistivity by analyzing the $e$-$e$ and $e$-ph limited transport regimes. Our work disentangles the electronic and lattice degrees of freedom in a prototypical correlated metal, revealing the dominant role of $e$-ph interactions in SVO.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.16095v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Measurements profoundly impact quantum systems, and can be used to create novel states of matter out of equilibrium. We investigate the multipartite entanglement structure that emerges in hybrid quantum circuits involving unitaries and measurements. We describe how a balance between measurements and unitary evolution can lead to multipartite entanglement spreading to distances far greater than what is found in non-monitored systems, thus evading the usual fate of entanglement. We introduce a graphical representation based on spanning graphs that allows to infer the evolution of genuine multipartite entanglement for general subregions. We exemplify our findings on hybrid random Haar circuits that realize a 1d measurement-induced dynamical phase transition, where we find genuine 3-party entanglement at all separations. At criticality, our data is consistent with power-law decay with a tripartite exponent strictly larger than the one of the bipartite logarithmic negativity. The 4-party case is also explored. Finally, we discuss how our approach can provide fundamental insights regarding entanglement dynamics for a wide class of quantum circuits and architectures.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.19013v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Shortcuts to adiabaticity (STA) make the fast preparation of many-body states possible, circumventing the limitations of adiabatic strategies. We propose a fast STA protocol for generating interacting states in the Tomonaga-Luttinger liquid by counter-diabatic driving, stirring the dynamics with an auxiliary control field. To this end, we exploit the equivalence between the time-dependent Tomonaga-Luttinger liquid and an ensemble of quantum oscillators with driven mass and frequency. We specify the closed-form expression of the counterdiabatic control and demonstrate its efficiency in suppressing excitations.</description>

Abstract: In the field of fractional Chern insulators, a great deal of effort has been devoted to characterizing Chern bands that exhibit properties similar to the Landau levels. Among them, the concept of the vortex function, which generalizes the complex coordinate used for the symmetric-gauge Landau-level basis, allows for a concise description. In this paper, we develop a theory of constructing the vortex function and basis states of Chern insulators in the tight-binding formalism. In the first half, we consider the optimization process of the vortex function, which minimizes an indicator that measures the difference from the ideal Chern insulators. In particular, we focus on the sublattice position dependence of the vortex function or the quantum geometric tensor. This degree of freedom serves as a discrete analog of the non-uniformity in the spatial metric and magnetic field in a continuous model. In the second half, we construct two types of basis sets for a given vortex function: radially localized basis set and coherent-like basis set. The former basis set is defined as the eigenstates of an analogy of the angular momentum operator. Remarkably, one can always find exact zero mode(s) for this operator, which is explained by the celebrated Atiyah-Singer index theorem. As a byproduct, we propose an inequality rooted in the band topology. We also discuss the subtle differences between our formalism and the previous works about the momentum-space Landau level. The latter basis set generalizes the concept of coherent states on von Neumann lattice. While this basis set is not orthogonal, it is useful to compare the LLL and the given Chern insulator directly in the Brillouin zone. These basis sets are expected to be useful for many-body calculations of fractional Chern insulators.</description>

      <title>Correlation versus dissipation in a non-Hermitian Anderson impurity model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.03494</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.03494v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We analyze the competition between strong correlations and dissipation in quantum impurity systems from the Kondo regime to the valence fluctuation regime by developing a slave-boson theory for a non-Hermitian Anderson impurity model with one-body loss. Notably, in the non-Hermitian Kondo regime, strong correlations qualitatively change the nature of dissipation through renormalization effects, where the effective one-body loss is suppressed and emergent many-body dissipation characterized by the complex-valued hybridization is generated. We unveil the mechanism of a dissipative quantum phase transition of the Kondo state on the basis of this renormalization effect, which counterintuitively enhances the lifetime of the impurity against loss. We also find a crossover from the non-Hermitian Kondo regime to the valence fluctuation regime dominated by one-body dissipation. Our results can be tested in a wide variety of setups such as quantum dots coupled to electronic leads and quantum point contacts in ultracold Fermi gases.</description>

Abstract: We consider trajectories of massless particles in the presence of charged black holes in asymptotically AdS spacetimes in arbitrary dimensions. We study the properties of the photon ring in the (near-)extremal limit and show that the photon ring can probe the near-horizon region in two different scenarios: in high enough number of spacetime dimensions or when the massless particle carries an electric charge. We propose a simple $\mathrm{i} \epsilon$-prescription for implementing the JWKB approximation and show its utility in various contexts. We calculate the quasi-normal modes for charged fields in the eikonal limit and show the emergence of a new time-scale of relaxation in the dual field theory side. In the near-extremal limit, we show generally that the time-scale of decay of the perturbations is governed by the chemical potential. We also verify our analytical results numerically. The $\mathrm{i} \epsilon$-prescription allows us to study the superradiant modes and the associated instabilities in the eikonal limit easily. We comment on some related aspects regarding near-extremal black holes.</description>

      <title>Geometric Breaking of Quantum Strings in Kagome Rydberg Atom Array</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.21135</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.21135v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Leveraging the rapid development of quantum simulators, the intriguing phenomena of string breaking are observed across various quantum simulation platforms \cite{Rydberg_kagome,qbit_string_breaking}. However, the strings can only be broken by quenching the tension energy due to the system size limitation, such "tensile breaking" behaves quite the same as in one-dimension \cite{ion_string_breaking}. To discover the distinctive properties of quantum strings in two dimensions, we utilize a newly developed quantum Monte Carlo method to simulate a ten times larger scale (743-site) Kagome Rydberg atom array which can be described with U(1) lattice gauge theory. With designed edges, one end of the string can be easily grasped, allowing for clearly observing the dynamics of the dangling gauge charge at the open end. Then, we can drag each end in opposite directions perpendicular to the string. As the separation distance increases, asymptotic freedom-like behavior is detected. Eventually, the string breaks because the distance between both ends surpasses the string's length, so named "geometric breaking". Distinct from "tensile breaking," the two newly formed strings are suddenly uncorrelated, accompanied by a sudden energy increase. Lastly, we study multiple strings and successfully prepare a heart-like superposition state of broken and unbroken quantum strings with three gauge charges attached reminiscent of quarks and gluon. This work can benefit the comprehension of quantum strings and also shed light on the simulation of high-energy physics.</description>

      <title>A relativistic continuous matrix product state study of field theories with defects</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.09797</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.09797v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We propose a method to compute expectation values in 1+1-dimensional massive Quantum Field Theories (QFTs) with line defects using Relativistic Continuous Matrix Product State (RCMPS). Exploiting Euclidean invariance, we use a quantization scheme where (imaginary) time runs perpendicularly to the defect. With this choice, correlation functions of local operators in the presence of the defect can be computed as expectation values of extended operators in the no-defect vacuum, which can be approximated by a homogeneous RCMPS. We demonstrate the effectiveness of this machinery by computing correlation functions of local bulk and defect operators in $\phi^4$ theory with a magnetic line defect, in perturbative, strong coupling, critical, and symmetry-broken regimes.</description>

      <title>Stability of the $\pi$-Flux Phase for $\mathbb{Z}_{2}$ Lattice Gauge Theory Coupled to Fermionic Matter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.10065</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.10065v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We consider the two-dimensional $\mathbb{Z}_{2}$ Ising gauge theory coupled to fermionic matter. In absence of electric fields, we prove that, at half-filling, the ground state of the gauge theory coincides with the $\pi$-flux phase, associated with magnetic flux equal to $\pi$ in every elementary lattice plaquette, provided the fermionic hopping is large enough. This proves in particular the semimetallic behavior of the ground state of the model. Furthermore, we compute the magnetic susceptibility of the gauge theory, and we prove that it is given by the one of massless $2d$ Dirac fermions, thus rigorously justifying recent numerical computations. The proof is based on reflection positivity and chessboard estimates, and on lattice conservation laws for the computation of the transport coefficient.</description>

      <title>Digital Simulation of Non-Abelian Parafermions in Superconducting Circuits</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.20254</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.20254v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Parafermions, which can be viewed as a fractionalized version of Majorana fermions, exhibit profound non-Abelian statistics and emerge in topologically ordered systems, while their realization in experiment has been challenging. Here we propose an experimental scheme for the digital simulation of parafermions and their non-Abelian braiding in superconducting (SC) circuits by realizing the $\mathbb{Z}_d$ plaquette model on a two-dimensional lattice. Two protocols using quantum circuits and non-destructive measurements are introduced to prepare the ground state, on which parafermion pairs are created by engineering dislocations. We then propose a generalized code deformation approach to realize the fusion and non-Abelian braiding statistics of parafermion modes, and show the application of this approach to fusing and braiding the $d=3$ parafermions. We also examine the experimental parameter regime to confirm the feasibility in SC devices. This work extends previous quantum simulation for twist defects in SC qubits to qudit systems, and may open up a way for parafermion-based high-dimensional topological quantum computing with experimental feasibility.</description>

      <title>Holographic study of shear viscosity and butterfly velocity for magnetic field-driven quantum criticality</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.10584</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.10584v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate the shear viscosity and butterfly velocity of a magnetic field-induced quantum phase transition in five dimensional Einstein-Maxwell-Chern-Simons theory, which is holographically dual to a class of strongly coupled quantum field theories with chiral anomalies. Our analysis reveals that the ratio of longitudinal shear viscosity to entropy density $\eta_\parallel/s$ exhibits a pronounced non-monotonic dependence on temperature $T$ when the magnetic field $B$ is slightly below the critical value $B_c$ of the quantum phase transition. In particular, it can develop a distinct minimum at an intermediate temperature. This contrasts sharply with the monotonic temperature scaling observed at and above $B_c$, where $\eta_\parallel/s$ follows the scaling $T^{2/3}$ at $B=B_c$ and transitions to $T^2$ for $B&gt;B_c$ as $T\to0$. The non-vanishing of $\eta_\parallel/s$ for $B&lt;B_c$ in the zero temperature limit suggests that it could serve as a good order parameter of the quantum phase transition. We also find that all butterfly velocities change dramatically near the quantum phase transition, and thus their derivatives with respect to $B$ can be independently used to detect the quantum critical point.</description>
