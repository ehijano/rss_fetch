      <title>Chain Bounding and the leanest proof of Zorn's lemma</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.11638</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.11638v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present an exposition of the *Chain Bounding Lemma*, which is a common generalization of both Zorn's Lemma and the Bourbaki-Witt fixed point theorem. The proofs of these results through the use of Chain Bounding are amongst the simplest ones that we are aware of. As a by-product, we show that for every poset $P$ and a function $f$ from the powerset of $P$ into $P$, there exists a maximal well-ordered chain whose family of initial segments is appropriately closed under $f$.
  We also provide a "computer formalization" of our main results using the Lean proof assistant.</description>

      <title>Lewis and Brouwer meet Strong L\"ob</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.11969</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.11969v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the principle phi implies box phi, known as `Strength' or `the Completeness Principle', over the constructive version of L\"ob's Logic. We consider this principle both for the modal language with the necessity operator and for the modal language with the Lewis arrow, where L\"ob's Logic is suitably adapted.
  Central insights of provability logic, like the de Jongh-Sambin Theorem and the de Jongh-Sambin-Bernardi Theorem, take a simple form in the presence of Strength. We present these simple versions. We discuss the semantics of two salient systems and prove uniform interpolation for both. In addition, we sketch arithmetical interpretations of our systems. Finally, we describe the various connections of our subject with Computer Science.</description>

      <title>Upward L\"owenheim-Skolem-Tarski Numbers for Abstract Logics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.12269</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.12269v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Galeotti, Khomskii and V\"a\"an\"aanen recently introduced the notion of the upward L\"owenheim-Skolem-Tarski number for a logic, strengthening the classical notion of a Hanf number. A cardinal $\kappa$ is the \emph{upward L\"owenheim-Skolem-Tarski number} (ULST) of a logic $\mathcal L$ if it is the least cardinal with the property that whenever $M$ is a model of size at least $\kappa$ satisfying a sentence $\varphi$ in $\mathcal L$, then there are arbitrarily large models satisfying $\varphi$ and having $M$ as a substructure. The substructure requirement is what differentiates the ULST number from the Hanf number and gives the notion large cardinal strength. While it is a theorem of ZFC that every logic has a Hanf number, Galeotti, Khomskii and V\"a\"an\"anen showed that the existence of the ULST number for second-order logic implies the existence of a partially extendible cardinal. We answer positively their conjecture that the ULST number for second-order logic is the least extendible cardinal.
  We define the strong ULST number by strengthening the substructure requirement to elementary substructure. We investigate the ULST and strong ULST numbers for several classical strong logics: infinitary logics, the equicardinality logic, logic with the well-foundedness quantifier, second-order logic, and sort logics. We show that the ULST and the strong ULST numbers are characterized in some cases by classical large cardinals and in some cases by natural new large cardinal notions that they give rise to. We show that for some logics the notions of the ULST number, strong ULST number and least strong compactness cardinal coincide, while for others, it is consistent that they can be separated. Finally, we introduce a natural large cardinal notion characterizing strong compactness cardinals for the equicardinality logic.</description>

      <title>The Generic Circular Triangle-Free Graph</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.12082</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.12082v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we introduce the generic circular triangle-free graph $\mathbb C_3$ and propose a finite axiomatization of its first order theory. In particular, our main results show that a countable graph $G$ embeds into $\mathbb C_3$ if and only if it is a $\{K_3, K_1 + 2K_2, K_1+C_5, C_6\}$-free graph. As a byproduct of this result, we obtain a geometric characterization of finite $\{K_3, K_1 + 2K_2, K_1+C_5, C_6\}$-free graphs, and the (finite) list of minimal obstructions of unit Helly circular-arc graphs with independence number strictly less than three.
  The circular chromatic number $\chi_c(G)$ is a refinement of the classical chromatic number $\chi(G)$. We construct $\mathbb C_3$ so that a graph $G$ has circular chromatic number strictly less than three if and only if $G$ maps homomorphically to $\mathbb C_3$. We build on our main results to show that $\chi_c(G) &lt; 3$ if and only if $G$ can be extended to a $\{K_3, K_1 + 2K_2, K_1+C_5, C_6\}$-free graph, and in turn, we use this result to reprove an old characterization of $\chi_c(G) &lt; 3$ due to Brandt (1999). Finally, we answer a question recently asked by Guzm\'an-Pro, Hell, and Hern\'andez-Cruz by showing that the problem of deciding for a given finite graph $G$ whether $\chi_c(G) &lt; 3$ is NP-complete.</description>

      <title>On $\Sigma_1$-Definable Closed Unbounded Sets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.08251</link>
      <description>arXiv:2303.08251v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Definable stationary sets, and specifically, ordinal definable ones, play a significant role in the study of canonical inner models of set theory and the class HOD of hereditarily ordinal definable sets. Fixing a certain notion of definability and an uncountable cardinal, one can consider the associated family of definable closed unbounded sets. In this paper, we study the extent to which such families can approximate the full closed unbounded filter, and their dependence on the defining complexity. Focusing on closed unbounded subsets of a cardinal $\kappa$ which are $\Sigma_1$-definable in parameters from $H_\kappa$ and ordinal parameters, we show that the ability of such closed unbounded sets to well approximate the closed unbounded filter on $\kappa$ can highly vary, and strongly depends on key properties of the underlying universe of set theory.</description>

      <title>Transasymptotic expansions of o-minimal germs</title>

      <description>arXiv:2402.12073v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Given an o-minimal expansion $\mathbb{R}_{\mathcal{A}}$ of the real ordered field, generated by a generalized quasianalytic class $\mathcal{A}$, we construct an explicit truncation closed ordered differential field embedding of the Hardy field of the expansion $\mathbb{R}_{\mathcal{A},\exp}$ of $\mathbb{R}_{\mathcal{A}}$ by the unrestricted exponential function, into the field $\mathbb{T}$ of transseries. We use this to prove some non-definability results. In particular, we show that the restriction to the positive half-line of Euler's Gamma function is not definable in the structure $\mathbb{R}_{\text{an}^{*},\exp}$, generated by all convergent generalized power series and the exponential function, thus establishing the non-interdefinability of the restrictions to a neighbourhood of $+\infty$ of Euler's Gamma and of the Riemann Zeta function.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2305.15209v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We give an expository, and hopefully approachable, account of the Joyal-Tierney result that every topos can be represented as a topos of sheaves on a localic groupoid. We give an explicit presentation of a representing localic groupoid for the classifying topos of a given geometric theory and discuss links with the topological groupoids of Forssell.</description>

      <title>Combining swap structures: the case of Paradefinite Ivlev-like modal logics based on FDE</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.15426</link>
      <description>arXiv:2308.15426v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The aim of this paper is to combine several Ivlev-like modal systems characterized by 4-valued non-deterministic matrices (Nmatrices) with IDM4, a 4-valued expansion of Belnap-Dunn's logic FDE with an implication introduced by Pynko in 1999. In order to do this, we introduce a new methodology for combining logics which are characterized by means of swap structures, based on what we call superposition of snapshots. In particular, the combination of IDM4 with Tm, the 4-valued Ivlev's version of KT, will be analyzed with more details. From the semantical perspective, the idea is to combine the 4-valued swap structures (Nmatrices) for Tm (and several of its extensions) with the 4-valued twist structure (logical matrix) for IDM4. This superposition produces a universe of 6 snapshots, with 3 of them being designated. The multioperators over the new universe are defined by combining the specifications of the given swap and twist structures. This gives rise to 6 different paradefinite Ivlev-like modal logics, each one of them characterized by a 6-valued Nmatrix, and conservatively extending the original modal logic and IDM4. This important feature allows to consider the proposed construction as a genuine technique for combining logics. In addition, it is possible to define in the combined logics a classicality operator in the sense of logics of evidence and truth (LETs). A sound and complete Hilbert-style axiomatization is also presented for the 6 combined systems, as well as a Prolog program which implements the swap structures semantics for the 6 systems, producing a decision procedure for satisfiability, refutability and validity of formulas in these logics.</description>

      <title>Construction under Martin's axiom of a Boolean algebra with the Grothendieck property but without the Nikodym property</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.16155</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.16155v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Improving a result of M. Talagrand, under the assumption of a weak form of Martin's axiom, we construct a totally disconnected compact Hausdorff space $K$ such that the Banach space $C(K)$ of continuous real-valued functions on $K$ is a Grothendieck space but there exists a sequence $(\mu_n)$ of Radon measures on $K$ such that $\mu_n(A)\to0$ for every clopen set $A\subseteq K$ and $\int_Kfd\mu_n\not\to0$ for some $f\in C(K)$. Consequently, we get that Martin's axiom implies the existence of a Boolean algebra with the Grothendieck property but without the Nikodym property.</description>
