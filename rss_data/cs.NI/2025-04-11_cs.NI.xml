      <title>Enabling Continuous 5G Connectivity in Aircraft through Low Earth Orbit Satellites</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.07262</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.07262v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: As air travel demand increases, uninterrupted high-speed internet access becomes essential. However, current satellite-based systems face latency and connectivity challenges. While prior research has focused on terrestrial 5G and geostationary satellites, there is a gap in optimizing Low Earth Orbit (LEO)-based 5G systems for aircraft. This study evaluates the feasibility of deployment strategies and improving signal quality with LEO satellites for seamless in-flight 5G connectivity. Using Matlab and Simulink, we model satellite trajectories, aircraft movement, and handover mechanisms, complemented by ray-tracing techniques for in-cabin signal analysis. Results show that proposed LEO satellite configurations enhance coverage and reduce latency, with sequential handovers minimizing service interruptions. These findings contribute to advancing in-flight 5G networks, improving passenger experience, and supporting real-time global connectivity solutions.</description>

      <title>LLM-Enabled Data Transmission in End-to-End Semantic Communication</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.07431</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.07431v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Emerging services such as augmented reality (AR) and virtual reality (VR) have increased the volume of data transmitted in wireless communication systems, revealing the limitations of traditional Shannon theory. To address these limitations, semantic communication has been proposed as a solution that prioritizes the meaning of messages over the exact transmission of bits. This paper explores semantic communication for text data transmission in end-to-end (E2E) systems through a novel approach called KG-LLM semantic communication, which integrates knowledge graph (KG) extraction and large language model (LLM) coding. In this method, the transmitter first utilizes a KG to extract key entities and relationships from sentences. The extracted information is then encoded using an LLM to obtain the semantic meaning. On the receiver side, messages are decoded using another LLM, while a bidirectional encoder representations from transformers (i.e., BERT) model further refines the reconstructed sentences for improved semantic similarity. The KG-LLM semantic communication method reduces the transmitted text data volume by 30% through KG-based compression and achieves 84\% semantic similarity between the original and received messages. This demonstrates the KG-LLM methods efficiency and robustness in semantic communication systems, outperforming the deep learning-based semantic communication model (DeepSC), which achieves only 63%.</description>

      <title>Deep Learning Based Service Composition in Integrated Aerial-Terrestrial Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.07528</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.07528v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The explosive growth of user devices and emerging applications is driving unprecedented traffic demands, accompanied by stringent Quality of Service (QoS) requirements. Addressing these challenges necessitates innovative service orchestration methods capable of seamless integration across the edge-cloud continuum. Terrestrial network-based service orchestration methods struggle to deliver timely responses to growing traffic demands or support users with poor or lack of access to terrestrial infrastructure. Exploiting both aerial and terrestrial resources in service composition increases coverage and facilitates the use of full computing and communication potentials. This paper proposes a service placement and composition mechanism for integrated aerial-terrestrial networks over the edge-cloud continuum while considering the dynamic nature of the network. The service function placement and service orchestration are modeled in an optimization framework. Considering the dynamicity, the Aerial Base Station (ABS) trajectory might not be deterministic, and their mobility pattern might not be known as assumed knowledge. Also, service requests can traverse through access nodes due to users' mobility. By incorporating predictive algorithms, including Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) approaches, the proposed method predicts ABS locations and service requests. Subsequently, a heuristic isomorphic graph matching approach is proposed to enable efficient, latency-aware service orchestration. Simulation results demonstrate the efficiency of the proposed prediction and service composition schemes in terms of accuracy, cost optimization, scalability, and responsiveness, ensuring timely and reliable service delivery under diverse network conditions.</description>

      <title>A Hybrid Semantic RAN Protocol Stack Design for 6G System and Its Implementation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.07829</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.07829v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recently, Semantic Communication (SC) has been recognized as a crucial new paradigm in 6G, significantly improving information transmission efficiency. However, the diverse range of service types in 6G networks, such as high-data-volume services like AR/VR/MR and low-data-volume applications requiring high accuracy, such as industrial control and data collection, presents significant challenges to fully replacing the fundamental technologies with SC. Therefore, we design a Hybrid Semantic Communication Ratio Access Network (HSC-RAN) protocol stack demo for 6G systems to achieve compatibility and smooth transition between SC and non-SC. Specifically, we take the Physical Downlink Shared Channel (PDSCH) as an example, to efficiently integrate SC with Orthogonal Frequency Division Multiplexing (OFDM). Furthermore, we introduce a novel Downlink Control Information (DCI) format that jointly supports SC and non-SC, enabling real-time video transmission via SC and text transmission through non-SC. Experimental results demonstrate that our approach allows simultaneous transmission of semantic and non-semantic information while maintaining high-quality reconstruction at the receiver.</description>

      <title>Self-organisation of common good usage and an application to Internet services</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.07175</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.07175v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Natural and human-made common goods present key challenges due to their susceptibility to degradation, overuse, or congestion. We explore the self-organisation of their usage when individuals have access to several available commons but limited information on them. We propose an extension of the Win-Stay, Lose-Shift (WSLS) strategy for such systems, under which individuals use a resource iteratively until they are unsuccessful and then shift randomly. This simple strategy leads to a distribution of the use of commons with an improvement against random shifting. Selective individuals who retain information on their usage and accordingly adapt their tolerance to failure in each common good improve the average experienced quality for an entire population. Hybrid systems of selective and non-selective individuals can lead to an equilibrium with equalised experienced quality akin to the ideal free distribution. We show that these results can be applied to the server selection problem faced by mobile users accessing Internet services and we perform realistic simulations to test their validity. Furthermore, these findings can be used to understand other real systems such as animal dispersal on grazing and foraging land, and to propose solutions to operators of systems of public transport or other technological commons.</description>

      <title>Leveraging Machine Learning Techniques in Intrusion Detection Systems for Internet of Things</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.07220</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.07220v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: As the Internet of Things (IoT) continues to expand, ensuring the security of connected devices has become increasingly critical. Traditional Intrusion Detection Systems (IDS) often fall short in managing the dynamic and large-scale nature of IoT networks. This paper explores how Machine Learning (ML) and Deep Learning (DL) techniques can significantly enhance IDS performance in IoT environments. We provide a thorough overview of various IDS deployment strategies and categorize the types of intrusions common in IoT systems. A range of ML methods -- including Support Vector Machines, Naive Bayes, K-Nearest Neighbors, Decision Trees, and Random Forests -- are examined alongside advanced DL models such as LSTM, CNN, Autoencoders, RNNs, and Deep Belief Networks. Each technique is evaluated based on its accuracy, efficiency, and suitability for real-world IoT applications. We also address major challenges such as high false positive rates, data imbalance, encrypted traffic analysis, and the resource constraints of IoT devices. In addition, we highlight the emerging role of Generative AI and Large Language Models (LLMs) in improving threat detection, automating responses, and generating intelligent security policies. Finally, we discuss ethical and privacy concerns, underscoring the need for responsible and transparent implementation. This paper aims to provide a comprehensive framework for developing adaptive, intelligent, and secure IDS solutions tailored for the evolving landscape of IoT.</description>

      <title>Prekey Pogo: Investigating Security and Privacy Issues in WhatsApp's Handshake Mechanism</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.07323</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.07323v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: WhatsApp, the world's largest messaging application, uses a version of the Signal protocol to provide end-to-end encryption (E2EE) with strong security guarantees, including Perfect Forward Secrecy (PFS). To ensure PFS right from the start of a new conversation -- even when the recipient is offline -- a stash of ephemeral (one-time) prekeys must be stored on a server. While the critical role of these one-time prekeys in achieving PFS has been outlined in the Signal specification, we are the first to demonstrate a targeted depletion attack against them on individual WhatsApp user devices. Our findings not only reveal an attack that can degrade PFS for certain messages, but also expose inherent privacy risks and serious availability implications arising from the refilling and distribution procedure essential for this security mechanism.</description>

      <title>Task-oriented Age of Information for Remote Inference with Hybrid Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.07428</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.07428v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have revolutionized the field of artificial intelligence (AI) through their advanced reasoning capabilities, but their extensive parameter sets introduce significant inference latency, posing a challenge to ensure the timeliness of inference results. While Small Language Models (SLMs) offer faster inference speeds with fewer parameters, they often compromise accuracy on complex tasks. This study proposes a novel remote inference system comprising a user, a sensor, and an edge server that integrates both model types alongside a decision maker. The system dynamically determines the resolution of images transmitted by the sensor and routes inference tasks to either an SLM or LLM to optimize performance. The key objective is to minimize the Task-oriented Age of Information (TAoI) by jointly considering the accuracy and timeliness of the inference task. Due to the non-uniform transmission time and inference time, we formulate this problem as a Semi-Markov Decision Process (SMDP). By converting the SMDP to an equivalent Markov decision process, we prove that the optimal control policy follows a threshold-based structure. We further develop a relative policy iteration algorithm leveraging this threshold property. Simulation results demonstrate that our proposed optimal policy significantly outperforms baseline approaches in managing the accuracy-timeliness trade-off.</description>

      <title>MUFFLER: Secure Tor Traffic Obfuscation with Dynamic Connection Shuffling and Splitting</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.07543</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.07543v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Tor, a widely utilized privacy network, enables anonymous communication but is vulnerable to flow correlation attacks that deanonymize users by correlating traffic patterns from Tor's ingress and egress segments. Various defenses have been developed to mitigate these attacks; however, they have two critical limitations: (i) significant network overhead during obfuscation and (ii) a lack of dynamic obfuscation for egress segments, exposing traffic patterns to adversaries. In response, we introduce MUFFLER, a novel connection-level traffic obfuscation system designed to secure Tor egress traffic. It dynamically maps real connections to a distinct set of virtual connections between the final Tor nodes and targeted services, either public or hidden. This approach creates egress traffic patterns fundamentally different from those at ingress segments without adding intentional padding bytes or timing delays. The mapping of real and virtual connections is adjusted in real-time based on ongoing network conditions, thwarting adversaries' efforts to detect egress traffic patterns. Extensive evaluations show that MUFFLER mitigates powerful correlation attacks with a TPR of 1% at an FPR of 10^-2 while imposing only a 2.17% bandwidth overhead. Moreover, it achieves up to 27x lower latency overhead than existing solutions and seamlessly integrates with the current Tor architecture.</description>

      <title>A Novel Energy-Efficient Cross-Layer Design for Scheduling and Routing in 6TiSCH Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.12949</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.12949v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The 6TiSCH protocol stack plays a vital role in enabling reliable and energy-efficient communications for the Industrial Internet of Things (IIoT). However, it faces challenges, including prolonged network formation, inefficient parent switching, high control packet overhead, and suboptimal resource utilization. To tackle these issues, we propose in this paper a novel cross-layer optimization framework aiming to enhance the coordination between the Scheduling Function (SF), the Routing Protocol for Low-Power and Lossy Networks (RPL), and queue management. Our solution introduces a slot-aware parent switching mechanism, early slot reservation to mitigate queue overflow, and a refined slot locking strategy to improve slot availability. To reduce control overhead, the proposed method merges 6P cell reservation information into RPL control packets (DIO/DAO), thus minimizing control exchanges during parent switching and node joining. Optimized slot selection further reduces latency and jitter. Through extensive simulations on the 6TiSCH simulator and under varying network densities and traffic loads, we demonstrate significant improvements over the standard 6TiSCH benchmark in terms of traffic load, joining time, latency, and energy efficiency. These enhancements make the proposed solution suitable for time-sensitive IIoT applications.</description>

      <title>PACIFISTA: Conflict Evaluation and Management in Open RAN</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.04395</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.04395v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The O-RAN ALLIANCE is defining architectures, interfaces, operations, and security requirements for cellular networks based on Open Radio Access Network (RAN) principles. In this context, O-RAN introduced the RAN Intelligent Controllers (RICs) to enable dynamic control of cellular networks via data-driven applications referred to as rApps and xApps. RICs enable for the first time truly intelligent and self-organizing cellular networks. However, enabling the execution of many Artificial Intelligence (AI) algorithms making autonomous control decisions to fulfill diverse (and possibly conflicting) goals poses unprecedented challenges. For instance, the execution of one xApp aiming at maximizing throughput and one aiming at minimizing energy consumption would inevitably result in diametrically opposed resource allocation strategies. Therefore, conflict management becomes a crucial component of any functional intelligent O-RAN system. This article studies the problem of conflict mitigation in O-RAN and proposes PACIFISTA, a framework to detect, characterize, and mitigate conflicts generated by O-RAN applications that control RAN parameters. PACIFISTA leverages a profiling pipeline to tests O-RAN applications in a sandbox environment, and combines hierarchical graphs with statistical models to detect the existence of conflicts and evaluate their severity. Experiments on Colosseum and OpenRAN Gym demonstrate PACIFISTA's ability to predict conflicts and provide valuable information before conflicting xApps are deployed on production. We demonstrate that users can experience a 16% throughput loss even in the case of xApps with similar goals, and that applications with conflicting goals might cause instability and result in up to 30% performance degradation. We also show that PACIFISTA can help operators to identify conflicting applications and maintain performance degradation at bay.</description>

      <title>Scheduling Policies in a Multi-Source Status Update System with Dedicated and Shared Servers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.21246</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.21246v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Use of multi-path network topologies has become a prominent technique to assert timeliness in terms of age of information (AoI) and to improve resilience to link disruptions in communication systems. However, establishing multiple dedicated communication links among network nodes is a costly endeavor. Therefore, quite often, these secondary communication links are shared among multiple entities. Moreover, these multi-path networks come with the added challenge of out-of-order transmissions. In this paper, we study an amalgamation of the above two aspects, i.e., multi-path transmissions and link sharing. In contrast to the existing literature where the main focus has been scheduling multiple sources on a single shared server, we delve into the realm where each source sharing the shared server is also supplemented with its dedicated server so as to improve its timeliness. In this multi-path link sharing setting with generate-at-will transmissions, we first present the optimal probabilistic scheduler, and then propose several heuristic-based cyclic scheduling algorithms for the shared server, to minimize the weighted average age of information of the sources.</description>
