      <title>Unified Far-Field and Near-Field in Holographic MIMO: A Wavenumber-Domain Perspective</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.14815</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.14815v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This article conceives a unified representation for near-field and far-field holographic multiple-input multiple-output (HMIMO) channels, addressing a practical design dilemma: "Why does the angular-domain representation no longer function effectively?" To answer this question, we pivot from the angular domain to the wavenumber domain and present a succinct overview of its underlying philosophy. In re-examining the Fourier plane-wave series expansion that recasts spherical propagation waves into a series of plane waves represented by Fourier harmonics, we characterize the HMIMO channel employing these Fourier harmonics having different wavenumbers. This approach, referred to as the wavenumebr-domain representation, facilitates a unified view across the far-field and the near-field. Furthermore, the limitations of the DFT basis are demonstrated when identifying the sparsity inherent to the HMIMO channel, motivating the development of a wavenumber-domain basis as an alternative. We then present some preliminary applications of the proposed wavenumber-domain basis in signal processing across both the far-field and near-field, along with several prospects for future HMIMO system designs based on the wavenumber domain.</description>

      <title>Rate Splitting Multiple Access: Optimal Beamforming Structure and Efficient Optimization Algorithms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.14890</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.14890v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Joint optimization for common rate allocation and beamforming design have been widely studied in rate splitting multiple access (RSMA) empowered multiuser multi-antenna transmission networks. Due to the highly coupled optimization variables and non-convexity of the joint optimization problems, emerging algorithms such as weighted minimum mean square error (WMMSE) and successive convex approximation (SCA) have been applied to RSMA which typically approximate the original problem with a sequence of disciplined convex subproblems and solve each subproblem by an optimization toolbox. While these approaches are capable of finding a viable solution, they are unable to offer a comprehensive understanding of the solution structure and are burdened by high computational complexity. In this work, for the first time, we identify the optimal beamforming structure and common rate allocation for the weighted sum-rate (WSR) maximization problem of RSMA. We then propose a computationally efficient optimization algorithm that jointly optimizes the beamforming and common rate allocation without relying on any toolbox. Specifically, we first approximate the original WSR maximization problem with a sequence of convex subproblems based on fractional programming (FP). Numerical results show that the proposed algorithm achieves the same performance but takes only 0.5\% or less simulation time compared with the state-of-the-art WMMSE, SCA, and FP algorithms. Experimental results show that the proposed two methods have similar mean square error (MSE) performance compared with traditional method using CVX optimization tool, however, computational complexities are greatly reduced. The proposed algorithms pave the way for the practical and efficient optimization algorithm design for RSMA and its applications in 6G.</description>

      <title>Stacked Intelligent Metasurfaces for Task-Oriented Semantic Communications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.15053</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.15053v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Semantic communication leveraging advanced deep learning (DL) technologies enhances the efficiency, reliability, and security of information transmission. Emerging stacked intelligent metasurface (SIM) having a diffractive neural network (DNN) architecture allows performing complex calculations at the speed of light. In this letter, we introduce an innovative SIM-aided semantic communication system for image recognition tasks. In the considered model, a SIM is positioned in front of the transmitting antenna. In contrast to conventional communication systems transmitting the modulated signals carrying the image information or compressed semantic information, the carrier electromagnetic (EM) wave is directly transmitted from the source in the proposed system. The input layer of the SIM is utilized for source encoding, while the remaining multi-layer architecture constitutes a DNN for semantic encoding. Specifically, the semantic encoder aims to transform the signals passing through the input layer of the SIM into a unique beam towards a receiving antenna corresponding to the image class. Remarkably, both the source and semantic encoding occur naturally as the EM waves propagate through the SIM. At the receiver, the image is recognized by probing the received signal magnitude across the receiving array. To this end, we develop an efficient algorithm to train the transmission coefficients of SIM's meta-atoms to learn the semantic representation of the image. Extensive numerical results verify the effectiveness of utilizing the SIM-based DNN for image recognition task-oriented semantic communications, achieving more than 90% recognition accuracy.</description>

      <title>Lifted Hamming and Simplex Codes and Their Designs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.15104</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.15104v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A generator matrix of a linear code $\C$ over $\gf(q)$ is also a matrix of the same rank $k$ over any extension field $\gf(q^\ell)$ and generates a linear code of the same length, same dimension and same minimum distance over $\gf(q^\ell)$, denoted by $\C(q|q^\ell)$ and called a lifted code of $\C$. Although $\C$ and their lifted codes $\C(q|q^\ell)$ have the same parameters, they have different weight distributions and different applications. Few results about lifted linear codes are known in the literature. This paper proves some fundamental theory for lifted linear codes, settles the weight distributions of lifted Hamming codes and lifted Simplex codes, and investigates the $2$-designs supported by the lifted Hamming and Simplex codes. Infinite families of $2$-designs are obtained. In addition, an infinite family of two-weight codes and an infinite family of three-weight codes are presented.</description>

      <title>Integrated Access and Backhaul (IAB) in Low Altitude Platforms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.15463</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.15463v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we explore the problem of utilizing Integrated Access and Backhaul (IAB) technology in Non-Terrestrial Networks (NTN), with a particular focus on aerial access networks. We consider an Uncrewed Aerial Vehicle (UAV)-based wireless network comprised of two layers of UAVs: (a) a lower layer consisting a number of flying users and a UAV Base Station (BS) that provides coverage for terrestrial users and, (b) an upper layer designated to provide both wireless access for flying users and backhaul connectivity for UAV BS. By adopting IAB technology, the backhaul and access links collaboratively share their resources, enabling aerial backhauling and the utilization of the same infrastructure and frequency resources for access links. A sum-rate maximization problem is formulated by considering aerial backhaul constraints to optimally allocate the frequency spectrum between aerial and terrestrial networks. We decompose the resulting non-convex optimization problem into two sub-problems of beamforming and spectrum allocation and then propose efficient solutions for each. Numerical results in different scenarios yield insightful findings about the effectiveness of using the IAB technique in aerial networks.</description>

      <title>Hybrid STAR-RIS Enabled Integrated Sensing and Communication</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.15570</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.15570v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) is recognized as one of the key enabling technologies for sixth-generation (6G) wireless communication networks, facilitating diverse emerging applications and services in an energy and cost-efficient manner. This paper proposes a multi-user multi-target ISAC system to enable full-space coverage for communication and sensing tasks. The proposed system employs a hybrid simultaneous transmission and reflection reconfigurable intelligent surface (STAR-RIS) comprising active transmissive and passive reflective elements. In the proposed scheme, the passive reflective elements support communication and sensing links for nearby communication users and sensing targets, while low-power active transmissive elements are deployed to improve sensing performance and overcome high path attenuation due to multi-hop transmission for remote targets. Moreover, to optimize the transmissive/reflective coefficients of the hybrid STAR-RIS, a semi-definite relaxation (SDR)-based algorithm is proposed. Furthermore, to evaluate sensing performance, signal-to-interference-noise ratio (SINR) and Cramer-Rao bound (CRB) metrics have been derived and investigated via conducting extensive computer simulations.</description>

      <title>Self-Sustainable Metasurface-Assisted mmWave Indoor Communication System</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.15729</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.15729v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the design of a metasurface-assisted system for indoor environments, it is essential to take into account not only the performance gains and coverage extension provided by the metasurface but also the operating costs brought by its reconfigurability, such as powering and cabling. These costs can present challenges, particularly in indoor dense spaces (IDSs). A self-sustainable metasurface (SSM), which retains reconfigurability unlike a static metasurface (SMS), achieves a lower operating cost than a reconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS) by being self-sustainable through power harvesting. In this paper, in order to find a better trade-off between metasurface gain, coverage, and operating cost, the design and performance of an SSM-assisted indoor mmWave communication system are investigated. We first simplify the design of the SSM-assisted system by considering the use of SSMs in a preset-based manner and the formation of coverage groups by associating SSMs with the closest user equipments (UEs). We propose a two-stage iterative algorithm to maximize the minimum data rate in the system by jointly deciding the association between the UEs and the SSMs, the phase-shifts of the SSMs, and allocating time resources for each UE. The non-convexities that exist in the proposed optimization problem are tackled using the feasible point pursuit successive convex approximation method and the concave-convex procedure. To understand the best scenario for using SSM, the resulting performance is compared with that achieved with RIS and SMS. Our numerical results indicate that SSMs are best utilized in a small environment where self-sustainability is easier to achieve when the budget for operating costs is tight.</description>

      <title>Enhanced Achievable DoF Bounds for Cache-Aided MIMO Communication Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.15743</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.15743v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Integrating coded caching (CC) into multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) communications may significantly enhance the achievable degrees of freedom (DoF) of the wireless networks. In this paper, we consider a cache-aided MIMO configuration with a CC gain $t$, where a server with $L$ Tx antennas communicates with $K$ users, each with $G$ Rx antennas. In the proposed content-aware MIMO strategy, we carefully adjust the number of users $\Omega$ and the number of parallel streams decoded by each user $\beta$ served in each transmission to maximize the DoF. As a result, we achieve a DoF of ${\max_{\beta, \Omega }}{\Omega \beta}$, where ${\beta \le \mathrm{min}\big(G,\frac{L \binom{\Omega-1}{t}}{1 + (\Omega - t-1)\binom{\Omega-1}{t}}\big)}$. To prove the achievability of the proposed DoF bound, we provide a novel transmission strategy based on the simultaneous unicasting of multiple data streams. In this strategy, the missing data packets are scheduled such that the number of parallel streams per transmission is maximized while the decodability of all useful terms by each target user is guaranteed. Numerical simulations validate the findings, confirming the enhanced DoF and improved performance of the proposed design.</description>

      <title>Broad and Spectral-Efficient Beamforming for the Uni-polarized Reconfigurable Intelligent Surfaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.15752</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.15752v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A reconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS) is composed of low-cost elements that manipulate the propagation environment from a transmitter by intelligently applying phase shifts to incoming signals before they are reflected. This paper explores a uni-polarized RIS with linear shape aimed at transmitting a common signal to multiple user equipments (UEs) spread across a wide angular region. To achieve uniform coverage, the uni-polarized RIS is designed to emit a broad and spectral-efficient beam featuring a spatially flat-like array factor, diverging from the conventional narrow beam approach. To achieve this objective, we start by deriving probabilistic lower and upper bounds for the average spectral efficiency (SE) delivered to the UEs. Leveraging the insights from the lower bound, we focus on optimizing the minimum value of the power domain array factor (PDAF) across a range of azimuth angles from \(-\frac{\pi}{2}\) to \(\frac{\pi}{2}\). We employ the continuous genetic algorithm (CGA) for this optimization task, aiming to improve the SE delivered to the UEs while also creating a wide beam. Extensive simulation experiments are carried out to assess the performance of the proposed code, focusing on key metrics such as the minimum and average values of the PDAF and the SE delivered to the UEs. Our findings demonstrate that the proposed code enhances the minimum SE delivered to the UEs while maintaining the desired attribute of a broad beam. This performance is notably superior to that of established codes, including the Barker, Frank, and Chu codes.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.15782v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Reconfigurable intelligent surfaces (RISs) have emerged as a promising technology in wireless communications. Simultaneously transmitting and reflecting RIS (STAR-RISs) in particular have garnered significant attention due to their dual capabilities of simultaneous transmission and reflection, underscoring their potential applications in critical scenarios within the forthcoming sixth-generation (6G) technology landscape. Moreover, full-duplex (FD) systems have emerged as a breakthrough research direction in wireless transmission technology due to their high spectral efficiency. This paper explores the application potential of STAR-RIS in FD systems for future wireless communications, presenting an innovative technology that provides robust self-interference cancellation (SIC) capabilities for FD systems. We utilize the refraction functionality of STAR-RIS enhances the transmission capacity of FD systems, while its reflection functionality is used to eliminate self interference within the FD system. We delve into the applications of two different types of STAR-RIS in FD systems and compare their performance through simulations. Furthermore, we discuss the performance differences of STAR-RIS empowered FD systems under various configurations in a case study, and demonstrate the superiority of the proposed deep learning-based optimization algorithm. Finally, we discuss possible future research directions for STAR-RIS empowered FD systems.</description>

      <title>More on the sum-freedom of the multiplicative inverse function</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.14660</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.14660v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In two papers entitled ``Two generalizations of almost perfect nonlinearity" and ``On the vector subspaces of $\mathbb F_{2^n}$ over which the multiplicative inverse function sums to zero", the first author has introduced and studied the notion of sum-freedom of vectorial functions, which expresses that a function sums to nonzero values over all affine subspaces of $\Bbb F_{2^n}$ of a given dimension $k\geq 2$, and he then focused on the $k$th order sum-freedom of the multiplicative inverse function $x\in \Bbb F_{2^n}\mapsto x^{2^n-2}$. Some general results were given for this function (in particular, the case of affine spaces that do not contain 0 was solved positively), and the cases of $k\in \{3,n-3\}$ and of $k$ not co-prime with $n$ were solved as well (negatively); but the cases of those linear subspaces of dimension $k\in [\![ 4;n-4]\!]$, co-prime with $n$, were left open. The present paper is a continuation of the previous work. After studying, from two different angles, the particular case of those linear subspaces that are stable under the Frobenius automorphism, we deduce from the second approach that, for $k$ small enough (approximately, $3\le k\leq n/10$), the multiplicative inverse function is not $k$th order sum-free. Finally, we extend a result previously obtained in the second paper mentioned above, and we deduce in particular that, for any even $n$ and every $2\leq k\leq n-2$, the multiplicative inverse function is not $k$th order sum-free.</description>

      <title>Data Augmentation in Graph Neural Networks: The Role of Generated Synthetic Graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.14765</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.14765v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Graphs are crucial for representing interrelated data and aiding predictive modeling by capturing complex relationships. Achieving high-quality graph representation is important for identifying linked patterns, leading to improvements in Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) to better capture data structures. However, challenges such as data scarcity, high collection costs, and ethical concerns limit progress. As a result, generative models and data augmentation have become more and more popular. This study explores using generated graphs for data augmentation, comparing the performance of combining generated graphs with real graphs, and examining the effect of different quantities of generated graphs on graph classification tasks. The experiments show that balancing scalability and quality requires different generators based on graph size. Our results introduce a new approach to graph data augmentation, ensuring consistent labels and enhancing classification performance.</description>

      <title>Channel Shaping Using Beyond Diagonal Reconfigurable Intelligent Surface: Analysis, Optimization, and Enhanced Flexibility</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.15196</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.15196v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper investigates the capability of a passive Reconfigurable Intelligent Surface (RIS) to redistribute the singular values of point-to-point Multiple-Input Multiple-Output (MIMO) channels for achieving power and rate gains. We depart from the conventional Diagonal (D)-RIS with diagonal phase shift matrix and adopt a Beyond Diagonal (BD) architecture that offers greater wave manipulation flexibility through element-wise connections. Specifically, we first provide shaping insights by characterizing the channel singular value regions attainable by D-RIS and BD-RIS via a novel geodesic optimization. Analytical singular value bounds are then derived to explore their shaping limits in typical deployment scenarios. As a side product, we tackle BD-RIS-aided MIMO rate maximization problem by a local-optimal Alternating Optimization (AO) and a shaping-inspired low-complexity approach. Results show that compared to D-RIS, BD-RIS significantly improves the dynamic range of all channel singular values, the trade-off in manipulating them, and thus the channel power and achievable rate. Those observations become more pronounced when the number of RIS elements and MIMO dimensions increase. Of particular interest, BD-RIS is shown to activate multi-stream transmission at lower transmit power than D-RIS, hence achieving the asymptotic Degrees of Freedom (DoF) at low Signal-to-Noise Ratio (SNR) thanks to its higher flexibility of shaping the distribution of channel singular values.</description>

      <title>Movable Antenna-Enhanced Wireless Communications: General Architectures and Implementation Methods</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.15448</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.15448v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Movable antennas (MAs), traditionally explored in antenna design, have recently garnered significant attention in wireless communications due to their ability to dynamically adjust the antenna positions to changes in the propagation environment. However, previous research has primarily focused on characterizing the performance limits of various MA-assisted wireless communication systems, with less emphasis on their practical implementation. To address this gap, in this article, we propose several general MA architectures that extend existing designs by varying several key aspects to cater to different application scenarios and tradeoffs between cost and performance. Additionally, we draw from fields such as antenna design and mechanical control to provide an overview of candidate implementation methods for the proposed MA architectures, utilizing either direct mechanical or equivalent electronic control. Simulation results are finally presented to support our discussion.</description>

      <title>PyJama: Differentiable Jamming and Anti-Jamming with NVIDIA Sionna</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.15473</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.15473v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Despite extensive research on jamming attacks on wireless communication systems, the potential of machine learning for amplifying the threat of such attacks, or our ability to mitigate them, remains largely untapped. A key obstacle to such research has been the absence of a suitable framework. To resolve this obstacle, we release PyJama, a fully-differentiable open-source library that adds jamming and anti-jamming functionality to NVIDIA Sionna. We demonstrate the utility of PyJama (i) for realistic MIMO simulations by showing examples that involve forward error correction, OFDM waveforms in time and frequency, realistic channel models, and mobility; and (ii) for learning to jam. Specifically, we use stochastic gradient descent to optimize jamming power allocation over an OFDM resource grid. The learned strategies are non-trivial, intelligible, and effective.</description>

      <title>Fundamental Limits of Prompt Compression: A Rate-Distortion Framework for Black-Box Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.15504</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.15504v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We formalize the problem of prompt compression for large language models (LLMs) and present a framework to unify token-level prompt compression methods which create hard prompts for black-box models. We derive the distortion-rate function for this setup as a linear program, and provide an efficient algorithm to compute this fundamental limit via the dual of the linear program. Using the distortion-rate function as the baseline, we study the performance of existing compression schemes on a synthetic dataset consisting of prompts generated from a Markov chain, natural language queries, and their respective answers. Our empirical analysis demonstrates the criticality of query-aware prompt compression, where the compressor has knowledge of the downstream task/query for the black-box LLM. We show that there is a large gap between the performance of current prompt compression methods and the optimal strategy, and propose a query-aware, variable-rate adaptation of a prior work to close the gap. We extend our experiments to a small natural language dataset to further confirm our findings on our synthetic dataset.</description>

      <title>A New Theoretical Perspective on Data Heterogeneity in Federated Optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.15567</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.15567v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In federated learning (FL), data heterogeneity is the main reason that existing theoretical analyses are pessimistic about the convergence rate. In particular, for many FL algorithms, the convergence rate grows dramatically when the number of local updates becomes large, especially when the product of the gradient divergence and local Lipschitz constant is large. However, empirical studies can show that more local updates can improve the convergence rate even when these two parameters are large, which is inconsistent with the theoretical findings. This paper aims to bridge this gap between theoretical understanding and practical performance by providing a theoretical analysis from a new perspective on data heterogeneity. In particular, we propose a new and weaker assumption compared to the local Lipschitz gradient assumption, named the heterogeneity-driven pseudo-Lipschitz assumption. We show that this and the gradient divergence assumptions can jointly characterize the effect of data heterogeneity. By deriving a convergence upper bound for FedAvg and its extensions, we show that, compared to the existing works, local Lipschitz constant is replaced by the much smaller heterogeneity-driven pseudo-Lipschitz constant and the corresponding convergence upper bound can be significantly reduced for the same number of local updates, although its order stays the same. In addition, when the local objective function is quadratic, more insights on the impact of data heterogeneity can be obtained using the heterogeneity-driven pseudo-Lipschitz constant. For example, we can identify a region where FedAvg can outperform mini-batch SGD even when the gradient divergence can be arbitrarily large. Our findings are validated using experiments.</description>

      <title>Neural-based Video Compression on Solar Dynamics Observatory Images</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.15730v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: NASA's Solar Dynamics Observatory (SDO) mission collects extensive data to monitor the Sun's daily activity. In the realm of space mission design, data compression plays a crucial role in addressing the challenges posed by limited telemetry rates. The primary objective of data compression is to facilitate efficient data management and transmission to work within the constrained bandwidth, thereby ensuring that essential information is captured while optimizing the utilization of available resources. This paper introduces a neural video compression technique that achieves a high compression ratio for the SDO's image data collection. The proposed approach focuses on leveraging both temporal and spatial redundancies in the data, leading to a more efficient compression. In this work, we introduce an architecture based on the Transformer model, which is specifically designed to capture both local and global information from input images in an effective and efficient manner. Additionally, our network is equipped with an entropy model that can accurately model the probability distribution of the latent representations and improves the speed of the entropy decoding step. The entropy model leverages a channel-dependent approach and utilizes checkerboard-shaped local and global spatial contexts. By combining the Transformer-based video compression network with our entropy model, the proposed compression algorithm demonstrates superior performance over traditional video codecs like H.264 and H.265, as confirmed by our experimental results.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.15740v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a new distinguisher for alternant and Goppa codes, whose complexity is subexponential in the code length. It does not suffer from the strong regime limitations of the previous distinguishers or structure recovery algorithms: in particular, it applies to the codes used in the Classic McEliece candidate for postquantum cryptography standardization. The invariants that allow us to distinguish are graded Betti numbers of the homogeneous coordinate ring of a shortening of the dual code.
  Since its introduction in 1978, this is the first time an analysis of the McEliece cryptosystem breaks the exponential barrier.</description>

      <title>Diffusion Model Based Resource Allocation Strategy in Ultra-Reliable Wireless Networked Control Systems</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.15784v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Diffusion models are vastly used in generative AI, leveraging their capability to capture complex data distributions. However, their potential remains largely unexplored in the field of resource allocation in wireless networks. This paper introduces a novel diffusion model-based resource allocation strategy for Wireless Networked Control Systems (WNCSs) with the objective of minimizing total power consumption through the optimization of the sampling period in the control system, and blocklength and packet error probability in the finite blocklength regime of the communication system. The problem is first reduced to the optimization of blocklength only based on the derivation of the optimality conditions. Then, the optimization theory solution collects a dataset of channel gains and corresponding optimal blocklengths. Finally, the Denoising Diffusion Probabilistic Model (DDPM) uses this collected dataset to train the resource allocation algorithm that generates optimal blocklength values conditioned on the channel state information (CSI). Via extensive simulations, the proposed approach is shown to outperform previously proposed Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) based approaches with close to optimal performance regarding total power consumption. Moreover, an improvement of up to eighteen-fold in the reduction of critical constraint violations is observed, further underscoring the accuracy of the solution.</description>

      <title>A Generalized Nyquist-Shannon Sampling Theorem Using the Koopman Operator</title>

      <description>arXiv:2303.01927v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In the field of signal processing, the sampling theorem plays a fundamental role for signal reconstruction as it bridges the gap between analog and digital signals. Following the celebrated Nyquist-Shannon sampling theorem, generalizing the sampling theorem to non-band-limited signals remains a major challenge. In this work, a generalized sampling theorem, which builds upon the Koopman operator, is proposed for signals in a generator-bounded space. It naturally extends the Nyquist-Shannon sampling theorem in that: 1) for band-limited signals, the lower bounds of the sampling frequency and the reconstruction formulas given by these two theorems are exactly the same; 2) the Koopman operator-based sampling theorem can also provide a finite bound of the sampling frequency and a reconstruction formula for certain types of non-band-limited signals, which cannot be addressed by Nyquist-Shannon sampling theorem. These non-band-limited signals include, but are not limited to, the inverse Laplace transform with limit imaginary interval of integration, and linear combinations of complex exponential functions. Furthermore, the Koopman operator-based reconstruction method is supported by theoretical results on its convergence. This method is illustrated numerically through several examples, demonstrating its robustness against low sampling frequencies.</description>

      <title>Average Probability of Error for Single Uniprior Index Coding over Rayleigh Fading Channel</title>

      <description>arXiv:2303.10460v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Ong and Ho developed optimal linear index codes for single uniprior index coding problems (ICPs) by finding a spanning tree for each of the strongly connected components of the corresponding information-flow graphs, following which Thomas et al. considered the same class of ICPs over Rayleigh fading channel. They developed the min-max probability of error criterion for choosing an index code which minimized the probability of error at the receivers and showed that there always exist optimal linear index codes for which any receiver takes at most two transmissions to decode a requested message. Motivated by the above works, this paper considers single uniprior ICPs over Rayleigh fading channels for which minimizing average probability of error is shown to be a criterion for further selection of index codes. The optimal index code w.r.t this criterion is shown to be one that minimizes the total number of transmissions used for decoding the message requests at all the receivers. An algorithm that generates a spanning tree which has a lower value of this metric as compared to the optimal star graph is also presented. For a given set of parameters of single uniprior ICPs, a lower bound for the total number of transmissions used by any optimal index code is derived, and a class of ICPs for which this bound is tight is identified.</description>

      <title>Bayes-Optimal Estimation in Generalized Linear Models via Spatial Coupling</title>

      <description>arXiv:2309.08404v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider the problem of signal estimation in a generalized linear model (GLM). GLMs include many canonical problems in statistical estimation, such as linear regression, phase retrieval, and 1-bit compressed sensing. Recent work has precisely characterized the asymptotic minimum mean-squared error (MMSE) for GLMs with i.i.d. Gaussian sensing matrices. However, in many models there is a significant gap between the MMSE and the performance of the best known feasible estimators. In this work, we address this issue by considering GLMs defined via spatially coupled sensing matrices. We propose an efficient approximate message passing (AMP) algorithm for estimation and prove that with a simple choice of spatially coupled design, the MSE of a carefully tuned AMP estimator approaches the asymptotic MMSE in the high-dimensional limit. To prove the result, we first rigorously characterize the asymptotic performance of AMP for a GLM with a generic spatially coupled design. This characterization is in terms of a deterministic recursion (`state evolution') that depends on the parameters defining the spatial coupling. Then, using a simple spatially coupled design and a judicious choice of functions for the AMP algorithm, we analyze the fixed points of the resulting state evolution and show that it achieves the asymptotic MMSE. Numerical results for phase retrieval and rectified linear regression show that spatially coupled designs can yield substantially lower MSE than i.i.d. Gaussian designs at finite dimensions when used with AMP algorithms.</description>

      <title>Time-Domain Channel Measurements and Small-Scale Fading Characterization for RIS-Assisted Wireless Communication Systems</title>

      <description>arXiv:2309.15776v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Reconfigurable intelligent surfaces (RISs) have attracted extensive attention from industry and academia. In RIS-assisted wireless communication systems, practical channel measurements and modeling serve as the foundation for system design, network optimization, and performance evaluation. In this paper, a RIS time-domain channel measurement system, based on a software defined radio platform, is developed for the first time to investigate the small-scale fading characteristics of RIS-assisted channels. We present RIS channel measurements in corridor and laboratory scenarios and compare the power delay profile of the channel without RIS, with RIS specular reflection, and with RIS intelligent reflection. The multipath component parameters and cluster parameters based on the Saleh-Valenzuela model are extracted. We find that the power delay profiles (PDPs) of the RIS-assisted channel fit the power-law decay model better than the common exponential decay model and approximate the law of square decay. Through intelligent reflection, the RIS can decrease the delay and concentrate the energy of the virtual line-of-sight (VLoS) path, thereby reducing the delay spread and mitigating multipath fading. Furthermore, the cluster characteristics of RIS-assisted channels are highly dependent on the measurement environment. In the laboratory scenario, a single cluster dominated by the VLoS path with smooth envelope is observed. On the other hand, in the corridor scenario, some additional clusters introduced by the RIS reflection are created.</description>

      <title>Wavefront Transformation-based Near-field Channel Prediction for Extremely Large Antenna Array with Mobility</title>

      <description>arXiv:2312.02175v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper addresses the mobility problem in extremely large antenna array (ELAA) communication systems. In order to account for the performance loss caused by the spherical wavefront of ELAA in the mobility scenario, we propose a wavefront transformation-based matrix pencil (WTMP) channel prediction method. In particular, we design a matrix to transform the spherical wavefront into a new wavefront, which is closer to the plane wave. We also design a time-frequency projection matrix to capture the time-varying path delay. Furthermore, we adopt the matrix pencil (MP) method to estimate channel parameters. Our proposed WTMP method can mitigate the effect of near-field radiation when predicting future channels. Theoretical analysis shows that the designed matrix is asymptotically determined by the angles and distance between the base station (BS) antenna array and the scatterers or the user when the number of BS antennas is large enough. For an ELAA communication system in the mobility scenario, we prove that the prediction error converges to zero with the increasing number of BS antennas. Simulation results demonstrate that our designed transform matrix efficiently mitigates the near-field effect, and that our proposed WTMP method can overcome the ELAA mobility challenge and approach the performance in stationary setting.</description>

Abstract: Accurate localization of mobile terminals is crucial for integrated sensing and communication systems. Existing fingerprint localization methods, which deduce coordinates from channel information in pre-defined rectangular areas, struggle with the heterogeneous fingerprint distribution inherent in non-line-of-sight (NLOS) scenarios. To address the problem, we introduce a novel multi-source information fusion learning framework referred to as the Autosync Multi-Domain NLOS Localization (AMDNLoc). Specifically, AMDNLoc employs a two-stage matched filter fused with a target tracking algorithm and iterative centroid-based clustering to automatically and irregularly segment NLOS regions, ensuring uniform fingerprint distribution within channel state information across frequency, power, and time-delay domains. Additionally, the framework utilizes a segment-specific linear classifier array, coupled with deep residual network-based feature extraction and fusion, to establish the correlation function between fingerprint features and coordinates within these regions. Simulation results demonstrate that AMDNLoc significantly enhances localization accuracy by over 40\% compared with traditional convolutional neural networks on the wireless artificial intelligence research dataset.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.04733v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we study the sample complexity and develop efficient optimal algorithms for 1-bit phase retrieval: recovering a signal $\mathbf{x}\in\mathbb{R}^n$ from $m$ phaseless bits $\{\mathrm{sign}(|\mathbf{a}_i^\top\mathbf{x}|-\tau)\}_{i=1}^m$ generated by standard Gaussian $\mathbf{a}_i$s. By investigating a phaseless version of random hyperplane tessellation, we show that (constrained) hamming distance minimization uniformly recovers all unstructured signals with Euclidean norm bounded away from zero and infinity to the error $\mathcal{O}((n/m)\log(m/n))$, and $\mathcal{O}((k/m)\log(mn/k^2))$ when restricting to $k$-sparse signals. Both error rates are shown to be information-theoretically optimal, up to a logarithmic factor. Intriguingly, the optimal rate for sparse recovery matches that of 1-bit compressed sensing, suggesting that the phase information is non-essential for 1-bit compressed sensing. We also develop efficient algorithms for 1-bit (sparse) phase retrieval that can achieve these error rates. Specifically, we prove that (thresholded) gradient descent with respect to the one-sided $\ell_1$-loss, when initialized via spectral methods, converges linearly and attains the near optimal reconstruction error, with sample complexity $\mathcal{O}(n)$ for unstructured signals and $\mathcal{O}(k^2\log(n)\log^2(m/k))$ for $k$-sparse signals. Our proof is based upon the observation that a certain local (restricted) approximate invertibility condition is respected by Gaussian measurements.</description>

      <title>Lossless Image Compression Using Multi-level Dictionaries: Binary Images</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.03087v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Lossless image compression is required in various applications to reduce storage or transmission costs of images, while requiring the reconstructed images to have zero information loss compared to the original. Existing lossless image compression methods either have simple design but poor compression performance, or complex design, better performance, but with no performance guarantees. In our endeavor to develop a lossless image compression method with low complexity and guaranteed performance, we argue that compressibility of a color image is essentially derived from the patterns in its spatial structure, intensity variations, and color variations. Thus, we divide the overall design of a lossless image compression scheme into three parts that exploit corresponding redundancies. We further argue that the binarized version of an image captures its fundamental spatial structure. In this first part of our work, we propose a scheme for lossless compression of binary images.
  The proposed scheme first learns dictionaries of $16\times16$, $8\times8$, $4\times4$, and $2\times 2$ square pixel patterns from various datasets of binary images. It then uses these dictionaries to encode binary images. These dictionaries have various interesting properties that are further exploited to construct an efficient and scalable scheme. Our preliminary results show that the proposed scheme consistently outperforms existing conventional and learning based lossless compression approaches, and provides, on average, as much as $1.5\times$ better performance than a common general purpose lossless compression scheme (WebP), more than $3\times$ better performance than a state of the art learning based scheme, and better performance than a specialized scheme for binary image compression (JBIG2).</description>

Abstract: The global 6G vision has taken its shape after years of international research and development efforts. This work culminated in ITU-R's Recommendation on "IMT-2030 Framework". While the definition phase of technological requirements is currently ongoing, 3GPP's standardization process on 6G networks is expected to start in 2025 and worldwide commercialization around 2030. This article serves as a comprehensive guide to 6G by providing an overall vision, a contemporary survey of the main literature, and an informative tutorial-type presentation style. In our vision, 6G will be based on three fundamental elements: wireless, artificial intelligence (AI), and the Internet of Everything (IoE). Consequently, 6G can ultimately become the Intelligent Network of Everything while serving as an enabling platform for the next major disruption in mobile communication, called mobile intelligence. The potential of mobile intelligence is that anything can be made connected, intelligent, and aware of its environment. This will revolutionize the way how devices, systems, and applications are designed; how they operate and interact with humans and each other; and how they can be used for the benefit of people, society, and the world in general. After high-level visioning, the main details of 6G are discussed, including fundamental elements, disruptive applications, key use cases, main performance requirements, potential technologies, and defining features. A special focus is given to a comprehensive set of potential 6G technologies, each of which is introduced in a tutorial manner. Finally, we speculate on what comes after 6G and sketch the first high-level vision of 7G. All in all, the objective of this article is to provide a thorough guide to 6G in order to serve as a source of knowledge and inspiration for further research and development work in academia, industry, and standardization bodies.</description>

      <title>Spectrum-Aware Debiasing: A Modern Inference Framework with Applications to Principal Components Regression</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.07810</link>
      <description>arXiv:2309.07810v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Debiasing is a fundamental concept in high-dimensional statistics. While degrees-of-freedom adjustment is the state-of-the-art technique in high-dimensional linear regression, it is limited to i.i.d. samples and sub-Gaussian covariates. These constraints hinder its broader practical use. Here, we introduce Spectrum-Aware Debiasing--a novel method for high-dimensional regression. Our approach applies to problems with structured dependencies, heavy tails, and low-rank structures. Our method achieves debiasing through a rescaled gradient descent step, deriving the rescaling factor using spectral information of the sample covariance matrix. The spectrum-based approach enables accurate debiasing in much broader contexts. We study the common modern regime where the number of features and samples scale proportionally. We establish asymptotic normality of our proposed estimator (suitably centered and scaled) under various convergence notions when the covariates are right-rotationally invariant. Such designs have garnered recent attention due to their crucial role in compressed sensing. Furthermore, we devise a consistent estimator for its asymptotic variance.
  Our work has two notable by-products: first, we use Spectrum-Aware Debiasing to correct bias in principal components regression (PCR), providing the first debiased PCR estimator in high dimensions. Second, we introduce a principled test for checking alignment between the signal and the eigenvectors of the sample covariance matrix. This test is independently valuable for statistical methods developed using approximate message passing, leave-one-out, or convex Gaussian min-max theorems. We demonstrate our method through simulated and real data experiments. Technically, we connect approximate message passing algorithms with debiasing and provide the first proof of the Cauchy property of vector approximate message passing (V-AMP).</description>

      <title>On Simultaneous Information and Energy Transmission through Quantum Channels</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.13691</link>
      <description>arXiv:2309.13691v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The optimal rate at which information can be sent through a quantum channel when the transmitted signal must simultaneously carry some minimum amount of energy is characterized. To do so, we introduce the quantum-classical analogue of the capacity-power function and generalize results in classical information theory for transmitting classical information through noisy channels. We show that the capacity-power function for a classical-quantum channel, for both unassisted and private protocol, is concave and also prove additivity for unentangled and uncorrelated ensembles of input signals for such channels. This implies we do not need regularized formulas for calculation. We show these properties also hold for all noiseless channels when we restrict the set of input states to be pure quantum states. For general channels, we find that the capacity-power function is piece-wise concave. We give an elegant visual proof for this supported by numerical simulations. We connect channel capacity and properties of random quantum states. In particular, we obtain analytical expressions for the capacity-power function for the case of noiseless channels using properties of random quantum states under an energy constraint and concentration phenomena in large Hilbert spaces.</description>

      <title>Physics-compliant diagonal representation of beyond-diagonal RIS</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.17222</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.17222v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Physics-compliant models of RIS-parametrized channels assign a load-terminated port to each RIS element. For conventional diagonal RIS (D-RIS), each auxiliary port is terminated by its own independent and individually tunable load (i.e., independent of the other auxiliary ports). For beyond-diagonal RIS (BD-RIS), the auxiliary ports are terminated by a tunable load circuit which couples the auxiliary ports to each other. Here, we point out that a physics-compliant model of the load circuit of a BD-RIS takes the same form as a physics-compliant model of a D-RIS-parametrized radio environment: a multi-port network with a subset of ports terminated by individually tunable loads (independent of each other). Consequently, we recognize that a BD-RIS-parametrized radio environment can be understood as a multi-port cascade network (i.e., the cascade of radio environment with load circuit) terminated by individually tunable loads (independent of each other). Hence, the BD-RIS problem can be mapped into the original D-RIS problem by replacing the radio environment with the cascade of radio environment and load circuit. The insight that BD-RIS can be physics-compliantly analyzed with the conventional D-RIS formalism implies that (i) the same optimization protocols as for D-RIS can be used for the BD-RIS case, and (ii) it is unclear if existing comparisons between BD-RIS and D-RIS are fair because for a fixed number of RIS elements, a BD-RIS has usually more tunable lumped elements.</description>

      <title>Semantic Communication for Cooperative Multi-Task Processing over Wireless Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.08483</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.08483v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we investigated semantic communication for multi-task processing using an information-theoretic approach. We introduced the concept of a "semantic source", allowing multiple semantic interpretations from a single observation. We formulated an end-to-end optimization problem taking into account the communication channel, maximizing mutual information (infomax) to design the semantic encoding and decoding process exploiting the statistical relations between semantic variables. To solve the problem we perform data-driven deep learning employing variational approximation techniques. Our semantic encoder is divided into a common unit and multiple specific units to facilitate cooperative multi-task processing. Simulation results demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed semantic source and system design when statistical relationships exist, comparing cooperative task processing with independent task processing. However, our findings highlight that cooperative multi-tasking is not always beneficial, emphasizing the importance of statistical relationships between tasks and indicating the need for further investigation into the semantically processing of multiple tasks.</description>

      <title>Adaptive Foundation Models for Online Decisions: HyperAgent with Fast Incremental Uncertainty Estimation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.13195</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.13195v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Foundation models often struggle with uncertainty when faced with new situations in online decision-making, necessitating scalable and efficient exploration to resolve this uncertainty. We introduce GPT-HyperAgent, an augmentation of GPT with HyperAgent for uncertainty-aware, scalable exploration in contextual bandits, a fundamental online decision problem involving natural language input. We prove that HyperAgent achieves fast incremental uncertainty estimation with $\tilde{O}(\log T)$ per-step computational complexity over $T$ periods under the linear realizable assumption. Our analysis demonstrates that HyperAgent's regret order matches that of exact Thompson sampling in linear contextual bandits, closing a significant theoretical gap in scalable exploration. Empirical results in real-world contextual bandit tasks, such as automated content moderation with human feedback, validate the practical effectiveness of GPT-HyperAgent for safety-critical decisions.
