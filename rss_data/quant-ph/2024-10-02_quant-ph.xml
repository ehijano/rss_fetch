      <title>Linear quantum systems: poles, zeros, invertibility and sensitivity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.00014</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.00014v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The noncommutative nature of quantum mechanics imposes fundamental constraints on system dynamics, which, in the linear realm, are manifested through the physical realizability conditions on system matrices. These restrictions give system matrices a unique structure. This paper aims to study this structure by investigating the zeros and poles of linear quantum systems. Firstly, it is shown that -s_0 is a transmission zero if and only if s_0 is a pole of the transfer function, and -s_0 is an invariant zero if and only if s_0 is an eigenvalue of the A-matrix, of a linear quantum system. Moreover, s_0 is an output-decoupling zero if and only if -s_0 is an input-decoupling zero. Secondly, based on these zero-pole correspondences, we show that a linear quantum system must be Hurwitz unstable if it is strongly asymptotically left invertible. Two types of stable input observers are constructed for unstable linear quantum systems. Finally, the sensitivity of a coherent feedback network is investigated; in particular, the fundamental tradeoff between ideal input squeezing and system robustness is studied on the basis of system sensitivity analysis.</description>

      <title>Exact solution of the isotropic and anisotropic Hamiltonian of two coupled harmonic oscillators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.00021</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.00021v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the isotropic and anisotropic Hamiltonian of two coupled harmonic oscillators from an algebraic approach of the $SU(1,1)$ and $SU(2)$ groups. In order to obtain the energy spectrum and eigenfunctions of this problem, we write its Hamiltonian in terms of the boson generators of the $SU(1,1)$ and $SU(2)$ groups. We use the one boson and two boson realizations of the $su(1,1)$ Lie algebra, and the one boson realization of the $su(2)$ Lie algebra to apply three tilting transformations to diagonalize the original Hamiltonian. These transformations let us to obtain the exact solutions of the isotropic and the anisotropic cases, from which the particular expected results are obtained for the cases where the coupling is neglected.</description>

      <title>Warm-Started QAOA with Aligned Mixers Converges Slowly Near the Poles of the Bloch Sphere</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.00027</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.00027v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In order to boost the performance of the Quantum Approximate Optimization Algorithm (QAOA) to solve problems in combinatorial optimization, researchers have leveraged the solutions returned from classical algorithms in order to create a warm-started quantum initial state for QAOA that is biased towards "good" solutions. Cain et al. showed that if the classically-obtained solutions are mapped to the poles of the Bloch sphere, then vanilla QAOA with the standard mixer "gets stuck". If the classically-obtained solution is instead mapped to within some angle $\theta$ from the poles of the Bloch sphere, creating an initial product state, then QAOA with optimal variational parameters is known to converge to the optimal solution with increased circuit depth if the mixer is modified to be "aligned" with the warm-start initial state. Leveraging recent work of Benchasattabuse et al., we provide theoretical lower bounds on the circuit depth necessary for this form of warm-started QAOA to achieve a desired change $\Delta \lambda$ in approximation ratio; in particular, we show that for small $\theta$, the lower bound on the circuit depth roughly scales proportionally with $\Delta \lambda/\theta$.</description>

      <title>Hydrogen atom as a nonlinear oscillator under circularly polarized light: epicyclical electron orbits</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.00056</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.00056v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we use Clifford algebra $Cl_{2,0}$ to find the 2D orbit of Hydrogen electron under a Coulomb force and a perturbing circularly polarized electric field of light at angular frequency~$\omega$, which is turned on at time $t = 0$ via a unit step switch. Using a coordinate system co-rotating with the electron's unperturbed circular orbit at angular frequency $\omega_0$, we derive the complex nonlinear differential equation for the perturbation which is similar to but different from the Lorentz oscillator equation: (1) the acceleration terms are similar, (2) the damping term coefficient is not real but imaginary due to Coriolis force, (3) the term similar to spring force is not positive but negative, (3) there is a complex conjugate of the perturbation term which has no Lorentz analog but which makes the equation nonlinear, and (4) the angular frequency of the forcing term is not $\omega$ but $\omega - \omega_0$. By imposing that the position and velocity of the electron are continuous at time $t = 0$, we show that the orbit of the electron is a sum of five exponential Fourier terms with frequencies 0, $\omega_0$, $2\omega_0$, $(2\omega_0 - \omega)$, and $\omega$, which correspond to the eccentric, deferent, and three epicycles in Copernican astronomy. We show that at the three resonant light frequencies $0$, $\omega_0$, and $2\omega_0$, the electron's orbit is divergent, but approximates a Keplerian ellipse. At other light frequencies, the orbits are nondivergent with periods that are integer multiples of $\pi/\omega_0$ depending on the frequency ratio $\omega/\omega_0$. And as $\omega/\omega_0\rightarrow \pm\infty$, the orbit approaches the electron's unperturbed circular orbit.</description>

      <title>Qibocal: an open-source framework for calibration of self-hosted quantum devices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.00101</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.00101v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Calibration of quantum devices is fundamental to successfully deploy quantum algorithms on current available quantum hardware. We present Qibocal, an open-source software library to perform calibration and characterization of superconducting quantum devices within the Qibo framework. Qibocal completes the Qibo middleware framework by providing all necessary tools to easily (re)calibrate self-hosted quantum platforms. After presenting the layout and the features of the library, we give an overview on some of the protocols implemented to perform single and two-qubit gates calibration. Finally, we present applications involving recalibration and monitoring of superconducting platforms.</description>

Abstract: We show that a perturbed Coulomb problem discussed recently is conditionally solvable. We obtain the exact eigenvalues and eigenfunctions and compare the former with eigenvalues calculated by means of a numerical method. We discuss the meaning of the numbers that determine the exact solutions which arise from the Frobenius (power-series) method.</description>

      <title>Smallest quantum codes for amplitude damping noise</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.00155</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.00155v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We describe the smallest quantum error correcting (QEC) code to correct for amplitude-damping (AD) noise, namely, a 3-qubit code that corrects up to first order in the damping strength. We generalize this construction to create a family of codes that correct AD noise up to any fixed order. We underpin the fundamental connection between the structure of our codes and the noise structure via a relaxed form of the Knill-Laflamme conditions, that are different from existing formulations of approximate QEC conditions. Although the recovery procedure for this code is non-deterministic, our codes are optimal with respect to overheads and outperform existing codes to tackle AD noise in terms of entanglement fidelity. This alternate formulation of approximate QEC in fact leads us to a new class of quantum codes tailored to AD noise and also gives rise to a noise-adapted quantum Hamming bound for AD noise.</description>

      <title>Cooling and Squeezing a Microwave Cavity State with Magnons Using a Beam Splitter Interaction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.00160</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.00160v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose two geometries to realize a significant beam splitter interaction (XZ coupling) between magnons and a 2D microwave cavity mode. In both setups the cavity is analogous to the mechanical oscillator in a conventional optomechanical setup. The backaction effects are calculated with realistic experimental parameters. The analytical results show that we can not only make the backaction damping (anti-damping) rate larger than the bare microwave resonator damping rate, but that we can also achieve quantum squeezing of the resonator where the uncertainty in one quadruture (charge or current) is smaller than its zero point fluctuation.</description>

      <title>More buck-per-shot: Why learning trumps mitigation in noisy quantum sensing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.00197</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.00197v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum sensing is one of the most promising applications for quantum technologies. However, reaching the ultimate sensitivities enabled by the laws of quantum mechanics can be a challenging task in realistic scenarios where noise is present. While several strategies have been proposed to deal with the detrimental effects of noise, these come at the cost of an extra shot budget. Given that shots are a precious resource for sensing -- as infinite measurements could lead to infinite precision -- care must be taken to truly guarantee that any shot not being used for sensing is actually leading to some metrological improvement. In this work, we study whether investing shots in error-mitigation, inference techniques, or combinations thereof, can improve the sensitivity of a noisy quantum sensor on a (shot) budget. We present a detailed bias-variance error analysis for various sensing protocols. Our results show that the costs of zero-noise extrapolation techniques outweigh their benefits. We also find that pre-characterizing a quantum sensor via inference techniques leads to the best performance, under the assumption that the sensor is sufficiently stable.</description>

      <title>Interfering-or-not-interfering quantum key distribution with advantage distillation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.00205</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.00205v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Interfering-or-not-interfering quantum key distribution (INI-QKD) is an innovative protocol whose performance surpasses existing twin-field protocol variants. In this study, we introduce an additional step of advantage distillation (AD) after the quantum communication phase to further enhance its performance. Through the AD the raw key is partitioned into small blocks of bits to identify highly correlated bit pairs. We numerically compute the optimal partitioning for different realistic conditions. Our results show that by employing the advantage distillation the transmission distance is significantly increased and thus can potentially improve the secret key rate of INI-QKD. This in particular is most prominent in the presence of high polarization misalignment error rates and considerable phase mismatch, all without altering the experimental setup of the protocol.</description>

      <title>Spectra and transport of probability and energy densities in a $\mathcal{PT}$-symmetric square well with a delta-function potential</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.00234</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.00234v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the spectrum, eigenstates and transport properties of a simple $\mathcal{P}\mathcal{T}$-symmetric model consisting in a finite, complex, square well potential with a delta potential at the origin. We show that as the strength of the delta potential increases, the system exhibits exceptional points accompanied by an accumulation of density associated with the break in the $\mathcal{P}\mathcal{T}$-symmetry. We also obtain the density and energy density fluxes and analyze their transport properties. We find that in the $\mathcal{P}\mathcal{T}-$ symmetric phase transport is efficient, in the sense that all the density that flows into the system at the source, flows out at the sink, which is sufficient to derive a generalized unitary relation for the transmission and reflection coefficients.</description>

      <title>Element-specific, non-destructive profiling of layered heterostructures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.00241</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.00241v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Fabrication of semiconductor heterostructures is now so precise that metrology has become a key challenge for progress in science and applications. It is now relatively straightforward to characterize classic III-V and group IV heterostructures consisting of slabs of different semiconductor alloys with thicknesses of $\sim$5~nm and greater using sophisticated tools such as \mbox{X-ray} diffraction, high energy X-ray photoemission spectroscopy, and secondary ion mass spectrometry. However, profiling thin layers with nm or sub-nm thickness, \textit{e.g.} atomically thin dopant layers (\mbox{$\delta$-layers}), of impurities required for modulation doping and spin-based quantum and classical information technologies is more challenging.
  Here, we present theory and experiment showing how resonant-contrast \mbox{X-ray} reflectometry meets this challenge. The technique takes advantage of the change in the scattering factor of atoms as their core level resonances are scanned by varying the \mbox{X-ray} energy. We demonstrate the capability of the resulting element-selective, non-destructive profilometry for single arsenic $\delta$-layers within silicon, and show that the sub-nm electronic thickness of the \mbox{$\delta$-layers} corresponds to sub-nm chemical thickness. In combination with X-ray fluorescence imaging, this enables non-destructive three-dimensional characterization of nano-structured quantum devices. Due to the strong resonances at soft X-ray wavelengths, the technique is also ideally suited to characterize layered quantum materials, such as cuprates or the topical infinite-layer nickelates.</description>

      <title>Spatio-Spectral Quantum State Estimation of Photon Pairs from Optical Fiber Using Stimulated Emission</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.00298</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.00298v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Developing a quantum light source that carries more than one bit per photon is pivotal for expanding quantum information applications. Characterizing a high-dimensional multiple-degree-of-freedom source at the single-photon level is challenging due to the large parameter space as well as limited emission rates and detection efficiencies. Here, we characterize photon pairs generated in optical fiber in the transverse-mode and frequency degrees of freedom by applying stimulated emission in both degrees of freedom while detecting in one of them at a time. This method may be useful in the quantum state estimation and optimization of various photon-pair source platforms in which complicated correlations across multiple degrees of freedom may be present.</description>

      <title>Quantum Bayes' rule and Petz transpose map from the minimal change principle</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.00319</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.00319v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Bayes' rule, which is routinely used to update beliefs based on new evidence, arises from a minimal change principle. This states that updated beliefs must be consistent with new data while deviating minimally from the prior belief. Here we introduce a quantum analog of the minimal change principle and use it to derive a quantum Bayes' rule by minimizing the change between quantum processes, not just their marginals, similar to the classical case where Bayes' rule is obtained by minimizing the change between joint distributions. When the change is quantified by the fidelity, the minimal change principle has a unique solution, and the resulting quantum Bayes' rule recovers the Petz transpose map.</description>

      <title>Switching of post quench reflection asymmetry in an embedded non-Hermitian Su-Schrieffer-Heeger system</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.00325</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.00325v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A quench in a Su-Schrieffer-Heeger lattice across the topological boundary initialized with an edge state leads to transport across the chain. We consider such a quench in an effective model in which non-Hermitian components are embedded in an SSH lattice. We find that the transport arising as a result of quench is asymmetric in the sense that there is imbalance in reflection in transport from left and right and this imbalance switches from higher right reflection to higher left reflection as the configuration to which the system is quenched varies in parameter space. We discuss the switching as emergence from the underlying phenomenon of a partial reorganization of bulk states in terms of localization and energy, the intricacies of which depends upon the configuration of the system and the symmetries present.</description>

      <title>Effects of Systematic Error on Quantum-Enhanced Atom Interferometry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.00341</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.00341v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We develop a framework for describing the effects of systematic state preparation error in quantum-enhanced atom interferometry on sensing performance. We do this in the context of both spin-squeezed and non-Gaussian states for the two-axis-twisting (TAT), one-axis-twisting (OAT), and twist-and-turn (TNT) state preparation schemes, and derive general conditions for robustness and susceptibility of quantum states to state preparation error. In the spin-squeezing regime, we find that OAT is more susceptible to state preparation error than TAT due to its parameter-dependent phase space rotation. In the non-Gaussian regime, we find that OAT is robust to state preparation errors, which can be explained by a small ratio of off-diagonal to diagonal elements in its Fisher-covariance matrix. In contrast, TNT does not exhibit this robustness. We find that the single parameter unbiased estimators that are habitually used in quantum-enhanced atom interferometry are not always optimal, and that there may be occasions where biased estimators, or two-parameter unbiased estimators, lead to lower net error.</description>

      <title>Testing quantum master equations for complete positivity: A direct approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.00353</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.00353v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: While quantum master equations (QMEs) are the primary workhorse in quantum information science, quantum optics, spectroscopy, and quantum thermodynamics, verifying complete positivity of the associated $N$-level quantum dynamical maps remains an outstanding challenge for $N\ge 3$. We address this challenge by establishing a direct mapping between the Liouvillian and Kossakowski matrices of an arbitrary Markovian QME. The mapping relies on the Moore-Penrose pseudo-inverse of a rectangular matrix composed of the structure constants of SU$(N)$. As an application, we establish complete positivity of the quantum optical Bloch-Redfield QME for a three-level V-system driven by incoherent light. Our approach makes it possible to test QMEs for complete positivity without solving them, and to restore complete positivity by keeping only non-negative eigenvalues of the Kossakowski matrix.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.00364v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The mechanism governing the evolution of controlled quantum systems is often obscured, making their dynamics hard to interpret. Mitra and Rabitz {[Phys. Rev. A 67, 033407 (2003)]} define mechanism via a perturbative expansion of pathways between eigenstates; the evolution of the system is driven by the constructive and destructive interference of these pathway amplitudes. In this paper, we explore mechanism in controlled single-qubit systems and describe novel analytic methods for computing the mechanism underlying the evolution of a single qubit under a piecewise constant control.</description>

      <title>Residual-$ZZ$-coupling suppression and fast two-qubit gate for Kerr-cat qubits based on level-degeneracy engineering</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.00431</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.00431v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Building large-scale quantum computers requires an interqubit-coupling scheme with a high on-off ratio to avoid unwanted crosstalk coming from residual coupling and to enable fast multi-qubit operations. We propose a $ZZ$-coupling scheme for two Kerr-cat qubits with a frequency-tunable coupler. By making four relevant states of the two Kerr-cat qubits quadruply degenerate, we can switch off the $ZZ$ coupling. By partially lifting the level degeneracy, we can switch it on. We theoretically show that an experimentally feasible circuit model suppresses the residual $ZZ$ coupling. Moreover, our circuit can realize $R_{ZZ}(-\pi/2)$-gate fidelity higher than $99.999\%$ within $25\,$ns when decoherence is ignored.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.00439v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce a method to construct a quantum battery and a quantum Otto heat engine using a Nitrogen-Vacancy (NV) center spin coupled to a mechanical oscillator in a highly detuned regime. By precisely controlling the NV spin, we enable efficient energy exchange despite significant detuning, challenging conventional assumptions. This leads to a robust mechanical quantum battery and a cooling scheme driving the oscillator toward its ground state. Leveraging this, we implement a quantum Otto engine that produces mechanical work at maximum efficiency without decoupling from the hot bath, paving the way for practical quantum thermal machines.</description>

      <title>Beamsplitter-free, high bit-rate, quantum random number generator based on temporal and spatial correlations of heralded single-photons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.00440</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.00440v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The spontaneous parametric down-conversion (SPDC), an inherently random quantum process, produces a non-deterministic photon-pair with strong temporal and spatial correlations owing to both energy and momentum conservation. Therefore, the SPDC-based photon pairs are used for quantum random number generation (QRNG). Typically, temporal correlation in association with an ideal unbiased beam splitter is used for QRNG without fully exploring the spatial correction. As a result, SPDC-based QRNG has a low bit rate. On the other hand, due to the spatial correlation, the photon pairs in non-collinear phase-matched geometry are generated randomly in diametrically opposite points over an annular ring spatial distribution. Therefore, exploring the temporal correlation between photon pairs from different sections of the annual ring can lead to multi-bit QRNG at a high rate, avoiding the need for a beam splitter. As a proof-of-concept, we report on high-bit-rate QRNG by using spatial correlation of photon-pairs by sectioning the SPDC ring of a non-collinear, degenerate, high-brightness source and temporal correlation between the diametrically opposite sections. Dividing the annular ring of the high-brightness photon-pair source based on a 20 mm long, type-0 phase-matched, periodically-poled KTP crystal into four sections, recording the timestamp of the coincidences (widow of 1 ns) between photons from diametrically opposite sections and assigning bits (0 and 1), we extracted 90 million raw bits over 27.7 s at a pump power of 17 mW. We determined the extraction ratio using the minimum entropy evaluation of more than 95% in our case. Using Toeplitz matrix-based post-processing, we achieved a QRNG with a bit-rate of 3 Mbps, passing all NIST 800-22 and TestU01 test suites. The generic scheme shows the possibility of further enhancement of the bit rate through more sectioning of the SPDC ring.</description>

      <title>Disentangling collective coupling in vibrational polaritons with double quantum coherence spectroscopy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.00494</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.00494v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Vibrational polaritons are formed by strong coupling of molecular vibrations and photon modes in an optical cavity. Experiments have demonstrated that vibrational strong coupling can change molecular properties and even affect chemical reactivity. However, the interactions in a molecular ensemble are complex, and the exact mechanisms that lead to modifications are not fully understood yet. We simulate two-dimensional infrared spectra of molecular vibrational polaritons based on the double quantum coherence technique to gain further insight into the complex many-body structure of these hybrid light-matter states. Double quantum coherence uniquely resolves the excitation of hybrid light-matter polaritons and allows to directly probe the anharmonicities of the resulting states. By combining the cavity Born-Oppenheimer Hartree-Fock ansatz with a full quantum dynamics simulation of the corresponding eigenstates, we go beyond simplified model systems. This allows us to study the influence of self-polarization and the response of the electronic structure to the cavity interaction on the spectral features even beyond the single-molecule case.</description>

      <title>Protected Fluxonium Control with Sub-harmonic Parametric Driving</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.00495</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.00495v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Protecting qubits from environmental noise while maintaining strong coupling for fast high-fidelity control is a central challenge for quantum information processing. Here, we demonstrate a novel control scheme for superconducting fluxonium qubits that eliminates qubit decay through the control channel by reducing the environmental density of states at the transition frequency. Adding a low-pass filter on the flux line allows for flux-biasing and at the same time coherently controlling the fluxonium qubit by parametrically driving it at integer fractions of its transition frequency. We compare the filtered to the unfiltered configuration and find a five times longer $T_1$, and ten times improved $T_2$-echo time in the protected case. We demonstrate coherent control with up to 11-photon sub-harmonic drives, highlighting the strong non-linearity of the fluxonium potential. We experimentally determine Rabi frequencies and drive-induced frequency shifts in excellent agreement with numerical and analytical calculations. Furthermore, we show the equivalence of a 3-photon sub-harmonic drive to an on-resonance drive by benchmarking sub-harmonic gate fidelities above 99.94 %. These results open up a scalable path for full qubit control via a single protected channel, strongly suppressing qubit decoherence caused by control lines.</description>

      <title>Cryptographic Characterization of Quantum Advantage</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.00499</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.00499v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum computational advantage refers to an existence of computational tasks that are easy for quantum computing but hard for classical one. Unconditionally showing quantum advantage is beyond our current understanding of complexity theory, and therefore some computational assumptions are needed. Which complexity assumption is necessary and sufficient for quantum advantage? In this paper, we show that inefficient-verifier proofs of quantumness (IV-PoQ) exist if and only if classically-secure one-way puzzles (OWPuzzs) exist. As far as we know, this is the first time that a complete cryptographic characterization of quantum advantage is obtained. IV-PoQ capture various types of quantum advantage previously studied, such as sampling advantage and searching advantage. Previous work [Morimae and Yamakawa 2024] showed that IV-PoQ can be constructed from OWFs, but a construction of IV-PoQ from weaker assumptions was left open. Our result solves the open problem. OWPuzzs are one of the most fundamental quantum cryptographic primitives implied by many quantum cryptographic primitives weaker than one-way functions (OWFs). The equivalence between IV-PoQ and classically-secure OWPuzzs therefore highlights that if there is no quantum advantage, then these fundamental primitives do not exist. The equivalence also means that quantum advantage is an example of the applications of OWPuzzs. Except for commitments, no application of OWPuzzs was known before. Our result shows that quantum advantage is another application of OWPuzzs. Moreover, it is the first quantum computation classical communication (QCCC) application of OWPuzzs.</description>

      <title>Exploring entanglement in finite-size quantum systems with degenerate ground state</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.00515</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.00515v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We develop an approach for characterizing non-local quantum correlations in spin systems with exactly or nearly degenerate ground states. Starting with linearly independent degenerate eigenfunctions calculated with exact diagonalization we generate a finite set of their random linear combinations with Haar measure, which guarantees that these combinations are uniformly distributed in the space spanned by the initial eigenstates. Estimating the von Neumann entropy of the random wave functions helps to reveal previously unknown features of the quantum correlations in the phases with degeneracy of the ground state. For instance, spin spiral phase of the quantum magnet with Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interaction is characterized by the enhancement of the entanglement entropy, which can be qualitatively explained by the changes in behaviour of two- and three-spin correlation functions. To establish the connection between our theoretical findings and real experiments we elaborate on the problem of estimating observables on the basis of the single-shot measurements of numerous degenerate eigenstates.</description>

      <title>High-performance conditional-driving gate for Kerr parametric oscillator qubits</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.00552</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.00552v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Kerr parametric oscillators (KPOs), two-photon driven Kerr-nonlinear resonators, can stably hold coherent states with opposite-sign amplitudes and are promising devices for quantum computing. Recently, we have theoretically proposed a two-qubit gate $R_{zz}$ for highly detuned KPOs and called it a conditional-driving gate [Chono $\textit{et al}$., Phys. Rev. Res. $\textbf{4}$, 043054 (2022)]. In this study, analyzing its superconducting-circuit model and deriving a corresponding static model, we find that an AC-Zeeman shift due to the flux pulse for the gate operation largely affects the gate performance. This effect becomes a more aggravating factor with shorter gate times, leading to an increase in the error rate. We thus propose a method to cancel this undesirable effect. Furthermore, through the use of shortcuts to adiabaticity and the optimization of flux pulses, we numerically demonstrate a conditional-driving gate with average fidelity exceeding 99.9$\%$ twice faster than that without the proposed method.</description>

      <title>Beating the Optimal Verification of Entangled States via Collective Strategies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.00554</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.00554v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the realm of quantum information processing, the efficient characterization of entangled states poses an overwhelming challenge, rendering the traditional methods including quantum tomography unfeasible and impractical. To tackle this problem, we propose a new verification scheme using collective strategies, showcasing arbitrarily high efficiency that beats the optimal verification with global measurements. Our collective scheme can be implemented in various experimental platforms and scalable for large systems with a linear scaling on hardware requirement, and distributed operations are allowed. More importantly, the approach consumes only a few copies of the entangled states, while ensuring the preservation of unmeasured ones, and even boosting their fidelity for any subsequent tasks. Furthermore, our protocol provides additional insight into the specific types of noise affecting the system, thereby facilitating potential targeted improvements. These advancements hold promise for a wide range of applications, offering a pathway towards more robust and efficient quantum information processing.</description>

      <title>Quantum correlations, mixed states and bistability at the onset of lasing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.00588</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.00588v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We derive a model for a single mode laser that includes all two particle quantum correlations between photons and electrons. In contrast to the predictions of semi-classical models, we find that lasing takes place in the presence of quantum bistability between a non-lasing and a non-classical coherent state. The coherent state is characterized by a central frequency and a finite linewidth and emerges with finite amplitude from a saddle-node bifurcation together with an unstable coherent state. Hence coherent emission in nanolasers originates through a mixing of lasing and non-lasing states. In the limit of a macrolaser with a large number of emitters and non-resonant modes, the laser threshold approaches the prediction of the semi-classical theory, but with the important difference that lasing can be achieved only in the presence of finite size perturbations.</description>

Abstract: Quantum computing is presently undergoing rapid development to achieve a significant speedup promised in certain applications. Nonetheless, scaling quantum computers remains a formidable engineering challenge, prompting exploration of alternative methods to achieve the promised quantum advantage. An example is given by the concept of distributed quantum computing, which aims to scale quantum computers through the linking of different individual quantum computers. Additionally, distributed quantum computing opens the way to new applications on the longer term. This study seeks to give an overview of this technology on an application-level, considering both use cases and implementation considerations. In this way, this work aims to push forward the field of distributed quantum computing, aiming for real-world distributed quantum systems in the near future.</description>

      <title>Nonlinearity-assisted advantage for charger-supported open quantum batteries</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.00618</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.00618v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We analyze the performance of a quantum battery in terms of energy storage and energy extraction, assisted by nonlinearities in a charger-battery system utilizing an open-system approach. In particular, we consider two types of nonlinearities in the system, viz. nonlinearity in the coupling between battery and charger, and the charger itself comprising an anharmonic oscillator. In both these scenarios, the charger is connected to an environment, and is driven by an external laser source. We derive the Markovian master equation for the dynamics of the combined charger-battery system in presence of the environment. When the charger is non-linearly coupled to a battery, we find an enhancement in the steady state ergotropy over the linearly-coupled case. We further see that the times at which steady state and maximum ergotopies are attained get decreased in presence of non-linear coupling. We also identify instances where no ergotropy is obtained in the linear case, but can be obtained in presence of any non-zero value of nonlinearity. We additionally find a complementarity between the non-linear interaction strength and the coherent-drive strength in the steady-state ergotropy values, i.e. the same ergotropy as that obtained using weak nonlinearity and strong coherent drive can be obtained utilizing an opposite order of their values. In case when the charger is modeled as a multi-level transmon with an inherent anharmonicity, we find an advantage in maximum ergotropy values over the harmonic instance. Unlike the non-linearly coupled batteries, the ones mediated by an anharmonic charger prove to be useful in the transient regime. We also determine values of the coherent drive for which the anharmonic battery is beneficial over the harmonic one at all timescales. Further, we observe a distinct region of the anharmonic strength and coherent drive where ergotropy values reach their maxima.</description>

      <title>Experimental demonstration of Robust Amplitude Estimation on near-term quantum devices for chemistry applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.00686</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.00686v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study explores hardware implementation of Robust Amplitude Estimation (RAE) on IBM quantum devices, demonstrating its application in quantum chemistry for one- and two-qubit Hamiltonian systems. Known for potentially offering quadratic speedups over traditional methods in estimating expectation values, RAE is evaluated under realistic noisy conditions. Our experiments provide detailed insights into the practical challenges associated with RAE. We achieved a significant reduction in sampling requirements compared to direct measurement techniques. In estimating the ground state energy of the hydrogen molecule, the RAE implementation demonstrated two orders of magnitude better accuracy for the two-qubit experiments and achieved chemical accuracy. These findings reveal its potential to enhance computational efficiencies in quantum chemistry applications despite the inherent limitations posed by hardware noise. We also found that its performance can be adversely impacted by coherent error and device stability and does not always correlate with the average gate error. These results underscore the importance of adapting quantum computational methods to hardware specifics to realize their full potential in practical scenarios.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.00742v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum computing is currently gaining significant attention, not only from the academic community but also from industry, due to its potential applications across several fields for addressing complex problems. For any practical problem which may be tackled using quantum computing, it is imperative to represent the data used onto a quantum computing system. Depending on the application, many different types of data and data structures occur, including regular numbers, higher-dimensional data structures, e.g., n-dimensional images, up to graphs. This report aims to provide an overview of existing methods for representing these data types on gate-based quantum computers.</description>

      <title>Absorbing State Phase Transitions and Stability of Long-Range Coherence in Dissipative Quantum State Preparation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.00819v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the absorbing state phase transition in a purely dissipative quantum reaction-diffusion model where the absorbing state itself has long range phase coherence. The model may also be viewed as a dissipative quantum state preparation procedure for the (generalized) W-state with errors. The 'error' Lindblad jump operators preserve the W-state as a dark state, but nonetheless act to decohere the system and induce the phase transition. We find cases where the preparation protocol is either fragile or robust against weak error quantum jump rates, and show that remnants of the coherence persist even after the phase transition to the decohering phase.</description>

      <title>The role of non-classicality in mediated spatial quantum correlations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.00824</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.00824v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The study of non-classicality is essential to understand the quantum-to-classical transition in physical systems. Recently a witness of non-classicality has been proposed, linking the ability of a system (``the mediator") to create quantum correlations between two quantum probes with its non-classicality, intended as the existence of at least two non-commuting variables. Here we propose a new inequality that quantitatively links the increase in quantum correlations between the probes to the degree of non-commutativity of the mediator's observables. We test the inequality for various degrees of non-classicality of the mediator, from fully quantum to fully classical. This quantum-to-classical transition is simulated via a phase-flip channel applied to the mediator, inducing an effective reduction of the non-commutativity of its variables. Our results provide a general framework for witnessing non-classicality, quantifying the non-classicality of a system via its intrinsic properties (such as its Hilbert space dimension and observable commutators) beyond the specifics of interaction dynamics.</description>

      <title>Pulse shape optimization against Doppler shifts and delays in optical quantum communication</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.00852</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.00852v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: High relative velocities and large distances in space-based quantum communication with satellites in lower earth orbits can lead to significant Doppler shifts and delays of the signal impairing the achievable performance if uncorrected. We analyze the influence of systematic and stochastic Doppler shift and delay in the specific case of a continuous variable quantum key distribution (CV-QKD) protocol and identify the generalized correlation function, the ambiguity function, as a decisive measure of performance loss. Investigating the generalized correlations as well as private capacity bounds for specific choices of spectral amplitude shape (Gaussian, single- and double-sided Lorentzian), we find that this choice has a significant impact on the robustness of the quantum communication protocol to spectral and temporal synchronization errors. We conclude that optimizing the pulse shape can be a building block in the resilient design of quantum network infrastructure.</description>

      <title>Deployed quantum link characterization via Bayesian ancilla-assisted process tomography</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.00892</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.00892v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The development of large-scale quantum networks requires reliable quantum channels, the quality of which can be quantified by the framework of quantum process tomography. In this work, we leverage ancilla-assisted process tomography and Bayesian inference to probe a 1.6 km deployed fiber-optic link. We send one of two polarization-entangled photons from Alice in one building to Bob in another, exploiting the local qubit as an ancilla system to characterize the corresponding quantum channel. Monitoring over a 24 h period returns a steady process fidelity of 95.1(1)%, while controllable spectral filtering with passbands from 0.025-4.38 THz finds fidelities that first increase, then level off with bandwidth, suggesting both stable operation with time and minimal polarization mode dispersion. To our knowledge, these results represent the first AAPT of a deployed quantum link, revealing a valuable tool for in situ analysis of entanglement-based quantum networks.</description>

      <title>The quantum trajectory sensing problem and its solution</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.00893</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.00893v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The quantum trajectory sensing problem seeks quantum sensor states which enable the trajectories of incident particles to be distinguished using a single measurement. For an $n$-qubit sensor state to unambiguously discriminate a set of trajectories with a single projective measurement, all post-trajectory output states must be mutually orthogonal; therefore, the $2^n$ state coefficients must satisfy a system of constraints which is typically very large. Given that this system is generally challenging to solve directly, we introduce a group-theoretic framework which simplifies the criteria for sensor states and exponentially reduces the number of equations and variables involved when the trajectories obey certain symmetries. These simplified criteria yield general families of trajectory sensor states and provide bounds on the particle-sensor interaction strength required for perfect one-shot trajectory discrimination. Furthermore, we establish a link between trajectory sensing and quantum error correction, recognizing their common motivation to identify perturbations using projective measurements. Our sensor states in fact form novel quantum codes, and conversely, a number of familiar stabilizer codes (such as toric codes) also provide trajectory sensing capabilities. This connection enables noise-resilient trajectory sensing through the concatenation of sensor states with quantum error-correcting codes.</description>

      <title>Quantum schoolbook multiplication with fewer Toffoli gates</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.00899</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.00899v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper presents a method for constructing quantum circuits for schoolbook multiplication using controlled add-subtract circuits, asymptotically halving the Toffoli count compared to traditional controlled-adder-based constructions. Controlled n-qubit add-subtract circuits, which perform an addition when the control qubit is one and a subtraction when it is zero, require only n-1 Toffoli gates, instead of the 2n-1 needed for controlled adders. Despite the existence of multiplication circuits with better asymptotic scaling, schoolbook multiplication yields the lowest Toffoli counts for small register sizes, making it advantageous in practical applications. For example, the presented approach reduces the Toffoli count by up to around 30% in circuits for breaking 256-bit elliptic curve keys compared to circuits with standard schoolbook multipliers.</description>

      <title>Systematic construction of multi-controlled Pauli gate decompositions with optimal $T$-count</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.00910</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.00910v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Multi-controlled Pauli gates are typical high-level qubit operations that appear in the quantum circuits of various quantum algorithms. We find multi-controlled Pauli gate decompositions with smaller CNOT-count or $T$-depth while keeping the currently known minimum $T$-count. For example, for the CCCZ gate, we find decompositions with CNOT-count 7 or $T$-depth 2 while keeping the $T$-count at the currently known minimum of 6. The discovery of these efficient decompositions improves the computational efficiency of many quantum algorithms. What led to this discovery is the systematic procedure for constructing multi-controlled Pauli gate decompositions. This procedure not only deepens our theoretical understanding of quantum gate decomposition but also leads to more efficient decompositions that have yet to be discovered.</description>

      <title>Impact of parity violation on quantum entanglement and Bell nonlocality</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.15418</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.15418v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Quantum entanglement (QE) and Bell inequalities (BI) have been extensively studied for interactions that conserve parity (P), while their interplay with P-violating ones remains underexplored. We find P violation leads to a preference for particular spin combinations and has significant effects on QE and the extent of BI violation. Within the quantum field theory (QFT) framework, for spin-0 particles decaying into two fermions, parameters for the concurrence and the BI for the Clauser-Horne-Shimony-Holt case are found to be $\sqrt{1 - \alpha^2}$ and $2 \sqrt{2 - \alpha^2}$, respectively, where $-1\leq \alpha\ \leq 1$ quantifies the size of P violation. For spin-1 particle decays, we find that P-violating interactions introduce effects similar to those in the spin-0 case. Without knowledge from the QFT, for the spin-0 case, the general form of density matrices requires measuring only one parameter for P-conserving decays and three otherwise. For spin-1 cases, there would be nine parameters in general. We further study the overlooked effect on QE and BI induced by the magnetic field in detectors and find it essential for a genuine test of P and CP symmetries.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.00372v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this letter, we demonstrate for the first time the creation of Josephson-like superconducting nanojunctions using a thermal scanning probe to directly inscribe weak links into microstrips of YBa2Cu3O7-x (YBCO). Our method effectively reduces the critical current (Ic) over an order of magnitude. The resulting nanobridges exhibit clear evidence of Josephson effects, of SNS-type junctions, as shown by both the DC and AC Josephson effects. This approach provides a novel and flexible method for scaling up quantum mechanical circuits that operate at liquid nitrogen temperatures. Additionally, it offers a promising pathway for modifying properties of the junctions in-situ and post fabrication.</description>

Abstract: We explore the holographic time-like entanglement entropy (TEE) in the boundary theory of three-dimensional Lifshitz spacetime. There have been various holographic proposals for TEE in recent years and we test those proposals in the Lifshitz background. We obtain the analytic result for TEE in each proposal, compare the results, and analyze how the anisotropic scaling affects the TEE. We find that different holographic proposals give the same result for TEE in the Lifshitz background. Our analysis further suggests that the TEE of the Lifshitz system contains real and imaginary parts, both of which depend on the anisotropic parameter.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.00650v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Quantum computing is getting increasing interest from both academia and industry, and the quantum software landscape has been growing rapidly. The quantum software stack comprises quantum programs, implementing algorithms, and platforms like IBM Qiskit, Google Cirq, and Microsoft Q#, enabling their development. To ensure the reliability and performance of quantum software, various techniques for testing and analyzing it have been proposed, such as test generation, bug pattern detection, and circuit optimization. However, the large amount of work and the fact that work on quantum software is performed by several research communities, make it difficult to get a comprehensive overview of the existing techniques. In this work, we provide an extensive survey of the state of the art in testing and analysis of quantum software. We discuss literature from several research communities, including quantum computing, software engineering, programming languages, and formal methods. Our survey covers a wide range of topics, including expected and unexpected behavior of quantum programs, testing techniques, program analysis approaches, optimizations, and benchmarks for testing and analyzing quantum software. We create novel connections between the discussed topics and present them in an accessible way. Finally, we discuss key challenges and open problems to inspire future research.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.00803v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Gravitational wave science transforms research beyond general relativity and gravity. The signals detected not only reveal the nature of cataclysmic events and exotic objects in galaxies, but also test the models for the equation of state and color superconducting vortex alignment in neutron stars, as well as for the distribution of cosmological dark matter and their characteristic coupling with ordinary matter as new physics beyond the standard model of elementary particles. Measurement sensitivity is crucial to advance along those lines. One of the rapidly developing frontiers is quantum enhanced interferometry applied into the gravitational wave detectors. Progress achieved by LIGO, Virgo and KAGRA detectors brings exciting prospects. Here, we introduce an orbital atomic sensor using a squeezed $p$-orbital Bose-Einstein condensate in an ultracold atomic optical lattice to project the gravitational wave signal received by a usual LIGO setup into a phase-sensitive entangled state. Simulation data show the detection sensitivity improves over the quantum noise of LIGO by approximately one order of magnitude in key frequency ranges. This advance enables about three-order-of-magnitude increase in detection volume, significantly advancing the potential of using gravitational waves to detect dark matter and black holes.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.00805v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We analyse the entanglement in a model Josephson photonics system in which a dc voltage-biased Josephson junction couples a collection of cavity modes and populates them with microwave photons. Using an approximate quadratic Hamiltonian model, we study the Gaussian entanglement that develops between the modes as the Josephson energy of the system is increased. We find that the modes in the system fall into a series of blocks, with bipartite entanglement generated between modes within a given block. Tripartite entanglement between modes within a given block is also widespread, though it is limited to certain ranges of the Josephson energy. The system could provide an alternative route to generating multimode microwave entanglement, an important resource in quantum technologies, without the need for ac excitation.</description>

Abstract: Hamiltonian bootstrap methods use semidefinite relaxation to find certifiable lower bounds to the ground state energy of a Hamiltonian, along with approximations of ground state correlation functions. We give a thorough treatment of the role of symmetry in finite-dimensional Hamiltonian bootstrap, and show that symmetry can be used to significantly reduce the required computational resources. We additionally incorporate arbitrary Hermitian linear constraints in our analysis, which allows one to find properties of the ground state within a specified subspace. We demonstrate our approach using the 1D Hubbard model. We find quantitative agreement with exact diagonalization on $10$ sites at both half-filling and quarter-filling. Additionally, we apply our method on $100$ sites at half-filling and find quantitative agreement with the exact ground state energy density in thermodynamic limit derived from the Bethe ansatz.</description>

      <title>Kinetic magnetism and stripe order in the doped AFM bosonic ${t-J}$ model</title>

Abstract: Unraveling the microscopic mechanisms governing the physics of doped quantum magnets is a central challenge in strongly correlated many-body physics. Quantum simulation platforms, e.g. ultracold atoms trapped in optical lattices or tweezer arrays, offer an exciting pathway to investigate the interplay between spin and charge motion, thereby providing an avenue to addressing longstanding questions such as the nature of charge pairing in high-temperature superconductors. Here, in a new twist, we seek to disentangle the role of particle statistics in the physics of strongly correlated systems by exploring the strong coupling limit of doped bosonic quantum magnets, specifically the antiferromagnetic (AFM) bosonic $t-J$ model. We perform large-scale density matrix renormalization group (DMRG) calculations to map out the phase diagram of the AFM bosonic $t-J$ model on the 2D square lattice at finite doping. We find that in the low doping regime, bosonic holes tend to form partially-filled stripes, akin to those observed in high-$T_c$ cuprates. As doping increases beyond a critical value $\delta \gtrsim \delta^*_\mathrm{PP} (\delta^*_\mathrm{FM})$, a transition occurs between AFM and ferromagnetic (FM) ground states, driven by the competition between Heisenberg-type AFM and Nagaoka-type FM mediated by the motion of mobile bosonic holes. In the high doping or large $t/J$ limit, the system evolves into a fully-polarized SU(2) ferromagnet, consistent with a phase transition linked to Nagaoka polarons. Our findings shed light on the role of particle statistics in strongly correlated quantum matter and connect to phases in the 2D Fermi-Hubbard and $t-J$ models. Our results may be realized in state-of-the-art quantum simulation experiments with bosonic quantum gas microscopes, paving the way for further exploration of doped bosonic quantum magnets.</description>

      <title>Quantum-classical tradeoffs and multi-controlled quantum gate decompositions in variational algorithms</title>

      <description>arXiv:2210.04378v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The computational capabilities of near-term quantum computers are limited by the noisy execution of gate operations and a limited number of physical qubits. Hybrid variational algorithms are well-suited to near-term quantum devices because they allow for a wide range of tradeoffs between the amount of quantum and classical resources used to solve a problem. This paper investigates tradeoffs available at both the algorithmic and hardware levels by studying a specific case -- applying the Quantum Approximate Optimization Algorithm (QAOA) to instances of the Maximum Independent Set (MIS) problem. We consider three variants of the QAOA which offer different tradeoffs at the algorithmic level in terms of their required number of classical parameters, quantum gates, and iterations of classical optimization needed. Since MIS is a constrained combinatorial optimization problem, the QAOA must respect the problem constraints. This can be accomplished by using many multi-controlled gate operations which must be decomposed into gates executable by the target hardware. We study the tradeoffs available at this hardware level, combining the gate fidelities and decomposition efficiencies of different native gate sets into a single metric called the gate decomposition cost.</description>

      <title>Extending the Q-score to an Application-level Quantum Metric Framework</title>

      <description>arXiv:2302.00639v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Evaluating the performance of quantum devices is an important step towards scaling quantum devices and eventually using them in practice. The great number of available quantum metrics and the different hardware technologies used to develop quantum computers complicate this evaluation. In addition, different computational paradigms implement quantum operations in different ways. A prominent quantum metric is given by the Q-score metric of Atos. This metric was originally introduced as a standalone way to benchmark devices using the Max-Cut problem. In this work, we show that the Q-score defines a framework of quantum metrics, which allows benchmarking using different problems, user settings and solvers. To showcase the applicability of the framework, we showcase a second Q-score in this framework, called the Q-score Max-Clique. This yields, to our knowledge, the first application-level metric capable of natively comparing three different paradigms of quantum computing. This metric is evaluated on these computational quantum paradigms -- quantum annealing, gate-based quantum computing, and photonic quantum computing -- and the results are compared to those obtained by classical solvers.</description>

      <title>Mixed-state additivity properties of magic monotones based on quantum relative entropies for single-qubit states and beyond</title>

      <description>arXiv:2307.08258v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We prove that the stabilizer fidelity is multiplicative for the tensor product of an arbitrary number of single-qubit states. We also show that the relative entropy of magic becomes additive if all the single-qubit states but one belong to a symmetry axis of the stabilizer octahedron. We extend the latter results to include all the $\alpha$-$z$ R\'enyi relative entropy of magic. This allows us to identify a continuous set of magic monotones that are additive for single-qubit states. We also show that all the monotones mentioned above are additive for several standard two and three-qubit states subject to depolarizing noise. Finally, we obtain closed-form expressions for several states and tighter lower bounds for the overhead of probabilistic one-shot magic state distillation.</description>

      <title>S-QGPU: Shared Quantum Gate Processing Unit for Distributed Quantum Computing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.08736</link>
      <description>arXiv:2309.08736v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We propose a distributed quantum computing (DQC) architecture in which individual small-sized quantum computers are connected to a shared quantum gate processing unit (S-QGPU). The S-QGPU comprises a collection of hybrid two-qubit gate modules for remote gate operations. In contrast to conventional DQC systems, where each quantum computer is equipped with dedicated communication qubits, S-QGPU effectively pools the resources (e.g., the communication qubits) together for remote gate operations, and thus significantly reduces the cost of not only the local quantum computers but also the overall distributed system. Our preliminary analysis and simulation show that S-QGPU's shared resources for remote gate operations enable efficient resource utilization. When not all computing qubits (also called data qubits) in the system require simultaneous remote gate operations, S-QGPU-based DQC architecture demands fewer communication qubits, further decreasing the overall cost. Alternatively, with the same number of communication qubits, it can support a larger number of simultaneous remote gate operations more efficiently, especially when these operations occur in a burst mode.</description>

Abstract: This work introduces a novel approach to price rainbow options, a type of path-independent multi-asset derivatives, with quantum computers. Leveraging the Iterative Quantum Amplitude Estimation method, we present an end-to-end quantum circuit implementation, emphasizing efficiency by delaying the transition to price space. Moreover, we analyze two different amplitude loading techniques for handling exponential functions. Experiments on the IBM QASM simulator validate our quantum pricing model, contributing to the evolving field of quantum finance.</description>

      <title>Shuttling for Scalable Trapped-Ion Quantum Computers</title>

      <description>arXiv:2402.14065v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Trapped-ion quantum computers exhibit promising potential to provide platforms for high-quality qubits and reliable quantum computation. The Quantum Charge Coupled Device (QCCD) architecture is a leading example that offers a modular solution to enable the realization of scalable quantum computers, paving the way for practical quantum algorithms with large qubit numbers. Within these devices, ions can be shuttled (moved) throughout the trap and through different dedicated zones, e.g., a memory zone for storage and a processing zone for the actual computation. However, due to decoherence of the ions' quantum states, the qubits lose their quantum information over time. Thus, the required time steps of shuttling operations should be minimized. In this work, we propose a heuristic approach to determining an efficient shuttling schedule, which orchestrates the movement operations within the device. Given a quantum algorithm and a device architecture, the proposed approach produces shuttling schedules with a close-to-minimal amount of time steps for small-size QCCD architectures. For large scale QCCD devices, empirical evaluations show promising results with respect to quality of the solution as well as performance. An implementation of the proposed approach is publicly available as part of the open-source Munich Quantum Toolkit (MQT) at https://github.com/cda-tum/mqt-ion-shuttler.</description>

      <title>Molecular Ground State Simulation by Subspace Restriction and Hund's Rule</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.03268v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Molecular ground state simulation is a promising application of quantum computing. Nevertheless, this question has been shown as a QMA-complete problem, indicating that its complexity increases with the size of the molecule. To address this challenge, we focus on reducing the computation cost of molecular ground state simulation.
  In this study, we present a mathematical framework named Subspace Restriction Scheme (SRS), based on the Qubit Efficiency Encoding (QEE) method. Within this framework, we introduce and test a novel subspace, Multiplicity Hund Subspace (MH), which is generated by Hund's rule and selected based on molecular multiplicity. Our testing data and mathematical proofs demonstrate that MH subspace significantly reduces qubit usage compared to the classic Multiplicity Subspace and Particle Conservation Subspace (PC). For example, the ground state simulation of 10 electrons in 50 orbitals only requires 35 qubits, compared to the 44 qubits by PC and 100 qubits by the Jordan-Wigner transform. Furthermore, leveraging the reduced computation cost, we examine SRS for seldom tested larger molecules such as $\mathrm{CH}_{4}$ and $\mathrm{H_{2}O_{2}}$ without frozen any orbital and find that the MH subspace has less ground-state energy difference in the tested 15 molecules compared to PC subspace.</description>

Abstract: Intra-particle entanglement of individual particles such as neutrons could enable another class of scattering probes that are sensitive to entanglement in quantum systems and materials. In this work, we present experimental results demonstrating quantum contextuality as a result of entanglement between the spin and energy modes (i.e., degrees of freedom) of single neutrons in a beam using a pair of resonant radio-frequency neutron spin flippers in the MIEZE configuration (Modulated IntEnsity with Zero Effort). We verified the mode-entanglement by measuring a Clauser-Horne-Shimony-Holt (CHSH) contextuality witness $S$ defined in the spin and energy subsystems, observing a clear breach of the classical bound of $|S| \leq 2$, obtaining $S = 2.40 \pm 0.02$. These entangled beams could enable alternative approaches for directly probing dynamics and entanglement in quantum materials whose low-energy excitation scales match those of the incident entangled neutron.</description>

      <title>Existential Unforgeability in Quantum Authentication From Quantum Physical Unclonable Functions Based on Random von Neumann Measurement</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.11306v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Physical Unclonable Functions (PUFs) leverage inherent, non-clonable physical randomness to generate unique input-output pairs, serving as secure fingerprints for cryptographic protocols like authentication. Quantum PUFs (QPUFs) extend this concept by using quantum states as input-output pairs, offering advantages over classical PUFs, such as challenge reusability via public channels and eliminating the need for trusted parties due to the no-cloning theorem. Recent literature introduced a generalized mathematical framework for QPUFs, demonstrating that no random unitary QPUF can achieve existential unforgeability against Quantum Polynomial Time (QPT) adversaries. Additionally, we introduce a second model where the QPUF functions as a nonunitary quantum channel, which also guarantees existential unforgeability. These are the first models in the literature to demonstrate such a high level of provable security. Finally, we show that the Quantum Phase Estimation (QPE) protocol, applied to a Haar random unitary, serves as an approximate implementation of the second type of QPUF by approximating a von Neumann measurement on the eigenbasis of the unitary.</description>

      <title>Using PT-symmetric Qubits to Break the Tradeoff Between Fidelity and the Degree of Quantum Entanglement</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.08525v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A noteworthy discovery is that the minimal evolution time is smaller for parity-time ($\mathcal{PT}$) symmetric systems compared to Hermitian setups. Moreover, there is a significant acceleration of two-qubit quantum entanglement preparation near the exceptional point (EP), or spectral coalescence, within such system. Nevertheless, an important problem often overlooked for quantum EP-based devices is their fidelity, greatly affected by the process of dissipation or post-selection, creating an inherent trade-off relation between the degree of entanglement and fidelity. Our study demonstrates that this limitation can be effectively overcome by harnessing an active $\mathcal{PT}$-symmetric system, which possesses balanced gain and loss, enabling maximal entanglement with rapid speed, high fidelity, and greater resilience to non-resonant errors. This new approach can efficiently prepare multi-qubit entanglement and use not only bipartite but also tripartite entanglement, as illustrative examples, even when the precise gain-loss balance is not strictly maintained. Our analytical findings are in excellent agreement with numerical simulations, confirming the potential of truly $\mathcal{PT}$-devices as a powerful tool for creating and engineering diverse quantum resources for applications in quantum information technology</description>

      <title>Variational Quantum Imaginary Time Evolution for Matrix Product State Ansatz with Tests on Transcorrelated Hamiltonians</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.10523v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The matrix product state (MPS) ansatz offers a promising approach for finding the ground state of molecular Hamiltonians and solving quantum chemistry problems. Building on this concept, the proposed technique of quantum circuit MPS (QCMPS) enables the simulation of chemical systems using a relatively small number of qubits. In this study, we enhance the optimization performance of the QCMPS ansatz by employing the variational quantum imaginary time evolution (VarQITE) approach. Guided by McLachlan's variational principle, the VarQITE method provides analytical metrics and gradients, resulting in improved convergence efficiency and robustness of the QCMPS. We validate these improvements numerically through simulations of $\rm H_2$, $\rm H_4$, and $\rm LiH$ molecules. Additionally, given that VarQITE is applicable to non-Hermitian Hamiltonians, we evaluate its effectiveness in preparing the ground state of transcorrelated (TC) Hamiltonians. This approach yields energy estimates comparable to the complete basis set (CBS) limit while using even fewer qubits. Specifically, we perform simulations of the beryllium atom and $\rm LiH$ molecule using only three qubits, maintaining high fidelity with the CBS ground state energy of these systems. This qubit reduction is achieved through the combined advantages of both the QCMPS ansatz and transcorrelation. Our findings demonstrate the potential practicality of this quantum chemistry algorithm on near-term quantum devices.</description>

Abstract: Optical computing harnesses the speed of light to perform vector-matrix operations efficiently. It leverages interference, a cornerstone of quantum computing algorithms, to enable parallel computations. In this work, we interweave quantum computing with classical structured light by formulating the process of photonic matrix multiplication using quantum mechanical principles such as state superposition and subsequently demonstrate a well known algorithm, namely the Deutsch-Jozsa's algorithm. This is accomplished by elucidating the inherent tensor product structure within the Cartesian transverse degrees of freedom of light, which is the main resource for optical vector-matrix multiplication. To this end, we establish a discrete basis using localized Gaussian modes arranged in a lattice formation and demonstrate the operation of a Hadamard Gate. Leveraging the reprogrammable and digital capabilities of spatial light modulators, coupled with Fourier transforms by lenses, our approach proves adaptable to various algorithms. Therefore our work advances the use of structured light for quantum information processing.</description>

Abstract: Superconducting qubits, a promising candidate for universal quantum computing, currently face limitations in chip size due to reproducibility, wiring complexity, and packaging modes. Distributed quantum modules offer a viable strategy for constructing larger quantum information processing systems, though universal quantum gate operations between remote qubits have yet to be realized. Here, we demonstrate high-fidelity perfect entanglers between two remote superconducting quantum devices over 30 cm distance, leveraging the standing-wave modes in the coaxial cable connecting them. We achieve cross-entropy benchmarking (XEB) fidelities of $(99.15 \pm 0.02)\%$ and $(98.04 \pm 0.04)\%$ for CNOT and CZ gates, respectively, which are more efficient and universal than existing state transfer or feedback-based protocols. This advancement significantly enhances the feasibility of universal distributed quantum information processing, essential for the future development of large-scale quantum systems.</description>

      <title>Transmission of quantum information through quantum fields in curved spacetimes</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.00518v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We construct a relativistic quantum communication channel between two localized qubit systems, mediated by a relativistic quantum field, that can achieve the theoretical maximum for the quantum capacity in arbitrary curved spacetimes using the Unruh-DeWitt detector formalism. Using techniques from algebraic quantum field theory, we express the quantum capacity of the quantum communication channel purely in terms of the correlation functions of the field and the causal propagator for the wave equation. Consequently, the resulting quantum channel, and hence the quantum capacity, are by construction manifestly covariant, respect the causal structure of spacetime, and are independent of the details of the background geometry, topology, and the choice of Hilbert space (quasifree) representations of the field.</description>

      <title>Demonstration of strong coupling of a subradiant atom array to a cavity vacuum</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.17079v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: By considering linear scattering of cold atoms inside an undriven high-finesse optical resonator, we experimentally demonstrate effects unique to a strongly coupled vacuum field. Arranging the atoms in an incommensurate lattice, with respect to the resonator mode, the scattering can be suppressed by destructive interference: resulting in a subradiant atomic array. We show however, that strong coupling leads to a drastic modification of the excitation spectrum, as evidenced by well-resolved vacuum Rabi splitting in the intensity of the fluctuations. Furthermore, we demonstrate a significant polarization rotation in the linear scattering off the subradiant array via Raman scattering induced by the strongly coupled vacuum field.</description>

      <title>Low-characteristic-impedance superconducting tadpole resonators in the sub-gigahertz regime</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.02558</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.02558v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We demonstrate a simple and versatile resonator design based on a short strip of a typical coplanar waveguide shorted at one end to the ground and shunted at the other end with a large parallel-plate capacitor. Due to the shape of the structure, we coin it the tadpole resonator. The design allows tailoring the characteristic impedance of the resonator to especially suit applications requiring low values. We demonstrate characteristic impedances ranging from $Z_c = 2\,{\Omega}$ to $10\,{\Omega}$ and a frequency range from $f_0 = 290\,\mathrm{MHz}$ to $1.1\,\mathrm{GHz}$ while reaching internal quality factors of order $Q_{\mathrm{int}} = 8.5\times 10^3$ translating into a loss tangent of $\tan({\delta}) = 1.2\times 10^{-4}$ for the aluminium oxide used as the dielectric in the parallel plate capacitor. We conclude that these tadpole resonators are well suited for applications requiring low frequency and low charactersitic impedance while maintaining a small footprint on chip. The low characteristic impedance of the tadpole resonator renders it a promising candidate for achieving strong inductive coupling to other microwave components.</description>

      <title>Quantum thermodynamics as a gauge theory</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.07676v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Thermodynamics is based on a coarse-grained approach, from which its fundamental variables emerge, effectively erasing the complicate details of the microscopic dynamics within a macroscopic system. The strength of Thermodynamics lies in the universality provided by this paradigm. In contrast, quantum mechanics focuses on describing the dynamics of microscopic systems, aiming to make predictions about experiments we perform, a goal shared by all fundamental physical theories, which are often framed as gauge theories in modern physics. Recently, a gauge theory for quantum thermodynamics was introduced, defining gauge invariant work and heat, and exploring their connections to quantum phenomena. In this work, we extend that theory in two significant ways. First, we incorporate energy spectrum degeneracies, which were previously overlooked. Additionally, we define gauge-invariant entropy, exploring its properties and connections to other physical and informational quantities. This results in a complete framework for quantum thermodynamics grounded in the principle of gauge invariance. To demonstrate some implications of this theory, we apply it to well-known critical systems.</description>

      <title>Emergent Liouvillian exceptional points from exact principles</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.08100v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Recent years have seen a surge of interest in exceptional points in open quantum systems. The natural approach in this area has been the use of Markovian master equations. While the resulting Liouvillian EPs have been seen in a variety of systems and have been associated to numerous exotic effects, it is an open question whether such degeneracies and their peculiarities can persist beyond the validity of master equations. In this work, taking the example of a dissipative double-quantum-dot system, we show that Heisenberg equations for the system exhibit the same EPs as the corresponding master equations. To highlight the importance of this finding, we prove that the paradigmatic property associated to EPs - critical damping, persists well beyond the validity of master equations. Our results demonstrate that Liouvillian EPs can arise from underlying fundamental exact principles, rather than merely as a consequence of approximations involved in deriving master equations.</description>

      <title>Entanglement, Spin Squeezing and Quantum Sensing in a Spin-5/2 Heisenberg Molecular Iron(III) Triangle</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.13457</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.13457v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This study provides insights into the static and dynamic quantum properties of the trinuclear high-spin iron(III) molecular complex. Using exact diagonalization of a spin-5/2 Heisenberg triangle in a magnetic field, we model the corresponding quantum behavior of the molecular compound Fe$_3$. Our rigorous analysis employs various key metrics to explore a rich quantum behavior of this molecular compound. At sufficiently low temperatures, the bipartite negativity reveals that the pairwise entanglement between any pair of iron(III) magnetic ions of the molecular complex Fe$_3$ can be significantly enhanced by a small magnetic field. This enhancement is followed by unconventional step-like changes characterized by a sequence of plateaus and sudden downturns as the magnetic field further increases. A qualitatively similar behavior is also observed in the genuine tripartite entanglement among all three iron(III) magnetic ions in the trinuclear complex Fe$_3$. Notably, the bipartite and tripartite entanglement persist in the molecular complex Fe$_3$ up to moderate temperatures of approximately $30\,\text{K}$ and $70\,\text{K}$, respectively. We also utilized a spin squeezing parameter to identify parameter regions of coherent, entangled, and squeezed states of the molecular compound Fe$_3$. Our findings demonstrate that the squeezed states, which are relevant for technological applications, can be achieved at temperatures below $15\,\text{K}$ and magnetic fields under $25\,\text{T}$. Additionally, we demonstrate the achievement of quantum-enhanced sensitivity by initializing the molecular complex Fe$_3$ in Dicke states. Finally, we investigated a quantum-sensing protocol by applying a local magnetic field specifically to one iron(III) magnetic ion of the molecular compound Fe$_3$ and performing readout sequentially on one of two remaining iron(III) magnetic ions.</description>

      <title>Preparing Ground and Excited States Using Adiabatic CoVaR</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.16194</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.16194v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: CoVarince Root finding with classical shadows (CoVaR) was recently introduced as a new paradigm for training variational quantum circuits. Common approaches, such as variants of the Variational Quantum Eigensolver, aim to optimise a non-linear classical cost function and thus suffer from, e.g., poor local minima, high shot requirements and barren plateaus. In contrast, CoVaR fully exploits powerful classical shadows and finds joint roots of a very large number of covariances using only a logarithmic number of shots and linearly scaling classical HPC compute resources. As a result, CoVaR has been demonstrated to be particularly robust against local traps, however, its main limitation has been that it requires a sufficiently good initial state. We address this limitation by introducing an adiabatic morphing of the target Hamiltonian and demonstrate in a broad range of application examples that CoVaR can successfully prepare eigenstates of the target Hamiltonian when no initial warm start is known. CoVaR succeeds even when Hamiltonian energy gaps are very small -- this is in stark contrast to adiabatic evolution and phase estimation algorithms where circuit depths scale inversely with the Hamiltonian energy gaps. On the other hand, when the energy gaps are relatively small then adiabatic CoVaR may converge to higher excited states as opposed to a targeted specific low-lying state. Nevertheless, we exploit this feature of adiabatic CoVaR and demonstrate that it can be used to map out the low lying spectrum of a Hamiltonian which can be useful in practical applications, such as estimating thermal properties or in high-energy physics.</description>

      <title>The Influence of Quantum Correlation on the Holonomy of Spatially-Structured Bi-Photons</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.16401v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The manifestation of entanglement within geometric phase is elucidated for spatially-structured bi-photons. Entanglement parameters are shown to influence holonomy in two distinct ways: through statistical superpositions of separable states; and via quantum correlation. These are entwined within geometric phase, motivating the construction of a projective, gauge-invariant measure that allows the manifestation of quantum correlation to be pinpointed and explained. An optical circuit consisting of a pair of misoriented mode converters gives a practical demonstration. This is facilitated by a novel pump engineering method which produces photon pairs with tunable entanglement.</description>

      <title>Quantum Advantage in Distributed Sensing with Noisy Quantum Networks</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.17089v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We show that quantum advantage in distributed sensing can be achieved with noisy quantum networks. When using depolarized GHZ states as the probe, we derive a closed-form fidelity threshold to achieve advantage over the optimal local sensing strategy. The threshold indicates that while entanglement is needed for this quantum advantage, genuine multipartite entanglement is generally unnecessary. We further explore the impacts from imperfect local entanglement generation and local measurement constraint, and our results imply that the quantum advantage is more robust against quantum network imperfections than local operation errors. Finally, we demonstrate that the quantum advantage in distributed sensing can be achieved with a three-node quantum network using practical protocol stacks through simulations with SeQUeNCe, an open-source, customizable quantum network simulator.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.18420v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Quantum theory is consistent with a computational model permitting black-box operations to be applied in an indefinite causal order, going beyond the standard circuit model of computation. The quantum switch -- the simplest such example -- has been shown to provide numerous information-processing advantages. Here, we prove that the action of the quantum switch on two $n$-qubit quantum channels cannot be simulated deterministically and exactly by any causally ordered quantum circuit that uses $M$ calls to one channel and one call to the other, if $M \leq \max(2, 2^n-1)$. This demonstrates an exponential separation in quantum query complexity of indefinite causal order compared to standard quantum circuits.</description>

Abstract: Hyperbolic lattices are a new type of synthetic quantum matter emulated in circuit quantum electrodynamics and electric-circuit networks, where particles coherently hop on a discrete tessellation of two-dimensional negatively curved space. While real-space methods and a reciprocal-space hyperbolic band theory have been recently proposed to analyze the energy spectra of those systems, discrepancies between the two sets of approaches remain. In this work, we reconcile those approaches by first establishing an equivalence between hyperbolic band theory and $U(N)$ topological Yang-Mills theory on higher-genus Riemann surfaces. We then show that moments of the density of states of hyperbolic tight-binding models correspond to expectation values of Wilson loops in the quantum gauge theory and become exact in the large-$N$ limit.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2312.14137v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The physics of doped Mott insulators is at the heart of strongly correlated materials and is believed to constitute an essential ingredient for high-temperature superconductivity. In systems with higher SU(N) spin symmetries, even richer magnetic ground states appear at a filling of one particle per site compared to the case of SU(2) spins, but their fate upon doping remains largely unexplored. Here we address this question by studying a single hole in the SU(3) $t$-$J$ model, whose undoped ground state features long-range, diagonal spin stripes. By analyzing both ground state and dynamical properties utilizing the density matrix renormalization group, we establish the appearence of magnetic polarons consisting of chargons and flavor defects, whose dynamics is constrained to a single effective dimension along the ordered diagonal. We semi-analytically describe the system using geometric string theory, where paths of hole motion are the fundamental degrees of freedom. With recent advances in the realization and control of SU(N) Fermi-Hubbard models with ultracold atoms in optical lattices, our results can directly be observed in quantum gas microscopes with single-site resolution. Our work suggests the appearance of intricate ground states at finite doping constituted by emergent, coupled Luttinger liquids along diagonals, and is a first step towards exploring a wealth of physics in doped SU(N) Fermi-Hubbard models on various geometries.</description>

      <title>Developments in Sheaf-Theoretic Models of Natural Language Ambiguities</title>

      <description>arXiv:2402.04505v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Sheaves are mathematical objects consisting of a base which constitutes a topological space and the data associated with each open set thereof, e.g. continuous functions defined on the open sets. Sheaves have originally been used in algebraic topology and logic. Recently, they have also modelled events such as physical experiments and natural language disambiguation processes. We extend the latter models from lexical ambiguities to discourse ambiguities arising from anaphora. To begin, we calculated a new measure of contextuality for a dataset of basic anaphoric discourses, resulting in a higher proportion of contextual models-82.9%-compared to previous work which only yielded 3.17% contextual models. Then, we show how an extension of the natural language processing challenge, known as the Winograd Schema, which involves anaphoric ambiguities can be modelled on the Bell-CHSH scenario with a contextual fraction of 0.096.

      <description>arXiv:2404.08744v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate resource allocation for quantum entanglement distribution over an optical network. We characterize and model a network architecture that employs a single quasi-deterministic time-frequency heralded Einstein-Podolsky-Rosen (EPR) pair source, and develop a routing scheme for distributing entangled photon pairs over such a network. We focus on max-min fairness in entanglement distribution and compare the performance of various spectrum allocation schemes by examining the max-min and median number of EPR-pairs assigned by them, and the Jain index associated with this assignment. Since this presents an NP-hard problem, we identify two approximation algorithms that outperform others in minimum and mean EPR-pair rate distribution and are comparable to others in the Jain index. We also analyze how the network size and connectivity affect these metrics using Watts-Strogatz random graphs. We find that a spectrum allocation approach that achieves high minimum EPR-pair rate can perform significantly worse when the median EPR-pair rate, Jain index, and runtimes are considered.</description>

      <title>Constrained Hamiltonian dynamics for electrons in magnetic field and additional forces besides the Lorentz force acting on electrons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.18019</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.18019v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We consider the forces acting on electrons in magnetic field including the constraints and a condition arising from quantum mechanics. The force is calculated as the electron mass, $m_e$, multiplied by the total time-derivative of the velocity field evaluated using the quantum mechanical many-electron wave function. The velocity field includes a term of the Berry connection from the many-body wave function; thereby, quantum mechanical effects are included. It is shown that additional important forces besides the Lorentz force exist; they include the gradient of the electron velocity field kinetic energy, the gradient of the chemical potential, and the `force' for producing topologically protected loop currents. These additional forces are shown to be important in superconductivity, electric current in metallic wires, and charging of capacitors.</description>

      <title>Local control and mixed dimensions: Exploring high-temperature superconductivity in optical lattices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.02551</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.02551v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The simulation of high-temperature superconducting materials by implementing strongly correlated fermionic models in optical lattices is one of the major objectives in the field of analog quantum simulation. Here we show that local control and optical bilayer capabilities combined with spatially resolved measurements create a versatile toolbox to study fundamental properties of both nickelate and cuprate high-temperature superconductors. On the one hand, we present a scheme to implement a mixed-dimensional (mixD) bilayer model that has been proposed to capture the essential pairing physics of pressurized bilayer nickelates. This allows for the long-sought realization of a state with long-range superconducting order in current lattice quantum simulation machines. In particular, we show how coherent pairing correlations can be accessed in a partially particle-hole transformed and rotated basis. On the other hand, we demonstrate that control of local gates enables the observation of $d$-wave pairing order in the two-dimensional (single-layer) repulsive Fermi-Hubbard model through the simulation of a system with attractive interactions. Lastly, we introduce a scheme to measure momentum-resolved dopant densities, providing access to observables complementary to solid-state experiments -- which is of particular interest for future studies of the enigmatic pseudogap phase appearing in cuprates.</description>

      <title>Collective motion using quantum-like entanglement of neighbours in perceptual space</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.18985</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.18985v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We explore the collective motion of self-propelled agents through the lens of quantum-like entanglement in visual perception. This approach makes the non-linear dynamics in ordinary space a derivative of dynamics in the Hilbert space of perception. By appropriate choice of operators in this quantum-inspired model, we show how the familiar Vicsek model, a well-known paradigm for flocking behaviour, naturally emerges. Furthermore, we extend the analysis to explore how different types of entangled quantum states-such as GHZ states, W states, and cluster states-affect collective motion. Each type of entanglement introduces unique coordination patterns, interaction strength, and information sharing among agents, leading to different collective behaviours.</description>
