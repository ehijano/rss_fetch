      <title>Four-valued logics of indicative conditionals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.21882</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.21882v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We detail some ways in which the study of three-valued logics of indicative conditionals can be extended by further adding a new truth-value. Our approach heavily relies on twist constructions, which have been already used in the literature in order to provide algebraic semantics in the three-valued case. Here we follow the inverse path: we first specify how these twist constructions, expanded with the new truth-value, induce new logics and then we prove the corresponding twist representation results.</description>

      <title>A discrete-time temporal deontic STIT logic based on interpreted systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.22175</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.22175v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a STIT (`see to it that') logic with discrete temporal operators and deontic operators in which we can formalize and reason about legal concepts such as persistent duty and the dynamic concept of power from Hohfeld. As our main technical contribution, we show that this logic is sound and complete with respect to the semantics based on interpreted systems and is decidable.</description>

      <title>Stable Canonical Rules and Formulas for Pre-transitive Logics via Definable Filtration</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.22638</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.22638v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We generalize the theory of stable canonical rules by adopting definable filtration, a generalization of the method of filtration. We show that for a modal rule system or a modal logic that admits definable filtration, each extension is axiomatizable by stable canonical rules. Moreover, we provide an algebraic presentation of Gabbay's filtration and generalize stable canonical formulas and the axiomatization results via stable canonical formulas for $\mathsf{K4}$ to pre-transitive logics $\mathsf{K4^{m+1}_{1}} = \mathsf{K} + \Diamond^{m+1} p \to \Diamond p$ $(m \geq 1)$. As consequences, we obtain the fmp of $\mathsf{K4^{m+1}_{1}}$-stable logics and a characterization of splitting and union-splitting logics in the lattice $\mathsf{NExt}\mathsf{K4^{m+1}_{1}}$. Finally, we introduce $m$-stable canonical formulas, strengthening the axiomatization results for these logics.</description>

      <title>New consequences of PFA($T^*$)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.22807</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.22807v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $T^*$ be an almost Suslin tree, that is, an Aronszajn tree with no stationary antichains. Krueger introduced a forcing axiom, $\mathrm{PFA}(T^*)$, for the class of proper forcings that preserve that $T^*$ is almost Suslin. He showed that $\mathrm{PFA}(T^*)$ implies several well-known consequences of the Proper Forcing Axiom ($\mathrm{PFA}$), including Suslin's Hypothesis and the P-ideal dichotomy. We extend this list by proving that $\mathrm{PFA}(T^*)$ also implies the Mapping Reflection Principle ($\mathrm{MRP}$) and the Open Graph Axiom ($\mathrm{OGA}$). Additionally, we show that $\mathrm{PFA}(T^*)$ implies that all special Aronszajn trees are club-isomorphic, but it does not imply that all almost Suslin trees are club-isomorphic.</description>

      <title>The completeness and congruences of quasi-Boolean algebras</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.23094</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.23094v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quasi-Boolean algebras were introduced as the generalization of Boolean algebras in the setting of quantum computation logic. In this paper, we investigate the completeness and congruences of quasi-Boolean algebras. First, we discuss the number of finite quasi-Boolean algebras and characterize the finite irreducible quasi-Boolean algebras. Second, we show the standard completeness of quasi-Boolean algebras. Finally, we prove that the variety of quasi-Boolean algebras satisfies the congruence extension property and provide a complete characterization of how congruences on a Boolean subalgebra can be extended to the whole quasi-Boolean algebra.</description>

      <title>Borel Complexity of the set of vectors normal for a fixed recurrence sequence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.23380</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.23380v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we consider recurrence sequences $x_n=\xi_1 \alpha_1^n+\xi_2 \alpha_2^n$ ($n=0,1,\ldots$) with companion polynomial $P(X)$. For example, the sequence $x_n=\xi_1(4+\sqrt{2})^n+\xi_2(4-\sqrt{2})^n$ satisfies the recurrence $x_{n+2}-8x_{n+1}+14x_n=0$ and has companion polynomial $P(X)=X^2-8X+14=(X-4-\sqrt{2})(X-4+\sqrt{2})$. We call $(\xi_1,\xi_2)$ normal with respect to the recurrence relation determined by $P(X)$ when $(x_n)_{n\ge 0}$ is uniformly distributed modulo one.
  Determining the Borel complexity of the set of normal vectors for a fixed recurrence sequence is unresolved even for most geometric progressions. Under certain assumptions, we prove that the set of normal vectors is $\boldsymbol{\Pi}_3^0$-complete. A special case is the new result that the sets of numbers normal in base $\alpha$, i.e. $\{\xi\in \mathbb{R}\mid (\xi\alpha^n)_{n\geq 0}\mbox{ is u.d. modulo one.} \}$, are $\boldsymbol{\Pi}_3^0$-complete for every real number $\alpha$ with $|\alpha|$ Pisot. We analyze the fractional parts of recurrence sequences in terms of finite words via certain numeration systems. One of the difficulties in proving the main result is that even when recurrence sequences are uniformly distributed modulo one, it is not known what the average frequencies of the digits in the corresponding digital expansions are or if they even must exist.</description>

      <title>Coalgebraic models of Omega-groups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.22653</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.22653v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate models of algebraic theories in the category of cocommutative coalgebras over a field. We establish some of their categorical properties, similar to those of algebraic varieties. We introduce a class of categories of coalgebraic models of algebraic theories endowed with an underlying structure of cocommutative Hopf algebra, and show that these categories are semi-abelian. We call them ``categories of Omega-Hopf algebras'', since it is possible to characterize them as coalgebraic models of algebraic theories of Omega-groups.</description>

      <title>Logical GANs: Adversarial Learning through Ehrenfeucht Fraisse Games</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.22824</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.22824v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: GANs promise indistinguishability, logic explains it. We put the two on a budget: a discriminator that can only ``see'' up to a logical depth $k$, and a generator that must look correct to that bounded observer. \textbf{LOGAN} (LOGical GANs) casts the discriminator as a depth-$k$ Ehrenfeucht--Fra\"iss\'e (EF) \emph{Opponent} that searches for small, legible faults (odd cycles, nonplanar crossings, directed bridges), while the generator plays \emph{Builder}, producing samples that admit a $k$-round matching to a target theory $T$. We ship a minimal toolkit -- an EF-probe simulator and MSO-style graph checkers -- and four experiments including real neural GAN training with PyTorch. Beyond verification, we score samples with a \emph{logical loss} that mixes budgeted EF round-resilience with cheap certificate terms, enabling a practical curriculum on depth. Framework validation demonstrates $92\%$--$98\%$ property satisfaction via simulation (Exp.~3), while real neural GAN training achieves $5\%$--$14\%$ improvements on challenging properties and $98\%$ satisfaction on connectivity (matching simulation) through adversarial learning (Exp.~4). LOGAN is a compact, reproducible path toward logic-bounded generation with interpretable failures, proven effectiveness (both simulated and real training), and dials for control.</description>

      <title>Games as recursive coalgebras: A categorical view on the Nim-sum</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.22886</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.22886v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In 1901, Bouton proved that a winning strategy of the game of Nim is given by the bitwise XOR, called the nim-sum. But, why does such a weird binary operation work? Led by this question, this paper introduces a categorical reinterpretation of combinatorial games and the nim-sum. The main categorical gadget used here is recursive coalgebras, which allow us to redefine games as ``graphs on which we can conduct recursive calculation'' in a concise and precise way.
  For game-theorists, we provide a systematic framework to decompose an impartial game into simpler games and synthesize the quantities on them, which generalizes the nim-sum rule for the Conway addition. To read the first half of this paper, the categorical preliminaries are limited to the definitions of categories and functors.
  For category theorists, this paper offers a nicely behaved category of games $\mathbf{Games}$, which is a locally finitely presentable symmetric monoidal closed category comonadic over $\mathbf{Set}$ admitting a subobject classifier!
  As this paper has several ways to be developed, we list seven open questions in the final section.</description>

      <title>Definable discrete sets with large continuum</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/1610.03331</link>
      <description>arXiv:1610.03331v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Let $\mathcal R$ be a $\Sigma^1_1$ binary relation and call a set $\mathcal R$-discrete iff no two distinct of its elements are $\mathcal R$-related. We show that in the extension of $\mathbf{L}$ by iterated Sacks forcing, there is a $\Delta^1_2$ maximal $\mathcal R$-discrete set, and thus the existence of such sets is compatible with the negation of the continuum hypothesis. As an application we find a $\Pi^1_1$ maximal orthogonal family of Borel probability measures in said extension. The basis of this is a new Ramsey theoretic result.</description>

      <title>Approaching a Bristol model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2006.04514</link>
      <description>arXiv:2006.04514v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The Bristol model is an inner model of $L[c]$, where $c$ is a Cohen real, which is not constructible from a set. The idea was developed in 2011 in a workshop taking place in Bristol, but was only written in detail by the author in [8]. This paper is a guide for those who want to get a broader view of the construction. We try to provide more intuition that might serve as a jumping board for those interested in this construction and in odd models of $\mathsf{ZF}$. We also correct a few minor issues in the original paper, as well as prove new results. For example, that the Boolean Prime Ideal theorem fails in the Bristol model, as some sets cannot be linearly ordered, and the ground model is always definable in its Bristol extensions. In addition to this we include a discussion on Kinna--Wagner Principles, which we think may play an important role in understanding the generic multiverse in $\mathsf{ZF}$.</description>

      <title>T-Convexity, Tame Extensions and Definability of Hausdorff Limits in O-minimal Structures with Generic Derivations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.16967</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.16967v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the combination of two o-minimal extensions of the theory of real closed fields: one by a T-convex subring and the other by a T-derivation. Let T be a complete, model complete o-minimal extension of RCF. We show that the combined theory T_convex^delta has a model completion T_g,convex^delta. By adding a definable unary function st, we obtain a relative quantifier elimination result for tame pairs (M, delta^M, st^M, N, delta^N, st^N), where st is the standard part map and N is Dedekind complete in M. As an application, we prove the stable embedding property for tame pairs of T_g^delta. We also associate a sequence of definable metric topologies with models of T_g^delta and prove the Marker-Steinhorn Theorem for T_g^delta. As a consequence, Hausdorff limits of definable families are definable. A special case of our framework recovers Borotta's results on CODF with convex valuation subrings and tame pairs.</description>

      <title>A probabilistic look at the infinite hat-guessing game</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.02828</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.02828v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this article, we look at a hat-guessing game, in which each player must guess the color of their own hat while only seeing the hats of the other players. We focus on the case of two hat colors and a countably infinite number of players. By strategizing in advance, the players can, in some ways, do much better than random guessing; using the axiom of choice, they can in fact achieve highly counter-intuitive success. We review some of these results. Then, we use tools from probability to obtain bounds on how successful a strategy can be under a measurability hypothesis, in terms of the asymptotic density of the set of correctly guessing players. As we discuss, this illustrates that the full axiom of choice is truly necessary for the counter-intuitively successful strategies, and that there is a wide gap between what can be achieved with and without choice.</description>
