      <title>Resonant light scattering by a slab of ultracold atoms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.04148</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.04148v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A gas of ultracold atoms probed with laser light is a nearly-ideal experimental realization of a medium of resonant point-like scatterers, a key problem from condensed matter to biology or photonics. Yet, several recent experiments have reported large discrepancies with theory. In this work, we measure the complex transmission through a slab of ultracold two-level atoms with an interferometric technique. We find good agreement with first-principles simulations of mutually-coupled, laser-driven dipoles, and provide an explanation for the discrepancies in earlier measurements.</description>

      <title>Benchmarking Quantum Red TEA on CPUs, GPUs, and TPUs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.03818</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.03818v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We benchmark simulations of many-body quantum systems on heterogeneous hardware platforms using CPUs, GPUs, and TPUs. We compare different linear algebra backends, e.g., numpy versus the torch, jax, or tensorflow library, as well as a mixed-precision-inspired approach and optimizations for the target hardware. Quantum red TEA out of the Quantum TEA library specifically addresses handling tensors with different libraries or hardware, where the tensors are the building block of tensor network algorithms. The benchmark problem is a variational search of a ground state in an interacting model. This is a ubiquitous problem in quantum many-body physics, which we solve using tensor network methods. This approximate state-of-the-art method compresses quantum correlations which is key to overcoming the exponential growth of the Hilbert space as a function of the number of particles. We present a way to obtain speedups of a factor of 34 when tuning parameters on the CPU, and an additional factor of 2.76 on top of the best CPU setup when migrating to GPUs.</description>

      <title>An Explicit Wavefunction of the Interacting Non-Hermitian Spin-1/2 1D System</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.04112</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.04112v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present an explicit Bethe-ansatz wavefunction to a 1D spin-$\frac{1}{2}$ interacting fermion system, manifesting a many-body resonance resulting from the interplay between interaction and non-Hermitian spin-orbit coupling. In the dilute limit, the wavefunction is greatly simplified and then factorized into Slater determinants and a Jastrow factor. An effective thermodynamic distribution is constructed with an effective Hamiltonian including a repulsion resulting from Pauli's exclusion principle and a distinctive zigzag potential arising from the resonance. The competition between these effects leads to a transition from a uniformly distributed configuration to a phase separation. The connection to the recent cold atom experimental efforts of realizing on-site atom-loss is discussed.</description>

      <title>Relativistic BEC extracted from a complex FRG flow equation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.04361</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.04361v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Based on the functional renormalization group (FRG) under the local potential approximation, we analyze the Bose-Einstein condensation (BEC) in the relativistic complex scalar theory. This framework leads to a complex flow equation of the effective potential, even with the well-known Litim regulator. In order to evaluate the condensate from such a complex effective potential, we impose a condition between chemical potential and mass, analogously to those in the free theory or the mean field theory. We elucidate that for the strongly (weakly) coupled theory, the phase diagrams computed from the FRG are more (less) deviated from that under the mean field approximation. This result implies that quantum fluctuations strongly affect the nonperturbative formation of the BEC.</description>

      <title>Generalized cold-atom simulators for vacuum decay</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.02156</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.02156v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Cold-atom analog experiments are a promising new tool for studying relativistic vacuum decay, enabling one to empirically probe early-Universe theories in the laboratory. However, existing proposals place stringent requirements on the atomic scattering lengths that are challenging to realize experimentally. Here we eliminate these restrictions and show that any stable mixture between two states of a bosonic isotope can be used as a faithful relativistic analog. This greatly expands the landscape of suitable experiments, and will expedite efforts to study vacuum decay with cold atoms.</description>

Abstract: We present simple arguments suggesting that H. Biss et al [PRL 128, 100401 (2022)] did not measure with the required accuracy the low-wavenumber curvature of the acoustic excitation branch of the ground-state unitary Fermi gas. This difficult-to-calculate quantity is crucial for the relaxation dynamics of the gas at low temperature.</description>

      <title>Bose-Einstein Condensation of Photons in a Four-Site Quantum Ring</title>

      <description>arXiv:2312.14741v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Thermalization of radiation by contact to matter is a well-known concept, but the application of thermodynamic methods to complex quantum states of light remains a challenge. Here we observe Bose-Einstein condensation of photons into the hybridized ground state of a four-site ring potential with coherent tunnel couplings. In our experiment, the periodically-closed ring lattice superimposed by a weak harmonic trap for photons is realized inside a spatially structured dye-filled microcavity. Photons thermalize to room temperature, and above a critical photon number macroscopically occupy the symmetric linear combination of the site eigenstates with zero phase winding, which constitutes the ground state of the system. The mutual phase coherence of photons at different lattice sites is verified by optical interferometry.</description>

      <title>Perspective: Interactions mediated by atoms, photons, electrons, and excitons</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.13795v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Interactions between quasiparticles mediated by a surrounding environment are ubiquitous and lead to a range of important effects from collective modes of low temperature quantum gases, superconductivity, to the interaction between elementary particles at high energies. This perspective article is motivated by experimental progress in the fields of quantum degenerate atomic gases, cavity QED, and two-dimensional (2D) semi-conductors, which enable a systematic exploration of mediated interactions in new settings and regimes. We first describe how to microscopically calculate the quasiparticle interaction using perturbation theory, diagrammatics, and the path integral, highlighting the key role played by the quantum statistics of the quasiparticles. Recent theoretical and experimental insights into quasiparticle and mediated interactions in general obtained from atomic gases are then discussed, after which we focus on hybrid light-atom systems where a remarkable long range photon mediated interaction can be realised. Next, we describe new and puzzling results regarding the interaction between quasiparticles in 2D semiconductors. We then discuss how mediated interactions open up ways to realise new quantum phases in atomic and hybrid atom-photon systems as well as 2D semiconductors, and the perspective ends by posing some open questions and outlook.</description>

      <title>Observation of Shapiro steps in an ultracold atomic Josephson junction</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.03340v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The current-voltage characteristic of a driven superconducting Josephson junction displays discrete steps. This phenomenon, discovered by Sydney Shapiro, forms today's voltage standard. Here, we report the observation of Shapiro steps in a driven Josephson junction in a gas of ultracold atoms. We demonstrate that the steps exhibit universal features, and provide key insight into the microscopic dissipative dynamics that we directly observe in the experiment. Most importantly, the steps are directly connected to phonon emission and soliton nucleation. The experimental results are underpinned by extensive numerical simulations based on classical-field dynamics and represent the transfer of the voltage standard to the realm of ultracold quantum gases.</description>

      <title>Shapiro steps in strongly-interacting Fermi gases</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.03448</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.03448v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We report the observation of Shapiro steps in a periodically driven Josephson junction between strongly-interacting Fermi superfluids of ultracold atoms. We observe quantized plateaus in the current-potential characteristics, the height and width of which mirror the external drive frequency and the junction nonlinear response. Direct measurements of the current-phase relationship showcase how Shapiro steps arise from the synchronization between the relative phase of the two reservoirs and the external drive. Such mechanism is further supported by the detection of periodic phase-slippage processes, in the form of vortex-antivortex pairs. Our results are corroborated by a circuital model and numerical simulations, overall providing a clear understanding of Shapiro dynamics in atomic Fermi superfluids. Our work demonstrates phase-coherent and synchronization effects in driven strongly-interacting superfluids, opening prospects for studying emergent non-equilibrium dynamics in quantum many-body systems under external drives.</description>

      <title>Global becomes local: Efficient many-body dynamics for global master equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.07105</link>
      <description>arXiv:2309.07105v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This work makes progress on the issue of global- vs. local- master equations. Global master equations like the Redfield master equation (following from standard Born- and Markov- approximation) require a full diagonalization of the system Hamiltonian. This is especially challenging for interacting quantum many-body systems. We discuss a short-bath-correlation-time expansion in reciprocal (energy) space, leading to a series expansion of the jump operator, which avoids a diagonalization of the Hamiltonian. For a bath that is coupled locally to one site, this typically leads to an expansion of the global Redfield jump operator in terms of local operators. We additionally map the local Redfield master equation to a novel local Lindblad form, giving an equation which has the same conceptual advantages of traditional local Lindblad approaches, while being applicable in a much broader class of systems. Our ideas give rise to a non-heuristic foundation of local master equations, which can be combined with established many-body methods.</description>

      <title>Anomalous universal quantum transport in 2D asymptotic quasiperiodic system</title>

      <description>arXiv:2312.04349v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Quasiperiodic systems extend the concept of the Anderson transition to quasi-random and low-dimensional realms and have garnered widespread attention. Here, we propose the asymptotic quasiperiodic two-dimensional systems characterized by a sequence of rational magnetic fluxes, which have an irrational limit, and predict exotic universal wave-packet dynamics and transport phenomena associated with the asymptotic quasiperiodicity (AQP). The predictions unveil a class of multiple metal-insulator transitions driven by a novel interplay effect between AQP, relaxation, and finite temperature, which further reveals a unified and profound mechanism. Specifically, all the transport phenomena, including the wave-packet dynamics, the bulk and edge transport, are unified in the universal scaling laws unveiled in the asymptotic quasiperiodic regime, which demonstrate a nontrivial asymptotic connection to quantum phases in the quasiperiodic limit. Our work enriches the universal quantum transport phenomena, adds to the basic mechanisms underlying metal-insulator transitions, and opens up an avenue to study the exotic transport physics with AQP in high dimensions.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.02990v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Trapped ions offer long coherence times and high fidelity, programmable quantum operations, making them a promising platform for quantum simulation of condensed matter systems, quantum dynamics, and problems related to high-energy physics. We review selected developments in trapped-ion qubits and architectures and discuss quantum simulation applications that utilize these emerging capabilities. This review emphasizes developments in digital (gate-based) quantum simulations that exploit trapped-ion hardware capabilities, such as flexible qubit connectivity, selective mid-circuit measurement, and classical feedback, to simulate models with long-range interactions, explore non-unitary dynamics, compress simulations of states with limited entanglement, and reduce the circuit depths required to prepare or simulate long-range entangled states.</description>
