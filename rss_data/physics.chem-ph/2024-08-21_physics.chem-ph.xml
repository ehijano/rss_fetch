      <title>Elucidating the mechanism of helium evaporation from liquid water</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.10345</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.10345v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the evaporation of trace amounts of helium solvated in liquid water using molecular dynamics simulations and theory. Consistent with experimental observations, we find a super-Maxwellian distribution of kinetic energies of evaporated helium. This excess of kinetic energy over typical thermal expectations is explained by an effective continuum theory of evaporation based on a Fokker-Planck equation, parameterized molecularly by a potential of mean force and position-dependent friction. Using this description, we find that helium evaporation is strongly influenced by the friction near the interface, which is anomalously small near the Gibbs dividing surface due to the ability of the liquid-vapor interface to deform around the gas particle. Our reduced description provides a mechanistic interpretation of trace gas evaporation as the motion of an underdamped particle in a potential subject to a viscous environment that varies rapidly across the air-water interface. From it we predict the temperature dependence of the excess kinetic energy of evaporation, which is yet to be measured.</description>

      <title>Enhanced strong-field ionization and fragmentation of methanol using non-commensurate fields</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.10423</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.10423v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Electron-initiated chemistry with chemically relevant electron energies (10-200 eV) is at the heart of several high-energy processes and phenomena. To probe these dissociation and fragmentation reactions with femtosecond resolution requires the use of femtosecond lasers to induce ionization of the polyatomic molecules via electron rescattering. Here, we combine non-commensurate fields with intensity-difference spectra using methanol as a model system. Experimentally, we find orders of magnitude enhancement in several product ions of methanol when comparing coherent vs incoherent combinations of non-commensurate fields. This approach not only mitigates multi-photon ionization and multi-cycle effects during ionization but also enhances tunnel ionization and electron rescattering energy.</description>

      <title>Revisiting the measurements and interpretations of DLVO forces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.10870</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.10870v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The DLVO theory and electrical double layer (EDL) theory are the foundation of colloid and interface science. With the invention and development of surface forces apparatus (SFA) and atomic force microscope (AFM), the measurements and interpretations of DLVO forces (i.e., mainly measuring the EDL force (electrostatic force) FEDL and van der Waals force FvdW, and interpreting the potential {\psi}, charge density {\sigma}, and Hamaker constant H) can be greatly facilitated by various surface force measurement techniques, and would have been very promising in advancing the DLVO theory, EDL theory, and colloid and interface science. However, although numerous studies have been conducted, pervasive anomalous results can be identified throughout the literature, main including: (1) the fitted {\psi}/{\sigma} is normally extremely small ({\psi} can be close to or (much) smaller than {\psi}{\zeta} (zeta potential)) and varies greatly; (2) the fitted {\psi}/{\sigma} can exceed the allowable range of calculation; and (3) the measured FvdW and the fitted H vary greatly. Based on rigorous and comprehensive arguments, we have reasonably explained the pervasive anomalous results in the literature and further speculated that, the pervasive anomalous results are existing but not noticed and questioned owing to the two important aspects: (1) the pervasive unreasonable understandings of EDL theory and (2) the commonly neglected systematic errors. Consequently, we believe that the related studies have been seriously hampered. We therefore call for re-examination and re-analysis of related experimental results and theoretical understandings by careful consideration of the EDL theory and systematic errors. On these bases, we can interpret the experimental results properly and promote the development of EDL theory, colloid and interface science, and many related fields.</description>

      <title>Multiple Topology Replica Exchange of Expanded Ensembles (MT-REXEE) for Multidimensional Alchemical Calculations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.11038</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.11038v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Relative free energy calculations are now widely used in academia and industry, but the accuracy is often limited by poor sampling of the complexes conformational ensemble. To address this, we have developed a novel method termed Multi-Topology Replica Exchange of Expanded Ensembles (MT-REXEE). This method enables parallel expanded ensemble calculations, facilitating iterative relative free energy computations while allowing conformational exchange between parallel transformations. These iterative transformations are adaptable to any set of systems with a common backbone or central substructure. We demonstrate that the MT-REXEE method maintains thermodynamic cycle closure to the same extent as standard expanded ensemble for both solvation free energy and relative binding free energy. The transformations tested involve simple systems that incorporate diverse heavy atoms and multi-site perturbations of a small molecule core resembling multi-site $\lambda$ dynamics, without necessitating modifications to the MD code, which in our initial implementation is GROMACS. We outline a systematic approach for topology set-up and provide instructions on how to perform inter-replicate coordinate modifications. This work shows that MT-REEXE can be used to perform accurate and reproducible free energy estimates and prompts expansion to more complex test systems and other molecular dynamics simulation infrastructures.</description>

      <title>Electric field dependent g factors of YbOH molecule</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.10244</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.10244v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: YbOH molecule is one of the most sensitive systems for the electron electric dipole moment ($e$EDM) searches. Zeeman splittings of the $e$EDM sensitive levels have significant implications to control and suppress important systematic effects due to stray magnetic field in experiments for $e$EDM searches. The electric-field-dependent g factors of the lowest rotational level of the first excited bending vibrational mode of $^{174}$YbOH are calculated. l-doublet levels with small g factors difference are found and main contributions to the difference are determined.</description>

      <title>Enhanced Shadow Tomography of Molecular Excited States from Enforcing $N$-representability Conditions by Semidefinite Programming</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.11025</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.11025v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Excited-state properties of highly correlated systems are key to understanding photosynthesis, luminescence, and the development of novel optical materials, but accurately capturing their interactions is computationally costly. We present an algorithm that combines classical shadow tomography with physical constraints on the two-electron reduced density matrix (2-RDM) to treat excited states. The method reduces the number of measurements of the many-electron 2-RDM on quantum computers by (i) approximating the quantum state through a random sampling technique called shadow tomography and (ii) ensuring that the 2-RDM represents an $N$-electron system through imposing $N$-representability constraints by semidefinite programming. This generalizes recent work on the $N$-representability-enhanced shadow tomography of ground-state 2-RDMs. We compute excited-state energies and 2-RDMs of the H$_4$ chain and analyze the critical points along the photoexcited reaction pathway from gauche-1,3-butadiene to bicyclobutane via a conical intersection. The results show that the generalized shadow tomography retains critical multireference correlation effects while significantly reducing the number of required measurements, offering a promising avenue for the efficient treatment of electronically excited states on quantum devices.</description>

      <title>Shadow Ansatz for the Many-Fermion Wave Function in Scalable Molecular Simulations on Quantum Computing Devices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.11026</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.11026v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Here we show that shadow tomography can generate an efficient and exact ansatz for the many-fermion wave function on quantum devices. We derive the shadow ansatz -- a product of transformations applied to the mean-field wave function -- by exploiting a critical link between measurement and preparation. Each transformation is obtained by measuring a classical shadow of the residual of the contracted Schr\"odinger equation (CSE), the many-electron Schr\"odinger equation (SE) projected onto the space of two electrons. We show that the classical shadows of the CSE vanish if and only if the wave function satisfies the SE and, hence, that randomly sampling only the two-electron space yields an exact ansatz regardless of the total number of electrons. We demonstrate the ansatz's advantages for scalable simulations -- fewer measurements and shallower circuits -- by computing H$_{3}$ on simulators and a quantum device.</description>

      <title>Stationary conditions for excited states: the surprising impact of density-driven correlations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.12593</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.12593v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Typical density functional theory (DFT) and approximations thereto solve the many-electron ground state problem by working from a numerically efficient non-interacting Kohn-Sham reference system; and benefit from useful minimization conditions that allow iteration (i.e. self-consistency) to the optimal energy and density. Ensembles of ground and excited states can also benefit from similar minimization conditions [see in source]. This work reveals that individual excited states also have state-specific stationary conditions, that can be deduced from the ensemble solution and apply to DFT and its interacting potential functional theory (PFT) counterpart. However, the state-specific stationary condition for the non-interacting Kohn-Sham PFT is revealed to be more complicated than the ground state problem, due in part to a contribution from density-driven correlations [Phys. Rev. Lett. 123, 016401 (2019); 124, 243001 (2020); 125, 233001 (2020)] that are neglected in ``$\Delta$SCF'' approaches. Some implications for self-consistency in exact theory and approximations are discussed.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.11508v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Several closely related ab initio thermal mean-field theories for fermions, both well-established and new ones, are compared with one another at the formalism level and numerically. The theories considered are Fermi-Dirac theory, thermal Hartree-Fock (HF) theory, two modifications of the thermal single-determinant approximation of Kaplan and Argyres, and first-order finite-temperature many-body perturbation theory based on zero-temperature or thermal HF reference. The thermal full-configuration-interaction theory is used as the benchmark.</description>

      <title>Escape of an Active Ring from an Attractive Surface: Behaving Like a Self-Propelled Brownian Particle</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.20613</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.20613v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Escape of active agents from metastable states is of great interest in statistical and biological physics. In this study, we investigate the escape of a flexible active ring, composed of active Brownian particles, from a flat attractive surface using Brownian dynamics simulations. To systematically explore the effects of activity, persistence time, and the shape of attractive potentials, we calculate escape time and effective temperature. We observe two distinct escape mechanisms: Kramers-like thermal activation at small persistence times and the maximal force problem at large persistence time, where escape time is determined by persistence time. The escape time explicitly depends on the shape of the potential barrier at high activity and large persistence time. Moreover, when the propulsion force is biased along the ring's contour, escape becomes more difficult and is primarily driven by thermal noise. Our findings highlight that, despite its intricate configuration, the active ring can be effectively modeled as a self-propelled Brownian particle when studying its escape from a smooth surface.</description>
