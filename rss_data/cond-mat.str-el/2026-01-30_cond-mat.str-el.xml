      <title>Quench spectroscopy of amplitude modes in a one-dimensional critical phase</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.20926</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.20926v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the emergence of an amplitude (Higgs-like) mode in the gapless phase of the $(1+1)$D XXZ spin chain. Unlike conventional settings where amplitude modes arise from spontaneous symmetry breaking, here, we identify a symmetry-preserving underdamped excitation on top of a Luttinger-liquid ground state. Using nonequilibrium quench spectroscopy, we demonstrate that this mode manifests as oscillations of U(1)-symmetric observables following a sudden quench. By combining numerical simulations with Bethe-ansatz analyses, we trace its microscopic origin to specific families of string excitations. We further discuss experimental pathways to detect this mode in easy-plane quantum magnets and programmable quantum simulators. Our results showcase the utility of quantum quenches as a powerful tool to probe collective excitations, beyond the scope of linear response.</description>

      <title>When does a lattice higher-form symmetry flow to a topological higher-form symmetry at low energies?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.20935</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.20935v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the lattice version of higher-form symmetries on tensor-product Hilbert spaces. Interestingly, at low energies, these symmetries may not flow to the topological higher-form symmetries familiar from relativistic quantum field theories, but instead to non-topological higher-form symmetries. We present concrete lattice models exhibiting this phenomenon. One particular model is an $\mathbb{R}$ generalization of the Kitaev honeycomb model featuring an $\mathbb{R}$ lattice 1-form symmetry. We show that its low-energy effective field theory is a gapless, non-relativistic theory with a non-topological $\mathbb{R}$ 1-form symmetry. In both the lattice model and the effective field theory, we demonstrate that the non-topological $\mathbb{R}$ 1-form symmetry is not robust against local perturbations. In contrast, we also study various modifications of the toric code and their low-energy effective field theories to demonstrate that the compact $\mathbb{Z}_2$ lattice 1-form symmetry does become topological at low energies unless the Hamiltonian is fine-tuned. Along the way, we clarify the rules for constructing low-energy effective field theories in the presence of multiple superselection sectors. Finally, we argue on general grounds that non-compact higher-form symmetries (such as $\mathbb{R}$ and $\mathbb{Z}$ 1-form symmetries) in lattice systems generically remain non-topological at low energies, whereas compact higher-form symmetries (such as $\mathbb{Z}_{n}$ and $U(1)$ 1-form symmetries) generically become topological.</description>

      <title>Self-dual Higgs transitions: Toric code and beyond</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.20945</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.20945v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The toric code, when deformed in a way that preserves the self-duality $\mathbb{Z}_2$ symmetry exchanging the electric and magnetic excitations, admits a transition to a topologically trivial state that spontaneously breaks the $\mathbb{Z}_2$ symmetry. Numerically, this transition was found to be continuous, which makes it particularly enigmatic given the longstanding absence of a continuum field-theoretic description. In this work we propose such a continuum field theory for the transition dubbed the $SO(4)_{2,-2}$ Chern-Simons-Higgs (CSH) theory. We show that our field theory provides a natural "mean-field" understanding of the phase diagram. Moreover, it can be generalized to an entire series of theories, namely the $SO(4)_{k,-k}$ CSH theories, labeled by an integer $k$. For each $k&gt;2$, the theory describes an analogous transition involving different non-Abelian topological orders, such as the double Fibonacci order ($k=3$) and the $S_3$ quantum double ($k=4$). For $k=1$, we conjecture that the corresponding CSH transition is in fact infrared-dual to the $3d$ Ising transition, in close analogy with the particle-vortex duality of a complex scalar.</description>

      <title>Spin-orbit-induced Instability and Finite-Temperature Stabilization of a Triangular-lattice Supersolid</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.20963</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.20963v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Geometrically frustrated triangular-lattice magnets provide fertile ground for realizing intriguing quantum phases such as spin supersolids. A common expectation is that spin-orbit coupling (SOC), which breaks continuous spin rotational symmetry, destabilizes these phases by gapping their low-energy modes. Revisiting this assumption, we map out the SOC-field phase diagram of a frustrated triangular-lattice magnet using spin-wave theory and infinite density-matrix renormalization group (iDMRG) simulations. We find that while infinitesimally weak SOC indeed drives a zero-temperature instability of the supersolid by opening a gap, certain supersolid states remain thermodynamically stable at non-zero temperatures. This reveals a previously unrecognized mechanism in which thermal fluctuations counteract SOC to stabilize supersolidity. The resulting finite-temperature supersolids retain key responses, including a giant magnetocaloric effect, highlighting their potential relevance to real materials. At larger SOC, the system transitions into distinct magnetic orders, including a skyrmion lattice, completing a unified phase diagram.</description>

      <title>Competing Ordering Modes in the Distorted Quantum Kagome Material Clinoatacamite Cu$_2$Cl(OH)$_3$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.21024</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.21024v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We have studied the magnetic properties of clinoatacamite Cu$_2$Cl(OH)$_3$, the parent compound of the quantum spin liquid candidate herbertsmithite and a longstanding puzzle among frustrated quantum magnets. As we reveal using density-functional theory, clinoatacamite belongs to the class of distorted kagome antiferromagnets with the kagome plane being embedded into a low-symmetry crystal structure. By means of thermodynamic measurements, muon spin rotation/relaxation as well as neutron diffraction on single crystals, we find a complex sequence of phases/regions below 18.1 K in zero magnetic field. We propose this complexity in multicritical clinoatacamite to arise from the competition of antiferromagnetic ordering modes from the underconstrained manifold of modes, which can lead to a metamagnetic texture in zero magnetic field.</description>

      <title>Ultrafast Decoherence of Charge Density Waves in K$_{0.3}$MoO$_{3}$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.21030</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.21030v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent works have suggested that transient suppression of a charge density wave (CDW) by an ultra-short excitation can lead to an inversion of the CDW phase. We experimentally investigate the dynamics of the CDW in K$_{0.3}$MoO$_{3}$ by time resolved x-ray diffraction after excitation with optical pulses. Our results indicate a transient inversion of the CDW phase close to the surface that evolves into a highly disordered state in less than one picosecond. Numerical simulations solving the Ginzburg-Landau equation including disorder from strong pinning defects reproduce our main observations. Our findings highlight the critical role of disorder in schemes for coherent control in condensed matter systems.</description>

      <title>Classification of non-Fermi liquids and universal superconducting fluctuations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.21047</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.21047v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In quantum critical metals, a plethora of different non-Fermi liquids arises depending on the nature of critical fluctuations coupled to Fermi surfaces. In this paper, we classify non-Fermi liquids that arise from q=0 critical fluctuations and characterize their universal superconducting fluctuations. The essential tool is the projective fixed points, which generalizes the notion of fixed points to fixed trajectories that take into account the incessant running of the Fermi momentum under the renormalization group flow. Based on the topology of bundles of projective fixed points, non-Fermi liquids are first grouped into seven superuniversality classes. Each superuniversality class includes multiple universality classes, which are further classified by the universal pairing interactions and emergent symmetries. Despite the pairing interaction generated by critical fluctuations, some non-Fermi liquids remain stable down to zero temperature due to the incoherence of excitations and the lack of scale invariance caused by Fermi momentum. Depending on the strength and span of the universal pairing interaction in momentum space, the emergent symmetry of non-Fermi liquids may or may not be lower than that of Fermi liquids. In non-Fermi liquids that become superconductors at low temperatures, the universal data of the parent metal determine the lower bound for the superconducting transition temperature and the associated pairing symmetry. In superuniversality classes that contain non-Fermi liquids prone to non-s-wave superconducting instabilities, the critical angular momentum above which pairing instability becomes inevitable is sensitive to the Fermi momentum, and the associated superconducting transition temperature oscillates as a function of the density. We use physical examples, as well as a toy model, to elucidate the universal low-energy physics of all superuniversality classes.</description>

      <title>Influence of Markovianity and self-consistency on time-resolved spectral functions of driven quantum systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.21088</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.21088v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a systematic comparison of the real-time Dyson expansion (RTDE) with established non-equilibrium Green's function approaches for simulating driven, interacting quantum systems. Focusing on density matrix dynamics, time-off-diagonal Green's functions, and time-resolved photoemission spectra, we benchmark RTDE against fully self-consistent Kadanoff-Baym equation (KBE) calculations, the generalized Kadanoff-Baym ansatz (GKBA), and exact diagonalization for small systems using second order many-body perturbation theory. Using a driven two-band Hubbard model, we show that mean-field single particle density matrix trajectories provide a reliable baseline for RTDE across a broad range of interaction strengths and excited-carrier populations. Further, RTDE accurately captures correlation effects in the Green's functions, including long-lived oscillations and revivals that are strongly suppressed by the overdamping inherent to self-consistent KBE schemes. As a consequence, RTDE resolves rich non-equilibrium spectral structure in time-resolved photoemission, such as interaction- and population-dependent quasiparticle splittings and bandgap renormalization, which are largely washed out in self-consistent approaches, yet are present in the exact solutions. Our results demonstrate that RTDE bridges the gap between mean-field propagation and full two-time KBE simulations, retaining favorable linear scaling while capturing essential dynamical correlations relevant for ultrafast spectroscopy.</description>

      <title>Interacting type-II semi-Dirac quasiparticles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.21098</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.21098v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Type-II semi-Dirac fermions in two dimensions have been proposed to describe topologically nontrivial low energy excitations in titanium/vanadium oxide heterostructures. These quasiparticles appear at the merger of three Dirac cones, resulting in a non-zero Berry phase. We find, by employing Hartree-Fock, renormalization group and RPA techniques, that the spectrum is very sensitive to long-range electron-electron interactions and can undergo a profound transformation. Specifically the quasiparticle spectrum evolves, driven by interactions, from anisotropic Dirac dispersion at the lowest energies, towards the characteristic type-II semi-Dirac boomerang shape as the energy increases. The corresponding density of states varies between linear and power one third ($\rho(\varepsilon) \sim |\varepsilon| \rightarrow |\varepsilon|^{1/3}$). The crossover scale is controlled by the interaction strength $\alpha = e^2/(\hbar v)$, and the specifics of the effective interacting Hamiltonian. Our results imply that various physical characteristics exhibit critical behavior with continuously varying 'critical exponents'; for example Landau levels in a magnetic field vary with the energy scale: $|\varepsilon_n(B)|\sim (nB)^{1/2} \rightarrow (nB)^{3/4}, n=0,1,2,...$, and similarly for other observables.</description>

      <title>Non-invertible translation from Lieb-Schultz-Mattis anomaly</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.21625</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.21625v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Symmetry provides powerful non-perturbative constraints in quantum many-body systems. A prominent example is the Lieb-Schultz-Mattis (LSM) anomaly -- a mixed 't Hooft anomaly between internal and translational symmetries that forbids a trivial symmetric gapped phase. In this work, we investigate lattice translation operators in systems with an LSM anomaly. We construct explicit lattice models in two and three spatial dimensions and show that, after gauging the full internal symmetry, translation becomes non-invertible and fuses into defects of the internal symmetry. The result is supported by the anomaly-inflow in view of topological field theory. Our work extends earlier one-dimensional observations to a unified higher-dimensional framework and clarifies their origin in mixed anomalies and higher-group structures, highlighting a coherent interplay between internal and crystalline symmetries.</description>

      <title>Emergent Spatial Textures from Interaction Quenches in the Hubbard Model</title>

      <description>arXiv:2601.22053v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Interaction quenches in strongly correlated electron systems provide a powerful route to probe nonequilibrium many-body dynamics. For the Hubbard model, nonequilibrium dynamical mean-field theory has revealed coherent post-quench oscillations, dynamical crossovers, and long-lived transient regimes. However, these studies are largely restricted to spatially homogeneous dynamics and therefore neglect the role of spatial structure formation during ultrafast evolution. Here we investigate interaction quenches in the half-filled Hubbard model using a real-space time-dependent Gutzwiller framework. We show that homogeneous nonequilibrium dynamics is generically unstable: even arbitrarily weak spatial fluctuations grow dynamically and drive the system toward intrinsically inhomogeneous states. Depending on the interaction strength, the post-quench evolution exhibits spatial differentiation, nucleation, and slow coarsening of Mott-like domains. Our results establish spatial self-organization as a generic feature of far-from-equilibrium correlated matter and reveal a fundamental limitation of spatially homogeneous nonequilibrium theories.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2601.22078v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate a single magnetic impurity in the presence of strong spin-orbit coupling and single-ion anisotropy. We show that at sufficiently strong coupling there exists a finite temperature window, before the moment is completely screened, where the magnetic anisotropy of the system flips: the hard-axis becomes the easy-axis or vice versa. We derive this rigorously for a single impurity using numerical renormalization group calculations as well as Nozieres' strong-coupling limit and discuss its relevance to heavy-fermion compounds which order magnetically along the hard-direction. We show that the coexistence of Curie-like response and Kondo fluctuations is stabilized along the initially hard direction leading to the anisotropy switch.</description>

      <title>Protection of Unconventional Superconductivity from Disorder</title>

      <description>arXiv:2601.20937v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Unconventional superconductivity is a desirable state of matter due to its potential for high transition temperatures $T_{\mathrm{c}}$ and associated favorable superconducting properties. However, the sign-changing nature of the order parameter of unconventional superconductors renders their condensates fragile to disorder, an inevitability in real materials. We uncover the generic properties of electronic band structures and associated Bloch weights able to support robust unconventional superconductivity. We demonstrate this property in several case studies of the kagome and Lieb lattices, showing how unconventional superconductors exhibit unusually weak $T_{\mathrm{c}}$ suppression by disorder, despite featuring fully compensated sign-changing order parameters. We contrast these results with those for unconventional superconductivity on the square and honeycomb lattices, which are unable to protect the condensates from disorder. Finally, we discuss material candidates for which this effect may be realized.</description>

      <title>Non-Equilibrium Phase Transition in a Boundary-Driven Dissipative Fermionic Chain</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.20938</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.20938v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We demonstrate that a boundary-localized periodic (Floquet) drive can induce nontrivial long-range correlations in a non-interacting fermionic chain which is additionally subject to boundary dissipation. Surprisingly, we find that this phenomenon occurs even when the corresponding isolated bulk is in a trivial gapped phase with exponentially decaying correlations. We argue that this boundary-drive induced non-equilibrium transition (as witnessed through the correlation matrix) is driven by a resonance mechanism whereby the drive frequency bridges bulk energy gaps, allowing boundary-injected particles and holes to propagate and mediate long-range correlations into the bulk. We also numerically establish that when the drive bridges a particle-hole gap, the induced long-range order scales as a power law with the bulk pairing potential ($\chi \sim \gamma^2$). Our results highlight the potential of localized coherent driving for generating macroscopic order in open quantum systems.</description>

      <title>Universal Topological Gates from Braiding and Fusing Anyons on Quantum Hardware</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.20956</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.20956v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Topological quantum computation encodes quantum information in the internal fusion space of non-Abelian anyonic quasiparticles, whose braiding implements logical gates. This goes beyond Abelian topological order (TO) such as the toric code, as its anyons lack internal structure. However, the simplest non-Abelian generalizations of the toric code do not support universality via braiding alone. Here we demonstrate that such minimally non-Abelian TOs can be made universal by treating anyon fusion as a computational primitive. We prepare a 54-qubit TO wavefunction associated with the smallest non-Abelian group, $S_3$, on Quantinuum's H2 quantum processor. This phase of matter exhibits cyclic anyon fusion rules, known to underpin universality, which we evidence by trapping a single non-Abelian anyon on the torus. We encode logical qutrits in the nonlocal fusion space of non-Abelian fluxes and, by combining an entangling braiding operation with anyon charge measurements, realize a universal topological gate set and read-out, which we further demonstrate by topologically preparing a magic state. This work establishes $S_3$ TO as simple enough to be prepared efficiently, yet rich enough to enable universal topological quantum computation.</description>

      <title>Continuum mechanics of entanglement in noisy interacting fermion chains</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.21134</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.21134v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We develop an effective continuum description for information scrambling in a chain of randomly interacting Majorana fermions. The approach is based on the semiclassical treatment of the path integral for an effective spin chain that describes "two-replica" observables such as the entanglement purity and the OTOC. This formalism gives exact results for the entanglement membrane and for operator spreading in the limit of weak interactions. In this limit there is a large crossover lengthscale between free and interacting behavior, and this large lengthscale allows for a continuum limit and a controlled saddle-point calculation. The formalism is also somewhat different from that known from random unitary circuits. The entanglement membrane emerges as a kind of bound state of two travelling waves, and shows an interesting unbinding phenomenon as the velocity of the entanglement membrane approaches the butterfly velocity.</description>

      <title>Efficient high-harmonic generation in van der Waals ferroelectric NbOI$_2$ crystals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.21273</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.21273v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Layered NbOX$_2$ ($X=\mathrm{Cl,\,Br,\,I}$), a member of the van der Waals ferroelectric family, exhibits intrinsic ferroelectricity and pronounced nonlinear optical responses, making it a promising candidate for integrated nanophotonics applications. While previous studies have emphasized the material's strong second-order nonlinear responses, higher-order nonlinear responses are still mostly unexplored. This work systematically investigates NbOI$_2$ using high harmonic generation (HHG) spectroscopy. Driven by an intense mid-infrared laser field centered at $\sim4~\mu\mathrm{m}$ wavelength, highly anisotropic odd- and even-order harmonics up to the 16th order are generated at a low peak intensity of $0.4~\mathrm{TW\,cm^{-2}}$, extending beyond the material's bandgap. Both bulk and flake forms of NbOI$_2$ display pronounced harmonic emission from the near-infrared to the deep-ultraviolet spectral region, with a notably high overall conversion efficiency compared to other known materials. Polarization-resolved measurements reveal that even-order harmonics remain aligned with the crystal polar axis regardless of the driving-field orientation, whereas odd-order harmonics are dynamically affected. First-principles calculations suggest that the flat valence band associated with Peierls dimerization enhances HHG efficiency through electron correlation. These findings provide fresh perspectives on HHG in van der Waals ferroelectric materials and facilitate the development of compact and tunable quantum light sources.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2601.21328v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The S=2 Heisenberg antiferromagnet on the orthogonal dimer lattice is studied. The edges of the exact dimer and Neel-ordered phases in the ground state of the system are examined by the numerical diagonalization method. Our present results are discussed by combining them with previously obtained estimates for smaller-S cases. We find that an intermediate region between the exact dimer and Neel-ordered phases gradually widens as spin S is increased up to S=2.</description>

      <title>Finite-size corrections to the crosscap overlap in the two-dimensional Ising model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.21502</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.21502v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We analyze the finite-size corrections to the crosscap overlap in the two-dimensional classical Ising model along its self-dual critical line. Using a fermionic formulation, we express the lattice crosscap overlap in terms of Bogoliubov angles and develop a contour-integral approach by analytically continuing the lattice momentum to the complex plane. This leads to a remarkably simple expression for the crosscap overlap, which demonstrates that the finite-size corrections decay exponentially with system size. We further derive an exact analytical formula for the corresponding decay constant and show that it is determined by the complex singularity structure of the Bogoliubov angle.</description>

      <title>Holographic Entanglement Propagation Through Wormholes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.21604</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.21604v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study how energy and quantum entanglement are transferred when two identical CFTs are entangled locally. This is probed by considering a local operator insertion in one of the CFTs. When the CFTs have holographic duals via the AdS/CFT correspondence, the transfer happens through an AdS wormhole that allows signal propagation even beyond the horizon from one AdS boundary to the other; we demonstrate this in explicit CFT calculations. We argue that this transmission is possible because the insertion of a local operator is not a unitary process but a regularized version of projection measurement, and that this is interpreted as quantum teleportation. We also find that this leads to a phenomenon opposite to scrambling, where mutual information, instead of being suppressed, gets enhanced by the insertion of a local operator excitation.</description>

      <title>Impurity screening by defects in (1+1)$d$ quantum critical systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.09519</link>
      <description>arXiv:2307.09519v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We propose a novel mechanism of impurity screening in (1+1)$d$ quantum critical states described by conformal field theories (CFTs). An impurity can be screened if it has the same quantum numbers as some gapless degrees of freedom of the CFT. The common source of these degrees of freedom is the chiral primary fields of the CFT, but we uncover that topological defect lines of the CFT may also take this role. Theoretical analysis relies on the insight that the impurities can be interpreted as edge modes of certain symmetry-protected topological (SPT) states. By stacking a SPT state with a CFT, one or two interfaces on which the SPT edge modes reside are created. If screening occurs due to topological defect lines, a symmetry-enriched CFT with exotic boundary states are obtained. The boundary conditions that appear in these cases are difficult to achieve using previously known methods. As a concrete example, we consider a spin-1 chain whose bulk is described by the SU(3)$_{1}$ CFT and edges are coupled to spin-1/2 impurities. We demonstrate that both the low-energy eigenstates and the extracted Affleck-Ludwig entropy are in excellent agreement with our theoretical predictions.</description>

      <title>Non-Abelian fractional quantum Hall states at filling factor 3/4</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.16275v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Fractional quantum Hall states have been observed at filling factor $\nu=3/4$ in GaAs hole system and bilayer graphene. In theoretical bootstrap analysis, it was revealed that non-Abelian topological orders with Ising anyons can be realized at $\nu=3/4$, which exhibit $12$ fold ground state degeneracy on the torus. The properties of $\nu=3/4$ states can be analyzed using two complementary approaches. In the first one, they are treated as particle-hole conjugate of $\nu=1/4$ Moore-Read types states. In the second one, they are mapped to composite fermions with reverse flux attachment at effective filling factor $3/2$, whose integral part realizes an integer quantum Hall state and the fractional part realizes $\nu=1/2$ Moore-Read type states. For bilayer graphene with appropriate Landau level mixing, numerical calculations found $12$ quasi-degenerate ground states on the torus at $\nu=3/4$. Chiral graviton spectral functions of these states have one low energy peak with negative chirality and one high energy peak with positive chirality. This points to a specific member of the Moore-Read type states and agrees with the deduction based on daughter states.</description>

      <title>Real-Space Switching of Local Moments Driven by Quantum Geometry in Correlated Graphene Heterostructures</title>

Abstract: Graphene-based multilayer systems serve as versatile platforms for exploring the interplay between electron correlation and topology, thanks to distinctive low-energy bands marked by significant quantum metric and Berry curvature from graphene's Dirac bands. Here, we investigate Mott physics and local spin moments in Dirac bands hybridized with a flat band of localized orbitals in functionalized graphene. Via hybridization control, a topological transition is realized between two symmetry-distinct site-selective Mott states featuring local moments in different Wyckoff positions, with a geometrically enforced metallic state emerging in between. We find that this geometrically controlled real-space switching of local moments and associated metal-insulator physics may be realized through proximity coupling of epitaxial graphene on SiC(0001) with group IV intercalants, where the Mott state faces geometrical obstruction in the large-hybridization limit. Our work shows that chemically functionalized graphene provides a correlated electron platform, very similar to the topological heavy fermions in graphene moir\'e systems but at significantly enhanced characteristic energy scales.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.08204v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The interplay between lattice distortions, magnetism, and spin-orbit coupling in 5d transition-metal halides offers a fertile platform for exploring correlated spin-lattice dynamics. Here, we investigate the impact of structural symmetry breaking on lattice vibrations and local spin environments in the antifluorite compound K2IrBr6 using temperature dependent Raman spectroscopy, electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR), and first-principles lattice dynamics calculations. K2IrBr6 undergoes successive cubic-to-tetragonal and tetragonal-to-monoclinic phase transitions at 170 K and 122 K, respectively, driven by cooperative distortions of the IrBr6 octahedra. Raman spectroscopy reveals anomalous phonon linewidth broadening and unconventional temperature dependence of phonon energies near these transitions, indicating that dynamic spin-phonon coupling is significant well above the Neel temperature (16 K). First-principles phonon calculations support the mode assignments and demonstrate that symmetry-lowering distortions significantly renormalize vibrational modes, consistent with the experimental observations. Complementary EPR measurements detect anisotropic g-factors, resonance field shifts, and linewidth narrowing across the structural transitions, reflecting the emergence of static spin-lattice correlations mediated by spin-orbit entanglement. These findings establish K2IrBr6 as a model system where halide ligand fields, octahedral distortions, and SOC collaboratively govern spin-lattice coupling, providing chemical pathways to engineer quantum materials with tunable magnetic and lattice responses.</description>

      <title>Interacting-cluster spin liquids with robust flat bands evolving into higher-rank half-moon phases and topological Lifshitz transitions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.18845v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Classical spin liquids are disordered magnetic phases, governed by local constraints that often give rise to flat-band ground states. When constraints take the form of a zero-divergence field within a cluster of spins, the spin liquid is often described by an emergent Coulomb gauge theory. Here we introduce an interaction $\eta$ between these clusters of spins which compete with the zero-divergence field. Using a framework embracing both the connectivity matrices of graph theory and the topology of band structures, we develop a generic theory of interacting-cluster Hamiltonians. We show how flat bands remain at zero energy up to finite interaction $\eta$, until a dispersive band becomes negative, stabilizing a spiral spin liquid with a hypersurface of ground-state manifold in reciprocal space. This hypersurface can be interpreted as an effective Fermi surface in the spectrum of the parent system, acting as a tunable energy selector despite the absence of particle filling. This effective Fermi surface serves as a mold for the apparition of the half-moon patterns in the equal-time structure factor. Our generic approach enables to extend the notion of half moons to the perturbation of higher-rank Coulomb fields and pinch-line spin liquids. In particular, multi-fold half moons appear when unconventional gauge charges, such as potential fractons, are stabilized in the ground state. Finally, half-moon phases can be tuned across the equivalent of a Lifshitz transition, when the hypersurface manifold changes topology.</description>

Abstract: In this paper, we develop a novel theory that generalizes the concept of anyon statistics to Abelian topological excitations of any dimension. We axiomatize excitations as a selected collection of states and operators satisfying the configuration axiom and the locality axiom, purely based on many-body quantum mechanics. Upon these axioms, we define a rigorous and self-contained theory of statistics using only basic algebra and can be implemented on a computer. While our theory is developed independently, the results align with existing physical theories.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.08242v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We introduce a geometrical framework to construct a large class of time-dependent quantum systems, in which the position of a classical particle moving autonomously on a smooth connected manifold is used to steer a quantum Hamiltonian over time. This results in quantum drives with structured temporal profiles and properties dependent on the local and global nature of the underlying choice of manifold. We show that our construction recovers the well-known classes of periodically-driven and quasiperiodically-driven quantum systems, but also unveils fundamentally new classes of quantum dynamics: by utilizing a compact 2d hyperbolic Bolza surface and a nonorientable Klein-bottle surface, we demonstrate examples of a hyperbolically-driven quantum system and a nonorientably-driven quantum system respectively. Furthermore, we demonstrate that these driven systems exhibit unusual quantized dynamical responses reflecting their different underlying topologies, under the condition of being fully gapped and in the adiabatic limit, and which have interpretations as quantized crystalline electromagnetic responses in certain exotic effective tight-binding lattice models. We envision geometric quantum driving as a general framework to chart the landscape of time-dependent quantum systems and investigate the universal phase structures they exhibit, as well as a useful tool to enhance the capabilities of modern day quantum simulators.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2505.15891v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: It is well known that disorder can induce low-energy Andreev bound states in a sign-changing, but fully gapped, superconductor at $\pi-$junctions. Generically, these excitations are localized. Starting from a superconductor with a sign-changing and nodeless order parameter in the clean limit, here we demonstrate a mechanism for increasing the localization length associated with the low-energy Andreev bound states at a fixed disorder strength. We find that the Fubini-Study metric associated with the electronic Bloch wavefunctions controls the localization length and the hybridization between bound states localized at distinct $\pi-$junctions. We present results for the inverse participation ratio, superfluid stiffness, site-resolved and disorder-averaged spectral functions as a function of increasing Fubini-Study metric, which indicate an increased tendency towards delocalization. The low-energy properties resemble those of a dirty nodal superconductor with gapless Bogoliubov excitations. We place these results in the context of recent experiments in moire graphene superconductors.</description>

Abstract: Multicomponent Heusler alloys exhibit various magnetic properties arising from their diverse atomic compositions and crystal structures. Identifying the general physical principles that govern these behaviors is essential for advancing their potential in spintronic applications. In this work, we combine density functional theory with atomistic Monte Carlo simulations to investigate the magnetic ground states, finite-temperature magnetic transitions, and electronic structures of fully-ordered $L2_1$-, $XA$-type, and partially-ordered V$_2X$Al ($X=$ Cr, Mn, Fe, Co, Ni) Heusler alloys. We propose the concept of magnetic motifs, defined as V-$X$-V triangular pathway connected by the nearest-neighbor (NN) exchange interactions $J_{\mathrm{V-}X}$. Within this framework, the magnetic ground states and transition temperatures across the V$_2X$Al family can be consistently understood. The magnetic order is primarily governed by the NN $J_{\mathrm{V-}X}$ interactions in the triangular motifs, while the transition temperatures are additionally influenced by $J_{X-X}$ couplings. Furthermore, the magnetic motifs are still proven to be effective in our calculations on partially-ordered V$_2$$X$Al alloys from $L2_1$ to $XA$-type structures. Our results suggest that the concept of magnetic motifs provides a unifying principle for understanding magnetic ordering in V-based Heusler alloys and could serve as a candidate guide for exploring magnetism and designing advanced spintronic materials in a broader class of Heusler systems.</description>

      <title>Anyonic membranes and Pontryagin statistics</title>

Abstract: Anyons, unique to two spatial dimensions, underlie extraordinary phenomena such as the fractional quantum Hall effect, but their generalization to higher dimensions has remained elusive. The topology of Eilenberg-MacLane spaces constrains the loop statistics to be only bosonic or fermionic in any dimension. In this work, we introduce the novel anyonic statistics for membrane excitations in four dimensions. Analogous to the $\mathbb{Z}_N$-particle exhibiting $\mathbb{Z}_{N\times \gcd(2,N)}$ anyonic statistics in two dimensions, we show that the $\mathbb{Z}_N$-membrane possesses $\mathbb{Z}_{N\times \gcd(3,N)}$ anyonic statistics in four dimensions. Given unitary volume operators that create membrane excitations on the boundary, we propose an explicit 56-step unitary sequence that detects the membrane statistics. We further analyze the boundary theory of $(5{+}1)$D 1-form $\mathbb{Z}_N$ symmetry-protected topological phases and demonstrate that their domain walls realize all possible anyonic membrane statistics. We then show that the $\mathbb{Z}_3$ subgroup persists in all higher dimensions. In addition to the standard fermionic $\mathbb{Z}_2$ membrane statistics arising from Stiefel-Whitney classes, membranes also exhibit $\mathbb{Z}_3$ statistics associated with Pontryagin classes. We explicitly verify that the 56-step process detects the nontrivial $\mathbb{Z}_3$ statistics in 5, 6, and 7 spatial dimensions. Moreover, in 7 and higher dimensions, the statistics of membrane excitations stabilize to $\mathbb{Z}_{2} \times \mathbb{Z}_{3}$, with the $\mathbb{Z}_3$ sector consistently captured by this process.</description>

      <title>Quantum Hall correlations in tilted extended Bose-Hubbard chains</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.27685</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.27685v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We demonstrate characteristics of a bosonic fractional quantum Hall (FQH) state in a one-dimensional extended Bose-Hubbard model (eBHM) with a static tilt. In the large tilt limit, quenched kinetic energy leads to emergent dipole moment conservation, enabling mapping to a model generating FQH states. Using exact diagonalization, density matrix renormalization group, and an analytical transfer matrix approach, we analyze energy and entanglement properties to reveal FQH correlations. Our findings set the stage for the use of quenched kinetics in simple time-reversal invariant eBHMs to explore emergent phenomena.</description>

      <title>Noncommuting zero-noise and zero-frequency limits in particle-hole symmetric fluids</title>

Abstract: In charged fluids obeying particle-hole symmetry, such as the Dirac fluid in graphene, charge transport is diffusive despite the presence of ballistically propagating sound waves: sound waves "hydrodynamically decouple" from the slower charge fluctuations. For quasi-one-dimensional fluids, we show that this symmetry-protected charge diffusion is not smoothly connected to the normal diffusion that arises when momentum conservation is broken by noise (or static impurities). Instead, the charge diffusion constant is a discontinuous function of noise, which (in the weak-noise limit) depends only on the ratio of momentum and energy relaxation rates. In the special limit of momentum-conserving noise (e.g., spatially uniform fluctuations of the Hamiltonian), the diffusion constant diverges in the presence of noise. We describe the resulting superdiffusion in terms of coupled Burgers equations. We present a general mechanism--hydrodynamic recoupling--by which weak noise can induce singular changes in transport coefficients. Our results highlight the limits of zero-noise extrapolation for predicting dynamical quantities like diffusion constants.</description>

      <title>General-order degenerate coupled-cluster theory</title>

Abstract: A size-extensive, converging, black-box, ab initio coupled-cluster ($\Delta$CC) ansatz is introduced that computes the energies and wave functions of stationary states from any degenerate or nondegenerate Slater-determinant references with any numbers of $\alpha$- and $\beta$-spin electrons, and any patterns of orbital occupancy. For a nondegenerate reference, it is identical to the single-reference coupled-cluster ansatz. For a degenerate multireference, it is a natural coupled-cluster extension of degenerate perturbation ($\Delta$MP) theory. For ionized and electron-attached references, it can be viewed as a coupled-cluster Green's function, although the present theory is convergent toward the full-configuration-interaction (FCI) limits, while many-body Green's function (MBGF) theory generally is not. Its single-excitation instance is a projection Hartree-Fock theory for a degenerate or nondegenerate reference as per the Thouless theorem, which may be useful for core ionizations, high-spin states, and possibly electron affinities. A new, size-extensive, converging, general-model-space state-universal multireference coupled-cluster (SUMRCC) theory is also proposed, to which $\Delta$CC theory is directly related. Determinant-based, general-order algorithms of $\Delta$CC and SUMRCC theories are implemented, which are compared with configuration-interaction (CI) and equation-of-motion coupled-cluster (EOM-CC) theories through octuple excitations and with $\Delta$MP and MBGF theories up to the 19th order. An algebraic, optimal-scaling, order-by-order algorithm of $\Delta$CC theory is also computer-synthesized at the levels of single excitation ($\Delta$CCS) and of single and double excitations ($\Delta$CCSD). The order of performance is: SUMRCC $\approx$ $\Delta$CC $&gt;$ EOM-CC $&gt;$ CI at the same order or SUMRCC $\approx$ $\Delta$CC $&gt;$ $\Delta$MP $&gt;$ MBGF at the same cost scaling.</description>
