      <title>Exchangeability and randomness for infinite and finite sequences</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.22162</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.22162v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Randomness (in the sense of being generated in an IID fashion) and exchangeability are standard assumptions in nonparametric statistics and machine learning, and relations between them have been a popular topic of research. This note draws the reader's attention to the fact that, while for infinite sequences of observations the two assumptions are almost indistinguishable, the difference between them becomes very significant for finite sequences of a given length.</description>

      <title>Active Nonparametric Two-Sample Testing by Betting on Heterogeneous Data Sources</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.22403</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.22403v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the problem of active nonparametric sequential two-sample testing over multiple heterogeneous data sources. In each time slot, a decision-maker adaptively selects one of $K$ data sources and receives a paired sample generated from that source for testing. The goal is to decide as quickly as possible whether the pairs are generated from the same distribution or not. The gain achieved by such adaptive sampling (in terms of smaller expected stopping time or larger error exponents) has been well-characterized for parametric models via Chernoff's adaptive MLE selection rule [1]. However, analogous results are not known for the case of nonparametric problems, such as two-sample testing, where we place no restrictions on the distributions.
  Our main contribution is a general active nonparametric testing procedure that combines an adaptive source-selecting strategy within the testing-by-betting framework of [2] that works under minimal distributional assumptions. In each time slot, our scheme proceeds by selecting a source according to a probability that mixes exploitation, favoring sources with the largest empirical distinguishability, and exploration via a vanishing greedy strategy. The (paired) observations so collected are then used to update the "betting-wealth process", which is a stochastic process guaranteed to be a nonnegative martingale under the null. The procedure stops and rejects the null when the wealth process exceeds an appropriate threshold; an event that is unlikely under the null. We show that our test controls the type-I error at a prespecified level-$\alpha$ under the null, and establish its power-one property and a bound on its expected sample size under the alternative. Our results provide a precise characterization of the improvements achievable by a principled adaptive sampling strategy over its passive analog.</description>

      <title>Sharp Non-Asymptotic Bounds for the Star Discrepancy of Double-Infinite Random Matrices via Optimal Covering Numbers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.22557</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.22557v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We establish sharp non-asymptotic probabilistic bounds for the star discrepancy of double-infinite random matrices -- a canonical model for sequences of random point sets in high dimensions. By integrating the recently proved \textbf{optimal covering numbers for axis-parallel boxes} (Gnewuch, 2024) into the dyadic chaining framework, we achieve \textbf{explicitly computable constants} that improve upon all previously known bounds.
  For dimension $d \ge 3$, we prove that with high probability, \[ D_N^d \le \sqrt{\alpha A_d + \beta B \frac{\ln \log_2 N}{d}} \sqrt{\frac{d}{N}}, \] where $A_d$ is given by an explicit series and satisfies $A_3 \le 745$, a \textbf{14\% improvement} over the previous best constant of 868 (Fiedler et al., 2023). For $d=2$, we obtain the currently smallest known constant $A_2 \le 915$.
  Our analysis reveals a \textbf{precise trade-off} between the dimensional dependence and the logarithmic factor in $N$, highlighting how optimal covering estimates directly translate to tighter discrepancy bounds. These results immediately yield improved error guarantees for \textbf{quasi-Monte Carlo integration, uncertainty quantification, and high-dimensional sampling}, and provide a new benchmark for the probabilistic analysis of geometric discrepancy.
  \textbf{Keywords:} Star discrepancy, double-infinite random matrices, covering numbers, dyadic chaining, high-dimensional integration, quasi-Monte Carlo, probabilistic bounds.</description>

      <title>Polynomial-Time Near-Optimal Estimation over Certain Type-2 Convex Bodies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.22714</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.22714v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We develop polynomial-time algorithms for near-optimal minimax mean estimation under $\ell_2$-squared loss in a Gaussian sequence model under convex constraints. The parameter space is an origin-symmetric, type-2 convex body $K \subset \mathbb{R}^n$, and we assume additional regularity conditions: specifically, we assume $K$ is well-balanced, i.e., there exist known radii $r, R &gt; 0$ such that $r B_2 \subseteq K \subseteq R B_2$, as well as oracle access to the Minkowski gauge of $K$. Under these and some further assumptions on $K$, our procedures achieve the minimax rate up to small factors, depending poly-logarithmically on the dimension, while remaining computationally efficient.
  We further extend our methodology to the linear regression and robust heavy-tailed settings, establishing polynomial-time near-optimal estimators when the constraint set satisfies the regularity conditions above. To the best of our knowledge, these results provide the first general framework for attaining statistically near-optimal performance under such broad geometric constraints while preserving computational tractability.</description>

      <title>A Recursive Exponential-Gamma Mixture: a New Generalized of the Lindley Distribution</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.22866</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.22866v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Lindley distribution was first introduced by Lindley in 1958 for Bayesian computations. Over the past years, various generalizations of this distribution have been proposed by different authors. The generalized Lindley distributions sometimes have many parameters, and although they show good flexibility, their statistical form becomes complicated. In this article, we propose a new and simple distribution determined by the recursive relation of the Lindley distribution and the Gamma distribution with specific weights. Subsequently, some statistical properties of this distribution are examined, and with real numerical examples, its superiority over the Lindley generalizations is demonstrated.</description>

      <title>Bayesian Effective Dimension: A Mutual Information Perspective</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.23047</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.23047v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: High-dimensional Bayesian procedures often exhibit behavior that is effectively low dimensional, even when the ambient parameter space is large or infinite-dimensional. This phenomenon underlies the success of shrinkage priors, regularization, and approximate Bayesian methods, yet it is typically described only informally through notions such as sparsity, intrinsic dimension, or degrees of freedom. In this paper we introduce the \emph{Bayesian effective dimension}, a model- and prior-dependent quantity defined through the mutual information between parameters and data. This notion quantifies the expected information gain from prior to posterior and provides a coordinate-free measure of how many directions in parameter space are statistically learnable at a given sample size. In regular parametric models the effective dimension coincides with the usual parameter dimension, while in high-dimensional, ill-posed, or strongly regularized settings it can be substantially smaller. We develop basic properties of the effective dimension and present explicit calculations for Gaussian location models and linear models with general design, revealing close connections with spectral complexity and effective rank. These examples illustrate how shrinkage and regularization mechanisms directly control the growth of effective dimension. The framework offers a unifying perspective on dimension reduction in Bayesian inference and provides insight into uncertainty quantification and the behavior of approximate posterior distributions.</description>

      <title>Robustness of OLS to sample removals: Theoretical analysis and implications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.23069</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.23069v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: For learned models to be trustworthy, it is essential to verify their robustness to perturbations in the training data. Classical approaches involve uncertainty quantification via confidence intervals and bootstrap methods. In contrast, recent work proposes a more stringent form of robustness: stability to the removal of any subset of $k$ samples from the training set. In this paper, we present a theoretical study of this criterion for ordinary least squares (OLS). Our contributions are as follows: (1) Given $n$ i.i.d. training samples from a general misspecified model, we prove that with high probability, OLS is robust to the removal of any $k \ll n $ samples. (2) For data of dimension $p$, OLS can withstand up to ${k\ll \sqrt{np}/\log n}$ sample removals while remaining robust and achieving the same error rate as OLS applied to the full dataset. Conversely, if $k$ is proportional to $n$, OLS is provably non-robust. (3) We revisit prior analyses that found several econometric datasets to be highly non-robust to sample removals. While this appears to contradict our results in (1), we demonstrate that the sensitivity is due to either heavy-tailed responses or correlated samples. Empirically, this sensitivity is considerably attenuated by classical robust methods, such as linear regression with a Huber loss.</description>

      <title>Conformal Prediction = Bayes?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.23308</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.23308v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Conformal prediction (CP) is widely presented as distribution-free predictive inference with finite-sample marginal coverage under exchangeability. We argue that CP is best understood as a rank-calibrated descendant of the Fisher-Dempster-Hill fiducial/direct-probability tradition rather than as Bayesian conditioning in disguise.
  We establish four separations from coherent countably additive predictive semantics. First, canonical conformal constructions violate conditional extensionality: prediction sets can depend on the marginal design P(X) even when P(Y|X) is fixed. Second, any finitely additive sequential extension preserving rank calibration is nonconglomerable, implying countable Dutch-book vulnerabilities. Third, rank-calibrated updates cannot be realized as regular conditionals of any countably additive exchangeable law on Y^infty. Fourth, formalizing both paradigms as families of one-step predictive kernels, conformal and Bayesian kernels coincide only on a Baire-meagre subset of the space of predictive laws.
  We further show that rank- and proxy-based reductions are generically Blackwell-deficient relative to full-data experiments, yielding positive Le Cam deficiency for suitable losses. Extending the analysis to prediction-powered inference (PPI) yields an analogous message: bias-corrected, proxy-rectified estimators can be valid as confidence devices while failing to define transportable belief states across stages, shifts, or adaptive selection. Together, the results sharpen a general limitation of wrappers: finite-sample calibration guarantees do not by themselves supply composable semantics for sequential updating or downstream decision-making.</description>

      <title>A general framework for deep learning</title>

      <description>arXiv:2512.23425v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper develops a general approach for deep learning for a setting that includes nonparametric regression and classification. We perform a framework from data that fulfills a generalized Bernstein-type inequality, including independent, $\phi$-mixing, strongly mixing and $\mathcal{C}$-mixing observations. Two estimators are proposed: a non-penalized deep neural network estimator (NPDNN) and a sparse-penalized deep neural network estimator (SPDNN). For each of these estimators, bounds of the expected excess risk on the class of H\"older smooth functions and composition H\"older functions are established. Applications to independent data, as well as to $\phi$-mixing, strongly mixing, $\mathcal{C}$-mixing processes are considered. For each of these examples, the upper bounds of the expected excess risk of the proposed NPDNN and SPDNN predictors are derived. It is shown that both the NPDNN and SPDNN estimators are minimax optimal (up to a logarithmic factor) in many classical settings.</description>

      <title>A review of NMF, PLSA, LBA, EMA, and LCA with a focus on the identifiability issue</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.22282</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.22282v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Across fields such as machine learning, social science, geography, considerable attention has been given to models that factorize a nonnegative matrix into the product of two or three matrices, subject to nonnegative or row-sum-to-1 constraints. Although these models are to a large extend similar or even equivalent, they are presented under different names, and their similarity is not well known. This paper highlights similarities among five popular models, latent budget analysis (LBA), latent class analysis (LCA), end-member analysis (EMA), probabilistic latent semantic analysis (PLSA), and nonnegative matrix factorization (NMF). We focus on an essential issue-identifiability-of these models and prove that the solution of LBA, EMA, LCA, PLSA is unique if and only if the solution of NMF is unique. We also provide a brief review for algorithms of these models. We illustrate the models with a time budget dataset from social science, and end the paper with a discussion of closely related models such as archetypal analysis.</description>

      <title>Likelihood-Preserving Embeddings for Statistical Inference</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.22638</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.22638v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Modern machine learning embeddings provide powerful compression of high-dimensional data, yet they typically destroy the geometric structure required for classical likelihood-based statistical inference. This paper develops a rigorous theory of likelihood-preserving embeddings: learned representations that can replace raw data in likelihood-based workflows -- hypothesis testing, confidence interval construction, model selection -- without altering inferential conclusions. We introduce the Likelihood-Ratio Distortion metric $\Delta_n$, which measures the maximum error in log-likelihood ratios induced by an embedding. Our main theoretical contribution is the Hinge Theorem, which establishes that controlling $\Delta_n$ is necessary and sufficient for preserving inference. Specifically, if the distortion satisfies $\Delta_n = o_p(1)$, then (i) all likelihood-ratio based tests and Bayes factors are asymptotically preserved, and (ii) surrogate maximum likelihood estimators are asymptotically equivalent to full-data MLEs. We prove an impossibility result showing that universal likelihood preservation requires essentially invertible embeddings, motivating the need for model-class-specific guarantees. We then provide a constructive framework using neural networks as approximate sufficient statistics, deriving explicit bounds connecting training loss to inferential guarantees. Experiments on Gaussian and Cauchy distributions validate the sharp phase transition predicted by exponential family theory, and applications to distributed clinical inference demonstrate practical utility.</description>

      <title>An Improved Lower Bound on Cardinality of Support of the Amplitude-Constrained AWGN Channel</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.22691</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.22691v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the amplitude-constrained additive white Gaussian noise channel. It is well known that the capacity-achieving input distribution for this channel is discrete and supported on finitely many points. The best known bounds show that the support size of the capacity-achieving distribution is lower-bounded by a term of order $A$ and upper-bounded by a term of order $A^2$, where $A$ denotes the amplitude constraint. It was conjectured in [1] that the linear scaling is optimal. In this work, we establish a new lower bound of order $A\sqrt{\log A}$, improving the known bound and ruling out the conjectured linear scaling.
  To obtain this result, we quantify the fact that the capacity-achieving output distribution is close to the uniform distribution in the interior of the amplitude constraint. Next, we introduce a wrapping operation that maps the problem to a compact domain and develop a theory of best approximation of the uniform distribution by finite Gaussian mixtures. These approximation bounds are then combined with stability properties of capacity-achieving distributions to yield the final support-size lower bound.</description>

      <title>Canonical correlation regression with noisy data</title>

      <description>arXiv:2512.22697v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study instrumental variable regression in data rich environments. The goal is to estimate a linear model from many noisy covariates and many noisy instruments. Our key assumption is that true covariates and true instruments are repetitive, though possibly different in nature; they each reflect a few underlying factors, however those underlying factors may be misaligned. We analyze a family of estimators based on two stage least squares with spectral regularization: canonical correlations between covariates and instruments are learned in the first stage, which are used as regressors in the second stage. As a theoretical contribution, we derive upper and lower bounds on estimation error, proving optimality of the method with noisy data. As a practical contribution, we provide guidance on which types of spectral regularization to use in different regimes.</description>

Abstract: Community detection is the problem of identifying dense communities in networks. Motivated by transitive behavior in social networks ("thy friend is my friend"), an emerging line of work considers spatially-embedded networks, which inherently produce graphs containing many triangles. In this paper, we consider the problem of exact label recovery in the Geometric Stochastic Block Model (GSBM), a model proposed by Baccelli and Sankararaman as the spatially-embedded analogue of the well-studied Stochastic Block Model. Under mild technical assumptions, we completely characterize the information-theoretic threshold for exact recovery, generalizing the earlier work of Gaudio, Niu, and Wei.</description>

      <title>Causal-Policy Forest for End-to-End Policy Learning</title>

      <description>arXiv:2512.22846v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This study proposes an end-to-end algorithm for policy learning in causal inference. We observe data consisting of covariates, treatment assignments, and outcomes, where only the outcome corresponding to the assigned treatment is observed. The goal of policy learning is to train a policy from the observed data, where a policy is a function that recommends an optimal treatment for each individual, to maximize the policy value. In this study, we first show that maximizing the policy value is equivalent to minimizing the mean squared error for the conditional average treatment effect (CATE) under $\{-1, 1\}$ restricted regression models. Based on this finding, we modify the causal forest, an end-to-end CATE estimation algorithm, for policy learning. We refer to our algorithm as the causal-policy forest. Our algorithm has three advantages. First, it is a simple modification of an existing, widely used CATE estimation method, therefore, it helps bridge the gap between policy learning and CATE estimation in practice. Second, while existing studies typically estimate nuisance parameters for policy learning as a separate task, our algorithm trains the policy in a more end-to-end manner. Third, as in standard decision trees and random forests, we train the models efficiently, avoiding computational intractability.</description>

      <title>Nonparametric Identification of Demand without Exogenous Product Characteristics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.23211</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.23211v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the identification of differentiated product demand with exogenous supply-side instruments, allowing product characteristics to be endogenous. Past analyses have argued that exogenous characteristic-based instruments are essentially necessary given a sufficiently flexible demand model with a suitable index restriction. We show, however, that price counterfactuals are nonparametrically identified by recentered instruments -- which combine exogenous shocks to prices with endogenous product characteristics -- under a weaker index restriction and a new condition we term faithfulness. We argue that faithfulness, like the usual completeness condition for nonparametric identification with instruments, can be viewed as a technical requirement on the richness of identifying variation rather than a substantive economic restriction, and we show that it holds under a variety of non-nested conditions on either price-setting or the index.</description>

      <title>Intrinsic Whittle--Mat\'ern fields and sparse spatial extremes</title>

      <description>arXiv:2512.23395v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Intrinsic Gaussian fields are used in many areas of statistics as models for spatial or spatio-temporal dependence, or as priors for latent variables. However, there are two major gaps in the literature: first, the number and flexibility of existing intrinsic models are very limited; second, theory, fast inference, and software are currently underdeveloped for intrinsic fields. We tackle these challenges by introducing the new flexible class of intrinsic Whittle--Mat\'ern Gaussian random fields obtained as the solution to a stochastic partial differential equation (SPDE). Exploiting sparsity resulting from finite-element approximations, we develop fast estimation and simulation methods for these models. We demonstrate the benefits of this intrinsic SPDE approach for the important task of kriging under extrapolation settings. Leveraging the connection of intrinsic fields to spatial extreme value processes, we translate our theory to an SPDE approach for Brown--Resnick processes for sparse modeling of spatial extreme events. This new paradigm paves the way for efficient inference in unprecedented dimensions. To demonstrate the wide applicability of our new methodology, we apply it in two very different areas: a longitudinal study of renal function data, and the modeling of marine heat waves using high-resolution sea surface temperature data.</description>

      <title>Le Cam Distortion: A Decision-Theoretic Framework for Robust Transfer Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.23617</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.23617v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Distribution shift is the defining challenge of real-world machine learning. The dominant paradigm--Unsupervised Domain Adaptation (UDA)--enforces feature invariance, aligning source and target representations via symmetric divergence minimization [Ganin et al., 2016]. We demonstrate that this approach is fundamentally flawed: when domains are unequally informative (e.g., high-quality vs degraded sensors), strict invariance necessitates information destruction, causing "negative transfer" that can be catastrophic in safety-critical applications [Wang et al., 2019].
  We propose a decision-theoretic framework grounded in Le Cam's theory of statistical experiments [Le Cam, 1986], using constructive approximations to replace symmetric invariance with directional simulability. We introduce Le Cam Distortion, quantified by the Deficiency Distance $\delta(E_1, E_2)$, as a rigorous upper bound for transfer risk conditional on simulability. Our framework enables transfer without source degradation by learning a kernel that simulates the target from the source. Across five experiments (genomics, vision, reinforcement learning), Le Cam Distortion achieves: (1) near-perfect frequency estimation in HLA genomics (correlation $r=0.999$, matching classical methods), (2) zero source utility loss in CIFAR-10 image classification (81.2% accuracy preserved vs 34.7% drop for CycleGAN), and (3) safe policy transfer in RL control where invariance-based methods suffer catastrophic collapse. Le Cam Distortion provides the first principled framework for risk-controlled transfer learning in domains where negative transfer is unacceptable: medical imaging, autonomous systems, and precision medicine.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2512.23643v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a theory for simultaneous approximation of the score function and its derivatives, enabling the handling of data distributions with low-dimensional structure and unbounded support. Our approximation error bounds match those in the literature while relying on assumptions that relax the usual bounded support requirement. Crucially, our bounds are free from the curse of dimensionality. Moreover, we establish approximation guarantees for derivatives of any prescribed order, extending beyond the commonly considered first-order setting.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2205.03368v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This work studies the computational aspects of multivariate convex regression in dimensions $d \ge 5$. Our results include the \emph{first} estimators that are minimax optimal (up to logarithmic factors) with polynomial runtime in the sample size for both $L$-Lipschitz convex regression, and $\Gamma$-bounded convex regression under polytopal support. Our analysis combines techniques from empirical process theory, stochastic geometry, and potential theory, and leverages recent algorithmic advances in mean estimation for random vectors and in distribution-free linear regression. These results provide the first efficient, minimax-optimal procedures for non-Donsker classes for which their corresponding least-squares estimator is provably minimax-suboptimal.</description>

      <title>Optimal plug-in Gaussian processes for modeling derivatives</title>

      <description>arXiv:2210.11626v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Derivatives are a key nonparametric functional in wide-ranging applications where the rate of change of an unknown function is of interest. In the Bayesian paradigm, Gaussian processes (GPs) are routinely used as a flexible prior for unknown functions, and are arguably one of the most popular tools in many areas. However, little is known about the optimal modeling strategy and theoretical properties when using GPs for derivatives. In this article, we study a plug-in strategy by differentiating the posterior distribution with GP priors for derivatives of any order. This practically appealing plug-in GP method has been previously perceived as suboptimal and degraded, but this is not necessarily the case. We provide posterior contraction rates for plug-in GPs and establish that they achieve optimal rates simultaneously for all derivative orders. We show that the posterior measure of the regression function and its derivatives, with the same choice of hyperparameter that does not depend on the order of derivatives, converges at the minimax optimal rate up to a logarithmic factor for functions in certain classes. We analyze a data-driven hyperparameter tuning method based on empirical Bayes, and show that it satisfies the optimal rate condition while maintaining computational efficiency. This article to the best of our knowledge provides the first positive result for plug-in GPs in the context of inferring derivative functionals, and leads to a practically simple nonparametric Bayesian method with optimal and adaptive hyperparameter tuning for simultaneously estimating the regression function and its derivatives. Simulations show competitive finite sample performance of the plug-in GP method. A climate change application for analyzing the global sea-level rise is discussed.</description>

      <title>Directional testing for one-way MANOVA in divergent dimensions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.07679v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Testing the equality of mean vectors across $g$ different groups plays an important role in many scientific fields. In regular frameworks, likelihood-based statistics under the normality assumption offer a general solution to this task. However, the accuracy of standard asymptotic results is not reliable when the dimension $p$ of the data is large relative to the sample size $n_i$ of each group. We propose here an exact directional test for the equality of $g$ normal mean vectors with identical unknown covariance matrix in a high dimensional setting, provided that $\sum_{i=1}^g n_i \ge p+g+1$. In the case of two groups ($g=2$), the directional test coincides with the Hotelling's $T^2$ test. In the more general situation where the $g$ independent groups may have different unknown covariance matrices, although exactness does not hold, simulation studies show that the directional test is more accurate than most commonly used likelihood{-}based solutions, at least in a moderate dimensional setting in which $p=O(n_i^\tau)$, $\tau \in (0,1)$. Robustness of the directional approach and its competitors under deviation from the assumption of multivariate normality is also numerically investigated. Our proposal is here applied to data on blood characteristics of male athletes and to microarray data storing gene expressions in patients with breast tumors.</description>

      <title>A Lanczos-Based Algorithmic Approach for Spike Detection in Large Sample Covariance Matrices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.03066</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.03066v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We introduce a new approach for estimating the number of spikes in a general class of spiked covariance models without directly computing the eigenvalues of the sample covariance matrix. This approach is based on the Lanczos algorithm and the asymptotic properties of the associated Jacobi matrix and its Cholesky factorization. A key aspect of the analysis is interpreting the eigenvector spectral distribution as a perturbation of its asymptotic counterpart. The specific exponential-type asymptotics of the Jacobi matrix enables an efficient approximation of the Stieltjes transform of the asymptotic spectral distribution via a finite continued fraction. As a consequence, we also obtain estimates for the density of the asymptotic distribution and the location of outliers. We provide consistency guarantees for our proposed estimators, proving their convergence in the high-dimensional regime. We demonstrate that, when applied to standard spiked covariance models, our approach outperforms existing methods in computational efficiency and runtime, while still maintaining robustness to exotic population covariances.</description>

      <title>Detection and Reconstruction of a Random Hypergraph from Noisy Graph Projection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.17527</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.17527v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: For a $d$-uniform random hypergraph on $n$ vertices in which hyperedges are included i.i.d.\ so that the average degree in the hypergraph is $n^{\delta+o(1)}$, the projection of such a hypergraph is a graph on the same $n$ vertices where an edge connects two vertices if and only if they belong to a same hyperedge. In this work, we study the inference problem where the observation is a \emph{noisy} version of the graph projection where each edge in the projection is kept with probability $p=n^{-1+\alpha+o(1)}$ and each edge not in the projection is added with probability $q=n^{-1+\beta+o(1)}$. For all constant $d$, we establish sharp thresholds for both detection (distinguishing the noisy projection from an Erd\H{o}s-R\'enyi random graph with edge density $q$) and reconstruction (estimating the original hypergraph). Notably, our results reveal a \emph{detection-reconstruction gap} phenomenon in this problem. Our work also answers a problem raised in \cite{BGPY25+}.</description>

Abstract: We consider statistical inference for a class of dynamic mixed-effect models described by stochastic differential equations whose drift and diffusion coefficients simultaneously depend on fixed- and random-effect parameters. Assuming that each process is observed at high frequency and the number of individuals goes to infinity, we propose a stepwise inference procedure and prove its theoretical properties. The methodology is based on suitable quasi-likelihood functions by profiling the random effect in the diffusion coefficient at the first stage, and then taking the marginal distribution in the drift coefficient in the second stage, resulting in a fully explicit and computationally convenient method.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2510.01015v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Wasserstein metrics are increasingly being used as similarity scores for images treated as discrete measures on a grid, yet their behavior under noise remains poorly understood. In this work, we consider the sensitivity of the signed Wasserstein distance with respect to pixel-wise additive noise and derive non-asymptotic upper bounds. Among other results, we prove that the error in the signed 2-Wasserstein distance scales with the square root of the noise standard deviation, whereas the Euclidean norm scales linearly. We present experiments that support our theoretical findings and point to a peculiar phenomenon where increasing the level of noise can decrease the Wasserstein distance. A case study on cryo-electron microscopy images demonstrates that the Wasserstein metric can preserve the geometric structure even when the Euclidean metric fails to do so.</description>

      <title>Persistence-Based Statistics for Detecting Structural Changes in High-Dimensional Point Clouds</title>

      <description>arXiv:2511.00938v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the probabilistic behavior of persistence-based statistics and propose a novel nonparametric framework for detecting structural changes in high-dimensional random point clouds. We establish moment bounds and tightness results for classical persistence statistics-total and maximum persistence-under general distributions, with explicit variance-scaling behavior derived for Gaussian mixture models. Building on these results, we introduce a bounded and normalized statistic based on persistence landscapes combined with the Jensen-Shannon divergence, and we prove its Holder continuity with respect to perturbations of the input point clouds. The resulting measure is stable, scale- and shift-invariant, and well suited for finite-sample nonparametric inference via permutation testing. An illustrative numerical study using dynamic attribute vectors from decentralized governance data demonstrates the practical applicability of the proposed method. Overall, this work provides a statistically rigorous and computationally stable approach to change-point detection in complex, high-dimensional data.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2511.08870v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We develop Gaussian approximations for high-dimensional vectors formed by second-order $U$- and $V$-statistics whose kernels depend on sample size under independent but not identically distributed (i.n.i.d.) sampling. Our results hold irrespective of which component of the Hoeffding decomposition is dominant, thereby covering both non-degenerate and degenerate regimes as special cases. By allowing i.n.i.d.~sampling, the class of statistics we analyze includes weighted $U$- and $V$-statistics and two-sample $U$- and $V$-statistics as special cases, which cover estimators of parameters in regression models with many covariates, many-weak instruments as well as a broad class of smoothed two-sample tests and the separately exchangeable arrays, among others. In addition, we extend sharp maximal inequalities for high-dimensional $U$-statistics with size-dependent kernels from the i.i.d.~to the i.n.i.d.~setting, which may be of independent interest.</description>

Abstract: Prompt learning has become a key method for adapting large language models to specific tasks with limited data. However, traditional gradient-based optimization methods for tuning prompts are computationally intensive, posing challenges for efficiency. We introduce ZOSA (Zero-Order Sharpness-Aware Minimization), a novel optimization framework that integrates zero-order optimization with sharpness-aware minimization to enhance prompt tuning. ZOSA employs Rademacher perturbation vectors to estimate gradients without requiring backpropagation. By incorporating sharpness-aware principles, it targets flat minima in the loss landscape, improving generalization. An adaptive learning rate, guided by loss variability, further ensures stable convergence. Experiments on few-shot learning tasks, such as text classification and natural language inference, show that ZOSA significantly outperforms existing methods. With its theoretical foundation and computational efficiency, ZOSA offers a practical solution for prompt-based learning in resource-limited settings.</description>

      <title>Mixed exponential statistical structures and their approximation operators</title>

      <description>arXiv:2512.07870v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The paper examines the construction and analysis of a new class of mixed exponential statistical structures that combine the properties of stochastic models and linear positive operators. The relevance of the topic is driven by the growing need to develop a unified theoretical framework capable of describing both continuous and discrete random structures that possess approximation properties. The aim of the study is to introduce and analyze a generalized family of mixed exponential statistical structures and their corresponding linear positive operators, which include known operators as particular cases. We define auxiliary statistical structures B and H through differential relations between their elements, and construct the main Phillips-type structure. Recurrent relations for the central moments are obtained, their properties are established, and the convergence and approximation accuracy of the constructed operators are investigated. The proposed approach allows mixed exponential structures to be viewed as a generalization of known statistical systems, providing a unified analytical and stochastic description. The results demonstrate that mixed exponential statistical structures can be used to develop new classes of positive operators with controllable preservation and approximation properties. The proposed methodology forms a basis for further research in constructing multidimensional statistical structures, analyzing operators in weighted spaces, and studying their asymptotic characteristics.</description>

      <title>Bayesian Image Mediation Analysis</title>

      <description>arXiv:2310.16284v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Mediation analysis aims to separate the indirect effect through mediators from the direct effect of the exposure on the outcome. It is challenging to perform mediation analysis with neuroimaging data which involves high dimensionality, complex spatial correlations, sparse activation patterns and relatively low signal-to-noise ratio. To address these issues, we develop a new spatially varying coefficient structural equation model for Bayesian Image Mediation Analysis (BIMA). We define spatially varying mediation effects within the potential outcomes framework, employing a soft-thresholded Gaussian process prior for functional parameters. We establish posterior consistency for spatially varying mediation effects along with selection consistency on important regions that contribute to the mediation effects. We develop an efficient posterior computation algorithm scalable to analysis of large-scale imaging data. Through extensive simulations, we show that BIMA can improve the estimation accuracy and computational efficiency for high-dimensional mediation analysis over existing methods. We apply BIMA to analyze behavioral and fMRI data in the Adolescent Brain Cognitive Development (ABCD) study with a focus on inferring the mediation effects of the parental education level on the children's general cognitive ability that are mediated through the working memory brain activity.</description>

      <title>Estimating Counterfactual Matrix Means with Short Panel Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.07520</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.07520v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We develop a spectral approach for identifying and estimating average counterfactual outcomes under a low-rank factor model with short panel data and general outcome missingness patterns. Applications include event studies and studies of outcomes of "matches" between agents of two types, e.g. people and places, typically conducted using less-flexible Two-Way Fixed Effects (TWFE) models of outcomes. Given finite observed outcomes per unit, we show our approach identifies all counterfactual outcome means, including those not identified by existing methods, if a particular graph algorithm determines that units' sets of observed outcomes have sufficient overlap. Our analogous, computationally efficient estimation procedure yields consistent, asymptotically normal estimates of counterfactual outcome means under fixed-$T$ (number of outcomes), large-$N$ (sample size) asymptotics. When estimating province-level averages of held-out wages from an Italian matched employer-employee dataset, our estimator outperforms a TWFE-model-based estimator.</description>

      <title>A Two-Step Projection-Based Goodness-of-Fit Test for Ultra-High Dimensional Sparse Regressions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.10721</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.10721v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper proposes a novel two-step strategy for testing the goodness-of-fit of parametric regression models in ultra-high dimensional sparse settings, where the predictor dimension far exceeds the sample size. This regime usually renders existing goodness-of-fit tests for regressions infeasible, primarily due to the curse of dimensionality or their reliance on the asymptotic linearity and normality of parameter estimators -- properties that may no longer hold under ultra-high dimensional settings. To address these limitations, our strategy first constructs multiple test statistics based on projected predictors from distinct projections and establishes their asymptotic properties under both the null and alternative hypotheses. This projection-based approach significantly mitigates the dimensionality problem, enabling our tests to detect local alternatives converging to the null at the rate as if the predictor were univariate. An important finding is that the resulting test statistics based on linearly independent projections are asymptotically independent under the null hypothesis. Based on this, our second step employs powerful $p$-value combination procedures, such as the minimum $p$-value and the Fisher combination of $p$-value, to form our final tests and enhance power. Theoretically, our tests only require the standard convergence rate of parameter estimators to derive their limiting distributions, thereby circumventing the need for asymptotic linearity or normality of parameter estimators. Simulations and real-data applications confirm that our approach provides robust and powerful goodness-of-fit testing in ultra-high dimensional settings.</description>

      <title>Asymptotic Properties of the Maximum Likelihood Estimator for Markov-switching Observation-driven Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.19555</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.19555v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A Markov-switching observation-driven model is a stochastic process $((S_t,Y_t))_{t \in \mathbb{Z}}$ where $(S_t)_{t \in \mathbb{Z}}$ is an unobserved Markov chain on a finite set and $(Y_t)_{t \in \mathbb{Z}}$ is an observed stochastic process such that the conditional distribution of $Y_t$ given $(Y_\tau)_{\tau \leq t-1}$ and $(S_\tau)_{\tau \leq t}$ depends on $(Y_\tau)_{\tau \leq t-1}$ and $S_t$. In this paper, we prove consistency and asymptotic normality of the maximum likelihood estimator for such model. As a special case, we also give conditions under which the maximum likelihood estimator for the widely applied Markov-switching generalised autoregressive conditional heteroscedasticity model introduced by Haas, Mittnik, and Paolella (2004b) is consistent and asymptotically normal.</description>

      <title>Computational Lower Bounds for Correlated Random Graphs via Algorithmic Contiguity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.09832</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.09832v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, assuming the low-degree conjecture, we provide evidence of computational hardness for two problems: (1) the (partial) matching recovery problem in the sparse correlated Erd\H{o}s-R\'enyi graphs $\mathcal G(n,q;\rho)$ when the edge-density $q=n^{-1+o(1)}$ and the correlation $\rho&lt;\sqrt{\alpha}$ lies below the Otter's threshold, this resolves a remaining problem in \cite{DDL23+}; (2) the detection problem between a pair of correlated sparse stochastic block models $\mathcal S(n,\tfrac{\lambda}{n};k,\epsilon;s)$ and a pair of independent stochastic block models $\mathcal S(n,\tfrac{\lambda s}{n};k,\epsilon)$ when $\epsilon^2 \lambda s&lt;1$ lies below the Kesten-Stigum (KS) threshold and $s&lt;\sqrt{\alpha}$ lies below the Otter's threshold, this resolves a remaining problem in \cite{CDGL24+}.
  One of the main ingredient in our proof is to derive certain forms of \emph{algorithmic contiguity} between two probability measures based on bounds on their low-degree advantage. To be more precise, consider the high-dimensional hypothesis testing problem between two probability measures $\mathbb{P}$ and $\mathbb{Q}$ based on the sample $\mathsf Y$. We show that if the low-degree advantage $\mathsf{Adv}_{\leq D} \big( \frac{\mathrm{d}\mathbb{P}}{\mathrm{d}\mathbb{Q}} \big)=O(1)$, then (assuming the low-degree conjecture) there is no efficient algorithm $\mathcal A$ such that $\mathbb{Q}(\mathcal A(\mathsf Y)=0)=1-o(1)$ and $\mathbb{P}(\mathcal A(\mathsf Y)=1)=\Omega(1)$. This framework provides a useful tool for performing reductions between different inference tasks, without requiring a strengthened version of the low-degree conjecture as in \cite{MW23+, DHSS25+}.</description>

      <title>Concentration via metastable mixing, with applications to the supercritical exponential random graph model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.07571</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.07571v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Folklore belief holds that metastable wells in low-temperature statistical mechanics models exhibit high-temperature behavior. We make this rigorous in the exponential random graph model (ERGM) through the lens of concentration of measure. We make use of the supercritical (low-temperature) metastable mixing which was recently proven by Bresler, Nagaraj, and Nichani, and obtain a novel concentration inequality for Lipschitz observables of the ERGM in a large metastable well, answering a question posed by those authors. To achieve this, we prove a new connectivity property for metastable mixing in the ERGM and introduce a new general result yielding concentration inequalities, which extends a result of Chatterjee. We also use a result of Barbour, Brightwell, and Luczak to cover all cases of interest. Our work extends a result of Ganguly and Nam from the subcritical (high-temperature) regime to metastable wells, and we also extend applications of this concentration, namely a central limit theorem for small subcollections of edges and a bound on the Wasserstein distance between the ERGM and the Erd\H{o}s-R\'enyi random graph. Finally, to supplement the mathematical content of the article, we present a simulation study of metastable wells in the supercritical ERGM.</description>

      <title>Poisson-Process Topic Model for Integrating Knowledge from Pre-trained Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.17809</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.17809v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Topic modeling is traditionally applied to word counts without accounting for the context in which words appear. Recent advancements in large language models (LLMs) offer contextualized word embeddings, which capture deeper meaning and relationships between words. We aim to leverage such embeddings to improve topic modeling.
  We use a pre-trained LLM to convert each document into a sequence of word embeddings. This sequence is then modeled as a Poisson point process, with its intensity measure expressed as a convex combination of $K$ base measures, each corresponding to a topic. To estimate these topics, we propose a flexible algorithm that integrates traditional topic modeling methods, enhanced by net-rounding applied before and kernel smoothing applied after. One advantage of this framework is that it treats the LLM as a black box, requiring no fine-tuning of its parameters. Another advantage is its ability to seamlessly integrate any traditional topic modeling approach as a plug-in module, without the need for modifications
  Assuming each topic is a $\beta$-H\"{o}lder smooth intensity measure on the embedded space, we establish the rate of convergence of our method. We also provide a minimax lower bound and show that the rate of our method matches with the lower bound when $\beta\leq 1$. Additionally, we apply our method to several datasets, providing evidence that it offers an advantage over traditional topic modeling approaches.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2505.08128v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The standard A/B testing approaches are mostly based on t-test in large scale industry applications. These standard approaches however suffers from low statistical power in business settings, due to nature of small sample-size or non-Gaussian distribution or return-on-investment (ROI) consideration. In this paper, we (i) show the statistical efficiency of using estimating equation and U statistics, which can address these issues separately; and (ii) propose a novel doubly robust generalized U that allows flexible definition of treatment effect, and can handles small samples, distribution robustness, ROI and confounding consideration in one framework. We provide theoretical results on asymptotics and efficiency bounds, together with insights on the efficiency gain from theoretical analysis. We further conduct comprehensive simulation studies, apply the methods to multiple real A/B tests at LinkedIn, and share results and learnings that are broadly useful.</description>

      <title>Quantitative central limit theorems for exponential random graphs</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.10531v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Ferromagnetic exponential random graph models (ERGMs) are nonlinear exponential tilts of Erd\H{o}s-R\'enyi models, under which the presence of certain subgraphs such as triangles may be emphasized. These models are mixtures of metastable wells which each behave macroscopically like new Erd\H{o}s-R\'enyi models themselves, exhibiting the same laws of large numbers for the overall edge count as well as all subgraph counts. However, the microscopic fluctuations of these quantities remained elusive for some time. Building on a recent breakthrough by Fang, Liu, Shao and Zhao [FLSZ24] driven by Stein's method, we prove quantitative central limit theorems (CLTs) for these quantities and more in metastable wells under ferromagnetic ERGMs. One main novelty of our results is that they apply also in the supercritical (low temperature) regime of parameters, which has previously been relatively unexplored. To accomplish this, we develop a novel probabilistic technique based on the careful analysis of the evolution of relevant quantities under the ERGM Glauber dynamics. Our technique allows us to deliver the main input to the method developed by [FLSZ24], which is the fact that the fluctuations of subgraph counts are driven by those of the overall edge count. This was first shown for the triangle count by Sambale and Sinulis [SS20] in the Dobrushin (very high temperature) regime via functional-analytic methods. We feel our technique clarifies the underlying mechanisms at play, and it also supplies improved bounds on the Wasserstein and Kolmogorov distances between the observables at hand and the limiting Gaussians, as compared to the results of [FLSZ24] in the subcritical (high temperature) regime beyond the Dobrushin regime. Moreover, our technique is flexible enough to also yield quantitative CLTs for vertex degrees and local subgraph counts, which have not appeared before in any parameter regime.</description>

      <title>Robust Spatial Confounding Adjustment via Basis Voting</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.22464</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.22464v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Estimating effects of spatially structured exposures is complicated by unmeasured spatial confounders, which undermine identifiability in spatial linear regression models unless structural assumptions are imposed. We develop a general framework for effect estimation in spatial regression models that relaxes the commonly assumed requirement that exposures contain higher-frequency variation than confounders. We propose basis voting, a plurality-rule estimator - novel in the spatial literature - that consistently identifies causal effects only under the assumption that, in a spatial basis expansion of the exposure and confounder, there exist several basis functions in the support of the exposure but not the confounder. This assumption generalizes existing assumptions of differential basis support used for identification of the causal effect under spatial confounding, and does not require prior knowledge of which basis functions satisfy this support condition. We design this estimator as the mode of several candidate estimators each computed based on a single working basis function. We also show that the standard projection-based candidate estimator typically used in other plurality-rule based methods is inefficient, and provide a more efficient novel candidate. Extensive simulations and a real-world application demonstrate that our approach reliably recovers unbiased causal estimates whenever exposure and confounder signals are separable on a plurality of basis functions. By not relying on higher-frequency variation, our method remains applicable to settings where exposures are smooth spatial functions, such as distance to pollution sources or major roadways, common in environmental studies.</description>

      <title>Learning What to Learn: Experimental Design when Combining Experimental with Observational Evidence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.23434</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.23434v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Experiments deliver credible treatment-effect estimates but, because they are costly, are often restricted to specific sites, small populations, or particular mechanisms. A common practice across several fields is therefore to combine experimental estimates with reduced-form or structural external (observational) evidence to answer broader policy questions such as those involving general equilibrium effects or external validity. We develop a unified framework for the design of experiments when combined with external evidence, i.e., choosing which experiment(s) to run and how to allocate sample size under arbitrary budget constraints. Because observational evidence may suffer bias unknown ex-ante, we evaluate designs using a minimax proportional-regret criterion that compares any candidate design to an oracle that knows the observational study bias and jointly chooses the design and estimator. This yields a transparent bias-variance trade-off that does not require the researcher to specify a bias bound and relies only on information already needed for conventional power calculations. We illustrate the framework by (i) designing cash-transfer experiments aimed at estimating general equilibrium effects and (ii) optimizing site selection for microfinance interventions.</description>

      <title>Change Point Detection and Mean-Field Dynamics of Variable Productivity Hawkes Processes</title>

      <description>arXiv:2512.20068v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Many self-exciting systems change because endogenous amplification, as opposed to exogenous forcing, varies. We study a Hawkes process with fixed background rate and kernel, but piecewise time-varying productivity. For exponential kernels we derive closed-form mean-field relaxation after a change and a deterministic surrogate for post-change Fisher information, revealing a boundary layer in which change time information localises and saturates, while post-change level information grows linearly beyond a short transient. These results motivate a Bayesian change point procedure that stabilizes inference on finite windows. We illustrate the method on invasive pneumococcal disease incidence in The Gambia, identifying a decline in productivity aligned with pneumococcal conjugate vaccine rollout.</description>
