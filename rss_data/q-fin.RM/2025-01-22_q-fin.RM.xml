      <title>Loss of earning capacity in Denmark -- an actuarial perspective</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.11578</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.11578v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We describe challenges and opportunities related to risk assessment and mitigation for loss of earning capacity insurance with a special focus on Denmark. The presence of public benefits, claim settlement processes, and prevention initiatives introduces significant intricacy to the risk landscape. Accommodating this requires the development of innovative approaches from researchers and practitioners alike. Actuaries are uniquely positioned to lead the way, leveraging their domain knowledge and mathematical-statistical expertise to develop equitable, data-driven solutions that mitigate risk and enhance societal well-being.</description>

      <title>Class-Imbalanced-Aware Adaptive Dataset Distillation for Scalable Pretrained Model on Credit Scoring</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.10677</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.10677v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The advent of artificial intelligence has significantly enhanced credit scoring technologies. Despite the remarkable efficacy of advanced deep learning models, mainstream adoption continues to favor tree-structured models due to their robust predictive performance on tabular data. Although pretrained models have seen considerable development, their application within the financial realm predominantly revolves around question-answering tasks and the use of such models for tabular-structured credit scoring datasets remains largely unexplored. Tabular-oriented large models, such as TabPFN, has made the application of large models in credit scoring feasible, albeit can only processing with limited sample sizes. This paper provides a novel framework to combine tabular-tailored dataset distillation technique with the pretrained model, empowers the scalability for TabPFN. Furthermore, though class imbalance distribution is the common nature in financial datasets, its influence during dataset distillation has not been explored. We thus integrate the imbalance-aware techniques during dataset distillation, resulting in improved performance in financial datasets (e.g., a 2.5% enhancement in AUC). This study presents a novel framework for scaling up the application of large pretrained models on financial tabular datasets and offers a comparative analysis of the influence of class imbalance on the dataset distillation process. We believe this approach can broaden the applications and downstream tasks of large models in the financial domain.</description>

      <title>Sovereign Debt Default and Climate Risk</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.11552</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.11552v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We explore the interplay between sovereign debt default/renegotiation and environmental factors (e.g., pollution from land use, natural resource exploitation). Pollution contributes to the likelihood of natural disasters and influences economic growth rates. The country can default on its debt at any time while also deciding whether to invest in pollution abatement. The framework provides insights into the credit spreads of sovereign bonds and explains the observed relationship between bond spread and a country's climate vulnerability. Through calibration for developing and low-income countries, we demonstrate that there is limited incentive for these countries to address climate risk, and the sensitivity of bond spreads to climate vulnerability remains modest. Climate risk does not play a relevant role on the decision to default on sovereign debt. Financial support for climate abatement expenditures can effectively foster climate adaptation actions, instead renegotiation conditional upon pollution abatement does not produce any effect.</description>

      <title>Implementation of an Asymmetric Adjusted Activation Function for Class Imbalance Credit Scoring</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.12285</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.12285v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Credit scoring is a systematic approach to evaluate a borrower's probability of default (PD) on a bank loan. The data associated with such scenarios are characteristically imbalanced, complicating binary classification owing to the often-underestimated cost of misclassification during the classifier's learning process. Considering the high imbalance ratio (IR) of these datasets, we introduce an innovative yet straightforward optimized activation function by incorporating an IR-dependent asymmetric adjusted factor embedded Sigmoid activation function (ASIG). The embedding of ASIG makes the sensitive margin of the Sigmoid function auto-adjustable, depending on the imbalance nature of the datasets distributed, thereby giving the activation function an asymmetric characteristic that prevents the underrepresentation of the minority class (positive samples) during the classifier's learning process. The experimental results show that the ASIG-embedded-classifier outperforms traditional classifiers on datasets across wide-ranging IRs in the downstream credit-scoring task. The algorithm also shows robustness and stability, even when the IR is ultra-high. Therefore, the algorithm provides a competitive alternative in the financial industry, especially in credit scoring, possessing the ability to effectively process highly imbalanced distribution data.</description>

      <title>Dynamic CoVaR Modeling and Estimation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2206.14275</link>
      <description>arXiv:2206.14275v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The popular systemic risk measure CoVaR (conditional Value-at-Risk) and its variants are widely used in economics and finance. In this article, we propose joint dynamic forecasting models for the Value-at-Risk (VaR) and CoVaR. The CoVaR version we consider is defined as a large quantile of one variable (e.g., losses in the financial system) conditional on some other variable (e.g., losses in a bank's shares) being in distress. We introduce a two-step M-estimator for the model parameters drawing on recently proposed bivariate scoring functions for the pair (VaR, CoVaR). We prove consistency and asymptotic normality of our parameter estimator and analyze its finite-sample properties in simulations. Finally, we apply a specific subclass of our dynamic forecasting models, which we call CoCAViaR models, to log-returns of large US banks. A formal forecast comparison shows that our CoCAViaR models generate CoVaR predictions which are superior to forecasts issued from current benchmark models.</description>

      <title>A multistate approach to disability insurance reserving with information delays</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.14324</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.14324v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Disability insurance claims are often affected by lengthy reporting delays and adjudication processes. The classic multistate life insurance modeling framework is ill-suited to handle such information delays since the cash flow and available information can no longer be based on the biometric multistate process determining the contractual payments. We propose a new individual reserving model for disability insurance schemes which describes the claim evolution in real-time. Under suitable independence assumptions between the available information and the underlying biometric multistate process, we show that these new reserves may be calculated as natural modifications of the classic reserves. We propose suitable parametric estimators for the model constituents and a real data application shows the practical relevance of our concepts and results.</description>
