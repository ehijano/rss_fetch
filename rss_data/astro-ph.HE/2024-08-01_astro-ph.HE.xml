      <title>Separating deterministic and stochastic gravitational wave signals in realistic pulsar timing array datasets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.21105</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.21105v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent observations by pulsar timing arrays indicate the presence of gravitational wave signals, likely from supermassive black hole binaries. These binaries can produce two types of signals: a stochastic gravitational wave background (GWB) or deterministic continuous gravitational waves (CGW). Correctly separating these signals is essential for accurate signal recovery and interpretation. This paper investigates the interaction between GWB and CGW signals within current analysis pipelines, focusing on misinterpretations and biases in parameter estimation when these signals are analyzed separately or together. We conducted several simulations based on the European PTA 24.8-year dataset. First, we injected either a GWB or a CGW. We compared parameter estimation using different search models, including Earth term only, combined Earth and pulsar term CGW templates, and correlated (HD) or uncorrelated (CURN) power law GWB templates. Our findings show that, when searched independently, the GWB and CGW signals can be misinterpreted as each other, and only a combined search can recover the true signal present. For datasets containing both a GWB and a CGW, failure to account for the CGW biases the recovery of the GWB. However, a combined search allows for the recovery of both GWB and CGW parameters without significant bias. Care must be taken with the method used to perform combined searches on these multi-component datasets, as the CGW pulsar term can be misinterpreted as a CURN. This can be avoided by direct searches for an HD correlated GWB plus a CGW. Our study underscores the importance of combined searches to ensure unbiased recovery of GWB parameters in the presence of strong CGWs, which is crucial for interpreting signals recently found in PTA data and represents a step toward a robust framework for disentangling stochastic and deterministic GW signals in future, more sensitive datasets.</description>

      <title>The Nature of the Emission Spectrum of NGC 7793 P13: modeling the atmosphere of the donor star</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.21117</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.21117v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We continue to study the ultra-luminous X-ray source NGC 7793 P13 in the optical range. In this work, we are testing the model of a spherically symmetric wind atmosphere of the donor star, previously identified as a B9 Ia supergiant. The model spectrum has shown good agreement with the observed one at a relatively high mass loss rate of $\dot{M} \approx 6\times10^{-6}\,M_{\odot}\,\text{yr}^{-1}$; other parameters turned out to be close to those expected for late B-supergiants. The increased mass loss rate can be explained by the high rotation velocity of the star. In addition, we have qualitatively demonstrated the effect of X-ray irradiation on the observed spectrum and discuss the fundamental possibility of wind acceleration under conditions of powerful irradiation.</description>

      <title>A Sea of Black Holes: Characterizing the LISA Signature for Stellar-Origin Black Hole Binaries</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.21161</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.21161v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Observations by the LIGO, Virgo and KAGRA (LVK) detectors have provided new insights in the demographics of stellar-origin black hole binaries (sBHB). A few years before gravitational-wave signals from sBHB mergers are recorded in the LVK detectors, their early coalescence will leave a unique signature in the ESA/NASA mission Laser Interferometer Space Antenna (LISA). Multiband observations of sBHB sources between LISA and LVK detectors opens an unprecedented opportunity to investigate the astrophysical environment and multi-messenger early-alerts. In this study, we report the sBHB sources that will be present in the LISA data derived directly from the hydrodynamic cosmological simulation Illustris. By surveying snapshots across cosmological volume, metallicity and look-back time, we find that about tens to thousand sBHB candidates will be present in the LISA data for various combinations of mission lifetime. For estimates consistent with the LVK rates, we find that only 20 sBHBs across Illustris snapshots will be detected with significant confidence for a 10-year LISA mission, while a 4-year LISA mission would detect only 2 sBHBs. Our work paves the way for creating LISA mock data and bench marking LISA detection pipelines directly using cosmological simulations.</description>

      <title>X-ray Emission of Nearby Low-mass and Sun-like Stars with Directly Imageable Habitable Zones</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.21247</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.21247v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Stellar X-ray and UV radiation can significantly affect the survival, composition, and long-term evolution of the atmospheres of planets in or near their host star's habitable zone (HZ). Especially interesting are planetary systems in the solar neighborhood that may host temperate and potentially habitable surface conditions, which may be analyzed by future ground and space-based direct-imaging surveys for signatures of habitability and life. To advance our understanding of the radiation environment in these systems, we leverage $\sim$3 Msec of XMM-Newton and Chandra observations in order to measure three fundamental stellar properties at X-ray energies for 57 nearby FGKM stellar systems: the shape of the stellar X-ray spectrum, the luminosity, and the timescales over which the stars vary (e.g., due to flares). These systems possess HZs that will be directly imageable to next-generation telescopes such as the Habitable Worlds Observatory and ground-based Extremely Large Telescopes (ELTs). We identify 29 stellar systems with $L_X/L_{\rm bol}$ ratios similar to (or less than) that of the Sun; any potential planets in the habitable zones of these stars therefore reside in present day X-ray radiation environments similar to (or less hostile than) modern Earth, though a broader set of these targets could host habitable planets. An additional 19 stellar systems have been observed with the Swift X-ray Telescope; in total, only $\sim$30% of potential direct imaging target stars has been observed with XMM-Newton, Chandra, or Swift. The data products from this work (X-ray light curves and spectra) are available via a public Zenodo repository (doi: 10.5281/zenodo.11490574).</description>

      <title>Two-Component gamma-ray Emission Spectrum and X-Ray Polarization of the Radio Galaxy Pictor A</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.21277</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.21277v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Pictor A is a $\gamma$-ray emitting radio galaxy and has a bright hotspot called WHS, located $\sim$4 arcmin away from the nucleus. In this letter, we present an analysis of its 16-year Fermi-LAT data and report the first Imaging X-ray Polarimetry Explorer (IXPE) observation for this source. Our analysis of the Fermi-LAT observations reveals evidence of two components in the average $\gamma$-ray spectrum of Pictor A, exhibiting a statistically significant hardening from $\Gamma^1_{\gamma}=3.25\pm0.15$ to $\Gamma^2_{\gamma}=1.81\pm0.07$ at a break energy of $2.46\pm0.09$ GeV. The evident variability of $\gamma$-rays is observed in Pictor A. Interestingly, the variability is dominated by the component below the break energy, and the component above the break energy shows no variability. Furthermore, we find that a power-law function can adequately fit the spectrum during high-flux states, whereas a broken power-law is still required to explain the spectrum during low-flux state. We suggest that the low-energy component originates from the nucleus, while the high-energy component primarily stems from WHS. The broadband spectral energy distributions of both nucleus and WHS can be well represented by a simple leptonic model, with both $\gamma$-ray components attributed to the synchrotron-self-Compton (SSC) process. The analysis of IXPE data on the nucleus yields an upper limit to the polarization degree $\Pi_{\rm X}&lt;$8.9\% in the 2--8 keV band, agreeing with its X-ray emission originating from SSC. However, $\Pi_{\rm X}=23.5\%\pm5.6\%$ is observed at a confidence level of $&gt;99\%$ in the 5--7 keV band, and the possible physical origin of this narrow-energy-band polarization signal is discussed.</description>

      <title>Einstein Probe discovery of a super-soft outburst from CXOU J005245.0-722844: a rare BeWD binary in the Small Magellanic Cloud</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.21371</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.21371v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: On May 27 2024, the Wide-field X-ray Telescope onboard the Einstein Probe (EP) mission detected enhanced X-ray emission from a new transient source in the Small Magellanic Cloud (SMC) during its commissioning phase. Prompt follow-up with the EP Follow-up X-ray Telescope, the Swift X-ray Telescope and Nicer have revealed a very soft, thermally emitting source (kT$\sim$0.1 keV at the outburst peak) with an X-ray luminosity of L$\sim$4$\times$10$^{38}$ erg s$^{-1}$, coincident with CXOU J005245.0-722844. This super-soft outburst faded very quickly in a week time. Several emission lines and absorption edges were present in the X-ray spectrum, such as the Oxygen (0.57 keV) and Neon (0.92 keV) He-like emission lines, and deep Nitrogen (0.67 keV) and Oxygen (0.87 keV) absorption edges. The X-ray emission resembles typical nova outbursts from an accreting white dwarf (WD) in a binary system, despite the X-ray source being historically associated with an O9-B0e massive star exhibiting a 17.55 days periodicity in the optical band. The discovery of this super-soft outburst nails down CXOU J005245.0-722844 as a BeWD X-ray binary: an elusive evolutionary stage where two main-sequence massive stars have undergone a common envelope phase and experienced at least two episodes of mass transfer. In addition, the very short duration of the outburst and the presence of Ne features hint at a rather massive, i.e., close to the Chandrasekhar limit, Ne-O WD in the system.</description>

      <title>Radio observations of the 2022 outburst of the transitional Z-Atoll source XTE J1701-462</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.21509</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.21509v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: XTE J1701-462 is a neutron star low mass X-ray binary (NS LMXB) discovered in 2006 as the first system to demonstrate unambiguously that the `Atoll' and `Z' classes of accreting neutron stars are separated by accretion rate. Radio observations during the 2006/7 outburst provided evidence for the formation of a relativistic jet, as now expected for all accreting neutron star and black hole X-ray binaries at high accretion rates. The source entered a new outburst in 2022, and we report 29 observations made with the MeerKAT radio telescope. The first radio detection was on the 16th September 2022, we continued detecting the source until mid-December 2022. Thereafter, establishing radio upper limits till 25 March 2023. We present the radio analysis alongside analysis of contemporaneous X-ray observations from MAXI. The radio light curve shows evidence for at least three flare-like events over the first hundred days, the most luminous of which has an associated minimum energy of $1\times10^{38}$ erg. We provide a detailed comparison with the 2006/7 outburst, and demonstrate that we detected radio emission from the source for considerably longer in the more recent outburst, although this is probably a function of sampling. We further constrain the radio emission from the source to have a polarisation of less than 9% at the time of 2022 IXPE detection of X-ray polarisation. Finally, we place the source in the radio -- X-ray plane, demonstrating that when detected in radio it sits in a comparable region of parameter space to the other Z-sources.</description>

      <title>Constraining the AGN formation channel for detected black hole binary mergers up to z=1.5 with the Quaia catalogue</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.21568</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.21568v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Statistical analyses based on the spatial correlation between the sky maps of Gravitational Wave (GW) events and the positions of potential host environments are a powerful tool to infer the origin of the black hole binary mergers that have been detected by the LIGO, Virgo, and KAGRA instruments. In this paper, we tighten our previous constraints on the fraction of detected GW events that may have originated from Active Galactic Nuclei (AGN). We consider 159 mergers detected not later than June 1st, 2024, and the all-sky quasar catalogue Quaia. We increase by a factor of 5.3 and 114 the number of considered GW sources and AGN respectively, also extending our analysis from redshift 0.3 to 1.5. This is possible thanks to the uniformity of the AGN catalogue and its high level of completeness, which we estimate as a function of redshift and luminosity. We find at a 95 per cent credibility level that un-obscured AGN with a bolometric luminosity higher than $10^{44.5}{\rm erg\ s}^{-1}$ ($10^{45}{\rm erg\ s}^{-1}$) do not contribute to more than the 21 (11) per cent of the detected GW events.</description>

      <title>Investigating the crust of neutron stars with neural-network quantum states</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.21207</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.21207v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: An accurate description of low-density nuclear matter is crucial for explaining the physics of neutron star crusts. In the density range between approximately 0.01 fm$^{-3}$ and 0.1 fm$^{-3}$, matter transitions from neutron-rich nuclei to various higher-density pasta shapes, before ultimately reaching a uniform liquid. In this work, we introduce a variational Monte Carlo method based on a neural Pfaffian-Jastrow quantum state, which allows us to model the transition from the liquid phase to neutron-rich nuclei microscopically. At low densities, nuclear clusters dynamically emerge from the microscopic interactions among protons and neutrons, which we model based on pionless effective field theory. Our variational Monte Carlo approach represents a significant improvement over the state-of-the-art auxiliary-field diffusion Monte Carlo method, which is severely hindered by the fermion-sign problem in this low-density regime and cannot capture the onset of clusters. In addition to computing the energy per particle of symmetric nuclear matter and pure neutron matter, we analyze an intermediate isospin-asymmetry configuration to elucidate the formation of nuclear clusters. We also provide evidence that the presence of such nuclear clusters influences the amount of protons in the crust compared to protons in beta-equilibrated, neutrino-transparent matter.</description>

      <title>Axion-like Particle Effects on Photon Polarization in High-Energy Astrophysics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.21421</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.21421v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this review, we present a self-contained introduction to axion-like particles (ALPs) with a particular focus on their effects on photon polarization: both theoretical and phenomenological aspects are discussed. We derive the photon survival probability in the presence of photon--ALP interaction, the corresponding final photon degree of linear polarization, and the polarization angle in a wide energy interval. The presented results can be tested by current and planned missions such as IXPE (already operative), eXTP, XL-Calibur, NGXP, XPP in the X-ray band and like COSI (approved to launch), e-ASTROGAM, and AMEGO in the high-energy range. Specifically, we describe ALP-induced polarization effects on several astrophysical sources, such as galaxy clusters, blazars, and gamma-ray bursts, and we discuss their real detectability. In particular, galaxy clusters appear as very good observational targets in this respect. Moreover, in the very-high-energy (VHE) band, we discuss a peculiar ALP signature in photon polarization, in principle capable of proving the ALP existence. Unfortunately, present technologies cannot detect photon polarization up to such high energies, but the observational capability of the latter ALP signature in the VHE band could represent an interesting challenge for the future. As a matter of fact, the aim of this review is to show new ways to make progress in the physics of ALPs, thanks to their effects on photon polarization, a topic that has aroused less interest in the past, but which is now timely with the advent of many new polarimetric missions.</description>

      <title>Weak rates in strongly coupled cold quark matter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.21643</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.21643v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The rates of flavor-changing weak processes are crucial in determining the conditions of beta equilibrium in neutron stars and mergers, influencing the damping of oscillations, the stability of rotating pulsars, and the emission of gravitational waves. We derive a formula for these rates at nonzero temperature, to leading order in the Fermi coupling and exact in the QCD coupling. Utilizing a simple phenomenological holographic model dual to QCD, we study massless unpaired quark matter at high densities. We numerically compute the rate for small deviations from beta equilibrium and derive an analytic approximation for small temperatures. Our findings reveal that, compared to the perturbative result, the rate is suppressed by logarithmic factors of the temperature.</description>

      <title>Constraints on the $\gamma$-parameter for the vacuum solution of Cotton gravity with geodesics and shadows</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.21655</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.21655v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider a recently introduced extension of General Relativity dubbed as Cotton gravity (CG), based on the use of the Cotton tensor, to estimate the size of a new constant $\gamma$ appearing within a spherically symmetric, vacuum solution of the theory. Taking into account its non-asymptotically flat character, we use the inferred size of the central brightness depression of the supermassive object at the heart of the Milky Way galaxy (Sgr A*) by the Event Horizon Telescope to constrain at $2\sigma$ the CG parameter as $\gamma M \approx 3.5 \times 10^{-12}$. We study the potential observational consequences from the smallness of such a value using exact and numerical expressions for the deflection angle, optical images from optically and geometrically thin accretion disks, isoradials, and instability scales (Lyapunov index) of nearly bound geodesics associated to photon rings. Our results point towards the impossibility to distinguish between these two geometries using current and foreseeable techniques in the field of interferometric detection of optical sources.</description>

      <title>A study in scarlet -- II. Spectroscopic properties of a sample of Intermediate Luminosity Red Transients</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.21733</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.21733v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the spectroscopic characteristics of Intermediate Luminosity Red Transients (ILRTs), a class of elusive objects with peak luminosity between that of classical novae and standard supernovae. We present the extensive optical and near-infrared (NIR) spectroscopic monitoring of four ILRTs, namely NGC 300 2008OT-1, AT 2019abn, AT 2019ahd and AT 2019udc. First we focus on the evolution of the most prominent spectral features observed in the low resolution spectra, then we discuss more in detail the high resolution spectrum collected for NGC 300 2008OT-1 with the Very Large Telescope equipped with UVES. Finally we analyse late time spectra of NGC 300 2008OT-1 and AT 2019ahd through comparisons with both synthetic and observed spectra. Balmer and Ca lines dominate the optical spectra, revealing the presence of slowly moving circumstellar medium (CSM) around the objects. The line luminosity of H$\alpha$, H$\beta$ and Ca II NIR triplet presents a double peaked evolution with time, possibly indicative of interaction between fast ejecta and the slow CSM. The high resolution spectrum of NGC 300 2008OT-1 reveals a complex circumstellar environment, with the transient being surrounded by a slow ($\sim$30 km s$^{-1}$) progenitor wind. At late epochs, optical spectra of NGC 300 2008OT-1 and AT 2019ahd show broad ($\sim$2500 km s$^{-1}$) emission features at $\sim$6170 A and $\sim$7000 A which are unprecedented for ILRTs. We find that these lines originate most likely from the blending of several narrow lines, possibly of iron-peak elements.</description>

      <title>Multi-frequency test of dark matter annihilation into long-lived particles in Sirius</title>

      <description>arXiv:2302.09951v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: New long-lived particles produced at the colliders may escape from conventional particle detectors. Using satellites or ground telescopes, we can detect the photons generated from the annihilation of the star-captured dark matter into a pair of long-lived particles. When the propagation length of these long-lived particles surpasses the interplanetary distance between the Sun and Jupiter, it becomes unfeasible to detect such dark matter signals originating from the Sun or Jupiter on Earth. Our analysis of the dark matter-induced photons produced by prompt radiation, inverse Compton scattering, and synchrotron radiation mechanisms reveals that a decay length of about $10^{-3}$ pc for long-lived particles is required for maximum detectability. We investigate the parameters that allow the long-lived particle's lifetime to be consistent with Big Bang nucleosynthesis while also allowing it to escape the confines of our solar system. The Sirius system is proposed as a promising target for the indirect detection of such long-lived particles. Utilizing the prompt, inverse Compton scattering, and synchrotron radiation, upper limits on the dark matter-proton spin-independent and spin-dependent cross section are estimated with the Fermi-LAT null-signal observation and the capabilities of the upcoming Square Kilometre Array radio telescope.</description>

      <title>Damping of strong GHz waves near magnetars and the origin of fast radio bursts</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.12182</link>
      <description>arXiv:2307.12182v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate how a fast radio burst (FRB) emitted near a magnetar would propagate through its surrounding dipole magnetosphere at radii $r=10^7$-$10^9$ cm. First, we show that a GHz burst emitted in the O-mode with luminosity $L\gg 10^{40}$ erg/s is immediately damped for all propagation directions except a narrow cone along the magnetic axis. Then we examine bursts in the X-mode. GHz waves propagating near the magnetic equator behave as magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) waves if they have $L\gg 10^{40}$ erg/s. The waves develop plasma shocks in each oscillation and dissipate at $r\sim 3 \times 10^8 L_{42}^{-1/4}$ cm. Waves with lower $L$ or propagation directions closer to the magnetic axis do not obey MHD. Instead, they interact with individual particles and require a kinetic description. The kinetic interaction quickly accelerates particles to Lorentz factors $10^4$-$10^5$ at the expense of the wave energy, which again results in strong damping of the wave. In either propagation regime, MHD or kinetic, the dipole magnetosphere surrounding the FRB source acts as a pillow absorbing the radio burst and re-radiating the absorbed energy in X-rays. These results constrain the origin of observed FRBs. We argue that the observed FRBs avoid damping because they are emitted by relativistic outflows from magnetospheric explosions, so that the GHz waves do not need to propagate through the outer equilibrium magnetosphere surrounding the magnetar.</description>

      <title>A bright burst from FRB 20200120E in a globular cluster of the nearby galaxy M81</title>

      <description>arXiv:2310.00908v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Fast radio bursts (FRBs) are immensely energetic millisecond-duration radio pulses. Observations indicate that nearby FRBs can be produced by old stellar populations, as suggested by the localization of the repeating source FRB 20200120E in a globular cluster of M81. Nevertheless, the burst energies of FRB 20200120E are significantly smaller than those of other cosmological FRBs, even falling below the energy of the Galactic event FRB 20200428. Here, we report the detection of a bright burst from FRB 20200120E in 1.1 -- 1.7 GHz, with a fluence of about 30 Jy ms, which is more than 42 times larger than the previously detected bursts near 1.4 GHz frequency. It reaches one-third of the energy of the weakest burst from FRB 20121102A and is detectable at a distance exceeding 200 Mpc. Our finding bridges the gap between nearby and cosmological FRBs and indicates that FRBs hosted in globular clusters can be bright enough to be observable at cosmological distances.</description>

      <title>A correlation between unabsorbed hard X-rays and neutrinos in radio-loud and radio-quiet AGN</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.06867v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The first high-energy neutrino source identified by IceCube was a blazar - an active galactic nucleus driving a relativistic jet towards Earth. Jets driven by accreting black holes are commonly assumed to be needed for high-energy neutrino production. Recently, IceCube discovered neutrinos from Seyfert galaxies, which appears unrelated to jet activity. Here, we show that the observed luminosity ratios of neutrinos and hard X-rays from blazars TXS 0506+056 and GB6 J1542+6129 are consistent with neutrino production in a $\gamma$-obscured region near a central supermassive black hole, with the X-ray flux corresponding to reprocessed $\gamma$-ray emission with flux comparable to that of neutrinos. Similar neutrino - hard X-ray flux ratios are found for four Seyfert galaxies, NGC 1068, NGC 4151, CGCG 420-015 and NGC 3079, raising the possibility of a common neutrino production mechanism that may not involve a strong jet.</description>

      <title>A Cyclic Spectroscopy Scintillation Study of PSR B1937+21 I. Demonstration of Improved Scintillometry</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.13796v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We use cyclic spectroscopy to perform high frequency-resolution analyses of multi-hour baseband Arecibo observations of the millisecond pulsar PSR B1937+21. This technique allows for the examination of scintillation features in far greater detail than is otherwise possible under most pulsar timing array observing setups. We measure scintillation bandwidths and timescales in each of eight subbands across a 200 MHz observing band in each observation. Through these measurements we obtain intra-epoch estimates of the frequency scalings for scintillation bandwidth and timescale.Thanks to our high frequency resolution and the narrow scintles of this pulsar, we resolve scintillation arcs in the secondary spectra due to the increased Nyquist limit, which would not have been resolved at the same observing frequency with a traditional filterbank spectrum using NANOGrav's current time and frequency resolutions, and the frequency-dependent evolution of scintillation arc features within individual observations. We observe the dimming of prominent arc features at higher frequencies, possibly due to a combination of decreasing flux density and the frequency dependence of the plasma refractive index of the interstellar medium. We also find agreement with arc curvature frequency dependence predicted by Stinebring et al. (2001) in some epochs. Thanks to the frequency resolution improvement provided by cyclic spectroscopy, these results show strong promise for future such analyses with millisecond pulsars, particularly for pulsar timing arrays, where such techniques can allow for detailed studies of the interstellar medium in highly scattered pulsars without sacrificing the timing resolution that is crucial to their gravitational wave detection efforts.</description>

      <title>Bumpy Superluminous Supernovae Powered by a Magnetar-star Binary Engine</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.01224v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Wolf-Rayet stars in close binary systems can be tidally spun up by their companions, potentially leaving behind fast-spinning highly-magnetized neutron stars, known as ``magnetars", after core collapse. These newborn magnetars can transfer rotational energy into heating and accelerating the ejecta, producing hydrogen-poor superluminous supernovae (SLSNe). In this {\em{Letter}}, we propose that the magnetar wind of the newborn magnetar could significantly evaporate its companion star, typically a main-sequence or helium star, if the binary system is not disrupted by the {abrupt mass loss and} SN kick. The subsequent heating and acceleration of the evaporated star material along with the SN ejecta by the magnetar wind can produce a post-peak bump in the SLSN lightcurve. Our model can reproduce the primary peaks and post-peak bumps of four example observed multiband SLSN lightcurves, revealing that the mass of the evaporated material could be $\sim0.4-0.6\,M_\odot$ if the material is hydrogen-rich. {We propose that the magnetar could induce strongly enhanced evaporation from its companion star near the pericenter if the orbit of the post-SN binary is highly eccentric, ultimately generating multiple post-peak bumps in the SLSN lightcurves. This ``magnetar-star binary engine" model may offer a possible explanation for the evolution of polarization, along with the origin and velocity broadening of late-time hydrogen or helium broad spectral features observed in some bumpy SLSNe.} The diversity in the lightcurves and spectra of SLSNe may be attributed to the wide variety of companion stars and post-SN binary systems.</description>

      <title>The neutron star mass, distance, and inclination from precision timing of the brilliant millisecond pulsar J0437$-$4715</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.07132v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The observation of neutron stars enables the otherwise impossible study of fundamental physical processes. The timing of binary radio pulsars is particularly powerful, as it enables precise characterization of their (three-dimensional) positions and orbits. PSR~J0437$-$4715 is an important millisecond pulsar for timing array experiments and is also a primary target for the Neutron Star Interior Composition Explorer (NICER). The main aim of the NICER mission is to constrain the neutron star equation of state by inferring the compactness ($M_p/R$) of the star. Direct measurements of the mass $M_p$ from pulsar timing therefore substantially improve constraints on the radius $R$ and the equation of state. Here we use observations spanning 26 years from Murriyang, the 64-m Parkes radio telescope, to improve the timing model for this pulsar. Among the new precise measurements are the pulsar mass $M_p=1.418\pm 0.044$ $M_{\odot}$, distance $D=156.96 \pm 0.11$ pc, and orbital inclination angle $i=137.506 \pm 0.016^\circ$, which can be used to inform the X-ray pulse profile models inferred from NICER observations. We demonstrate that these results are consistent between multiple data sets from the Parkes Pulsar Timing Array (PPTA), each modeled with different noise assumptions. Using the longest available PPTA data set, we measure an apparent second derivative of the pulsar spin frequency and discuss how this can be explained either by kinematic effects due to the proper motion and radial velocity of the pulsar or excess low-frequency noise such as a gravitational-wave background.</description>

Abstract: Using the data of eROSITA (extended Roentgen Survey with an Imaging Telescope Array) on board Spektrum-Roentgen-Gamma (Spektr-RG, SRG) taken during the first eROSITA all-sky survey (eRASS1), we perform the first X-ray classification and population study in the field of Canis Major overdensity (CMa OD), which is an elliptical-shaped stellar overdensity located at l = -240, b = -80. The study aims to identify the X-ray sources in CMa OD. For this purpose, we developed a classification algorithm using multi-wavelength criteria as a preliminary method for the classification of faint X-ray sources, specifically in regions with a high source number density. Out of a total number of 8311 X-ray sources, we have classified 1029 sources as Galactic stars and binaries in the foreground, 946 sources as active galactic nuclei (AGN) and galaxies in the background, and 435 sources with stellar counterparts, which can belong to either the MW or CMa OD. Among the sources with a stellar counterpart, we have identified 34 symbiotic star candidates, plus 335 sources, of which the infrared counterparts have properties of M-giants in CMa OD. Moreover, there is a known high-mass X-ray binary (HMXB, 4U 0728-25) in the field of our study, which, according to the Gaia parallax of its companion, seems to be a member of CMa OD. There is also a recently detected transient low-mass X-ray binary (LMXB, SRGt J071522.1-191609), which can be a member of CMa OD based on its companion that is most likely highly absorbed and is thus located behind the Galactic disk. In addition, we present the X-ray luminosity function (XLF) of members and candidate members of CMa OD. It is dominated by sources with luminosities of &lt; 2*10^32-10^33 erg/s in the energy range of 0.2-2.3 keV, which are expected to be either accreting white dwarfs or quiescent LMXBs.</description>

      <title>Primordial Black Hole Sterile Neutrinogenesis: Sterile Neutrino Dark Matter Production Independent of Couplings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.12136</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.12136v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Sterile neutrinos ($\nu_s$s) are well-motivated and actively searched for hypothetical neutral particles that would mix with the Standard Model active neutrinos. They are considered prime warm dark matter (DM) candidates, typically when their mass is in the keV range, although they can also be hot or cold DM components. We discuss in detail the characteristics and phenomenology of $\nu_s$s that minimally couple only to active neutrinos and are produced in the evaporation of early Universe primordial black holes (PBHs), a process we called "PBH sterile neutrinogenesis". Contrary to the previously studied $\nu_s$ production mechanisms, this novel mechanism does not depend on the active-sterile mixing. The resulting $\nu_s$s have a distinctive spectrum and are produced with larger energies than in typical scenarios. This characteristic enables $\nu_s$s to be WDM in the unusual $0.3$ MeV to $0.3$ TeV mass range, if PBHs do not matter-dominate the Universe before evaporating. When PBHs matter-dominate before evaporating, the possible coincidence of induced gravitational waves associated with PBH evaporation and astrophysical X-ray observations from $\nu_s$ decays constitutes a distinct signature of our scenario. constitutes a distinct signature of our scenario.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.05732v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Primordial black holes (PBH) can efficiently form black hole binaries in the early universe. We update the resulting constraints on PBH abundance using data from the third observational run (O3) of LIGO-Virgo-KAGRA. To capture a wide range of PBH scenarios, we consider a variety of mass functions, including critical collapse in the QCD epoch in the presence of non-Gaussianities. Applying hierarchical Bayesian analysis to a population binaries consisting of primordial and astrophysical black holes, we find that, in every scenario, the PBHs can make up at most $f_{\rm PBH} \lesssim 10^{-3}$ of dark matter in the mass range $1-200~M_\odot$. The shape and strength of the constraints are insensitive to the type of non-Gaussianities, the modifications to the mass function during the QCD epoch, or the modelling of the astrophysical PBH population.</description>

      <title>Black hole in a generalized Chaplygin-Jacobi dark fluid: shadow and light deflection angle</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.05650v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate a generalized Chaplygin-like gas with an anisotropic equation of state, characterizing a dark fluid within which a static spherically symmetric black hole is assumed. By solving the Einstein equations for this black hole spacetime, we explicitly derive the metric function. The spacetime is parametrized by two critical parameters, $\mathcal{B}$ and $\alpha$, which measure the deviation from the Schwarzschild black hole and the extent of the dark fluid's anisotropy, respectively. We explore the behavior of light rays in the vicinity of the black hole by calculating its shadow and comparing our results with the Event Horizon Telescope observations. This comparison constrains the parameters to $0 \leq \mathcal{B} &lt; 0.03$ and $0 &lt; \alpha &lt; 0.1$. Additionally, we calculate the deflection angles to determine the extent to which light is bent by the black hole. These calculations are further utilized to formulate possible Einstein rings, estimating the angular radius of the rings to be approximately $37.6\,\mathrm{\mu as}$. Throughout this work, we present analytical solutions wherever feasible, and employ reliable approximations where necessary to provide comprehensive insights into the spacetime characteristics and their observable effects.</description>
