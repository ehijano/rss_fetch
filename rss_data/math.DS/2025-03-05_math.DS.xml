      <title>Isogenies of minimal Cantor systems: from Sturmian to Denjoy and interval exchanges</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.02168</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.02168v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This work is motivated by the study of continued fraction expansions of real numbers: we describe in dynamical terms their orbits under the action of $\mathrm{PGL}_2(\mathbb{Q})$. A real number gives rise to a Sturmian system encoding a rotation of the circle. It is well known that $\mathrm{PGL}_2(\mathbb{Z})$-equivalence of real numbers, characterized by the tails of their continued fraction expansions, amounts to flow equivalence of Sturmian systems. We show that the multiplicative action of $m\in \mathbb{Z}$ on a real number corresponds to taking the $m$th-power followed by what we call an infinitesimal 2-asymptotic factor of its Sturmian system.
  This leads us to introduce the notion of isogeny between zero-dimensional systems: it combines virtual flow equivalences and infinitesimal asymptotic equivalences. We develop tools for classifying systems up to isogeny involving cohomological invariants and states. We then use this to give a complete description of $\mathrm{PSL}_2(\mathbb{Q})$-equivalence of real numbers in terms of Sturmian systems. We classify Denjoy systems up to isogenies within this class via the action of $\mathrm{PGL}_{2}(\mathbb{Q})$ on their invariants.
  We also investigate eventual flow equivalence of Sturmian systems: we show that for non-quadratic parameters it amounts to topological conjugacy and for quadratic parameters it implies total flow equivalence and other arithmetic constraints.
  In another direction, we consider interval exchanges satisfying Keane's condition. We characterize flow equivalence in terms of interval-induced subsystems (or the tails of their paths in the bilateral Rauzy induction diagram). Finally we find rational invariants for isogeny involving the length modules and SAF invariants of the associated ergodic measures. This leads to a conjecture for their classification up to isogeny, which we prove in the totally ergodic case.</description>

      <title>Hopf and double Hopf bifurcations in a delayed lateral vibration model of footbridges induced by pedestrians</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.02211</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.02211v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we investigate the dynamical behaviors of a delayed lateral vibration model of footbridges proposed based on the facts that pedestrians will reduce their walking speed or stop walking when the response of the footbridge becomes sufficiently large, and that the bridge velocity can not be changed at once when the pedestrians begin to walk on the bridge. By analyzing the distribution of roots of the associated characteristic equation, we find that there are only two types of bifurcations in this model: Hopf bifurcation and double Hopf bifurcation, and give the condition on the stability of the trivial solution. By using the center manifold theorem and bifurcation theory of delayed differential equations, we obtain the dynamical behavior in these bifurcations, specially including the stability of periodic solutions and invariant tori bifurcating from the trivial solution in these bifurcations. Finally, we prove that this model exhibits quasi-periodic vibrations by KAM theorems, besides periodic vibrations.</description>

      <title>Streams, Graphs and Global Attractors of Dynamical Systems on Locally Compact Spaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.02262</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.02262v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In a recent article, we introduced the concept of streams and graphs of a semiflow. An important related concept is the one of semiflow with {\em compact dynamics}, which we defined as a semiflow $F$ with a {\em compact global trapping region}. In this follow-up, we restrict to the important case where the phase space $X$ is locally compact and we move the focus on the concept of {\em global attractor}, a maximal compact set that attracts every compact subset of $X$. A semiflow $F$ can have many global trapping regions but, if it has a global attractor, this is unique. We modify here our original definition and we say that $F$ has compact dynamics if it has a global attractor $G$. We show that most of the qualitative properties of $F$ are inherited by the restriction $F_G$ of $F$ to $G$ and that, in case of Conley's chains stream of $F$, the qualitative behavior of $F$ and $F_G$ coincide. Moreover, if $F$ is a continuous-time semiflow, then its graph is identical to the graph of its time-1 map. Our main result is that, for each semiflow $F$ with compact dynamics over a locally compact space, the graphs of the prolongational relation of $F$ and of every stream of $F$ are connected if the global attractor is connected.</description>

      <title>Further results for a family of continuous piecewise linear planar maps</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.02411</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.02411v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider the family of piecewise linear maps $F(x,y)=\left(|x| - y + a, x - |y| + b\right),$ where $(a,b)\in \mathbb{R}^2$. In our previous work [10], we presented a comprehensive study of this family. In this paper, we give three new results that complement the ones presented in that reference. All them refer to the most interesting and complicated case, $a&lt;0$. For this case, the dynamics of each map is concentrated in a one-dimensional invariant graph that depend on $b$. In [10], we studied the dynamics of the family on these graphs. In particular, we described whether the topological entropy associated with the map on the graph is positive or zero in terms of the parameter $c=-b/a$. Among the results obtained, we found that there are points of discontinuity of the entropy in the transitions from positive to zero entropy. In this paper, as a first result, we present a detailed explicit analysis of the entropy behavior for the case $4&lt;c&lt;8$, which shows the continuity of this transition from positive to zero entropy. As a second result, we prove that for certain values of the parameter $c$, each invariant graph contains a subset of full Lebesgue measure where there are at most three distinct $\omega$-limit sets, which are periodic orbits when $c \in \mathbb{Q}$. Within the framework of the third result, we provide an explicit methodology to obtain accurate rational lower and upper bounds for the values of the parameter $c$ at which the transition from zero to positive entropy occurs.</description>

      <title>Ehrhart spectra of large subsets of $\mathbb{Z}^r$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.02501</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.02501v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper introduces and studies the Ehrhart spectrum of a set $E \subseteq \mathbb{Z}^r$, defined as the set of all Ehrhart polynomials of simplices with vertices in $E$, generalizing the notion of volume spectrum. We show that for any $E \subseteq \mathbb{Z}^r$ with positive upper Banach density, there is some $n \in \mathbb{Z}^r$ such that the Ehrhart spectrum of $n \mathbb{Z}^r$ is contained in the Ehrhart spectrum of $E$, generalizing an earlier result by the first and third author for the volume spectrum of $E$.</description>

      <title>Averaging method for quasi-periodic response solutions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.02540</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.02540v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we present an averaging method for obtaining quasi-periodic response solutions in perturbed real analytic quasi-periodic systems with Diophantine frequency vectors. Assuming that the averaged system possesses a non-degenerate equilibrium and the eigenvalues of the linearized matrix are pairwise distinct, we show that the original system admits a quasi-periodic response solution for the parameter belonging to a Cantorian set. The proof is based on the KAM techniques, and this averaging method can be extended to the second-order systems. It is worth mentioning that our results do not require the equilibrium point to be hyperbolic, which means that the eigenvalues of the linearized matrix of the averaging system may be purely imaginary.</description>

      <title>$C^{1}$-Stable-Manifolds for Periodic Heteroclinic Chains in Bianchi IX: Symbolic Computations and Statistical Properties</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.02664</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.02664v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper we study oscillatory Bianchi models of class A and are able to show that for admissible periodic heteroclinic chains in Bianchi IX there exisist $C^{1}$- stable - manifolds of orbits that follow these chains towards the big bang. A detailed study of Takens Linearization Theorem and the Non-Resonance-Conditions leads us to this new result in Bianchi class A. More precisely, we can show that there are no heteroclinic chains in Bianchi IX with constant continued fraction development that allow Takens-Linearization at all of their base points. Geometrically speaking, this excludes "symmetric" heteroclinic chains with the same number of "bounces" near all of the 3 Taub Points - the result shows that we have to require some "asymmetry" in the bounces in order to allow for Takens Linearization, e.g. by considering admissible 2-periodic continued fraction developments. We conclude by discussing the statistical properties of those solutions, including their topological and measure-theoretic genericity.</description>

      <title>The 18-cycle in Bianchi $VI_{-1/9}^{^{*}}$: Combined Linear Local Passage and Numerical Simulation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.02684</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.02684v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we find an example for a periodic heteroclinic chain in Bianchi $VI_{-1/9}^{^{*}}$ that allows Takens Linearization at all base points. It turns out to be a "18-cycle'', i.e. involving a heteroclinic chain of 18 different base points at the Kasner circle. We then show that the combined cinear local passage at the 18-cycle is a contraction. This qualifies the 18-cycle as a candidate for proving the first rigorous convergence theorem in Bianchi $VI_{-1/9}^{^{*}}$.
  For the numerical simulation of solutions that follow such heteroclinic cycles, we use a variable-step, variable-order (VSVO) Adams-Bashforth-Moulton PECE solver in Matlab. We conclude with a discussion on how to proceed further in studying Bianchi cosmologies, and also discuss directions for future research in inhomogeneous (PDE-) cosmological models. This puts our results in a broader perspective. The appendix contains symbolic and computations done by Mathematica for examples discussed throughout the text.</description>

      <title>The Hopf-Rinow theorem and the Ma\~n\'e critical value for magnetic geodesics on odd-dimensional spheres</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.02406</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.02406v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The subject of this article are magnetic geodesics on odd-dimensional spheres endowed with the round metric and with the magnetic potential given by the standard contact form. We compute the Ma\~n\'e's critical value of the system and show that a value of the energy is supercritical if and only if all pairs of points on the sphere can be connected by a magnetic geodesic with that value of the energy. Our methods are explicit and rely on the description of the submanifolds invariant by the flow and of the symmetries of the system, which we define for a general magnetic system and call totally magnetic submanifolds and magnetomorphisms, respectively. We recover hereby the known fact that the system is super-integrable: the three-spheres obtained intersecting the ambient space with a complex plane are totally magnetic and each magnetic geodesic is tangent to a two-dimensional Clifford torus. In our study the integral of motion given by the angle between magnetic geodesics and the Reeb vector field plays a special role, and can be used to realize the magnetic flow as an interpolation between the sub-Riemannian geodesic flow of the contact distribution and the Reeb flow of the contact form.</description>

      <title>Pseudo-Anosov surfaces and Dynamics in 3-manifolds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.02873</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.02873v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We determine which closed orientable $3$-manifolds $M$ admit a self-homeomorphism restricting to a pseudo-Anosov map on an incompressible subsurface $\Sigma$, which we call a pseudo-Anosov surface. When $M$ is irreducible, we show that the self-homeomorphism of $M$ is isotopic rel $\Sigma$ to a "partially pseudo-Anosov" homeomorphism, a notion that we will introduce. This is motivated by the corresponding results for Anosov tori in irreducible $3$-manifolds, and the connection to partially hyperbolic diffeomorphisms, obtained by F. Rodriguez-Hertz, J. Rodriguez-Hertz and R. Ures.</description>

      <title>On the strong Feller property of the heat equation on quantum graphs with Kirchoff noise</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.11866</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.11866v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider a so-called quantum graph with standard continuity and Kirchhoff vertex conditions where the Kirchhoff vertex condition is perturbed by Gaussian noise. We show that the quantum graph setting is very different from the classical one dimensional boundary noise setting, where the transition semigroup is known to be strong Feller, by giving examples and counterexamples to the strong Feller property. In particular, when the graph is a tree, and there is noise present in all but one of the boundary vertices, then the transition semigroup associated with the problem is strong Feller at any time $T&gt;0$. This turns out to be also a necessary condition for equilateral star graphs. We also comment on the existence and uniqueness of the invariant measure and the regularity of the solution.</description>

Abstract: We investigate the arithmetic properties of the multiplier polynomials for certain $1$-parameter families of polynomials. In particular, we prove integrality theorems of multiplier polynomials for $z^d+c$, $(z-c)z^d + c$ and $z^{d+1}+cz$. As a corollary, we obtain the uniform upper bound of the naive height of parabolic parameters of unicritical polynomials. Moreover, we determined the quadratic parabolic parameters for $z^2 + c$. We also conditionally list parabolic parameters for $z^2 + c$ of fixed degrees.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2502.08693v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We prove that for a wide family of open zooming systems and zooming potentials we have equilibrium stability, i.e., the equilibrium states depend continuously on the dynamics and the potential. We consider the open zooming systems with special holes and quite general contractions and zooming potentials with locally H\"older induced potential, which include the H\"older ones. We also prove stability for skew-products with the base being a zooming system like above. As a consequence of finiteness and stability, we obtain uniqueness of equilibrium state.</description>

      <title>Entropies and Pressures for Nonautonomous Dynamical Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.21149</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.21149v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Let $\boldsymbol{X}=\{X_k\}_{k=0}^\infty$ be a sequence of compact metric spaces $X_{k}$ and $\boldsymbol{T}=\{T_k\}_{k=0}^\infty$ a sequence of continuous mappings $T_{k}: X_{k} \to X_{k+1}$. The pair $(\boldsymbol{X},\boldsymbol{T})$ is called a nonautonomous dynamical system.
  In this paper, we study measure-theoretic entropies and pressures, Bowen and packing topological entropies and pressures on $(\boldsymbol{X},\boldsymbol{T})$, and we prove that they are invariant under equiconjugacies of nonautonomous dynamical systems. By establishing Billingsley type theorems for Bowen and packing topological pressures, we obtain their variational principles, that is, given a non-empty compact subset $K \subset X_{0}$ and an equicontinuous sequence $\boldsymbol{f}= \{f_k\}_{k=0}^\infty$ of functions $f_k : X_k\to \mathbb{R}$, we have that $$ P^{\mathrm{B}}(\boldsymbol{T},\boldsymbol{f},K)=\sup\{\underline{P}_{\mu}(\boldsymbol{T},\boldsymbol{f}): \mu \in M(X_{0}), \mu(K)=1\}, $$ and for $\|\boldsymbol{f}\|&lt;+\infty$ and $P^{\mathrm{P}}(\boldsymbol{T},\boldsymbol{f},K)&gt;\|\boldsymbol{f}\|$, $$ P^{\mathrm{P}}(\boldsymbol{T},\boldsymbol{f},K)=\sup\{\overline{P}_{\mu}(\boldsymbol{T},\boldsymbol{f}): \mu \in M(X_{0}), \mu(K)=1\}, $$ where $\underline{P}_{\mu} $ and $\overline{P}_{\mu} $, $P^{\mathrm{B}}$ and $P^{\mathrm{P}}$ denote measure-theoretic lower and upper pressures, Bowen and packing topological pressure, respectively. The Billingsley type theorems and variational principles for Bowen and packing topological entropies are direct consequences of the ones for Bowen and packing topological pressures.</description>

      <title>Mesoscopic and Macroscopic Entropy Balance Equations in a Stochastic Dynamics and Its Deterministic Limit</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.00165</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.00165v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Entropy, its production, and its change in a dynamical system can be understood from either a fully stochastic dynamic description or from a deterministic dynamics exhibiting chaotic behavior. By taking the former approach based on the general diffusion process with diffusion $\tfrac{1}{\alpha}{\bf D}(\bf x)$ and drift $\bf b(\bf x)$, where $\alpha$ represents the ``size parameter'' of a system, we show that there are two distinctly different entropy balance equations. One reads ${\rm d} S^{(\alpha)}/{\rm d} t = e^{(\alpha)}_p + Q^{(\alpha)}_{ex}$ for all $\alpha$. However, the leading $\alpha$-order, ``extensive'', terms of the entropy production rate $e^{(\alpha)}_p$ and heat exchange rate $Q^{(\alpha)}_{ex}$ are exactly cancelled. Therefore, in the asymptotic limit of $\alpha\to\infty$, there is a second, local ${\rm d} S/{\rm d} t = \nabla\cdot{\bf b}({\bf x}(t))+\left({\bf D}:{\bf \Sigma}^{-1}\right)({\bf x}(t))$ on the order of $O(1)$, where $\tfrac{1}{\alpha}{\bf D}(\bf x(t))$ represents the randomness generated in the dynamics usually represented by metric entropy, and $\tfrac{1}{\alpha}{\bf \Sigma}({\bf x}(t))$ is the covariance matrix of the local Gaussian description at ${\bf x}(t)$, which is a solution to the ordinary differential equation $\dot{\bf x}={\bf b}(\bf x)$ at time $t$. This latter equation is akin to the notions of volume-preserving conservative dynamics and entropy production in the deterministic dynamic approach to nonequilibrium thermodynamics {\it \`{a} la} D. Ruelle. As a continuation of [17], mathematical details with sufficient care are given in four Appendices.</description>

      <title>Convergence Analysis of Gradient Flow for Overparameterized LQR Formulations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.15456</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.15456v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Motivated by the growing use of artificial intelligence (AI) tools in control design, this paper analyses the intersection between results from gradient methods for the model-free linear quadratic regulator (LQR), and linear feedforward neural networks (LFFNNs), More specifically, it looks into the case where one wants to find a LFFNN feedback that minimizes a LQR cost. This paper starts by analyzing the structure of the gradient expression for the parameters of each layer, which implies a key conservation law of the system. This conservation law is then leveraged to generalize existing results on boundedness and global convergence of solutions to critical points, and invariance of the set of stabilizing networks under the training dynamics. This is followed by an analysis of the case where the LFFNN has a single hidden layer, for which the paper proves that the training converges not only to the critical points, but to the optimal feedback control law for all but a set of Lebesgue measure zero of the initializations. These theoretical results are followed by an extensive analysis of a simple version of the problem -- the ``vector case'' -- proving the theoretical properties of accelerated convergence and small-input input-to-state stability (ISS) for this simpler example. Finally, the paper presents numerical evidence of faster convergence of the training of general LFFNNs when compared to non-overparameterized formulations, showing that the acceleration of the solution is observable even when the gradient is not explicitly computed, but estimated from evaluations of the cost function.</description>

      <title>The Mean-Field Survival Model for Stripe Formation in Zebrafish Exhibits Turing Instability</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.15293</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.15293v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Zebrafish have been used as a model organism in many areas of biology, including the study of pattern formation. The mean-field survival model is a coupled ODE system describing the expected evolution of chromatophores coordinating to form stripes in zebrafish. This paper presents analysis of the model focusing on parameters for the number of cells, length of distant-neighbor interactions, and rates related to birth and death of chromatophores. We derive the conditions on these parameters for a Turing bifurcation to occur and show that the model predicts patterns qualitatively similar to those in nature.
  In addition to answering questions about this particular model, this paper also serves as a case study for Turing analysis on coupled ODE systems. The qualitative behavior of such coupled ODE models may deviate significantly from continuum limit models. The ability to analyze such systems directly avoids this concern and allows for a more accurate description of the behavior at physically relevant scales.</description>

      <title>Boundary actions of Bass-Serre Trees and the applications to $C^*$-algebras</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.02039</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.02039v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we study Bass-Serre theory from the perspectives of $C^*$-algebras and topological dynamics. In particular, we investigate the actions of fundamental groups of graphs of groups on their Bass-Serre trees and the associated boundaries, through which we identify new families of $C^*$-simple groups including certain tubular groups, fundamental groups of certain graphs of groups with one vertex group acylindrically hyperbolic and outer automorphism groups $\operatorname{Out}(BS(p, q))$ of Baumslag-Solitar groups. In addition, we study $n$-dimensional Generalized Baumslag-Solitar ($\text{GBS}_n$) groups. We first recover a result by Minasyan and Valiunas on the characterization of $C^*$-simplicity for $\text{GBS}_1$ groups and identify new $C^*$-simple $\text{GBS}_n$ groups including the Leary-Minasyan group. These $C^*$-simple groups also provide new examples of highly transitive groups. Moreover, we demonstrate that natural boundary actions of these $C^*$-simple fundamental groups of graphs of groups give rise to the new purely infinite crossed product $C^*$-algebras.</description>

      <title>Optimal Control of Nonconvex Sweeping Processes with Variable Time via Finite-Difference Approximations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.00667</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.00667v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The paper is devoted to the study of a new class of optimal control problems for nonsmooth dynamical systems governed by nonconvex discontinuous differential inclusions of the sweeping type with involving variable time into optimization. We develop a novel version of the method of discrete approximations of its own qualitative and numerical importance with establishing its well-posedness and strong convergence to optimal solutions of the controlled sweeping process. Using advanced tools of variational analysis and generalized differentiation leads us to deriving new necessary conditions for optimal solutions to discrete approximation problems, which serve as suboptimality conditions for the original continuous-time controlled sweeping process. The obtained results are applied to a class of motion models of practical interest, where the established necessary conditions are used to investigate the agents' interactions and to develop an algorithm for calculating optimal solutions.</description>
