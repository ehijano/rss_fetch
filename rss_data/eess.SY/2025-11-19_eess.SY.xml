      <title>A Deep Learning Density Shaping Model Predictive Gust Load Alleviation Control of a Compliant Wing Subjected to Atmospheric Turbulence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.13745</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.13745v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study presents a novel deep learning approach aimed at enhancing stochastic Gust Load Alleviation (GLA) specifically for compliant wings. The approach incorporates the concept of smooth wing camber variation, where the camber of the wing's chord is actively adjusted during flight using a control signal to achieve the desired aerodynamic loading. The proposed method employs a deep learning-based model predictive controller designed for probability density shaping. This controller effectively solves the probability density evolution equation through a custom Physics-Informed Neural Network (PINN) and utilizes Automatic Differentiation for Model Predictive Control (MPC) optimization. Comprehensive numerical simulations were conducted on a compliant wing (CW) model, evaluating performance of the proposed approach against stochastic gust profiles. The evaluation involved stochastic aerodynamic loads generated from Band-Limited White Noise (BLWN) and Dryden gust models. The evaluation were conducted for two distinct Compliant Chord Fractions (CCF). The results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed probability density shaping model predictive control in alleviating stochastic gust load and reducing wing tip deflection.</description>

      <title>Deep reinforcement learning-based spacecraft attitude control with pointing keep-out constraint</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.13746</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.13746v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper implements deep reinforcement learning (DRL) for spacecraft reorientation control with a single pointing keep-out zone. The Soft Actor-Critic (SAC) algorithm is adopted to handle continuous state and action space. A new state representation is designed to explicitly include a compact representation of the attitude constraint zone. The reward function is formulated to achieve the control objective while enforcing the attitude constraint. A curriculum learning approach is used for the agent training. Simulation results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed DRL-based method for spacecraft pointing-constrained attitude control.</description>

      <title>Game-theoretic Decentralized Coordination for Airspace Sector Overload Mitigation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.13770</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.13770v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Decentralized air traffic management systems offer a scalable alternative to centralized control, but often assume high levels of cooperation. In practice, such assumptions frequently break down since airspace sectors operate independently and prioritize local objectives. We address the problem of sector overload in decentralized air traffic management by proposing a mechanism that models self-interested behaviors based on best response dynamics. Each sector adjusts the departure times of flights under its control to reduce its own congestion, without any shared decision making. A tunable cooperativeness factor models the degree to which each sector is willing to reduce overload in other sectors. We prove that the proposed mechanism satisfies a potential game structure, ensuring that best response dynamics converge to a pure Nash equilibrium, under a mild restriction. In addition, we identify a sufficient condition under which an overload-free solution corresponds to a global minimizer of the potential function. Numerical experiments using 24 hours of European flight data demonstrate that the proposed algorithm substantially reduces overload even with only minimal cooperation between sectors, while maintaining scalability and matching the solution quality of centralized solvers.</description>

      <title>Tri-Level Stochastic-Robust Co-Planning of Distribution Networks and Renewable Charging Stations With an Adaptive iC&amp;CG Algorithm</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.13776</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.13776v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Renewable charging stations (RCSs) that co-locate electric-vehicle (EV) charging with distributed generation (DG) can raise renewable utilization and improve distribution-network (DN) efficiency, yet their variability and the siting-dependent charging demand can overload feeders if placed poorly. This paper proposes a tri-level, two-stage stochastic-robust optimization (SRO) co-planning framework that jointly determines RCS siting and DN expansion while accounting for transportation flows and population density. The model distinguishes two uncertainty classes: (i) decision-dependent uncertainty (DDU), under which EV charging loads vary with RCS siting; and (ii) decision-independent uncertainty (DIU), under which load fluctuations and renewable-generation variability do not depend on the RCS locations or the DN topology. At the upper level, the framework selects RCS sites and DN expansions. At the middle level, EV routing and charging are dispatched given the RCS siting to produce charging loads DDU. At the lower level, DN operation minimizes annualized loss costs under the worst-case DIU, reformulated via Karush-Kuhn-Tucker (KKT) conditions. To solve the resulting problem efficiently, we develop an adaptive inexact column-and-constraint generation (A-iC&amp;CG) algorithm and prove finite-iteration convergence. Case studies on a 47-node DN coupled with a 68-hub transportation network in Shenzhen, China, show that A-iC&amp;CG outperforms benchmark algorithms and that PV-EV hybrid stations are cost-optimal, with RCS siting concentrated near substations and high-flow hubs.</description>

      <title>Quantifying Distribution Shift in Traffic Signal Control with Histogram-Based GEH Distance</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.13785</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.13785v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Traffic signal control algorithms are vulnerable to distribution shift, where performance degrades under traffic conditions that differ from those seen during design or training. This paper introduces a principled approach to quantify distribution shift by representing traffic scenarios as demand histograms and comparing them with a GEH-based distance function. The method is policy-independent, interpretable, and leverages a widely used traffic engineering statistic. We validate the approach on 20 simulated scenarios using both a NEMA actuated controller and a reinforcement learning controller (FRAP++). Results show that larger scenario distances consistently correspond to increased travel time and reduced throughput, with particularly strong explanatory power for learning-based control. Overall, this method can predict performance degradation under distribution shift better than previously published techniques. These findings highlight the utility of the proposed framework for benchmarking, training regime design, and monitoring in adaptive traffic signal control.</description>

      <title>Stochastic framework for scheduling preemptive upgrades of distribution transformers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.13846</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.13846v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Electrification of residential heating and transporta- tion has the potential to overload transformers in distribution feeders. Strategic scheduling of transformer upgrades to antici- pate increasing loads can avoid operational failures and reduce the risk of supply shortages. This work proposes a framework to prioritize transformer upgrades based on predicted loads at each meter, including heat pumps and electric vehicle chargers. The framework follows a Monte Carlo approach to forecasting, generating many possible loading instances and collecting a distribution of failure probabilities for each transformer. In each loading instance, heat pumps and EVs are added stochastically to each meter over time, based on an overall estimated growth rate and factors specific to each customer. We set heat pump load profiles by temperature and EV load profiles based on a stochastic driving model and charging pattern. The load profiles feed into network topology and transformer failure models to calculate failure probabilities.We formulate a cost optimization based on these failure probabilities to schedule transformer upgrades. We demonstrate this approach on a real-world distribution feeder in rural Vermont under low, medium, and high-electrification scenarios. We find generally less than 20% of transformers having substantial risk of failure over a 20-year simulation. Lastly, we develop an optimization routine to schedule upgrades and discuss the expected number of failures.</description>

      <title>Targeted Algorithmic Purpose-Driven Cyber Attacks in Distributed Multi-Agent Optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.13859</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.13859v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Distributed multi-agent optimization (DMAO) enables the scalable control and coordination of a large population of edge resources in complex multi-agent environments. Despite its great scalability, DMAO is prone to cyber attacks as it relies on frequent peer-to-peer communications that are vulnerable to malicious data injection and alteration. Existing cybersecurity research mainly focuses on \emph{broad-spectrum} attacks that aim to jeopardize the overall environment but fail to sustainably achieve specific or targeted objectives. This paper develops a class of novel strategic purpose-driven algorithmic attacks that are launched by participating agents and interface with DMAO to achieve self-interested attacking purposes. Theoretical foundations, in both primal and dual senses, are established for these attack vectors with and without stealthy features. Simulations on electric vehicle charging control validate the efficacy of the proposed algorithmic attacks and show the impacts of such attacks on the power distribution network.</description>

      <title>Data-Driven EV Charging Load Profile Estimation and Typical EV Daily Load Dataset Generation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.13861</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.13861v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Widespread electric vehicle (EV) adoption introduces new challenges for distribution grids due to large, localized load increases, stochastic charging behavior, and limited data availability. This paper proposes two data-driven methods to estimate residential EV charging profiles using real-world customer meter data from CenterPoint Energy serving the Houston area. The first approach applies a least-squares estimation to extract average charging rates by comparing aggregated EV and non-EV meter data, enabling a statistical method for starting and ending charge times. The second method isolates EV load from meter profiles and applies a kernel density estimation (KDE) to develop a probabilistic charging model. Both methods produce a distinct "u-shaped" daily charging profile, with most charging occurring overnight. The validated profiles offer a scalable tool for utilities to better anticipate EV-driven demand increases and support proactive grid planning.</description>

      <title>Just Few States are Enough: Randomized Sparse Feedback for Stability of Dynamical Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.13870</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.13870v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: While classical control theory assumes that the controller has access to measurements of the entire state (or output) at every time instant, this paper investigates a setting where the feedback controller can only access a randomly selected subset of the state vector at each time step. Due to the random sparsification that selects only a subset of the state components at each step, we analyze the stability of the closed-loop system in terms of Asymptotic Mean-Square Stability (AMSS), which ensures that the system state converges to zero in the mean-square sense. We consider the problem of designing both a feedback gain matrix and a measurement sparsification strategy that minimizes the number of state components required for feedback, while ensuring AMSS of the closed-loop system. Interestingly, (1) we provide conditions on the dynamics of the system under which it is possible to find a sparsification strategy, and (2) we propose a Linear Matrix Inequality (LMI) based algorithm that jointly computes a stabilizing gain matrix, and a randomized sparsification strategy that minimizes the expected number of measured state coordinates while preserving the AMSS. Our approach is then extended to the case where the sparsification probabilities vary across the state components. Based on these theoretical findings, we propose an algorithmic procedure to compute the vector of sparsification parameters, along with the corresponding feedback gain matrix. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study to investigate the stability properties of control systems that rely solely on randomly selected state measurements. Numerical simulations demonstrate that, in some settings, the system achieves comparable performance to full-state feedback while requiring measurements from only $0.3\%$ of the state coordinates.</description>

      <title>Dynamic state estimation of hybrid systems: Inverters that switch between grid-following and grid-forming control schemes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.13872</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.13872v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper develops a hybrid system modeling framework for inverters that switch between grid-following and grid-forming control schemes. In particular, such inverters are modeled as hybrid automata with guard conditions on voltage and frequency, and reset maps that maintain consistent phase, frequency, and droop references during mode transitions. The hybrid model is embedded within an extended Kalman filter to assess estimation performance under explicit mode switching. Results show that the proposed framework ensures stable, well-behaved dynamics and improves state estimation, especially near switching instants, compared with smooth continuous models.</description>

      <title>A congestion-dependent imbalance pricing mechanism for regions allowing passive balancing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.13873</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.13873v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Maintaining system balance becomes increasingly challenging as market design and grid capacity enhancement lag behind the growing share of renewables, requiring greater effort from both the transmission system operator (TSO) and the Balance Responsible Parties (BRPs). An actor can support balancing actively by bidding into reserve markets, or passively by adjusting its portfolio in line with system needs. In some countries, BRPs are incentivized to engage in passive balancing when their deviations support overall system stability. However, BRPs focus on profit maximization rather than minimizing portfolio discrepancies, which can cause simultaneous responses to price signals and create issues at the transmission-distribution interface. This research provides a two-stage stochastic model that captures BRP dynamic behavior and their impact on the grid under day-ahead and balancing market price uncertainty across three imbalance pricing mechanisms: the single, dual, and two-price. Then, a congestion-dependent imbalance pricing mechanism is proposed that maintains incentives for passive balancing while satisfying the grid constraint. A proof of concept is provided via the simulation with a part of the Dutch distribution grid. Results show that the proposed method mitigates the unexpected peak flow issue in congested areas while preserving passive balancing contributions from other BRPs in non-congested areas.</description>

      <title>L-Functions Certify Set Attractivity for Discrete-Time Uncertain Nonlinear Switched Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.13906</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.13906v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce the class of L-functions to certify the attractivity of sets for uncertain nonlinear switched systems in discrete time. The existence of an L-function associated with a set guarantees the robust local attractivity of that set under the system dynamics. We propose a constructive method for obtaining piecewise-continuous L-functions based on contractive sets for the system, and show that the existence of a robust control contractive set for the dynamics implies the existence of an appropriate L-function, and hence the robust local attractivity of the set itself. We illustrate the proposed framework through examples that elucidate the theoretical concepts, and through the case study of a nonlinear switched system modelling antimicrobial resistance, which highlights the relevance of the approach to the analysis of biological systems.</description>

      <title>Dissipativity-Based Distributed Stability Analysis for Networks with Heterogeneous Nonlinear Agents</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.13925</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.13925v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Stabilizing large networks of nonlinear agents is challenging; decomposition and distributed analysis of these networks are crucial for computational tractability and information security. Vidyasagar's Network Dissipativity Theorem enables both properties concurrently in distributed network analysis. This paper explored combining it with the alternating direction methods of multipliers to develop distributed stability analysis for networks of inhomogeneous, nonlinear agents. One algorithm enhances information security by requiring agents to share only a dissipativity characterization, not a dynamical model, for stability analysis. A second algorithm further restricts this information sharing to their clique, thereby enhancing security, and can also reduce the computational burden of stability analysis if the network allows chordal decomposition. The convergence of the proposed algorithms is demonstrated, and criteria are identified for decomposable networks facilitating chordal decomposition. The effectiveness of the proposed methods is demonstrated through numerical examples involving a swarm of linearized unmanned aerial vehicles and networks beyond linear time-invariant agents.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2511.13926v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The emergence of large-scale multi-agent systems has led to controller synthesis methods for sparse communication between agents. However, most sparse controller synthesis algorithms remain centralized, requiring information exchange and high computational costs. This underscores the need for distributed algorithms that design controllers using only local dynamics information from each agent. This paper presents a consensus-based distributed stability analysis. The proposed stability analysis algorithms leverage Vidyasagar's Network Dissipativity Theorem and the alternating direction methods of multipliers to perform general stability analysis. Numerical examples involving a 2D swarm of unmanned aerial vehicles demonstrate the convergence of the proposed algorithms.</description>

      <title>dkpy: Robust Control with Structured Uncertainty in Python</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.13927</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.13927v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Models used for control design are, to some degree, uncertain. Model uncertainty must be accounted for to ensure the robustness of the closed-loop system. $\mu$-analysis and $\mu$-synthesis methods allow for the analysis and design of controllers subject to structured uncertainties. Moreover, these tools can be applied to robust performance problems as they are fundamentally robust control problems with structured uncertainty. The contribution of this paper is dkpy, an open-source Python package for performing robust controller analysis and synthesis for systems subject to structured uncertainty. dkpy also provides tools for performing model uncertainty characterization using data from a set of perturbed systems.

      <title>Power Delivery for Cryogenic Scalable Quantum Applications: Challenges and Opportunities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.13965</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.13965v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum technologies offer unprecedented capabilities in computation and secure information transfer. Their implementation requires qubits to operate at cryogenic temperatures (CT) while control and readout electronics typically still remains at room temperature (RT). As systems scale to millions of qubits, the electronics should also operate at CT to avoid a wiring bottleneck. However, wired power transfer from RT for such electronics introduces severe challenges, including thermal load between cooling stages, Joule heating, noise coupling, and wiring scalability. This paper addresses those challenges by evaluating several candidate architectures for scalable power transfer in the dilution frige: high-voltage (HV) wired power transfer, radiative wireless transfer, non-radiative wireless transfer, and a hybrid HV and non-radiative transfer. These architectures are analyzed in terms of thermal load, power loss, heating, coupling noise, power density, scalability, reliability, and complexity. Comparative analysis demonstrates the trade-offs among these architectures, while highlighting HV non-radiative transfer as a promising candidate for scalable quantum systems.</description>

      <title>On the Impact of Voltage Unbalance on Distribution Locational Marginal Prices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.13971</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.13971v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Finding clear economic signals for distribution-network operation and expansion is increasingly important as single-phase loads and distributed energy resources escalate. These devices create phase-to-phase imbalances that manifest as voltage unbalance, a power quality issue that accelerates insulation aging in machines and increases network losses, thereby raising costs for operators and consumers. Traditional grid codes address unbalance via disparate hard limits on various indices thresholds that differ across standards, offer no dynamic economic incentive and undermine optimality. This paper proposes instead to treat voltage unbalance as a `soft limit' by adding penalty terms to grid operation costs within a three-phase optimal power flow to reflect the cost of the decrease in lifetime of assets due to being subject to voltage unbalance. This unified approach yields dynamic economic signals unbalance-aware Distribution Locational Marginal Prices (DLMP) that reflect the cost of power quality deviations. A novel mathematical decomposition of DLMP is developed, isolating the energy, loss, congestion, and unbalance components. Case studies conducted on two benchmark networks demonstrate the effectiveness and practical value of the proposed method. The results indicate that unbalance penalties reshape nodal prices, produce unexpected phase-level effects, and even allow scenarios where added load reduces unbalance and lowers costs, while providing planners and market designers with actionable insights to balance investment, operation, and power quality in modern distribution systems.</description>

      <title>Data Center Control Against Sub-Synchronous Resonance: A Data-Driven Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.14141</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.14141v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Data centers host a variety of essential services such as cloud computing and artificial intelligence. Electric grid operators, however, have limited knowledge of the reliability risks of data center interconnection due to their unique operational characteristics. An emerging concern is the sub-synchronous resonance (SSR) which refer to unexpected voltage/current oscillations at typical frequencies below 60/50 Hz. It remains unknown whether and how the interactions between data centers and the grid may trigger resonances, equipment damages, and even cascading failures. In this paper, we focus on grid-connected data centers that draw electricity from the grid through power factor correction (PFC) converters. We conduct two-tone frequency sweep to investigate the data centers' impedance characteristics, i.e. magnitude and phase angle variations over frequencies, and showcase their deep dependence on compute workloads. The impedance modeling provides a direct approach to evaluating SSR risks and enable a cooperative mechanism to alarm and avoid resonance-prone situations. Building upon the impedance, a data-driven preventive controller is then established to raise early warnings of risky operation and suggest flexible workload management according to the given grid conditions. Through case study, we demonstrate how to use impedance to understand the unexpected interactions. Data-driven impedance is validated to show decent performance in capturing the unique impedance dips and tracking the impedance variations across a range of workload scenarios. The early warning and preventive control approaches are further effective to improve the safety margins with minimal workload rescheduling. The key findings of this work will provide valuable insights for grid operators and data center managers, and support preparation for future scenarios involving large-scale data center integration.</description>

      <title>Uncertainty Discounting in Deterministic Black Box Price Predictions for Energy Arbitrage</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.14158</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.14158v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study examines the economic impact of post-hoc uncertainty discounting in predictive energy management, specifically in battery energy arbitrage. A 2.2 MWh, 1.1 MW Tesla battery, emulating operations at the University of Queensland's St. Lucia campus, is used as a test system. Traditionally, Model Predictive Control (MPC) frameworks rely on deterministic spot price forecasts from the Australian Energy Market Operator (AEMO) to optimize battery scheduling. However, these forecasts lack uncertainty awareness, making arbitrage strategies vulnerable to extreme price volatility. To address this, we propose simple heuristic uncertainty discounting methods, which require no access to the predictive model's architecture or inputs. By integrating these strategies into existing MPC frameworks, we demonstrate a more than 20% improvement in economic returns under identical operational constraints. This approach enhances decision-making in energy arbitrage while remaining practical, scalable, and independent of specific forecasting models</description>

      <title>A Receding Horizon Reinforcement Learning Framework for Campus Chiller Energy Management - A case study from an Australian University</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.14160</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.14160v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This work presents a case study of optimal energy management of a large Heating Ventilation and Cooling (HVAC) system within a university campus in Australia using Reinforcement Learning (RL). The HVAC system supplies to nine university buildings with an annual average electricity consumption of $\sim2$ GWh. Updated chiller Coefficient of Performance (COP) curves are identified, and a predictive building cooling demand model is developed using historical data from the HVAC system. Based on these inputs, a Proximal Policy Optimization based RL model is trained to optimally schedule the chillers in a receding horizon control framework with a priority reward function for constraint satisfaction. Compared to the traditional way of controlling the HVAC system based on a reactive rule-based method, the proposed controller saves up to 28\% of the electricity consumed by simply controlling the mass flow rates of the chiller banks and with minimal constraint violations.</description>

      <title>Entirely Transformerless Universal Direct-Injection Power-Flow Controller</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.14209</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.14209v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: An increasing penetration of renewable energy resources, electric vehicle chargers, and energy storage systems into low-voltage power grids causes several power management and stability problems, such as reverse power flow, (local) overload lines, and over- / under-voltage. Previous power-flow and soft-open-point solutions are bulky and expensive. They need transformers and large magnetics, some on grid frequency, others more compact at high frequency. Even suggested circuits with high-frequency transformers still struggle with cost and size. We present a compact partial power-conversion high-current full-power-flow control circuit without a single transformer. We combine silicon and silicon-carbide, each with their specific advantages for current-dense direct injection. The circuit further needs fewer semiconductors than previous concepts. The circuit links a shunt converter through a non-isolated inverter bidirectionally with low-voltage series modules that practically float with their respective phases can serve between different feeders in low-voltage power grids. We analyze the circuit mathematically and evaluate the operation in simulation and experimental results.</description>

      <title>Improved Decoupled Control of Modular Multilevel Converter under Constaint of Nearest Level Modulation via Disturbance Observer Design</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.14217</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.14217v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Nearest level modulation (NLM) is an attractive modulation method for its implementation simplicity in modular multilevel converter (MMC). However, it introduces significant voltage and current distortion when the number of submodules (SMs) per arm is small, as in medium-voltage applications. While indirect modulation offers fully decoupled control of ac-side current, dc-side current and SM capacitor energy, its performance is fundamentally reliant on accurate arm voltage synthesis, making it incompatible with the large quantization error inherent in NLM. To resolve this conflict, this paper proposes a new control strategy based on a disturbance observer (DOB). The key idea is to estimate and actively compensate for the inevitable arm voltage synthesis error induced by NLM, thereby enabling fully decoupled control of indirect-modulated MMC even under NLM operation with a small number of SMs. A key advantage is its ease of implementation, as it requires no modifications to the conventional NLM and decoupled control structure. The validity and effectiveness of the proposed method in improving current quality and decoupled SM energy control are verified through both simulation and experimental results.</description>

      <title>Secure parameter identification of ARX systems with CKKS cryptosystem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.14267</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.14267v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper focuses on the cloud-based parameter identification problem of ARX systems while protecting the system input and output. To do so, a CKKS-cryptosystem-based parameter identification algorithm is proposed. By rigorously proving that the statistical distance between the Gaussian distribution and the truncated discrete one is negligible, the algorithm has the same security level as the standard CKKS cryptosystem. By utilizing the projection mapping on the estimates, the conditions for correct encryption and decryption are given. Based on these conditions, the stochastic approximation method is further employed to achieve the almost sure and mean square convergence of the algorithm. The effectiveness is demonstrated through a numerical example.</description>

      <title>A graph-informed regret metric for optimal distributed control</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.14280</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.14280v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider the optimal control of large-scale systems using distributed controllers with a network topology that mirrors the coupling graph between subsystems. In this work, we introduce spatial regret, a graph-informed metric that measures the worst-case performance gap between a distributed controller and an oracle which is assumed to have access to additional sensor information. The oracle's graph is a user-specified augmentation of the available information graph, resulting in a benchmark policy that highlights disturbances for which additional sensor information would significantly improve performance. Minimizing spatial regret yields distributed controllers-respecting the nominal information graph-that emulate the oracle's response to disturbances that are characteristic of large-scale networks, such as localized perturbations. We show that minimizing spatial regret admits a convex reformulation as an infinite program with a finite-dimensional approximation. To scale to large networks, we derive a computable upper bound on the spatial regret metric whose minimization problem can be solved in a distributed way. Numerical experiments on power-system models demonstrate that the resulting controllers mitigate localized disturbances more effectively than controllers optimized using classical metrics.</description>

      <title>Overtourism to Equilibrium: A System Dynamics &amp; Multi-Objective Model for Sustainable Destinations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.14288</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.14288v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Overtourism poses severe challenges to popular destinations worldwide, threatening natural environments and local communities. This paper develops a decision-making model integrating system dynamics with multi-objective evolutionary algorithms (NSGA-II) to balance economic returns, environmental protection, and social satisfaction. We collect multi-source data from 2008-2024 including visitor arrivals (up to 3.1M), government revenue/expenditure (up to $10.3M), glacier retreat (220-350 ft), CO2 emissions (77K-105K tons), and social satisfaction (0.29-0.48), and establish a dynamic system with four modules: tourist behavior, government finance, environmental evolution, and social well-being.
  We optimize three objectives via NSGA-II: cumulative net revenue, final environmental index, and final social satisfaction. Experiments on Juneau show optimal solutions yield net revenue up to $1.64B with environmental index 0.93 and social satisfaction 0.86. Extending to Iceland reveals Pareto fronts spanning revenues $150M-$200M, environment indices up to 0.92, and social satisfaction above 0.80.
  Sobol and Morris sensitivity analyses indicate carbon fees and price elasticity account for over 60% of environmental outcome variance, while capacity limits explain around 90% of net revenue variability. Scenario simulations demonstrate how capacity limits and dynamic pricing on crowded attractions, combined with marketing and infrastructure investment in lesser-known sites, mitigate congestion and enhance sustainability.
  This work contributes: (i) an integrated system-dynamics and NSGA-II framework for sustainable tourism management; (ii) demonstrated portability via case studies on Juneau and Iceland; and (iii) global sensitivity analysis highlighting influential policy levers for decision makers.</description>

      <title>Multi-Timescale Model Predictive Control for Slow-Fast Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.14311</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.14311v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Model Predictive Control (MPC) has established itself as the primary methodology for constrained control, enabling autonomy across diverse applications. While model fidelity is crucial in MPC, solving the corresponding optimization problem in real time remains challenging when combining long horizons with high-fidelity models that capture both short-term dynamics and long-term behavior. Motivated by results on the Exponential Decay of Sensitivities (EDS), which imply that, under certain conditions, the influence of modeling inaccuracies decreases exponentially along the prediction horizon, this paper proposes a multi-timescale MPC scheme for fast-sampled control. Tailored to systems with both fast and slow dynamics, the proposed approach improves computational efficiency by i) switching to a reduced model that captures only the slow, dominant dynamics and ii) exponentially increasing integration step sizes to progressively reduce model detail along the horizon. We evaluate the method on three practically motivated robotic control problems in simulation and observe speed-ups of up to an order of magnitude.</description>

      <title>An adaptive extension to robust data-driven predictive control under parametric uncertainty</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.14319</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.14319v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Robust data-driven controllers typically rely on datasets from previous experiments, which embed information on the variability of the system parameters across past operational conditions. Complementarily, data collected online can contribute to improving the feedback performance relative to the current system's conditions, but are unable to account for the overall -- possibly time-varying -- system operation.
  With this in mind, we consider the problem of stabilizing a time-varying linear system, whose parameters are only known to lie within a bounded polytopic set. Taking a robust data-driven approach, we synthesize the control law by simultaneously leveraging two sets of historical state and input measures: an offline dataset -- which covers the extreme variations of the system parameters -- and an online dataset consisting of a rolling window of the latest state and input samples.
  Our approach relies on the data informativity framework: we thus relax persistent excitation requirements (i.e., the collected samples need not be sufficient for system identification), while still allowing for the design of a stabilizing controller. The state feedback law is obtained from standard Lyapunov arguments, implemented via semi-definite optimization: this also yields an upper bound on the cost-to-go for the class of systems that are consistent with the online data, while guaranteeing a decreasing cost for all systems compatible with the offline data. Numerical experiments are presented to illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed controller.</description>

      <title>Offset-free Data-Driven Predictive Control for Grid-Connected Power Converters in Weak Grid Faults</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.14337</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.14337v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Grid-connected power converters encounter significant stability challenges during weak grid faults, when conventional PI-based controllers exhibit an oscillatory response and poor fault-ride-through performance. This paper addresses this problem by replacing the conventional outer PI controllers that regulate DC-link and PCC voltages with an offset-free data-driven predictive controller. The developed algorithm leverages either pre-fault or fault-time data to construct input-output predictors, yielding offset-free control without the need for physics-based modelling. Simulation results show that pre-fault offset-free DPC doubles the critical equivalent grid impedance that can be handled and reduces the root mean squared error during faults by a factor of 40, while maintaining computation times comparable to conventional PI control. These findings demonstrate that the developed offset-free data predictive controller offers a simple, robust, and computationally efficient alternative to conventional control, significantly enhancing fault-ride-through capabilities of converters in weak grids.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2511.14358v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We address cost identification in a finite-horizon linear quadratic Gaussian game. We characterize the set of cost parameters that generate a given Nash equilibrium policy. We propose a backpropagation algorithm to identify the time-varying cost parameters. We derive a probabilistic error bound when the cost parameters are identified from finite trajectories. We test our method in numerical and driving simulations. Our algorithm identifies the cost parameters that can reproduce the Nash equilibrium policy and trajectory observations.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2511.14390v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce a general formulation for automatic differentiation through direct form filters, yielding a closed-form backpropagation that includes initial condition gradients. The result is a single expression that can represent both the filter and its gradients computation while supporting parallelism. C++/CUDA implementations in PyTorch achieve at least 1000x speedup over naive Python implementations and consistently run fastest on the GPU. For the low-order filters commonly used in practice, exact time-domain filtering with analytical gradients outperforms the frequency-domain method in terms of speed.

      <title>Ultra-Low Insertion Loss Stepped Impedance Resonator Topology for HTSC RF Front-End</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.14447</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.14447v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present the design, fabrication, and measurement of a high-temperature superconductor (HTSC) Stepped Impedance Resonator (SIR) band-pass filter for S-band applications, and its incorporation into a cryogenic receiver cascade. The 11-pole filter, implemented in YBa2Cu3O(7-x) (YBCO) thin films on sapphire, exhibits an ultra-low insertion loss (IL) of -0.1~dB, a sharp roll-off of 100~MHz, and a rejection level exceeding --80~dB. These measured results represent, to the best of our knowledge, the lowest reported IL for an S-band filter with this number of poles. When integrated with a cryogenic low-noise amplifier (LNA), system-level simulations and measurements predict a receiver noise figure (NF) of 0.34~dB at 3.39~GHz, enabling a 20% increase in radar detection range compared with conventional copper-based front ends. This work demonstrates the feasibility of practical HTSC-based RF front-ends for next-generation communication and radar systems.</description>

      <title>Agentic AI Systems in Electrical Power Systems Engineering: Current State-of-the-Art and Challenges</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.14478</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.14478v2 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Agentic AI systems have recently emerged as a critical and transformative approach in artificial intelligence, offering capabilities that extend far beyond traditional AI agents and contemporary generative AI models. This rapid evolution necessitates a clear conceptual and taxonomical understanding to differentiate this new paradigm. Our paper addresses this gap by providing a comprehensive review that establishes a precise definition and taxonomy for "agentic AI," with the aim of distinguishing it from previous AI paradigms. The concepts are gradually introduced, starting with a highlight of its diverse applications across the broader field of engineering. The paper then presents four detailed, state-of-the-art use case applications specifically within electrical engineering. These case studies demonstrate practical impact, ranging from an advanced agentic framework for streamlining complex power system studies and benchmarking to a novel system developed for survival analysis of dynamic pricing strategies in battery swapping stations. Finally, to ensure robust deployment, the paper provides detailed failure mode investigations. From these findings, we derive actionable recommendations for the design and implementation of safe, reliable, and accountable agentic AI systems, offering a critical resource for researchers and practitioners.</description>

      <title>Stratospheric Grid: A Wireless Power Transfer Enabled HAP Network with Integrated Generation-Grid-Load-Storage Functions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.14527</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.14527v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Conventional high-altitude platforms (HAPs) face challenges in achieving continuous all-weather operation due to intermittent photovoltaic power generation, limited energy storage capacity, and high mission loads resulting from functional integration. To address this fundamental issue, we propose a stratospheric energy grid in which wireless power transfer (WPT) interconnections constitute the grid layer, while HAPs operate as dynamically reconfigurable integrated generation-grid-load-storage (IGGLS) nodes that harvest, buffer, consume, and peer-to-peer transfer energy for constellation-level balancing and resilience. In this system, each HAP node can flexibly switch among energy source, load, and storage roles according to its energy status and mission requirements, enabling energy exchange and spatiotemporal optimization within the stratosphere. Through cooperative scheduling, the stratospheric grid not only enables surplus-to-deficit energy support among HAPs but also extends upward to satellites and downward to the terrestrial grid and communication infrastructure, forming a heterogeneous, WPT-mediated interconnection. As an IGGLS ecosystem, it exploits peer-to-peer energy logistics, spatiotemporal smoothing of intermittency, cross-domain backup via the terrestrial grid, and service-aware dispatch, thereby boosting overall energy utilization and operational resilience. The proposed approach is validated through case studies, and we delineate an agenda of feasible research directions.</description>

      <title>Robust Offset-free Kernelized Data-Driven Predictive Control for Nonlinear Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.14652</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.14652v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper proposes a novel Kernelized Data-Driven Predictive Control (KDPC) scheme for robust, offset-free tracking of nonlinear systems. Our computationally efficient hybrid approach separates the prediction: (1) kernel ridge regression learns the nonlinear map from past trajectories, and (2) analytical linearization of the kernel map approximates the effect of future inputs. This linearization is key, allowing the controller to be formulated as a standard Quadratic Program (QP) for efficient real-time implementation. Offset-free tracking is inherently achieved by using input increments. We provide theoretical guarantees for recursive feasibility and asymptotic stability. The algorithm is validated on a nonlinear Van der Pol oscillator, where it successfully rejects unmeasured disturbances and eliminates steady-state errors, outperforming a standard model-based controller.</description>

      <title>Towards AC Feasibility of DCOPF Dispatch</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.14725</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.14725v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: DC Optimal Power Flow (DCOPF) is widely utilized in power system operations due to its simplicity and computational efficiency. However, its lossless, reactive power-agnostic model often yields dispatches that are infeasible under practical operating scenarios such as the nonlinear AC power flow (ACPF) equations. While theoretical analysis demonstrates that DCOPF solutions are inherently AC-infeasible, their widespread industry adoption suggests substantial practical utility. This paper develops a unified DCOPF-ACPF pipeline to recover AC feasible solutions from DCOPF-based dispatches. The pipeline uses four DCOPF variants and applies AC feasibility recovery using both distributed slack allocation and PV/PQ switching. The main objective is to identify the most effective pipeline for restoring AC feasibility. Evaluation across over 10,000 dispatch scenarios on various test cases demonstrates that the structured ACPF model yields solutions that satisfy both the ACPF equations, and all engineering inequality constraints. In a 13,659 bus case, the mean absolute error and cost differences between DCOPF and ACOPF are reduced by 75% and 93%, respectively, compared to conventional single slack bus methods. Under extreme loading conditions, the pipeline reduces inequality constraint violations by a factor of 3 to 5.</description>

      <title>Contactless Monitoring of Muscle Vibrations During Exercise with a Chaos-Inspired Radar</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.13955</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.13955v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, our goal is to enable quantitative feedback on muscle fatigue during exercise to optimize exercise effectiveness while minimizing injury risk. We seek to capture fatigue by monitoring surface vibrations that muscle exertion induces. Muscle vibrations are unique as they arise from the asynchronous firing of motor units, producing surface micro-displacements that are broadband, nonlinear, and seemingly stochastic. Accurately sensing these noise-like signals requires new algorithmic strategies that can uncover their underlying structure. We present GigaFlex the first contactless system that measures muscle vibrations using mmWave radar to infer muscle force and detect fatigue. GigaFlex draws on algorithmic foundations from Chaos theory to model the deterministic patterns of muscle vibrations and extend them to the radar domain. Specifically, we design a radar processing architecture that systematically infuses principles from Chaos theory and nonlinear dynamics throughout the sensing pipeline, spanning localization, segmentation, and learning, to estimate muscle forces during static and dynamic weight-bearing exercises. Across a 23-participant study, GigaFlex estimates maximum voluntary isometric contraction (MVIC) root mean square error (RMSE) of 5.9\%, and detects one to three Repetitions in Reserve (RIR), a key quantitative muscle fatigue metric, with an AUC of 0.83 to 0.86, performing comparably to a contact-based IMU baseline. Our system can enable timely feedback that can help prevent fatigue-induced injury, and opens new opportunities for physiological sensing of complex, non-periodic biosignals.</description>

      <title>Wasserstein Distributionally Robust Nash Equilibrium Seeking with Heterogeneous Data: A Lagrangian Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.14048</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.14048v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study a class of distributionally robust games where agents are allowed to heterogeneously choose their risk aversion with respect to distributional shifts of the uncertainty. In our formulation, heterogeneous Wasserstein ball constraints on each distribution are enforced through a penalty function leveraging a Lagrangian formulation. We then formulate the distributionally robust Nash equilibrium problem and show that under certain assumptions it is equivalent to a finite-dimensional variational inequality problem with a strongly monotone mapping. We then design an approximate Nash equilibrium seeking algorithm and prove convergence of the average regret to a quantity that diminishes with the number of iterations, thus learning the desired equilibrium up to an a priori specified accuracy. Numerical simulations corroborate our theoretical findings.</description>

      <title>Intrinsic Resonance depends on Network Size of Coupled-Delayed Interacting Oscillators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.14065</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.14065v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The collective frequency that emerges from synchronized neuronal populations--the network resonance--shows a systematic relationship with brain size: whole-brain's large networks oscillate slowly, whereas finer parcellations of fixed volume exhibit faster rhythms. This resonance-size scaling has been reported in delayed neural mass models and human neuroimaging, yet the physical mechanism remained unresolved. Here we show that size-dependent resonance follows directly from propagation delays in delay-coupled phase oscillators. Starting from a Kuramoto model with heterogeneous delays, we linearize around the near-synchronous solution and obtain a closed-form approximation linking the resonance $\Omega$ to the mean delay and the effective coupling field. The analysis predicts a generic scaling law: $\Omega \approx (\sum_j c_{ij} \tau)^{-1}$, so resonance is delay-limited and therefore depends systematically on geometric size or parcellation density. We evaluate four growth scenarios--expanding geometry, fixed-volume parcellation, constant geometry, and an unphysical reference case--and show that only geometry-consistent scaling satisfies the analytical prediction. Numerical simulations with heterogeneous delays validate the law and quantify its error as a function of delay dispersion. These results identify a minimal physical mechanism for size-dependent cortical resonance and provide an analytical framework that unifies numeric simulation outputs.</description>

      <title>Collaborative QA using Interacting LLMs. Impact of Network Structure, Node Capability and Distributed Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.14098</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.14098v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we model and analyze how a network of interacting LLMs performs collaborative question-answering (CQA) in order to estimate a ground truth given a distributed set of documents. This problem is interesting because LLMs often hallucinate when direct evidence to answer a question is lacking, and these effects become more pronounced in a network of interacting LLMs. The hallucination spreads, causing previously accurate LLMs to hallucinate. We study interacting LLMs and their hallucination by combining novel ideas of mean-field dynamics (MFD) from network science and the randomized utility model from economics to construct a useful generative model. We model the LLM with a latent state that indicates if it is truthful or not with respect to the ground truth, and extend a tractable analytical model considering an MFD to model the diffusion of information in a directed network of LLMs. To specify the probabilities that govern the dynamics of the MFD, we propose a randomized utility model. For a network of LLMs, where each LLM has two possible latent states, we posit sufficient conditions for the existence and uniqueness of a fixed point and analyze the behavior of the fixed point in terms of the incentive (e.g., test-time compute) given to individual LLMs. We experimentally study and analyze the behavior of a network of $100$ open-source LLMs with respect to data heterogeneity, node capability, network structure, and sensitivity to framing on multiple semi-synthetic datasets.</description>

      <title>Two-dimensional Spatial Optimization for Electric Motorcycle Powertrain Elements using Mixed-integer Programming</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.14236</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.14236v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This study presents a framework for optimizing the two-dimensional (2D) placement of electric motorcycle powertrain elements, accounting for the position, the orientation and geometric irregularities. Specifically, we construct a 2D placement model at the component level in which we include near-continuous rotation of components and allow for irregular subsystem geometries to make optimal use of the limited design space. Second, we introduce linearization techniques for the trigonometric constraints and formulate the placement problem as a mixed-integer quadratic program (MIQP). Finally, we demonstrate our framework on two electric motorcycle powertrain topologies and study the influence of the geometry complexity on the placement solutions. The results show that gradually increasing complexity leads to more manageable computation times and higher the complexity solution improves handling performance by 2.5% compared to the benchmark placement found in existing electric motorcycles.</description>

      <title>Concave Comparison Functions for Accelerating Constrained Lyapunov Decay</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.14626</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.14626v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: What limits how fast a Lyapunov function can decay under input bounds? We address this question by showing how the shape of Lyapunov comparison functions governs guaranteed decay for control affine systems. Using a windowed nominal exponential rate together with the endpoint cap induced by actuator limits, we establish a strict ordering: concave comparison functions strictly outperform linear and convex ones, and strict concavity is necessary to improve the best achievable global exponential rate under a fixed endpoint cap. We derive a computable lower bound on the required actuation level for a target nominal rate and show that only concave shaping can reduce this level under the endpoint cap. We then establish a feasibility-preserving acceleration result: whenever a margin exists on a sublevel set, a feasible linear comparison can be replaced by a concave one that preserves feasibility while strictly increasing the guaranteed windowed decay. Finally, we give a tunable rational concave factor with controlled slope that yields a constructive design and integrates with CLF QP, as illustrated by examples.</description>

      <title>A Sequential Operator-Splitting Framework for Exploration of Nonconvex Trajectory Optimization Solution Spaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.14752</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.14752v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Trajectory optimization methods provide an efficient and reliable means of computing feasible trajectories in nonconvex solution spaces. However, a well-known limitation of these algorithms is that they are inherently local in nature, and typically converge to a solution in the neighborhood of their initial guess. This paper presents a sequential operator-splitting framework, based on the alternating direction method of multipliers (ADMM), aimed at promoting exploration within the sequential convex programming (SCP) framework. In particular, diverse initial solutions are modeled as agents within the consensus ADMM framework. Driving these agents toward consensus facilitates exploration of the nonconvex optimization landscape. Numerical simulations demonstrate that the proposed method consistently yields equivalent or lower-cost solutions compared to the standard SCP approach, with the same number of or fewer agents.</description>

      <title>Robust Verification of Controllers under State Uncertainty via Hamilton-Jacobi Reachability Analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.14755</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.14755v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: As perception-based controllers for autonomous systems become increasingly popular in the real world, it is important that we can formally verify their safety and performance despite perceptual uncertainty. Unfortunately, the verification of such systems remains challenging, largely due to the complexity of the controllers, which are often nonlinear, nonconvex, learning-based, and/or black-box. Prior works propose verification algorithms that are based on approximate reachability methods, but they often restrict the class of controllers and systems that can be handled or result in overly conservative analyses. Hamilton-Jacobi (HJ) reachability analysis is a popular formal verification tool for general nonlinear systems that can compute optimal reachable sets under worst-case system uncertainties; however, its application to perception-based systems is currently underexplored. In this work, we propose RoVer-CoRe, a framework for the Robust Verification of Controllers via HJ Reachability. To the best of our knowledge, RoVer-CoRe is the first HJ reachability-based framework for the verification of perception-based systems under perceptual uncertainty. Our key insight is to concatenate the system controller, observation function, and the state estimation modules to obtain an equivalent closed-loop system that is readily compatible with existing reachability frameworks. Within RoVer-CoRe, we propose novel methods for formal safety verification and robust controller design. We demonstrate the efficacy of the framework in case studies involving aircraft taxiing and NN-based rover navigation. Code is available at the link in the footnote.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.15984v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this letter, we propose a control scheme for rigid bodies designed to optimise transient behaviors. The search space for the optimal control input is parameterized to yield a passive, specifically lossless, nonlinear feedback controller. As a result, it can be combined with other stabilizing controllers without compromising the stability of the closed-loop system. The controller commands torques generating fictitious gyroscopic effects characteristics of 3D rotational rigid body motions, and as such does not inject nor extract kinetic energy from the system. We validate the controller in simulation using a model predictive control (MPC) scheme, successfully combining stability and performance in a stabilization task with obstacle avoidance constraints.</description>

      <title>Trajectory Optimization for Unknown Maneuvering Target Tracking with Bearing-only Measurements</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.18669</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.18669v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper studies trajectory optimization of an autonomous underwater vehicle (AUV) to track an unknown maneuvering target both in the 2D and 3D space. Due to the restrictions on sensing capabilities in the underwater scenario, the AUV is limited to collecting only bearing measurements to the target. A framework called {\it GP-based Bearing-only Tracking (GBT)} is proposed with integration of online learning and planning. First, a Gaussian process learning method is proposed for the AUV to handle unknown target motion, wherein pseudo linear transformation of bearing measurements is introduced to address nonlinearity of bearings. A probabilistic bearing-data-dependent bound on tracking error is then rigorously established. Based on it, optimal desired bearings that can reduce tracking uncertainty are obtained analytically. Finally, the trajectory optimization problem is formulated and transformed into an easily solved one with parametric transformation. Numerical examples and comparison with existing methods verify the feasibility and superior performance of our proposed framework.</description>

      <title>Inertia-aware Unit Commitment and Remuneration Methods for Decarbonized Power System</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.10820</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.10820v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: To maintain frequency stability in decarbonized power systems, inertia services from synchronous generators (SGs) and inverter-based resources must be procured. However, designing an inertia-aware system operation poses significant challenges in considering the variability and uncertainty of renewable energy sources (RES) and adopting a remuneration method for inertia provision due to SG commitment variables. To address this research gap, we renovate the inertia-aware chance constraints unit commitment model by incorporating time-coupling constraints for SGs and joint chance constraints for RES uncertainty. We investigate remuneration methods for inertia provision, including uplift, marginal pricing (MP), approximated convex hull pricing (aCHP), and average incremental cost pricing (AIP), applying these to the renovated model. Numerical experiments show that the model enhances frequency stability during a contingency. Among the remuneration methods, only aCHP guarantees revenue adequacy without requiring uplift while maximizing economic welfare. However, the MP requires the highest level of uplift to adequately compensate generation costs, as the price function fails to account for inertia provision.</description>

      <title>Instantaneous Core Loss -- Cycle-by-cycle Modeling of Power Magnetics in PWM DC-AC Converters</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.13555</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.13555v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Nowadays, PWM excitation is one of the most common waveforms seen by magnetic components in power electronic converters. Core loss modelling approaches such as improved Generalized Steinmetz equation (iGSE) or the loss map based on composite waveform hypothesis (CWH) process the PWM excitation piecewisely, which is proven to be effective for DC DC converters. As the additional challenge in PWM DC AC converters, the fundamental-frequency sinewave component induces the "major loop loss" on top of the piecewise high-frequency segments, which however cannot be modelled on a switching cycle basis by any existing methods. To address this gap, this paper proposes a novel fundamental concept, instantaneous core loss, which is the time-domain core loss observed experimentally for the first time in history. Extending the reactive voltage cancellation concept, this work presents a method to measure the instantaneous core loss, which only contains real power loss, as a function of time. Based on measurements in evaluated soft magnetic components, it was discovered that the discharging stage exhibits higher core loss than the charging stage. A modelling approach is then proposed to break down the major loop core loss, typically an average value in the literature, into the time domain to enable cycle-by-cycle modelling of core losses in PWM converters. This work enhances the fundamental understanding of the core loss process by moving from the average model to the time-domain model.</description>

Abstract: In this paper we investigate identifiability and maximum likelihood estimation for direct system identification of networks of dynamical systems. We provide necessary and sufficient conditions for network identifiability in terms of Gr\"obner bases. We show that the maximum likelihood approach is both consistent and efficient, which is in contrast to existing prediction error approaches. Moreover, our approach has wider applicability, i.e., it is applicable whenever network identifiability holds. Finally, we show that we can formulate the maximum likelihood problem without the use of a predictor, which is the key to numerically being able to solve it efficiently.</description>

      <title>Identifying the Smallest Adversarial Load Perturbation that Renders DC-OPF Infeasible</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.07850</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.07850v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: What is the globally smallest load perturbation that renders DC-OPF infeasible? Reliably identifying such "adversarial attack" perturbations has useful applications in a variety of emerging grid-related contexts, including machine learning performance verification, cybersecurity, and operational robustness of power systems dominated by stochastic renewable energy resources. In this paper, we formulate the inherently nonconvex adversarial attack problem by applying a parameterized version of Farkas' lemma to a perturbed set of DC-OPF equations. Since the resulting formulation is very hard to globally optimize, we also propose a parameterized generation control policy which, when applied to the primal DC-OPF problem, provides solvability guarantees. Together, these nonconvex problems provide guaranteed upper and lower bounds on adversarial attack size; by combining them into a single optimization problem, we can efficiently "squeeze" these bounds towards a common global solution. We apply these methods on a range of small- to medium-sized test cases from PGLib, benchmarking our results against the best adversarial attack lower bounds provided by Gurobi 12.0's spatial Branch and Bound solver.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2509.13166v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study data-driven least squares (LS) problems with semidefinite (SD) constraints and derive finite-sample guarantees on the spectrum of their optimal solutions when these constraints are relaxed. In particular, we provide a high confidence bound allowing one to solve a simpler program in place of the full SDLS problem, while ensuring that the eigenvalues of the resulting solution are $\varepsilon$-close of those enforced by the SD constraints. The developed certificate, which consistently shrinks as the number of data increases, turns out to be easy-to-compute, distribution-free, and only requires independent and identically distributed samples. Moreover, when the SDLS is used to learn an unknown quadratic function, we establish bounds on the error between a gradient descent iterate minimizing the surrogate cost obtained with no SD constraints and the true minimizer.</description>

      <title>Strategic Data Center Load Shifting: Implications for Market Efficiency and Transmission Value</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.20805</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.20805v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Data center electricity use may reach 12% of U.S. demand by 2030, alongside growing ability to shift workloads geographically in response to prices or carbon signals. We examine the system-level implications of such strategic flexibility using a bilevel two-zone model that couples economic dispatch with consumer cost minimization. Two market failures emerge. First, discontinuous price changes at generator capacity limits can induce flexible consumers to shift load in socially inefficient directions-for example, toward a higher-cost region to trigger a price drop elsewhere. Second, by positioning near capacity boundaries, consumers can eliminate the marginal value of transmission expansion: although shadow prices suggest additional capacity is valuable, consumers reoptimize to offset resulting flow changes, leaving dispatch and costs unchanged. We derive conditions under which these effects arise and show that conventional price signals and planning methods can misrepresent system value in the presence of large flexible loads.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2510.26712v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper presents a time-optimal Model Predictive Control (MPC) scheme for linear discrete-time systems subject to multiplicative uncertainties represented by interval matrices. To render the uncertainty propagation computationally tractable, the set-valued error system dynamics are approximated using a matrix-zonotope-based bounding operator. Recursive feasibility and finite-time convergence are ensured through an adaptive terminal constraint mechanism. A key advantage of the proposed approach is that all the necessary bounding sets can be computed offline, substantially reducing the online computational burden. The effectiveness of the method is illustrated via a numerical case study on an orbital rendezvous maneuver between two satellites.</description>

      <title>Kalman-Bucy Filtering with Randomized Sensing: Fundamental Limits and Sensor Network Design for Field Estimation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2511.03740v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Stability analysis of the Kalman filter under randomly lost measurements has been widely studied. We revisit this problem in a general continuous-time framework, where both the measurement matrix and noise covariance evolve as random processes, capturing variability in sensing locations. Within this setting, we derive a closed-form upper bound on the expected estimation covariance for continuous-time Kalman filtering. We then apply this framework to spatiotemporal field estimation, where the field is modeled as a Gaussian process observed by randomly located, noisy sensors. Using clarity, introduced in our earlier work as a rescaled form of the differential entropy of a random variable, we establish a grid-independent lower bound on the spatially averaged expected clarity. This result exposes fundamental performance limits through a composite sensing parameter that jointly captures the effects of the number of sensors, noise level, and measurement frequency. Simulations confirm that the proposed bound is tight for the discrete-time Kalman filter, approaching it as the measurement rate decreases, while avoiding the recursive computations required in the discrete-time formulation. Most importantly, the derived limits provide principled and efficient guidelines for sensor network design problem prior to deployment.</description>

      <title>Dissipativity-Based Synthesis of Distributed Control and Communication Topology Co-Design for AC Microgrids</title>

      <description>arXiv:2511.06576v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper presents a novel dissipativity-based framework for co-designing distributed controllers and communication topologies in AC microgrids (MGs). Unlike existing methods that treat control synthesis and topology design separately, we propose a unified approach that simultaneously optimizes both aspects to achieve voltage and frequency regulation and proportional power sharing among distributed generators (DGs). We formulate the closed-loop AC MG as a networked system where DGs, distribution lines, and loads are interconnected subsystems characterized by their dissipative properties. Each DG employs a hierarchical architecture combining local controllers for voltage regulation and distributed controllers for droop-free power sharing through normalized power consensus. By leveraging dissipativity theory, we establish necessary and sufficient conditions for subsystem passivity and cast the co-design problem as a convex linear matrix inequality (LMI) optimization, enabling efficient computation and guaranteed stability. Our framework systematically synthesizes sparse communication topologies while handling the coupled dq-frame dynamics and dual power flow objectives inherent to AC MGs. Simulation results on a representative AC MG demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach in achieving accurate voltage regulation, frequency synchronization, and proportional power sharing.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2511.09661v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Model Predictive Control (MPC) offers rigorous safety and performance guarantees but is computationally intensive. Approximate MPC (AMPC) aims to circumvent this drawback by learning a computationally cheaper surrogate policy. Common approaches focus on imitation learning (IL) via behavioral cloning (BC), minimizing a mean-squared-error loss on a collection of state-input pairs. However, BC fundamentally fails to provide accurate approximations when MPC solutions are set-valued due to non-convex constraints or local minima. We propose a two-stage IL procedure to accurately approximate nonlinear, potentially set-valued MPC policies. The method integrates an approximation of the MPC's optimal value function into a one-step look-ahead loss function, and thereby embeds the MPC's constraint and performance objectives into the IL objective. This is achieved by adopting a stabilizing soft constrained MPC formulation, which reflects constraint violations in the optimal value function by combining a constraint tightening with slack penalties. We prove statistical consistency for policies that exactly minimize our IL objective, implying convergence to a safe and stabilizing control law, and establish input-to-state stability guarantees for approximate minimizers. Simulations demonstrate improved performance compared to BC.</description>

      <title>Artifacts Are Not Noise: Embodied Resonance and the 70% Signal Loss in Conventional EEG</title>

      <description>arXiv:2511.10596v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Current AI systems excel at pattern recognition but fail at causal reasoning. We argue this is not an engineering limitation but reveals something fundamental about the nature of understanding itself. We propose that causal cognition requires a specific physical architecture: stochastic, coupled oscillators with whole-system coordination. To test this, we analyzed high-density EEG (64 channels, 10 subjects, 500 plus trials) from a P300 target recognition task. We computed the Kuramoto Order Parameter (R) to measure global phase synchronization and compared it to standard voltage (ERP) and coherence (ITC) metrics. Four findings establish the framework. Phase and voltage are globally independent (r of 0.048) yet strongly trial-coupled (r of 0.590), proving R captures hidden cognitive structure. Voltage precedes phase by 293 ms, revealing sequential computation. Frequency decomposition shows Theta (169 ms), Alpha (286 ms), and Beta (777 ms) cascade. Our metric is distinct from standard ITC (r of 0.155). Then we tested the standard assumption. Conventional artifact rejection removes eye movements, muscle activity, and autonomic signals before analysis. The standard model assumes cognition is neural activity plus noise. We ran the identical analysis with and without rejection. Removing artifacts reduced the trial-level correlation threefold (from 0.590 to 0.195). Target discrimination reversed sign (from positive 0.6 percent to negative 0.4 percent). What we discard as noise is 70 percent of the signal. This falsifies the standard model. Cognition is not isolated neural computation. It is whole-body phase synchronization spanning neural, muscular, and autonomic systems. For AI, the implications are direct: embodied sensorimotor integration is not optional. It is the substrate that makes understanding possible.</description>

      <title>Physics-Informed Neural Networks for Nonlinear Output Regulation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2511.13595v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This work addresses the full-information output regulation problem for nonlinear systems, assuming the states of both the plant and the exosystem are known. In this setting, perfect tracking or rejection is achieved by constructing a zero-regulation-error manifold $\pi(w)$ and a feedforward input $c(w)$ that render such manifold invariant. The pair $(\pi(w), c(w))$ is characterized by the regulator equations, i.e., a system of PDEs with an algebraic constraint. We focus on accurately solving the regulator equations introducing a physics-informed neural network (PINN) approach that directly approximates $\pi(w)$ and $c(w)$ by minimizing the residuals under boundary and feasibility conditions, without requiring precomputed trajectories or labeled data. The learned operator maps exosystem states to steady state plant states and inputs, enables real-time inference and, critically, generalizes across families of the exosystem with varying initial conditions and parameters. The framework is validated on a regulation task that synchronizes a helicopter's vertical dynamics with a harmonically oscillating platform. The resulting PINN-based solver reconstructs the zero-error manifold with high fidelity and sustains regulation performance under exosystem variations, highlighting the potential of learning-enabled solvers for nonlinear output regulation. The proposed approach is broadly applicable to nonlinear systems that admit a solution to the output regulation problem.</description>

      <title>Convex Reformulation of LMI-Based Distributed Controller Design with a Class of Non-Block-Diagonal Lyapunov Functions</title>

Abstract: This study addresses a distributed state feedback controller design problem for continuous-time linear time-invariant systems by means of linear matrix inequalities (LMIs). As structural constraints on a control gain result in non-convexity in general, the block-diagonal relaxation of Lyapunov functions has been prevalent despite its conservatism. In this work, we target a class of non-block-diagonal Lyapunov functions with the same sparsity pattern as distributed controllers. By leveraging a block-diagonal factorization of sparse matrices and Finsler's lemma, we first present a nonlinear matrix inequality for stabilizing distributed controllers with such Lyapunov functions, which boils down to a necessary and sufficient condition for such controllers if the sparsity pattern is chordal. As its relaxation, we derive novel LMIs, one of which strictly covers the conventional relaxation, and then provide analogous results for $H_\infty$ control. Lastly, numerical examples underscore the efficacy of our results.</description>

      <title>Joint Communication and Over-the-Air Computation for Semi-Federated Learning Towards Scalable AI in Computing-Heterogeneous IoT Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.17453</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.17453v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The proliferation of Internet of Things (IoT) systems demands scalable artificial intelligence (AI) solutions that can operate in computing-heterogeneous environments with diverse hardware capabilities and non-independent and identically distributed data. This paper proposes a semi-federated learning (SemiFL) framework that integrates centralized learning (CL) and federated learning (FL) to enable efficient model training across heterogeneous IoT devices. In SemiFL, only devices with sufficient computational resources are designated for local model training (referred to as FL users), while the remaining devices transmit raw data to a base station (BS) for remote computation (referred to as CL users). This collaborative computing framework enables all IoT devices to participate in global model training, regardless of their computational capabilities and data distributions. Furthermore, to alleviate radio resource scarcity of SemiFL, we propose a joint communication and over-the-air computation design that unifies wireless transmission and model aggregation. This approach reduces latency and enhances spectrum efficiency by allowing simultaneous communication and computation over the air. Furthermore, we design a transceiver architecture that integrates receive beamforming and successive interference cancellation to mitigate multi-user interference, ensuring reliable aggregation at the BS. Subsequently, two scenarios are examined to assess the efficacy of SemiFL within IoT systems. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed next-generation multiple access (NGMA)-based SemiFL outperforms the fixed beamforming-based FL by 8% and the AirComp-based FL by 6.4%, demonstrating its superior learning efficiency and convergence performance.</description>

      <title>Communication-Efficient Distributed Online Nonconvex Optimization with Time-Varying Constraints</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.08592</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.08592v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper considers distributed online nonconvex optimization with time-varying inequality constraints over a network of agents, where the nonconvex local loss and convex local constraint functions can vary arbitrarily across iterations. For a time-varying directed graph, we propose two distributed bandit online primal--dual algorithm with compressed communication to efficiently utilize communication resources in the one-point and two-point bandit feedback settings, respectively. To measure the performance of the proposed algorithms, we use a network regret metric grounded in the first-order optimality condition associated with the variational inequality. We show that the compressed algorithms establish sublinear network regret and cumulative constraint violation bounds. Moreover, the network cumulative constraint violation bounds are reduced under Slater's condition. Finally, a simulation example is presented to validate the theoretical results.</description>

      <title>Long Duration Inspection of GNSS-Denied Environments with a Tethered UAV-UGV Marsupial System</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.23457</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.23457v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) have become essential tools in inspection and emergency response operations due to their high maneuverability and ability to access hard-to-reach areas. However, their limited battery life significantly restricts their use in long-duration missions. This paper presents a tethered marsupial robotic system composed of a UAV and an Unmanned Ground Vehicle (UGV), specifically designed for autonomous, long-duration inspection tasks in Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS)-denied environments. The system extends the UAV's operational time by supplying power through a tether connected to high-capacity battery packs carried by the UGV. Our work details the hardware architecture based on off-the-shelf components to ensure replicability and describes our full-stack software framework used by the system, which is composed of open-source components and built upon the Robot Operating System (ROS). The proposed software architecture enables precise localization using a Direct LiDAR Localization (DLL) method and ensures safe path planning and coordinated trajectory tracking for the integrated UGV-tether-UAV system. We validate the system through three sets of field experiments involving (i) three manual flight endurance tests to estimate the operational duration, (ii) three experiments for validating the localization and the trajectory tracking systems, and (iii) three executions of an inspection mission to demonstrate autonomous inspection capabilities. The results of the experiments confirm the robustness and autonomy of the system in GNSS-denied environments. Finally, all experimental data have been made publicly available to support reproducibility and to serve as a common open dataset for benchmarking.</description>

      <title>Time-causal and time-recursive wavelets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.05834</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.05834v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: When to apply wavelet analysis to real-time temporal signals, where the future cannot be accessed, it is essential to base all the steps in the signal processing pipeline on computational mechanisms that are truly time-causal.
  This paper describes how a time-causal wavelet analysis can be performed based on concepts developed in the area of temporal scale-space theory, originating from a complete classification of temporal smoothing kernels that guarantee non-creation of new structures from finer to coarser temporal scale levels. By necessity, convolution with truncated exponential kernels in cascade constitutes the only permissable class of kernels, as well as their temporal derivatives as a natural complement to fulfil the admissibility conditions of wavelet representations. For a particular way of choosing the time constants in the resulting infinite convolution of truncated exponential kernels, to ensure temporal scale covariance and thus self-similarity over temporal scales, we describe how mother wavelets can be chosen as temporal derivatives of the resulting time-causal limit kernel.
  By developing connections between wavelet theory and scale-space theory, we characterize and quantify how the continuous scaling properties transfer to the discrete implementation, demonstrating how the proposed time-causal wavelet representation can reflect the duration of locally dominant temporal structures in the input signals.
  We propose that this notion of time-causal wavelet analysis could be a valuable tool for signal processing tasks, where streams of signals are to be processed in real time, specifically for signals that may contain local variations over a rich span of temporal scales, or more generally for analysing physical or biophysical temporal phenomena, where a fully time-causal analysis is called for to be physically realistic.</description>

      <title>Combining High Level Scheduling and Low Level Control to Manage Fleets of Mobile Robots</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.23129</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.23129v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The deployment of mobile robots for material handling in industrial environments requires scalable coordination of large fleets in dynamic settings. This paper presents a two-layer framework that combines high-level scheduling with low-level control. Tasks are assigned and scheduled using the compositional algorithm ComSat, which generates time-parameterized routes for each robot. These schedules are then used by a distributed Model Predictive Control (MPC) system in real time to compute local reference trajectories, accounting for static and dynamic obstacles. The approach ensures safe, collision-free operation, and supports rapid rescheduling in response to disruptions such as robot failures or environmental changes. We evaluate the method in simulated 2D environments with varying road capacities and traffic conditions, demonstrating high task completion rates and robust behavior even under congestion. The modular structure of the framework allows for computational tractability and flexibility, making it suitable for deployment in complex, real-world industrial scenarios.</description>

      <title>On topological properties of closed attractors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.10429</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.10429v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The notion of an attractor has various definitions in the theory of dynamical systems. Under compactness assumptions, several of those definitions coincide and the theory is rather complete. However, without compactness, the picture becomes blurry. To improve our understanding, we characterize in this work when a closed, not necessarily compact, asymptotically stable attractor on a locally compact metric space is homotopy equivalent to its domain of attraction. This enables a further structural study of the corresponding feedback stabilization problem.</description>
