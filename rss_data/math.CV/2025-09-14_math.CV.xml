      <title>The difference analogues and delay-differential analogues of the Br\"uck conjecture and their application</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.10056</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.10056v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let \( f \) be a transcendental entire function with hyper-order strictly less than 1. Under certain conditions, the difference analogues and delay-differential analogues of the Br\"uck conjecture are proved respectively by using Nevanlinna theory. As applications of these two results, the relationship between $f$ and $\Delta^n f$ (or between $f'$ and $f(z + 1)$) is established provided that $f$ and $\Delta^n f$ (or $f'$ and $f(z + 1)$) share a finite set. Moreover, some examples are provided to illustrate these results.</description>

      <title>Meromorphic solution of a certain type of algebraic differential equation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.10113</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.10113v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the paper, we use the idea of normal family to find out the possible solution of the following special case of algebraic differential equation \[P_k\big(z,f,f^{(1)},\ldots, f^{(k)}\big)=f^{(1)}(f-\mathscr{L}_k(f))-\varphi (f-a)(f-b)=0,\] where $\mathscr{L}_k(f)=\sideset{}{_{i=0}^k}{\sum} a_i f^{(i)}$ and $\varphi$ is an entire function, $a_i\in\mathbb{C}\;(i=0,1,\ldots, k)$ such that $a_k=1$ and $a, b\in\mathbb{C}$ such that $a\neq b$. The obtained results improve and generalise the results of Li and Yang \cite{LY1} and Xu et al. \cite{XMD} in a large scale.</description>

      <title>Gromov hyperbolicity III: improved geometric characterization in Euclidean spaces and beyond</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.10403</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.10403v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This is the third article of a series of our recent works, addressing an open question of Bonk-Heinonen-Koskela [3], to study the relationship between (inner) uniformality and Gromov hyperbolicity in infinite dimensional spaces. Our main focus of this paper is to establish improved geometric characterization of Gromov hyperbolicity.
  More precisely, we develop an elementary measure-independent approach to establish the geometric characterization of Gromov hyperbolicity for general proper Euclidean subdomains, which addresses a conjecture of Bonk-Heinonen-Koskela [Asterisque 2001] for unbounded Euclidean subdomains. Our main results not only improve the corresponding result of Balogh-Buckley [Invent. Math. 2003], but also clean up the relationship between the two geometric conditions, ball separation condition and Gehring-Hayman inequality, that used to characterize Gromov hyperbolicity. We also provide a negative answer to an open problem of Balogh-Buckley by constructing an Euclidean domain with ball separation property but fails to satisfy the Gehring-Hayman inequality. Furthermore, we prove that ball separation condition, together with an LLC-2 condition, implies inner uniformality and thus the Gehring-Hayman inequality.
  As a consequence of our new approach, we are able to prove such a geometric characterization of Gromov hyperbolicity in the fairly general setting of metric spaces (without measures), which substantially improves the main result of Koskela-Lammi-Manojlovi\'c [Ann. Sci. \'Ec. Norm. Sup\'er. 2014]. In particular, we not only provide a new purely metric proof of the main reuslt of Balogh-Buckley and Koskela-Lammi-Manojlovi\'c, but also derive explicit dependence of various involved constants, which improves all the previous known results.</description>

      <title>Removable sets for pseudoconvexity for weakly smooth boundaries</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.20817</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.20817v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We show that for bounded domains in $\mathbb C^n$ with $\mathcal C^{1,1}$ smooth boundary, if there is a closed set $F$ of $2n-1$-Lebesgue measure $0$ such that $\partial \Omega \setminus F$ is $\mathcal C^{2}$-smooth and locally pseudoconvex at every point, then $\Omega$ is globally pseudoconvex. Unlike in the globally $\mathcal C^{2}$-smooth case, the condition ``$F$ of (relative) empty interior'' is not enough to obtain such a result. We also give some results under peak-set type hypotheses, which in particular provide a new proof of an old result of Grauert and Remmert about removable sets for pseudoconvexity under minimal hypotheses of boundary regularity.</description>

      <title>Quadrature Domains and the Faber Transform</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.03777</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.03777v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present a framework for reconstructing any simply connected, bounded or unbounded, quadrature domain $\Omega$ from its quadrature function $h$. Using the Faber transform, we derive formulae directly relating $h$ to the Riemann map for $\Omega$. Through this approach, we obtain a complete classification of one point quadrature domains with complex charge. We proceed to develop a theory of weighted quadrature domains with respect to weights of the form $\rho_a(w)=|w|^{2(a-1)}$ when $a &gt; 0$ ("power-weighted" quadrature domains) and the limiting case of when $a=0$ ("log-weighted" quadrature domains). Furthermore, we obtain Faber transform formulae for reconstructing weighted quadrature domains from their respective quadrature functions. Several examples are presented throughout to illustrate this approach both in the simply connected setting and in the presence of rotational symmetry.</description>

      <title>Periods of join algebraic cycles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.17222</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.17222v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We show, for all $n\ge 2$ even and $d\ge 2+\frac{4}{n}$, that the moduli of smooth degree $d$ hypersurfaces of $\mathbb{P}^{n+1}$ contains infinitely many different Hodge loci whose Zariski tangent space has the same codimension as the Hodge locus of linear cycles. We construct the Hodge cycles determining those Hodge loci as joins of $0$-dimensional cycles inside hypersurfaces of $\mathbb{P}^1$ with all their closed points defined over $\mathbb{Q}$. In order to analyze the cycle classes of these algebraic cycles, we establish a general formula for the cycle class of the join of any two algebraic cycles inside smooth hypersurfaces, expressed in terms of their periods. Furthermore, we prove that an algebraic cycle is a join of algebraic cycles, if and only if, its associated Artin Gorenstein algebra is the tensor product of the Artin Gorenstein algebras associated to each generating cycle.</description>
