      <title>Hadronic light-by-light scattering contribution to 1S-2S transition in muonium</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.09727</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.09727v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study hadronic light-by-light scattering contribution to the energy interval (1S-2S) in muonium. Various amplitudes of interaction of a muon and an electron are constructed, in which the effect of hadronic scattering of light-by-light is determined using the transition form factor of two photons into a meson. Their contributions to the particle interaction operator in the case of S-states are obtained in integral form, and to the energy spectrum in numerical form. The contributions of pseudoscalar, scalar, axial vector mesons are taken into account.</description>

      <title>Thermo-Coupled Early Dark Energy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.09747</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.09747v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Early dark energy solutions to the Hubble tension introduce an additional scalar field which is frozen at early times but becomes dynamical around matter-radiation equality. In order to alleviate the tension, the scalar's share of the total energy density must rapidly shrink from $\sim 10\%$ at the onset of matter domination to $\ll 1\%$ by recombination. This typically requires a steep potential that is imposed $\textit{ad hoc}$ rather than emerging from a concrete particle physics model. Here, we point out an alternative possibility: a homogeneous scalar field coupled quadratically to a cosmological background of light thermal relics (such as the Standard Model neutrino) will acquire an effective potential which can reproduce the dynamics necessary to alleviate the tension. We identify the relevant parameter space for this "thermo-coupled" scenario and study its unique phenomenology at the background level, including the back-reaction on the neutrino mass. Follow-up numerical work is necessary to determine the constraints placed on the model by early-time measurements.</description>

      <title>Imprints of Early Universe Cosmology on Gravitational Waves</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.09757</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.09757v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We explore the potential of gravitational waves (GWs) to probe the pre-BBN era of the early universe, focusing on the effects of energy injection. Specifically, we examine a hidden sector alongside the Standard Model that undergoes a strong first-order phase transition (FOPT), producing a GW signal. Once the phase transition has completed, energy injection initiates reheating in the hidden sector, which positions the hidden sector field so that additional phase transitions can occur. This can result in a total of three distinct phase transitions with a unique three-peak GW spectrum. Among these transitions, the first and third are of the standard type, while the intermediate second transition is inverted, moving from a broken to an unbroken phase. Using polynomial potentials as a framework, we derive analytical relations among the phase transition parameters and the resulting GW spectrum. Our results indicate that the second and third transitions generate GWs with higher amplitudes than the first, with a peak frequency ratio differing by up to an order of magnitude. This three-peak GW spectrum is detectable by upcoming facilities such as LISA, BBO, and UDECIGO. Notably, the phenomenon is robust across various potentials and model parameters, suggesting that hidden sector GWs provide a powerful tool for exploring new physics scenarios in the pre-BBN era.</description>

      <title>Efficient Quantum Simulation of QCD Jets on the Light Front</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.09762</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.09762v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quark and gluon jets provide one of the best ways to probe the matter produced in ultrarelativistic high-energy collisions, from cold nuclear matter to hot quark-gluon plasma. In this work, we propose a unified framework for efficient quantum simulation of many-body dynamics using the (3+1)-dimensional QCD Hamiltonian on the light front, particularly suited for studying the scattering of quark and gluon jets on nuclear matter in heavy-ion collisions. We describe scalable methods for mapping physical degrees of freedom onto qubits and for simulating in-medium jet evolution. We then validate our framework by implementing an algorithm that directly maps second-quantized Fock states onto qubits and uses Trotterized simulation for simulating time dynamics. Using a classical emulator, we investigate the evolution of quark and gluon jets with up to three particles in Fock states, extending prior studies. These calculations enable the study of key observables, including jet momentum broadening, particle production, and parton distribution functions.</description>

      <title>The Neutrino Mass Bound from Leptogenesis Revisited</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.09765</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.09765v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We revisit unflavoured leptogenesis in the seesaw model applying recent improvements in the computation of $CP$-conserving and $CP$-violating equilibration rates. These are relevant for the relativistic regime of the sterile Majorana fermions and the dynamics of the Standard Model particles acting as spectator processes. In order to probe the regime of large (${\cal O}(10^2)$) washout parameters, we add $\Delta L = 2$ washout processes, which we derive in the CTP-formalism. We then perform a parameter scan of the final baryon asymmetry and find a constraint $m_{\text{lightest}} \lesssim 0.15 \, \rm eV$ on the absolute neutrino mass scale, which is slightly less stringent than previously reported bounds obtained without the aforementioned improvements. The relaxation of the bounds is mainly due to partially equilibrated spectator fields, which protect part of the asymmetry from washout and lead to larger final asymmetries.</description>

      <title>Hadronic vacuum polarization contribution to the muon g-2 on Euclidean windows from tau data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.09811</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.09811v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We computed for the first time the $\tau$ data-driven Euclidean windows for the hadronic vacuum polarization contribution to the muon g-2. We showed that $\tau$-based results agree with the available lattice window evaluations and with the full result. On the intermediate window, where all lattice evaluations are rather precise and agree, $\tau$-based results are compatible with them. This is particularly interesting, given that the disagreement of the $e^+e^-$ data-driven result with the lattice values in this window is the main cause for their discrepancy, affecting the interpretation of the $a_\mu$ measurement in terms of possible new physics.</description>

      <title>Quantum similarity learning for anomaly detection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.09927</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.09927v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Anomaly detection is a vital technique for exploring signatures of new physics Beyond the Standard Model (BSM) at the Large Hadron Collider (LHC). The vast number of collisions generated by the LHC demands sophisticated deep learning techniques. Similarity learning, a self-supervised machine learning, detects anomalous signals by estimating their similarity to background events. In this paper, we explore the potential of quantum computers for anomaly detection through similarity learning, leveraging the power of quantum computing to enhance the known similarity learning method. In the realm of noisy intermediate-scale quantum (NISQ) devices, we employ a hybrid classical-quantum network to search for heavy scalar resonances in the di-Higgs production channel. In the absence of quantum noise, the hybrid network demonstrates improvement over the known similarity learning method. Moreover, we employ a clustering algorithm to reduce measurement noise from limited shot counts, resulting in $9\%$ improvement in the hybrid network performance. Our analysis highlights the applicability of quantum algorithms for LHC data analysis, where improvements are anticipated with the advent of fault-tolerant quantum computers.</description>

      <title>Effect of Coriolis Force on Diffusion of D Meson</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.09983</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.09983v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We have attempted to calculate and estimate the diffusion coefficients of D meson through rotating hadron resonance gas, which can be produced in the late stage of peripheral heavy ion collisions. According to the kinetic theory framework of relaxation time approximation and Einstein's diffusion relation, one can express D meson diffusion as a ratio of its conductivity to its susceptibility. Here, we have tuned D meson relaxation time from the knowledge of earlier works on its spatial diffusion estimations, and then we have extended the framework for the finite rotation picture of hadronic matter, where only the effect of Coriolis force is considered. The ratio of shear viscosity to entropy density shows a valley-shaped pattern well-known in the community of heavy-ion physics. Diffusion coefficients of D meson show a similar structure. Our study also revealed the anisotropic nature of diffusion in the presence of rotation with future possibilities of phenomenological signature.</description>

      <title>Photon polarization tensor at finite temperature and density in a magnetic field</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.09994</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.09994v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present analytical and numerical calculations for the photon polarization tensor at finite temperature and density in a constant magnetic field. We first discuss the tensor decomposition in the presence of the magnetic field which breaks rotational symmetry. Then, we analytically perform all the momentum integrations and numerically take the Landau level sum. We present the real and imaginary parts of the photon polarization tensor as functions of the momenta, the chemical potential, and the finite temperature. As an application, we consider the real photon limit and estimate the photon decay rate in the hot and dense medium. We specifically quantify the difference between the X-mode and the O-mode with the polarization orthogonal and parallel to the magnetic field. As long as the magnetic field is weak, the decay rate of the X-mode photon is larger than that of the O-mode photon, while the O-mode becomes dominant due to the Landau level suppression of the X-mode at strong magnetic field.</description>

      <title>Suppression of diffraction in DIS on nuclei and dynamical mechanism of leading twist nuclear shadowing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.10103</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.10103v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Using the leading twist approach (LTA) to nuclear shadowing (NS), we calculate the ratio of the diffractive-to-total DIS cross sections $R_{\rm diff/tot}$ for a heavy nucleus and proton and confirm that $R_{\rm diff/tot} \approx 0.5-1$ in contrast with $R_{\rm diff/tot} \approx 1.5-2$ in the dipole model. We show that the magnitude of $R_{\rm diff/tot}$ is controlled by an effective dipole cross section so that $R_{\rm diff/tot} \to 1$ in the black disk limit. We also argue that strong leading twist NS as well as the dilute nuclear density deplete nuclear enhancement of the saturation scale leading to $Q_{sA}^2(b=0)/Q_{sp}^2(b=0) \sim 1$.</description>

      <title>Four loop Green's functions involving the $n$ $=$ $2$ moment of the Wilson operator</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.10106</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.10106v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We evaluate the Green's function for the insertion of the second moment of the twist-$2$ flavour nonsinglet Wilson operator in a quark $2$-point function in all three different single scale external momentum configurations at four loops in the MSbar scheme and the chiral limit. One configuration is where the operator is inserted at zero momentum while the other two are where a non-zero momentum flows out through the operator itself with one external quark momentum nullified. In the latter two configurations mixing of the operator with a total derivative twist-$2$ operator is included for renormalization group consistency. In addition we compute the correlation functions of both gauge invariant operators to four loops in the same scheme.</description>

      <title>Constraints on large scalar multiplets added to the Standard Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.10114</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.10114v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the extension of the Standard Model (SM) by introducing a scalar multiplet with arbitrary isospin $J$ and hypercharge $Y$. We explicitly consider various possible values of the weak isospin $J$, up to and including $J=7/2$. The mass differences among the components of the multiplet originate from its coupling to the Higgs doublet of the SM, as present in the scalar potential (SP). We derive exact bounded-from-below (BFB) and unitarity (UNI) conditions for this model, even when the SP includes the most general quartic terms involving the multiplet components. We find that the upper bound on the mass differences depends not only on the UNI conditions but also on the BFB ones, thus imposing constraints on the mass differences. We compare these constraints to those derived from the oblique parameters (OPs) and from solutions of the renormalization-group equations (RGEs).</description>

      <title>Two-Component Boosted Dark Matter in Directional Detector Mediated By Dark Photon</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.10149</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.10149v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study explores a two-component dark matter model in which one component, heavier dark matter, annihilates into a lighter dark matter. The lighter dark matter is expected to generate detectable signals in detectors due to its enhanced momentum, enabling direct detection even for MeV-scale dark matter. We investigate the effectiveness of directional direct detections, especially the nuclear emulsion detector NEWSdm, in verifying these boosted dark matter particles through nuclear recoil. In particular, we focus on light nuclei, such as protons and carbon, as suitable targets for this detection method due to their high sensitivity to MeV-scale dark matter. By modeling the interactions mediated by a dark photon in a hidden U(1)$_D$ gauge symmetry framework, we calculate the expected dark matter flux and scattering rates for various detector configurations. Our results show that nuclear emulsions have the potential to yield distinct, direction-sensitive dark matter signals from the Galactic center, providing a new way to probe low-mass dark matter parameter spaces that evade conventional detection methods.</description>

      <title>On the dark matter origin of an LDMX signal</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.10216</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.10216v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Fixed target experiments where beam electrons are focused upon a thin target have shown great potential for probing new physics, including the sub-GeV dark matter (DM) paradigm. However, a signal in future experiments such as the light dark matter experiment (LDMX) would require an independent validation to assert its DM origin. To this end, we propose to combine LDMX and next generation DM direct detection (DD) data in a four-step analysis strategy, which we here illustrate with Monte Carlo simulations. In the first step, the hypothetical LDMX signal (i.e. an excess in the final state electron energy and transverse momentum distributions) is $\textit{recorded}$. In the second step, a DM DD experiment operates with increasing exposure to test the DM origin of the LDMX signal. Here, LDMX and DD data are simulated. In the third step, a posterior probability density function (pdf) for the DM model parameters is extracted from the DD data, and used to $\textit{predict}$ the electron recoil energy and transverse momentum distributions at LDMX. In the last step, $\textit{predicted}$ and $\textit{recorded}$ electron recoil energy and transverse momentum distributions are compared in a chi-square test. We present the results of this comparison in terms of a threshold exposure that a DD experiment has to operate with to assert whether $\textit{predicted}$ and $\textit{recorded}$ distributions $\textit{can}$ be statistically dependent. We find that this threshold exposure grows with the DM particle mass, $m_\chi$. It varies from 0.012 kg-year for a DM mass of $m_\chi=4$ MeV to 1 kg-year for $m_\chi=25$ MeV, which is or will soon be within reach.</description>

      <title>Bridging correlation and spectroscopy measurements to access the hadron interaction behind molecular states: the case of the $\Xi$(1620) and $\Xi$(1690) in the $K^- \Lambda$ system</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.10245</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.10245v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the compatibility between the $K^-\Lambda$ correlation function, recently measured by the ALICE collaboration, and the LHCb $K^-\Lambda$ invariant mass distribution obtained in the $\Xi^-_b \to J/\psi \Lambda K^-$ decay. The $K^-\Lambda$ invariant mass distribution associated with the $\Xi^-_b$ decay has been calculated within the framework of Unitary Effective Field Theories using two models, one of them constrained by the $K^-\Lambda$ correlation function. We consider two degenerate pentaquark $P_{cs}$ states in the $J/\psi \Lambda$ scattering amplitude which allows us to investigate their impact on both the $K^-\Lambda$ and $J/\psi \Lambda$ mass distributions assuming different spin-parity quantum numbers and multiplicity. Without any fitting procedure, the $K^-\Lambda$ model is able to better reproduce the experimental $K^-\Lambda$ mass spectrum in the energy region above $1680$ MeV as compared to previous unitarized scattering amplitudes constrained to a large amount of experimental data in the neutral $S=-1$ meson-baryon sector. We observe a tension between our model and the LHCb $K^-\Lambda$ distribution in the region close to the threshold, largely dominated by the presence of the still poorly known $\Xi$(1620) state. We discuss in detail the different production mechanisms probed via femtoscopy and spectroscopy that could provide valid explanations for such disagreement, indicating the necessity to employ future correlation data in other $S=-2$ channels such as $\pi\Xi$ and $\bar{K}\Sigma$.</description>

      <title>Two-loop corrections in power spectrum in models of inflation with PBHs formation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.10253</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.10253v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We calculate the two-loop corrections in curvature perturbation power spectrum in models of single field inflation incorporating an intermediate USR phase employed for PBHs formation. Among the total eleven one-particle irreducible Feynman diagrams, we calculate the corrections from the ``double scoop" two-loop diagram involving two vertices of quartic Hamiltonians. We demonstrate that the fractional two-loop correction in power spectrum scales like the square of the fractional one-loop correction. We confirm our previous findings that the loop corrections become arbitrarily large when the transition from the USR phase to the final attractor phase is very sharp. This suggests that in order for the analysis to be under perturbative control against the loop corrections, one requires a mild transition with a long enough relaxation period towards the final attractor phase.</description>

      <title>Universal non-equilibrium scaling of cumulants across a critical point</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.10266</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.10266v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the critical dynamics of a scalar field theory with $Z_2$ symmetry in the dynamic universality class of Model A in two and three spatial dimensions with classical-statistical lattice simulations. In particular, we measure the non-equilibrium behavior of the system under a quench protocol in which the symmetry-breaking external field is changed at a constant rate through the critical point. Using the well-established Kibble-Zurek scaling theory we compute non-equilibrium scaling functions of cumulants of the order parameter up to fourth order. Together with the static critical exponents and the dynamic critical exponent, these fully describe the universal non-equilibrium evolution of the system near the critical point. We further extend the analysis to include finite-size effects and observe good collapse of our data onto two-dimensional universal non-equilibrium and finite-size scaling functions.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.10304v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose the $\mu^-\to e^-\gamma$ process in a muonic atom as a novel means to investigate charged lepton flavor violation (CLFV). We demonstrate its sensitivity in probing effective CLFV operators associated with both single and double photon fields. In comparison to $\mu^+\to e^+\gamma$ using free positive muon decays at rest, the emitted electron and photon in $\mu^-\to e^-\gamma$ exhibit non-monochromatic spectra, presenting non-trivial case. We derive the decay rate formula and establish that the possible rate of the process can be sufficiently substantial to future exploration in forthcoming experiments using muonic atoms.</description>

      <title>Scalar and tensor meson dominance and gravitational form factors of the pion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.10354</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.10354v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We analyze the recent MIT lattice data for the gravitational form factors (GFFs) of the pion which extend up to $Q^2= 2~{\rm GeV}^2$ for $m_\pi=170$~MeV. We show that simple monopole fits comply with the old idea of meson dominance. We use Chiral Perturbation theory ($\chi$PT) to next-to-leading order (NLO) to transform the MIT data to the physical world with $m_\pi=140~$MeV and find that the spin-0 GFF is effectively saturated with the $f_0(600)$ and the spin-2 with the $f_2(1270)$, with monopole masses $m_\sigma= 630(60)$~MeV and $m_{f_2}= 1270(40)$~MeV. We determine in passing the chiral low energy constants (LECs) from the MIT lattice data alone
  $$
  10^3 \cdot L_{11} (m_\rho^2)=1.06(15) \, , \qquad 10^3 \cdot L_{12} (m_\rho^2)= -2.2(1) \, ,
  \qquad 10^3 \cdot L_{13} (m_\rho^2) = -0.7(1.1).
  $$ which agree in sign and order of magnitude with the original estimates by Donoghue and Leutwyler. We also analyze the sum rules based on perturbative QCD (pQCD) that imply that the corresponding spectral functions are not positive definite. We show that these sum rules are strongly violated in a variety of $\pi\pi-K \bar K$ coupled channel Omn\`es-Muskhelishvili calculations. This is not mended by the inclusion of the pQCD tail, suggesting the need for an extra negative spectral strength. Using a simple model implementing all sum rules, we find the expected onset of pQCD at very high momenta.</description>

      <title>The role of Pad\'e and D-Log Pad\'e approximants in the context of the MUonE Experiment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.10379</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.10379v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the context of the anomalous magnetic moment of the muon, the hadronic contribution plays a crucial role, especially given its large contribution to the final error. Currently, lattice QCD simulations are in disagreement with dispersive calculations based on $e^+e^-$ hadronic cross sections. The new MUonE experiment intends to shed light on this situation extracting the hadronic contribution to the running of the electromagnetic coupling in the space-like region, $\Delta \alpha_{\rm had}(t)$, from elastic $e\mu$ scattering. Still, due to the limited kinematic range that can be covered by the experiment, a powerful method must be devised to accurately extract the desired hadronic contribution from a new experiment of this type. In this work, we show how Pad\'e and D-Log Pad\'e approximants profiting from the analyticity of the correlator governing the hadronic contribution can be a powerful tool in reaching the required precision.</description>

      <title>Superconnections in AdS/QCD and the hadronic light-by-light contribution to the muon $g-2$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.10432</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.10432v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we consider hard-wall AdS/QCD models extended by a string-theory inspired Chern-Simons action in terms of a superconnection involving a bi-fundamental scalar field which corresponds to the open-string tachyon of brane-antibrane configurations and which is naturally identified with the holographic dual of the quark condensate in chiral symmetry breaking. This realizes both the axial and chiral anomalies of QCD with a Witten-Veneziano mechanism for the $\eta'$ mass in addition to current quark masses, but somewhat differently than in the Katz-Schwartz AdS/QCD model used previously by us to evaluate pseudoscalar and axial vector transition form factors and their contribution to the HLBL piece of the muon $g-2$. Compared to the Katz-Schwartz model, we obtain a significantly more realistic description of axial-vector mesons with regard to $f_1$-$f_1'$ mixing and equivalent photon rates. Moreover, predictions of the $f_1\to e^+e^-$ branching ratios are found to be in line with a recent phenomenological study. However, pseudoscalar transition form factors compare less well with experiment; in particular the $\pi^0$ transition form factor turns out to be overestimated at moderate non-zero virtuality. For the combined HLBL contribution to the muon $g-2$ from the towers of axial vector mesons and excited pseudoscalars we obtain, however, a result very close to that of the Katz-Schwartz model.</description>

      <title>Excess Radiation from Axion-Photon Conversion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.09042</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.09042v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Two notable anomalies in radio observations -- the excess radiation in the Rayleigh-Jeans tail of the cosmic microwave background, revealed by ARCADE2, and the twice-deeper absorption trough of the global 21cm line, identified by EDGES -- remain unresolved. These phenomena may have a shared origin, as the enhancement of the 21cm absorption trough could arise from excess heating. We investigate this scenario through the framework of axion-like particles (ALPs), showing that the resonant conversion of ALPs into photons can produce a photon abundance sufficient to resolve both anomalies simultaneously. Our model naturally explains the observed radio excess between 0.4 and 10GHz while also enhances the 21cm absorption feature at 78MHz. Furthermore, it predicts a novel power-law scaling of the radio spectrum above 0.5GHz and an additional absorption trough below 30MHz, which could be verified through cross-detection in upcoming experiments.</description>

      <title>Hadronic decay of vector charmonium from the lattice</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.10123v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Estimating decay parameters in lattice simulations is a computationally demanding problem, requiring several volumes and momenta. We explore an alternative approach, where the transition amplitude can be extracted from the spectral decomposition of particular ratios built from correlation functions. This so-called ratio method has the advantage of not needing various irreducible representations or volumes, and it allows us to predict the decay width $\Gamma$ and the energy shift $\epsilon$ of the spectrum directly. In this work, we apply this method to study the hadronic decay $\psi(3770)\to D\bar{D}$ on two CLS $N_\text{f}=2$ ensembles. This approach requires close to on-shell kinematics to work, and we employ twisted boundary conditions to precisely tune the on-shell point. Although our study is yet to approach the continuum limit, we find a value of $\Gamma$ fully compatible to the physical result, and $\epsilon$ informs us by how much our spectrum would shift in a fully dynamical simulation. Besides lattice calculations, many analytical tools have been proposed to understand decay processes. A relatively simple, early example is the ${}^3P_0$ quark model. By fixing its free parameters, we find that it describes well the lattice data for various kinematics.</description>

      <title>Aspects of the chiral crossover transition in (2+1)-flavor QCD with M\"{o}bius domain-wall fermions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.10217</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.10217v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The non-singlet part of the chiral symmetry in QCD with two light flavors is known to be restored through a crossover transition at a pseudo-critical temperature. However, the temperature dependence of the singlet part of the chiral symmetry and whether it is effectively restored at the same temperature is not well understood. Using (2+1)-flavor QCD configurations generated using the M\"{o}bius domain-wall discretization on an $N_\tau=8$ lattice, we construct suitable observables where the singlet and non-singlet chiral symmetries are disentangled in order to study their temperature dependence across the crossover transition. From the peak of the disconnected part of the chiral susceptibility, we obtain a pseudo-critical temperature $T_{pc}=158.7{}_{{}-2.3}^{{}+2.6}$ MeV where the non-singlet part of the chiral symmetry is effectively restored. From a calculation of the topological susceptibility and its temperature dependence we find that the singlet $U_A(1)$ part of the chiral symmetry is not effectively restored at $T&lt;186$ MeV.</description>

Abstract: We evaluate the consistency of hadronic interaction models in the CORSIKA simulation package with publicly available fluorescence telescope data from the Pierre Auger Observatory. By comparing the first few central moments of the extended air shower depth maximum distributions, as extracted from measured events, to those predicted by the best-fit inferred compositions, we derive a statistical measure of the consistency of a given hadronic model with data. To mitigate possible systematic biases, we include all primaries up to iron, compensate for the differences between the measured and simulated energy spectra of cosmic rays and account for other known systematic effects. Additionally, we study the effects of including higher central moments in the fit and project our results to larger statistics.</description>

      <title>In-medium gluon radiation spectrum with all-order resummation of multiple scatterings in longitudinally evolving media</title>

      <description>arXiv:2307.06226v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Over the past years, there has been a sustained effort to systematically enhance our understanding of medium-induced emissions occurring in the quark-gluon plasma, driven by the ultimate goal of advancing our comprehension of jet quenching phenomena. To ensure meaningful comparisons between these new calculations and experimental data, it becomes crucial to model the interplay between the radiation process and the evolution of the medium parameters, typically described by a hydrodynamical simulation. This step presents particular challenges when dealing with calculations involving the resummation of multiple scatterings, which have been shown to be necessary for achieving an accurate description of the in-medium emission process. In this paper, we extend our numerical calculations of the fully-resummed gluon spectrum to account for longitudinally expanding media. This new implementation allows us to quantitatively assess the accuracy of previously proposed scaling laws that establish a correspondence between an expanding medium and a ``static equivalent''. Additionally, we show that such scaling laws yield significantly improved results when the static reference case is replaced by an expanding medium with the temperature following a simple power-law decay. Such correspondence will enable the application of numerical calculations of medium-induced energy loss in realistic evolving media for a broader range of phenomenological studies.</description>

Abstract: We discuss the reactions $\pi p \to \pi p$ and $\pi p \to \pi p \gamma$ from a general quantum field theory (QFT) point of view, describing these reactions in QCD and lowest relevant order of electromagnetism. We consider the pion-proton elastic scattering both off shell and on shell. The on-shell amplitudes for $\pi^{\pm} p \to \pi^{\pm} p$ scattering are described by two invariant amplitudes, while the off-shell amplitudes contain eight invariant amplitudes. We study the photon emission amplitudes in the soft-photon limit where the c.m. photon energy $\omega \to 0$. The Laurent expansion in $\omega$ of the $\pi^{\pm} p \to \pi^{\pm} p \gamma$ amplitudes is considered and the terms of the orders $\omega^{-1}$ and $\omega^{0}$ are derived. These terms can be expressed by the on-shell invariant amplitudes and their partial derivatives with respect to $s$ and $t$. The pole term $\propto \omega^{-1}$ in the amplitudes corresponds to Weinberg's soft-photon theorem and is well known from the literature. We derive the next-to-leading term $\propto \omega^{0}$ using only rigorous methods of QFT. We give the relation of the Laurent series for $\pi^{0} p \to \pi^{0} p \gamma$ and Low's soft-photon theorem. Our formulas for the amplitudes in the limit $\omega \to 0$ are valid for photon momentum $k$ satisfying $k^{2} \geqslant 0$, $k^{0} = \omega \geqslant 0$, that is, for both real and virtual photons. Here we consider a limit where with $\omega \to 0$ we have also $k^{2} \to 0$. We discuss the behavior of the corresponding cross-sections for $\pi^{-} p \to \pi^{-} p \gamma$ with respect to $\omega$ for $\omega \to 0$. We consider cross sections for unpolarized as well as polarized protons in the initial and final states.</description>

      <title>New properties of elastic $pp$ and $p\bar{p}$ scattering at high energies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.14459</link>
      <description>arXiv:2308.14459v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Data-driving determination of the new properties of elastic scattering at small angles on the basis on all existing experimental data for $d\sigma/dt$ of $pp$ and $p\bar{p}$ at $\sqrt{s} \geq 540$ GeV allows us to obtain the main characteristics of the nonstandard terms of the elastic scattering amplitude. It was shown that the oscillation term has a different sign for $pp$ and $p\bar{p}$ reactions; hence, it is part of the Odderon amplitude. The energy dependence of the oscillation term and the term with an extremely large slope is determined. The period of the oscillation term agrees with the scaling properties predicted by the Auberson - Kinoshita - Martin (AKM) theorem. The high quality quantitative description of all data at $\sqrt{s} \geq 540$ GeV in the framework of the HEGS model supports such a phenomenon which can be connected with peripheral hadron interaction.</description>

      <title>GPDs and gravitational form factors of nucleons (quark and gluon contributions)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.12988</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.12988v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Taking into account the recent parameterizations of parton distribution functions (PDFs), % obtained in the recent time, the momentum transfer dependence of generalized parton distributions (GPDs) of nucleons is obtained in the limit $\xi \rightarrow 0$. The gravitational quark and gluon form factors of nucleons are calculated. It is shown that the gluon gravitational radius of the nucleon is comparable to the electromagnetic radius of the proton. The power dependence of form factors is investigated. As a result, it was obtained that the quark gravitational form factor is reproduced by the dipole form, while the form of the gluon gravitation form factor corresponds to the triple form.</description>

      <title>Cogenesis of baryon and dark matter with PBH and QCD axion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.02401</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.02401v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: With entropy injection, an early matter-dominated epoch (EMD) impels the axion decay constant $f_a$ towards larger values to produce correct axion dark matter (DM) abundance, thereby unfolding the low-mass axion ($m_a\lesssim 10^{-5}$ eV) parameter space to be searched for in axion experiments. We implement this proposition in a scenario where $f_a$ and the leptogenesis scale in a seesaw mechanism are equivalent. We show, that if instead, the EMD is provided by evaporating ultralight primordial black holes (PBH), the scenario becomes strikingly testable with gravitational waves (GW) background alongside the axion searches. In particular, while being consistent with correct axion DM abundance, the scale $f_a\gtrsim 10^{12}$ GeV, corresponding to the unflavored regime of leptogenesis with hierarchical right-handed neutrinos, can be probed with GW and axion experiments, which is otherwise not testable at neutrino or collider experiments. Additionally, axions produced from PBH evaporation can give rise to dark radiation within reach of future cosmic microwave background experiments.</description>

      <title>Solving arbitrary one-loop reduction via generating function</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.04644v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Recently, the concept of generating function has been employed in one-loop reduction. For one-loop integrals encompassing arbitrary tensor ranks and higher-pole contributions, the generating function can be decomposed into a tensor part and a higher-pole part. While the tensor component has been thoroughly addressed in recent studies, there remains a lack of satisfactory investigations regarding the higher-pole part. In this work, we completely solve the problem. We first establish the partial differential equations governing the higher-pole generating function. Based on these equations, we derive an integration recursion relation and solve it iteratively. This approach enables us to explore the analytical structure of higher-pole reduction and provides a valuable tool for generating reduction coefficients efficiently.</description>

      <title>Early Dark Energy During Big Bang Nucleosynthesis</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.03508v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the impact of an early dark energy component (EDE) present during big bang nucleosynthesis (BBN) on the elemental abundances of deuterium D/H, and helium $Y_p$, as well as the effective relativistic degrees of freedom $N_{\rm eff}$. We consider a simple model of EDE that is constant up to a critical time. After this critical time, the EDE transitions into either a radiation component that interacts with the electromagnetic plasma, a dark radiation component that is uncoupled from the plasma, or kination that is also uncoupled. We use measured values of the abundances and $N_{\rm eff}$ as determined by CMB observations to establish limits on the input parameters of this EDE model. In addition, we explore how those parameters are correlated with BBN inputs; the baryon to photon ratio $\eta_b$, neutron lifetime $\tau_n$, and number of neutrinos $N_\nu$. Finally, we study whether this setup can alleviate the tension introduced by recent measurements of the primordial helium abundance.</description>

Abstract: We present results for the Yukawa-enhanced and Higgs self-coupling type electroweak corrections to di-Higgs production in gluon fusion. The calculation of the corresponding four-scale, two-loop amplitude is carried out retaining the exact symbolic dependence on all masses and scales during the reduction to master integrals. The resulting integrals are then evaluated at high precision using both the series expansion of the differential equations and sector decomposition. Differential cross sections for the di-Higgs invariant mass and the transverse momentum of a Higgs boson are shown, where we find that the corrections are most pronounced at low invariant mass and transverse momentum.</description>

      <title>Freezing-in Cannibal Dark Sectors</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.12104v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Self-Interacting Dark Matter models can successfully explain dark matter (DM) production through interactions confined within the dark sector. However, they often lack measurable experimental signals due to their secluded nature. Including a feeble interaction with the visible sector through a Higgs portal leads not only to potential detection avenues and richer thermal production dynamics, but also to a possible explanation of the initial dark sector population through the freeze-in mechanism. In this work we study, by solving the full system of coupled Boltzmann equations for the number densities and temperatures of all the involved states, three scenarios of this type where the DM is: a real scalar with broken $\mathbb{Z}_2$, a complex scalar with unbroken $\mathbb{Z}_3$, and a $\mathbb{Z}_3$ scalar with an additional scalar mediator. All of these models have viable dark matter candidates in a cannibal phase while having different detection profiles. We show that cosmological bounds can be either exacerbated or evaded by changing the dark sector interactions, leading to potential signatures in long-lived particle and indirect detection experiments.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.16202v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We revisit the minimal Nelson-Barr model for solving the strong CP problem through the idea of spontaneous CP breaking. The minimal model suffers from the quality problem, which means that the strong CP angle is generated by higher-dimensional operators and one-loop effects. Consequently, it has been considered that there is a cosmological domain wall problem and that leptogenesis does not work. We point out that just imposing an additional approximate global symmetry solves the quality problem. We also propose a simple solution to the domain wall problem and show that the thermal leptogenesis scenario works.</description>

      <title>Crescendo Beyond the Horizon: More Gravitational Waves from Domain Walls Bounded by Inflated Cosmic Strings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.17525</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.17525v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Gravitational-wave (GW) signals offer a unique window into the dynamics of the early universe. GWs may be generated by the topological defects produced in the early universe, which contain information on the symmetry of UV physics. We consider the case in which a two-step phase transition produces a network of domain walls bounded by cosmic strings. Specifically, we focus on the case in which there is a hierarchy in the symmetry-breaking scales, and a period of inflation pushes the cosmic string generated in the first phase transition outside the horizon before the second phase transition. We show that the GW signal from the evolution and collapse of this string-wall network has a unique spectrum, and the resulting signal strength can be sizeable. In particular, depending on the model parameters, the resulting signal can show up in a broad range of frequencies and can be discovered by a multitude of future probes, including the pulsar timing arrays and space- and ground-based GW observatories. As an example that naturally gives rise to this scenario, we present a model with the first phase transition followed by a brief period of thermal inflation driven by the field responsible for the second stage of symmetry breaking. The model can be embedded into a supersymmetric setup, which provides a natural realization of this scenario. In this case, the successful detection of the peak of the GW spectrum probes the soft supersymmetry breaking scale and the wall tension.</description>

Abstract: A Bose star passing through cold molecular clouds may capture atoms, molecules and dust particles. The observational signature of such an event would be a relatively small amount of matter that is gravitationally bound. This binding may actually be provided by invisible dark matter forming the Bose star. We may expect a relative excess of heavier atoms, molecules, and solid dust compared to the content of giant cold molecular clouds since the velocity of heavy particles at a given temperature is lower and it may be small compared to the escape velocity, $v_\mathrm{rms} = \sqrt{3k_\mathrm{B} T/m_\mathrm{gas}} \ll v_\mathrm{esc}=\sqrt{2GM/R}$. Finally, the velocity of this captured matter cloud may correlate with the expected velocity of free dark matter particles (e.g. expected axion wind velocity relative to Earth).</description>

Abstract: Radiative symmetry breaking provides an appealing explanation for electroweak symmetry breaking and addresses the hierarchy problem. We present a comprehensive phenomenological study of this scenario, focusing on its key feature: the logarithmic-shaped potential. This potential gives rise to a relatively light scalar boson that mixes with the Higgs boson and leads to first-order phase transitions (FOPTs) in the early Universe. Our detailed analysis includes providing exact and analytical solutions for the vacuum structure and scalar interactions, classifying four patterns of cosmic thermal history, and calculating the supercooled FOPT dynamics and GWs. By combining future collider and gravitational wave experiments, we can probe the conformal symmetry breaking scales up to $10^5-10^8$ GeV.</description>

      <title>Enhanced Dark Matter Abundance in First-Order Phase Transitions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.02179v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We propose a novel scenario to obtain the correct relic abundance for thermally under-produced dark matter. This scenario utilizes a strongly first-order phase transition at temperature $T_{\rm PT}$ that gives rise to dark matter mass $m$. Freeze-out in the broken phase can yield the desired abundance in the entire region currently allowed by observational bounds and theoretical constraints for $10^2 T_{\rm PT} \lesssim m \lesssim 10^4 T_{\rm PT}$. We show that the accompanying gravitational waves are strong enough to be detected by many upcoming and proposed experiments. This, in tandem with dark matter indirect searches, provides a multi-messenger probe of such models. Positive signals in the future can help reconstruct the potential governing the phase transition and shed light on an underlying particle physics realization.</description>

      <title>Implications of electromagnetic scale anomaly to QCD chiral phase transition in smaller quark mass regime: $T_{\mathrm{pc}}$ does not drop with eB</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.11360</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.11360v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The decrease of the chiral pseudocritical temperature $T_{\mathrm{pc}}$ with an applied strong magnetic field has been extensively investigated by various QCD low-energy effective models and lattice QCD at physical point. We find that this decreasing feature may not hold in the case with a weak magnetic field and still depends on quark masses: when the quark masses get smaller, $T_{\mathrm{pc}}$ turns to increase with the weak magnetic field. This happens due to the significant electromagnetic-scale anomaly contribution in the thermomagnetic medium. We demonstrate this salient feature by employing the Polyakov Nambu-Jona-Lasinio model with 2 + 1 quark flavors including the electromagnetic-scale anomaly contribution. We observe a critical point in a sort of the Columbia plot, $(m_{0c}, m_{sc}) \simeq (3, 30) \mathrm{MeV}$ for the isospin symmetric mass for up and down quarks, $m_0$, and the strange quark mass, $m_s$, where $T_{\mathrm{pc}}$ decreases with the magnetic field if the quark masses exceed the critical values, and increases as the quark masses become smaller. Related cosmological implications, arising when the supercooled electroweak phase transition or dark QCD cosmological phase transition is considered along with a primordial magnetic field, are also briefly addressed.</description>

      <title>New Physics Through Flavor Tagging at FCC-ee</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.02485v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Leveraging recent advancements in machine learning-based flavor tagging, we develop an optimal analysis for measuring the hadronic cross-section ratios $R_b$, $R_c$, and $R_s$ at the FCC-ee during its $WW$, $Zh$, and $t\bar{t}$ runs. Our results indicate up to a two-order-of-magnitude improvement in precision, providing an unprecedented test of the SM. Using these observables, along with $R_\ell$ and $R_t$, we project sensitivity to flavor non-universal four-fermion (4F) interactions within the SMEFT, contributing both at the tree level and through the renormalization group (RG). We highlight a subtle complementarity with RG-induced effects at the FCC-ee's $Z$-pole. Our analysis demonstrates significant improvements over the current LEP-II and LHC bounds in probing flavor-conserving 4F operators involving heavy quark flavors and all lepton flavors. As an application, we explore simplified models addressing current $B$-meson anomalies, demonstrating that FCC-ee can effectively probe the relevant parameter space. Finally, we design optimized search strategies for quark flavor-violating 4F interactions.</description>

      <title>TMD-like functions through the twisted quark states</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.03741</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.03741v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this work, we investigate a new class of transverse momentum dependent functions (TMDs) as known as align-spin (AS) functions, employing the framework of twisted quark states. We reveal that these twisted (vortex) quark states serve as effective tools for the study of TMDs, thereby facilitating a comprehensive analysis of AS-functions. The proposed method is quite general and can be used for the standard TMDs. In contrast to the previous studies, the presented approach focuses on the leading order of interactions, providing a simplified and robust alternative to the methods based on the traditional $\mathbb{S}$-matrix expansion. We highlight that the critical dependence of transverse momentum arises not only from interactions but also from significant contributions linked to orbital angular momentum (OAM), influenced by the transverse momentum characteristics of correlators. Using a cylindrical formulation for twisted states, we can combine the properties of plane-wave particles with a description stemmed from spherical harmonics, resulting in well-defined propagation directions accompanied by essential OAM projections. In particular, this innovative framework opens a new window for the direct investigations of AS-functions, generating the unique angular $\phi$-dependence of differential cross sections. It also points towards promising applications in experimental particle physics.</description>

      <title>Extending the Dark Matter Reach of Water Cherenkov Detectors using Jupiter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.04435</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.04435v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We propose the first method for water Cherenkov detectors to constrain GeV-scale dark matter (DM) below the solar evaporation mass. While previous efforts have highlighted the Sun and Earth as DM capture targets, we demonstrate that Jupiter is a viable target. Jupiter's unique characteristics, such as its lower core temperature and significant gravitational potential, allow it to capture and retain light DM more effectively than the Sun, particularly in the mass range below 4 GeV where direct detection sensitivity diminishes. Our calculations provide the first sensitivities to GeV-scale annihilating DM within Jupiter using neutrino detectors, showing that these surpass current solar limits and direct detection results.</description>

      <title>Fractional quantum fields with Le'vy paths</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2212.03609</link>
      <description>arXiv:2212.03609v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We develop a path integral approach to quantum field theory that is defined over the paths of the Le'vy flights possessing a fractal dimension $1&lt;d_f&lt;2$. In standard quantum field theory, the fractality of the Brownian trajectories lead to a dispersion relation of quadric form. While the Le'vy paths lead fractional quantum field theory to a fractional dispersion relation. By considering Le'vy paths in time, we calculate density of states for a massless scalar field with box boundary condition. The density of states show behaviors dual to lower dimensional system, and the corresponding black body radiation has an energy spectrum dual to that in lower dimensional black body radiation. We derive the fractional equations of motion for scalar field, vector field and spinor field in zero temperature. Their propagators have been calculated. Based on above derivation, we calculate the one-loop self-energy of electron in Lev'y paths to show how this scheme works equally in renormalization as dimensional regularization does. Nevertheless, We found that gauge symmetry prevent Dirac spinor field from Le'vy paths and demonstrate that these paths in Dirac spinor field leds to unstable electrons, thus Le'vy paths are overcame by ordinary Brownian paths. While Le'vy paths are permitted in electromagnetic field by gauge symmetry. It led to a non-local phase and interaction with electron where electron charge is a composite quantity rather than a fundamental constant which maybe physically observable.</description>

      <title>Dynamical Friction in Gravitational Atoms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.15460</link>
      <description>arXiv:2305.15460v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Due to superradiant instabilities, clouds of ultralight bosons can spontaneously grow around rotating black holes, creating so-called "gravitational atoms". In this work, we study their dynamical effects on binary systems. We first focus on open orbits, showing that the presence of a cloud can increase the cross section for the dynamical capture of a compact object by more than an order of magnitude. We then consider closed orbits and demonstrate that the backreaction of the cloud's ionization on the orbital motion should be identified as dynamical friction. Finally, we study for the first time eccentric and inclined orbits. We find that, while ionization quickly circularizes the binary, it barely affects the inclination angle. These results enable a more realistic description of the dynamics of gravitational atoms in binaries and pave the way for dedicated searches with future gravitational wave detectors.</description>

      <title>Training Deep 3D Convolutional Neural Networks to Extract BSM Physics Parameters Directly from HEP Data: a Proof-of-Concept Study Using Monte Carlo Simulations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.13060</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.13060v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We report on a novel application of computer vision techniques to extract beyond the Standard Model parameters directly from high energy physics flavor data. We propose a simple but novel data representation that transforms the angular and kinematic distributions into "quasi-images", which are used to train a convolutional neural network to perform regression tasks, similar to fitting. As a proof-of-concept, we train a 34-layer Residual Neural Network to regress on these images and determine information about the Wilson Coefficient $C_{9}$ in Monte Carlo simulations of $B^0 \rightarrow K^{*0}\mu^{+}\mu^{-}$ decays. The method described here can be generalized and may find applicability across a variety of experiments.</description>

      <title>Cosmic Recombination in the Presence of Primordial Magnetic Fields</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.11448</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.11448v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Primordial magnetic fields (PMFs) may explain observations of magnetic fields on extragalactic scales. They are most cleanly constrained by measurements of cosmic microwave background radiation (CMB) anisotropies. Their effects on cosmic recombination may even be at the heart of the resolution of the Hubble tension. We present the most detailed analysis of the effects of PMFs on cosmic recombination to date. To this end we extend the public magneto-hydrodynamic code {\sl ENZO} with a new cosmic recombination routine, Monte-Carlo simulations of Lyman-$\alpha$ photon transport, and a Compton drag term in the baryon momentum equation. The resulting code allows us, for the first time, to realistically predict the impact of PMFs on the cosmic ionization history and the clumping of baryons during cosmic recombination. Our results identify the importance of mixing of Lyman-$\alpha$ photons between overdense- and underdense- regions for small PMF strength. This mixing speeds up recombination beyond the speed-up due to clumping. We also investigate the effects of pecuilar flows on the recombination rate and find it to be small for small PMF strengths. For non-helical PMFs with a Batchelor spectrum we find a surprising dependency of results on ultra-violet magnetic modes. We further show that the increase in the ionization fraction at low redshift by hydrodynamic baryon heating due to PMF dissipation is completely compensated by the faster recombination from baryon clumping. The present study shall serve as a theoretical foundation for a future precise comparison of recombination with PMFs to CMB data.</description>

      <title>Hybrid inflation and gravitational waves from accidentally light scalars</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.02531v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We construct a hybrid-inflation model where the inflaton potential is generated radiatively, as gauge symmetries guarantee it to be accidentally flat at tree level. The model can be regarded as a small-field version of Natural Inflation, with inflation ending when the mass of a second scalar, the waterfall field, turns tachyonic. This provides a minimal, robust realization of hybrid inflation, which predicts specific correlations among Cosmic Microwave Background observables. Tachyonic preheating leads to the production of gravitational waves which, for a low inflationary scale, might be detected by upcoming experiments. Simple variations of the model can give rise to topological defects, such as unstable domain walls. Their dynamics produces a stochastic gravitational wave background, which can be compatible with the recent detection by pulsar timing arrays.</description>

      <title>Consistent Theories for the DESI dark energy fit</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.08459</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.08459v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We search for physically consistent realizations of evolving dark energy suggested by the cosmological fit of DESI, Planck and Supernovae data. First we note that any lagrangian description of the standard Chevallier-Polarski-Linder (CPL) parametrization for the dark energy equation of state $w$, allows for the addition of a cosmological constant. We perform the cosmological fit finding new regions of parameter space that however continue to favour dark energy with $w&lt;-1$ at early times, that is challenging to realize in consistent theories. Next, in the spirit of effective field theories, we consider the effect of higher order terms in the Taylor expansion of the equation of state of dark energy around the present epoch. We find that non-linear corrections of the equation of state are weakly constrained, thus opening the way to scenarios that differ from CPL at early times, possibly with $w&gt;-1$ at all times. We present indeed scenarios where evolving dark energy can be realized through quintessence models. We introduce in particular the ramp model where dark energy coincides with CPL at late times and approximates to a cosmological constant at early times. The latter model provides a much better fit than $\Lambda$CDM, and only slightly worse than $w_0w_a$CDM, but with the notable advantage of being described by a simple and theoretically consistent lagrangian of a canonical quintessence model.</description>

      <title>Detection of hidden emissions in two rotating radio transients with high surface magnetic fields</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.09876v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Rotating Radio Transients (RRATs) are neutron stars emitting sporadic radio pulses. The unique emission of RRATs has been proposed to resemble those of known pulsar types, such as extreme nulling pulsars or pulsars with giant pulses. However, the presence of additional radiation beyond these sporadic pulses remains unclear. Through high-sensitivity observations and extended tracking, we detected the sequential weak emissions in two RRATs with relatively high surface magnetic fields (Bs &gt; 10^13 G): J1846-0257 and J1854+0306. These emissions show peak flux densities of 0.15 and 0.41 mJy, up to 687 and 512 times weaker than our detected RRAT single pulses, respectively. The weak emissions contribute small fractions (~ 16% and 5%) to the total radio pulse energy releases, contrasting significantly with giant-pulse pulsars where normal pulses dominate. Polarization analysis of J1854+0306 suggests that its sporadic RRAT pulses may originate from intermittent enhanced sparking processes due to magnetospheric evolution. Our findings indicate that some RRATs may represent a novel class of pulsars, distinct from any previously known subclass. Further observations of sources with similar rotational properties using high-sensitivity instruments could validate the generality of these hidden emissions.</description>

      <title>Low-scale Mirror Standard Model Dark Matter and its Detection via Gravitational Waves and the Guitar Nebula</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.16095</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.16095v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: What if the dark matter Sector is truly dark, self-interacting and unreachable by terrestrial experiments? How could we find hints of such dark sector if it is experimentally unreachable by any terrestrial experiment? We study a low-scale mirror Standard Model which can act as a model for dark matter, which interacts only gravitationally with the Standard Model particles. The mirror Standard Model sector particles are stable particles can comprise a measurable part of the dark matter of the Universe. These mirror Standard Model particles acquire mass through a low-temperature dark first order phase transition. We examine in detail this dark phase transition and we indicate how stochastic gravitational waves can be generated through this transition. For the model we use, the produced energy spectrum of the gravitational waves can be detected by the Square Kilometer Array. Moreover, we propose a possible way to detect effects of the particle nature of dark matter, using observational data coming from the guitar nebula, which can work if dark matter is collisional, so interacting dark matter. Without specifying a model for interacting dark matter, thus choosing an agnostic approach for interacting dark matter, we assume that the guitar nebula bow shock is generated by the interaction of the high speed neutron star that passes through the interstellar medium, which is assumed to be comprised by interacting dark matter and hydrogen. Our main proposal is that the opening angle of the bow shock can be directly related to the speed of sound of the dark matter particles, and a large angle of the bow shock could be a strong indicator that the interstellar medium is comprised by collisional dark matter and hydrogen gas. This is motivated by the Bosma effect.</description>

      <title>Composite running vacuum in the Universe: implications on the cosmological tensions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.20382</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.20382v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The possibility that the vacuum energy density (VED) could be time dependent in the expanding Universe is intuitively more reasonable than just a rigid cosmological constant for the entire cosmic history. The framework of the running vacuum model (RVM) is a salient example derived from QFT in curved spacetime, wherein the VED appears as a power series of the Hubble rate, $H(t)$, and its derivatives. The RVM contributes to alleviate the cosmological tensions and at a more fundamental level it also helps to smooth out certain hardcore aspects of the cosmological constant problem. Composite dark energy (DE) extensions of the RVM are possible, in which the DE is a mixed fluid made out of running vacuum and an entity X called ``phantom matter'' which, I should stress, is radically different from phantom DE, since the former produces positive pressure like ordinary matter (therein its name). The prototype is the old $\Lambda$XCDM model from 2006. Recently a simplified version of the latter, called the $w$XCDM, has proven capable to yield a truly outstanding fit to the cosmological data with dramatic implications for mitigating the cosmological tensions. The analysis is sensitive to the kind of BAO data used, transversal (2D) or anisotropic (3D). For both BAO types the overall fit quality is substantially better than for the standard $\Lambda$CDM model, and the growth tension becomes alleviated. Nevertheless, only for 2D BAO the $H_0$-tension can be completely cut down. Most notably, this scenario favours (at $3.3\sigma$ c.l.) quintessence-like behavior around our time, as recently reported by the DESI Collaboration. In what follows I will summarize in very simple phenomenological terms the essentials of the RVM idea and its composite extensions, as well as the remarkable practical implications ensuing from such scenarios.</description>
