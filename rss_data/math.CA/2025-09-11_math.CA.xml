      <title>Matrix-valued bispectral discrete orthogonal polynomials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.08909</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.08909v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We develop a unified construction of matrix-valued orthogonal polynomials associated with discrete weights, yielding bispectral sequences as eigenfunctions of second-order difference operators. This general framework extends the discrete families in the classical Askey scheme to the matrix setting by producing explicit matrix analogues of the Krawtchouk, Hahn, Meixner, and Charlier polynomials. In particular, we provide the first matrix extensions of the Krawtchouk and Hahn polynomials, filling a notable gap in the literature. Our results include explicit expressions for the weights, the orthogonal polynomials, and the corresponding difference operators. Furthermore, we establish matrix-valued limit transitions between these families, mirroring the standard relations in the scalar Askey scheme and connecting discrete and continuous cases.</description>

      <title>Incidences among flows</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.08937</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.08937v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider two incidence problems for integral curves of vector fields. The first is an analogue of the Euclidean joints problem, in which lines are replaced by integral curves of smooth vector fields taken from some finite-dimensional set. The second is a bilinear and more rigid version of the first, in which we have two vector fields and one family of integral curves tangent to each and wish to know how many intersecting pairs are possible. In both cases, a curvature condition of H\"ormander makes possible nontrivial bounds on the number of incidences in terms of the number of curves.</description>

      <title>Uniformly perfect measures on strictly convex planar graphs are $L^{2}$-flattening</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.09354</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.09354v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Uniformly perfect measures are a common generalisation of Ahlfors regular measures, self-conformal measures on the line, and their push-forwards under sufficiently regular maps. We show that every uniformly perfect measure $\sigma$ on a strictly convex planar $C^{2}$-graph is $L^{2}$-flattening. That is, for every $\epsilon&gt;0$, there exists $p = p(\epsilon,\sigma) \geq 1$ such that $$\|\hat{\sigma}\|_{L^{p}(B(R))}^{p} \lesssim_{\epsilon,\sigma} R^{\epsilon}, \qquad R \geq 1.$$</description>

      <title>The optimal bound $e$ in a dyadic version of Uchiyama's Lemma</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.09491</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.09491v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The best known constant in Uchiyama's Lemma is $e$. A conjecture states that this cannot be improved. We show that the constant $e$ also stands in a dyadic version of Uchiyama's Lemma. Further, we prove that in the dyadic case, the constant $e$ can indeed not be improved. We deduce a dyadic version of the reproducing kernel thesis for the embedding theorem.</description>

      <title>Localization and global dynamics in the long-range discrete nonlinear Schr\"odinger equation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.11395</link>
      <description>arXiv:2309.11395v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study localization, pinning, and mobility in the fractional discrete nonlinear Schr\"odinger equation (fDNLS) with generalized power-law coupling. A finite-dimensional spatial-dynamics reduction of the nonlocal recurrence yields onsite and offsite stationary profiles; their asymptotic validity, orbital stability of onsite solutions, and $\ell^2$ proximity to the exact lattice solutions are established. Using the explicit construction of localized states, it is shown that the spatial tail behavior is algebraic for all $\alpha$ &gt; 0. The Peierls-Nabarro barrier (PNB) is computed, and the parameter regimes are identified where it nearly vanishes; complementary numerical simulations explore mobility/pinning across parameters and exhibit scenarios consistent with near-vanishing PNB. We also analyze modulational instability of plane waves, locate instability thresholds, and discuss the role of nonlocality in initiating localization. Finally, we establish small-data scattering, and quantify how fDNLS dynamics approximates the nearest-neighbor DNLS on bounded times while exhibiting distinct global behavior for any large $\alpha$.</description>

      <title>Isomonodromy and Painlev\'e Type Equations, Case Studies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.15767</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.15767v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: There is an abundance of equations of Painlev\'e type besides the classical Painlev\'e equations. Classifications have been computed by the Japanese school. Here we consider Painlev\'e type equations induced by isomonodromic families of linear ODE's having at most ${z=0}$ and $z=\infty$ as singularities. Requiring that the formal data at the singularities produce isomonodromic families parametrized by a single variable $t$ leads to a small list of hierarchies of cases. The study of these cases involves Stokes matricesand moduli for linear ODE's on the projective line. Case studies reveal interesting families of linear ODE's and Painlev\'e type equations. However, rather often the complexity (especially of the Lax pair) is too high for either the computations or for the output. Apart from classical Painlev\'e equations one rediscovers work of Harnad, Noumi and Yamada. A hierarchy, probably new, related to the classical $P_3(D_8)$, is discovered. Finally, an amusing ''companion'' of $P_1$ is presented.</description>

      <title>Structure of operator algebras for matrix orthogonal polynomials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.16070</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.16070v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we study the structure of the differential operator algebra \( \mathcal{D}(W) \) and its associated eigenvalue algebra \( \Lambda(W) \) for matrix-valued orthogonal polynomials. While \( \Lambda(W) \) is isomorphic to \( \mathcal{D}(W) \), its simpler framework allows us to efficiently derive strong results about \( \mathcal{D}(W) \) and its center \( \mathcal{Z}(W) \). We analyze the behavior of the center under Darboux transformations, establishing explicit relationships between the centers of Darboux-equivalent weights. These results are illustrated through the study of both reducible and irreducible matrix weights, including a detailed analysis of an irreducible Jacobi-type weight.</description>

      <title>Block complexity and idempotent Schur multipliers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.21752</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.21752v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We call a matrix blocky if, up to row and column permutations, it can be obtained from an identity matrix by repeatedly applying one of the following operations: duplicating a row, duplicating a column, or adding a zero row or column. Blocky matrices are precisely the boolean matrices that are contractive when considered as Schur multipliers. It is conjectured that any boolean matrix with Schur multiplier norm at most $\gamma$ is expressible as a signed sum \begin{equation*}A = \sum_{i=1}^L \pm B_i\end{equation*} for some blocky matrices $B_i$, where $L$ depends only on $\gamma$. This conjecture is an analogue of Green and Sanders's quantitative version of Cohen's idempotent theorem. In this paper, we prove bounds on $L$ that are polylogarithmic in the dimension of $A$. Concretely, if $A$ is an $n\times n$ matrix, we show that one may take $L = 2^{O(\gamma^7)} \log(n)^2$.</description>

      <title>Universality for random matrices with an edge spectrum singularity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.18550</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.18550v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study invariant random matrix ensembles \begin{equation*}
  \mathbb{P}_n(d M)=Z_n^{-1}\exp(-n\,tr(V(M)))\,d M \end{equation*} defined on complex Hermitian matrices $M$ of size $n\times n$, where $V$ is real analytic such that the underlying density of states is one-cut regular. Considering the average \begin{equation*}
  E_n[\phi;\lambda,\alpha,\beta]:=\mathbb{E}_n\bigg(\prod_{\ell=1}^n\big(1-\phi(\lambda_{\ell}(M))\big)\omega_{\alpha\beta}(\lambda_{\ell}(M)-\lambda)\bigg),\ \ \ \ \ \omega_{\alpha\beta}(x):=|x|^{\alpha}\begin{cases}1,&amp;x&lt;0\\ \beta,&amp;x\geq 0\end{cases}, \end{equation*} taken with respect to the above law and where $\phi$ is a suitable test function, we evaluate its large-$n$ asymptotic assuming that $\lambda$ lies within the soft edge boundary layer, and $(\alpha,\beta)\in\mathbb{R}\times\mathbb{C}$ satisfy $\alpha&gt;-1,\beta\notin(-\infty,0)$. Our results are obtained by using Riemann-Hilbert problems for orthogonal polynomials and integrable operators and they extend previous results of Forrester and Witte \cite{FW} that were obtained by an application of Okamoto's $\tau$-function theory. A key role throughout is played by distinguished solutions to the Painlev\'e-XXXIV equation.</description>

      <title>Abel's problem, Gauss and Cartier congruences over number fields</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.16281</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.16281v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Abel's problem consists in identifying the conditions under which the diferential equation $y'=\eta y$, with $\eta$ an algebraic function in $\mathbb{C}(x)$, possesses a non-zero algebraic solution $y$. This problem has been algorithmically solved by Risch. In a previous paper, we have presented an alternative solution in the special arithmetic situation where $\eta$ has a Puiseux expansion with $\textit{rational}$ coefficients at the origin: there exists a non-trivial algebraic solution of $y'=\eta y$ if and only if the coefficients of the Puiseux expansion of $x\eta(x)$ at $0$ satisfy Gauss congruences for almost all prime numbers. In this paper, we generalize this criterion to arbitrary $\eta$ algebraic over $\overline{\mathbb{Q}}(x)$, by means of a natural generalization to number fields of Gauss congruences and of the weaker Cartier congruences recently introduced in this context by Bostan. We then provide applications of this criterion in the hypergeometric setting and for Artin-Mazur zeta functions.</description>
