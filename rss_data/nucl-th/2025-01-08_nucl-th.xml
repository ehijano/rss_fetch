      <title>Lattice Effective Field Theory Simulations of Nuclei</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.03303</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.03303v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Lattice effective field theory applies the principles of effective field theory in a lattice framework where space and time are discretized. Nucleons are placed on the lattice sites, and the interactions are tuned to replicate the observed features of the nuclear force. Monte Carlo simulations are then employed to predict the properties of nuclear few- and many-body systems. We review the basic methods and several theoretical and algorithmic advances that have been used to further our understanding of atomic nuclei.</description>

      <title>New Skyrme parametrizations to describe finite nuclei and neutron star matter with realistic effective masses. II. Adjusting the spin-dependent terms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.03411</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.03411v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Many common Skyrme functionals present ferromagnetic instabilities or unrealistic density dependence of the spin-1 Landau parameters. To solve these problems, we consider the Skyrme interaction as a density-functional rather than a density-dependent two-body force. This allows us to adjust the spin-dependent terms of the new extended Skyrme functionals of our previous paper [M. Duan and M. Urban, Phys. Rev. C 110, 065806 (2024)] independently without altering the properties of spin saturated matter. The parameters of the spin-dependent terms are determined by fitting the Landau parameters $G_0$ and $G_0^\prime$ in neutron matter and symmetric nuclear matter and the effective-mass splitting of up and down particles in spin polarized matter to the results of microscopic calculations. Using the new parametrizations, called Sky3s and Sky4s, the spin-related properties of nuclear matter are in good agreement with the microscopic results. As an application, we compute response functions and neutrino scattering rates of neutron-star matter with the new functionals having realistic effective masses and Landau parameters.</description>

      <title>Determining the Duration of the Hadronic Stage at RHIC-BES Energies via Resonance Suppression Using a Full Set of Rate Equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.03893</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.03893v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present realistic estimates for the duration of the hadronic stage in central Au+Au reactions in the RHIC-BES energy regime. To this aim, we employ a full set of coupled rate equations to describe the time evolution of the system from chemical to kinetic freeze-out. Combined with the recently measured data by the STAR collaboration on $K^*/K$ ratios, we show that the previous estimates substantially underestimated the duration of this stage due to the omission of the regeneration of hadron resonances. We provide an improved relation between the $K^*/K$ ratio at chemical and kinetic freeze-out and the life time of the hadronic phase. The calculated improved life times are now in line with estimates from other methods and are relevant for the NA61 and STAR collaborations and for upcoming experiments at the FAIR facility.</description>

      <title>Nuclear cross sections from low-energy interactions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.03958</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.03958v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a method to calculate neutron scattering cross sections for deformed nuclei using many--body wavefunctions described with multiple reference states. Nuclear states are calculated with the generator coordinate method using a low energy effective Hamiltonian. Using these states, a non--local and energy dependent optical potential is consistently constructed, allowing to directly investigate the role of nuclear structure properties in nuclear scattering. The case of neutron scattering on $^{24}$Mg is presented. The results are compared to experiment and to phenomenological optical potentials at energies below 13 MeV, demonstrating the importance of low--energy collectivity in elastic and non--elastic scattering.</description>

      <title>Neutrino energy and momentum emission from magnetized dense quark matter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.03318</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.03318v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Using first-principles field-theoretic methods, we investigate neutrino emission from strongly magnetized dense quark matter under conditions relevant to compact stars. We develop a customized approximation that fully accounts for the Landau-level quantization of electron states while neglecting such quantization for quarks. This approach is well-justified in dense quark matter, where the chemical potentials of up and down quarks significantly exceed those of electrons. Our analysis provides a detailed exploration of the influence of strong magnetic fields on neutrino emission, including both the modification of the total emission rate and the emergence of emission asymmetry relative to the magnetic field direction. We further examine the role of temperature in smoothing the oscillatory behavior of neutrino emission as a function of magnetic field strength. Additionally, we study the interplay between the Landau-level quantization of electrons and the Fermi-liquid effects of quarks in modifying the phase space of relevant weak processes. Finally, we briefly discuss the broader implications of magnetic fields on stellar cooling processes and the potential contribution of asymmetric neutrino emission to pulsar kicks.</description>

      <title>Bell Inequality Violation of Light Quarks in Back-to-Back Dihadron Pair Production at Lepton Colliders</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.03321</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.03321v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Spin correlations between particles produced at colliders provide valuable insights for quantum information studies. While traditional studies of quantum information at colliders are typically limited to massive particles with perturbative decay, we propose an innovative method to explore the Bell inequality in massless quark pair systems by analyzing the azimuthal correlations in back-to-back $\pi^+\pi^-$ dihadron pair production at lepton colliders. Revisiting the Belle data, we have shown the potential to detect Bell inequality violation of light quarks by introducing an additional angular cut, achieving a significance of 2.5 $\sigma$ even in the worst-case scenario of 100% correlated systematic uncertainties in each bins. The significance substantially exceeds $5\sigma$ when considering uncorrelated systematic uncertainties. Our approach opens avenues for exploring spin quantum information in the non-perturbative aspect and leverages existing data for quantum information research.</description>

      <title>Rapidity asymmetry of jet-hadron correlation as a robust signal of diffusion wake induced by di-jets in high-energy heavy-ion collisions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.03419</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.03419v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The diffusion wake accompanying a Mach cone is a unique feature of the medium response to jet-medium interaction inside the quark-gluon plasma in high-energy heavy-ion collisions. It leads to a depletion of soft hadrons in the opposite direction of the propagating jet as recently observed in $Z$-jet events of Pb+Pb collisions at LHC. In di-jet events, however, the diffusion wake of one jet usually overlaps with the medium-induced hadron enhancement of other jet with no clear signal of the diffusion wake except a reduction of the hadron enhancement, unless there is a large rapidity gap between the two jets. We propose to use the rapidity asymmetry of jet-hadron correlations in di-jets with a finite rapidity gap relative to that without, as a robust signal of the diffusion wake. The asymmetry emerges because the diffusion wake of one jet is shifted to a finite rapidity relative to the other jet. This shift leads to a depletion of soft hadrons in the rapidity region of the diffusion wake and an enhancement in the rapidity region of the other jet whose soft hadron enhancement is no longer or less reduced by the diffusion wake as in di-jets without a rapidity gap. We predict the rapidity asymmetry using both theoretical and mixed-event background subtraction for different values of the rapidity gap within the CoLBT-hydro model. Experimental measurements of this rapidity asymmetry with high statistics data on di-jets should provide more precise insights into the jet-induced diffusion wake and properties of the quark-gluon plasma.</description>

      <title>Right-handed weak currents in neutrinoless $\beta \beta $ decays and ton scale $\beta\beta$ detectors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.03454</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.03454v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Right handed weak currents (RHCs) in the left-right (L-R) symmetric model are examined in neutrinoless double beta decays ($0\nu$ DBDs) of both $0^+ \to 0^+$ and $0^+ \to 2^+$ transitions. The structures of the nuclear matrix elements (NMEs) of $\langle m\rangle$, $\langle\lambda\rangle$ and $\langle\eta\rangle$ terms are studied in detail for these two transitions. In case of $0^+ \to 0^+$ transition, the enhancement mechanisms of the $\langle\eta\rangle$ term over the $\langle\lambda\rangle$ term are shown. The $\Delta$ isobar contribution to the NME for the transition to the $2^+$ state is evaluated to be of the order of 10-20% of the NME. Measurements of both $\beta\beta $ and $\gamma$ rays associated with $0\nu$ DBDs by means of the ton-scale DBD detectors under construction are used to study the effective RHCs around $\langle\lambda\rangle \approx 10^{-7}$ and $\langle\eta\rangle \approx 10^{-10}$. These values depend on the phase space and the NME with the effective weak coupling of $g_{\rm A}^{eff}$.</description>

      <title>Strange mesons with one dynamical gluon: A light-front approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.03476</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.03476v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We obtain the mass spectra of strange mesons using a light-front quantized Hamiltonian with Quantum Chromodynamics (QCD) input, incorporating quark-antiquark and quark-antiquark-gluon Fock components, along with a three-dimensional confinement. We work within the basis light-front quantization framework. The resulting eigenvectors can simultaneously describe the kaon's electromagnetic form factor, decay constant, distribution amplitude, and quark and gluon distribution functions under QCD scale evolution. Using the obtained kaon parton distribution functions (PDFs), supplemented by established nuclear PDFs, we also predict the kaon-nucleus-induced Drell-Yan cross section, which is expected to be measured soon by COMPASS++/AMBER at CERN.</description>

      <title>The Gallium Solar Neutrino Capture Cross Section Revisited</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.03528</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.03528v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Solar neutrino flux constraints from the legacy GALLEX/GNO and SAGE experiments continue to influence contemporary global analyses of neutrino properties. The constraints depend on the neutrino absorption cross sections for various solar sources. Following recent work updating the $^{51}$Cr and $^{37}$Ar neutrino source cross sections, we reevaluate the $^{71}$Ga solar neutrino cross sections, focusing on contributions from transitions to $^{71}$Ge excited states, but also revising the ground-state transition to take into account new $^{71}$Ge electron-capture lifetime measurements and various theory corrections. The excited-state contributions have been traditionally taken from forward-angle $(p,n)$ cross sections. Here we correct this procedure for the $\approx 10\%-20\%$ tensor operator contribution that alters the relationship between Gamow-Teller and $(p,n)$ transition strengths. Using state-of-the-art nuclear shell-model calculations to evaluate this correction, we find that it lowers the $^8$B and hep neutrino cross sections. However, the addition of other corrections, including contributions from near-threshold continuum states that radiatively decay, leads to an overall increase in the $^8$B and hep cross sections of $\approx 10\%$ relative to the values recommended by Bahcall. Uncertainties are propagated using Monte Carlo simulations.</description>

      <title>Study of some properties of deconfined matter: Resummed perturbation theory and beyond</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.03604</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.03604v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The present thesis is devoted to the study of some of the features of the deconfined state of matter dubbed Quark-Gluon Plasma (QGP). The different properties of the extreme matter that have been studied in this thesis are next-to-leading order dispersion properties for soft-moving quarks, screening masses of mesons, drag and diffusion properties of heavy quarks, the specific shear viscosity of QGP and energy loss of heavy quarks propagating in QGP background. The theoretical techniques which are utilized in order to study these properties are mainly hard thermal loop effective theory, which is required when one is interested in studying the soft scale physics of the underlined theory QCD at finite temperatures, and the other techniques, which are utilized here is the nonperturbative resummation approach dubbed as Gribov quantization. This nonperturbative resummation deals with the magnetic scale of the theory through the Gribov mass parameter.</description>

      <title>The impact of mass uncertainties on the r-process nucleosynthesis in neutron star mergers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.03633</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.03633v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Theoretical predictions of element yields from the rapid neutron capture (r-) process are subject to large uncertainties due to incomplete knowledge of nuclear properties and approximative hydrodynamical modeling of matter ejection. A major source of uncertainty in determining ejecta composition and radioactive decay heat is the lack of nuclear mass data for exotic neutron-rich nuclei produced during neutron irradiation.
  We examine both model (systematic) and parameter (statistical) uncertainties affecting nuclear mass predictions and their impact on r-process nucleosynthesis, and consequently, the composition of neutron star merger ejecta. To estimate the effect of model uncertainties, we consider five nuclear mass models that accurately describe known masses. We also use a backward-forward Monte Carlo method to estimate uncorrelated uncertainties from local variations in model parameters, constraining them to experimentally known masses before propagating them to unknown masses of neutron-rich nuclei.
  These mass uncertainties are then applied to a 1.38-1.38 M$_{\odot}$ neutron star merger model, considering a wide range of ejecta trajectories. We find that uncorrelated parameter uncertainties lead to ejected abundance uncertainties of 20% up to A $\simeq$ 130, 40% between A=150 and 200, with peaks around A $\simeq$ 140 and A $\simeq$ 203, leading to deviations of 100-300%. While correlated model uncertainties generally exceed parameter uncertainties for most nuclei, both have a significant impact on heavy element production.
  Overall, improvements in nuclear models are essential to reducing uncertainties in r-process predictions. Both correlated model uncertainties and coherent determination of parameter uncertainties are crucial for sensitivity analysis in r-process nucleosynthesis.</description>

      <title>Dispersion effects in elastic electron scattering from $^{208}$Pb</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.13469</link>
      <description>arXiv:2307.13469v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Dispersion corrections to elastic electron scattering from $^{208}$Pb at energies up to 150 MeV are estimated within the second-order Born approximation. All strong transient nuclear excited states with angular momentum up to $L=3$ and natural parity are taken into consideration. It is found that at small scattering angles the high-lying $L=1$ isovector states provide the dominant contribution to the dispersive change of the differential cross section and of the beam-normal spin asymmetry. At the backmost angles these changes are considerably smaller and are basically due to the isoscalar $L=2$ and, to a lesser extent, $L=3$ states. In comparison with the findings for $^{12}$C, the dispersive cross-section modifications for $^{208}$Pb are significantly larger, while the spin-asymmetry changes are much smaller at all angles. The latter originates from the destructive interference of the multipole contributions in $^{208}$Pb that switch sign when proceeding from $L$ to $L+1$. This mechanism might be the origin of the small beam-normal spin asymmetries recently measured in ${}^{208}$Pb at much larger energies.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.19295v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We have studied the feasibility of the experimental determination of the width of a $D$ meson in a nuclear medium by using the method of the nuclear transparency. The cross section for inclusive production of a $D^+$ in different nuclei is evaluated, taking care of the $D^+$ absorption in the nucleus, or equivalently, the survival probability of the $D^+$ in its way out of the nucleus from the point of production. We use present values of the in medium width of $D$ mesons and calculate ratios of the cross sections for different nuclei to the $^{12} \text{C} $ nucleus as reference. We find ratios of the order of $0.6$ for heavy nuclei, a large deviation from unity, which indicates that the method proposed is adequate to measure this relevant magnitude, so far only known theoretically.</description>

We use several Walecka-type hadronic models and obtain the dispersion relations for the longitudinal modes. The isovector and isoscalar collective modes are determined for a wide range of densities as a function of isospin asymmetry and momentum transfer within a set of eleven relativistic mean field models with different nuclear matter properties. Special attention is given to beta-equilibrium matter. It is shown that the possible propagation of isoscalar and isovector-like modes depends directly on the density dependence of the symmetric nuclear matter equation of state and of the symmetry energy, with a stiff equation of state favouring the propagation of isoscalar like collective modes at high densities, and a stiff symmetry energy defining the behavior of the isovector like modes which propagate for densities below two times saturation density. The coupling of the nuclear modes to the electron plasmon is also discussed.</description>

      <title>Effects of Landau quantization on neutrino emission and absorption</title>

Abstract: Some neutron stars known as magnetars possess very strong magnetic fields, with surface fields as large as $10^{15}\,\rm G$ and internal fields that are possibly stronger. Recent observations of the radio pulsar GLEAM-X J1627 suggest it may have a surface field as strong as $10^{16} \,\rm G$. In the presence of a strong magnetic field, the energy levels of electrons and protons are quantized and the Direct Urca process allows neutron stars to cool rapidly, even at low density. For the case of magnetic fields $B \geq 10^{16}\,\rm G$, we find features in the emissivity due to energy quantization that are not captured by the frequently employed quasiclassical approximation where energy levels are treated as nearly continuous. Resonances can result in amplification of the neutrino emissivity at specific densities compared to a calculation that neglects quantization, particularly at low temperature. These effects are not important for the thermal evolution of an entire neutron star, but may be relevant for phenomena that depend on behavior at specific densities. We present a fully relativistic calculation of the Direct Urca rate in a strong magnetic field using the standard V-A weak Lagrangian incorporating mean field nuclear effects and discuss approaches to the numerical challenge the modified wavefunctions present and a new semi-analytic approximation. These tools are also applicable to calculating neutrino opacities in strong magnetic fields in the ejecta of binary neutron star mergers. We calculate the opacities for neutrinos capturing on free nucleons at sub-saturation densities and temperatures exceeding an MeV. We find an enhancement to capture processes of the lowest energy neutrinos by an order of magnitude or more due to suppression of electron Pauli blocking in the case of capture on neutrons, and from the effect of the nucleon magnetic moments in the case of capture on protons.</description>

      <title>Distinguishing charged lepton flavor violation scenarios with inelastic $\mu\rightarrow e$ conversion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.17166</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.17166v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The Mu2e and COMET experiments are expected to improve existing limits on charged lepton flavor violation (CLFV) by roughly four orders of magnitude. $\mu\rightarrow e$ conversion experiments are typically optimized for electrons produced without nuclear excitation, as this maximizes the electron energy and minimizes backgrounds from the free decay of the muon. Here we argue that Mu2e and COMET will be able to extract additional constraints on CLFV from inelastic $\mu \rightarrow e$ conversion, given the $^{27}$Al target they have chosen and backgrounds they anticipate. We describe CLFV scenarios in which inelastic CLFV can induce measurable distortions in the near-endpoint spectrum of conversion electrons, including cases where certain contributing operators cannot be probed in elastic $\mu \rightarrow e$ conversion. We extend the nonrelativistic EFT treatment of elastic $\mu \rightarrow e$ conversion to include the new nuclear operators needed for the inelastic process, evaluate the associated nuclear response functions, and describe several new-physics scenarios where the inelastic process can provide additional information on CLFV.</description>

      <title>QCD with background electromagnetic fields on the lattice: a review</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.19780</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.19780v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This review provides a comprehensive summary of results on the physics of strongly interacting matter in the presence of background electromagnetic fields, obtained via numerical lattice simulations of the underlying theory, Quantum Chromodynamics (QCD). Lattice QCD has guided our understanding of magnetized quarks and gluons via landmark results on the phase diagram, the equation of state, the confinemenent mechanism, anomalous transport phenomena as well as many more fascinating effects. Some of the lattice results lead to completely new paradigms in the description of hot magnetized quark matter and provided useful insights to a broad high-energy particle physics community. Since the first lattice QCD simulations with background fields, this field has been established as an independent research direction. We present the current status and recent developments of this field, together with an outlook including open questions to be answered in the near future.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.06340v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this short letter, I present a powerful application in dimensionality reduction of the lesser-used Jacobi-Davidson algorithm for the generalized eigenvalue decomposition. When combined with matrix-free implementations of relevant operators, this technique allows for the computation of the dynamics of an arbitrary quantum state to be done in $\mathcal{O}(n)$ time, where $n$ is the size of the original Hilbert space.</description>

      <title>Simplified projection on total spin zero for state preparation on quantum computers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.02848</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.02848v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We introduce a simple algorithm for projecting on $J=0$ states of a many-body system by performing a series of rotations to remove states with angular momentum projections greater than zero. Existing methods rely on unitary evolution with the two-body operator $J^2$, which when expressed in the computational basis contains many complicated Pauli strings requiring Trotterization and leading to very deep quantum circuits. Our approach performs the necessary projections using the one-body operators $J_x$ and $J_z$. By leveraging the method of Cartan decomposition, the unitary transformations that perform the projection can be parameterized as a product of a small number of two-qubit rotations, with angles determined by an efficient classical optimization. Given the reduced complexity in terms of gates, this approach can be used to prepare approximate ground states of even-even nuclei by projecting onto the $J=0$ component of deformed Hartree-Fock states. We estimate the resource requirements in terms of the universal gate set {$H$,$S$,CNOT,$T$} and briefly discuss a variant of the algorithm that projects onto $J=1/2$ states of a system with an odd number of fermions.</description>

      <title>Neutrino nucleus Quasi-Elastic and resonant Neutral Current scatterings with Non-Standard Interactions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.13349</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.13349v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: As well known, the cross sections of the resonance and Quasi-Elastic (QE) scattering off nucleons depend on quantities known as form factors that describe the nucleon structure. There are alternative approaches to determine the values of these non-perturbative quantities, some of them relying on the Neutral Current (NC) scattering of neutrinos off nucleons. In the presence of NC Non-Standard Interactions (NSI), such derivations must be revisited. The aim of the present paper is to discuss how information on NSI can be extracted by combining alternative approaches for deriving the form factors. We discuss how the KamLAND atmospheric neutrino data with $E_\nu&lt;{\rm GeV}$ (used to determine the axial strange form factor $g_A^s$) can already constrain the axial NSI of $\nu_\tau$ with nucleons. We also argue that if the precision measurement of $\nu_\mu$ NC QE scattering establishes unexpectedly large vector strange form factor ({\it e.g.,} $F_1^s(Q^2)\sim 0.01$), it will be an indication for nonzero NSI coupling with $u$ and $d$ quarks ($\epsilon_{\mu\mu}^{Au/d}\sim 0.01$). We study the QE and resonance scattering cross sections of $\nu_\tau$ and $\nu_e$ off Argon and show that if their axial NSI is of the order of (but of course below) the present bounds, the deviation of QE cross sections from the SM prediction will be sizable and distinct from the uncertainties induced by the form factors.</description>
