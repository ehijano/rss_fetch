      <title>Weakly-sparse and strongly flip-flat classes of graphs are uniformly almost-wide</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.04610</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.04610v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work we take a step towards characterising strongly flip-flat classes of graphs. Strong flip-flatness appears to be the analogue of uniform almost-wideness in the setting of dense classes of graphs. We prove that strongly flip-flat classes of graphs that are weakly sparse are indeed uniformly almost-wide.</description>

      <title>Polynomial-Time Pseudodeterministic Construction of Primes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.15140</link>
      <description>arXiv:2305.15140v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A randomized algorithm for a search problem is *pseudodeterministic* if it produces a fixed canonical solution to the search problem with high probability. In their seminal work on the topic, Gat and Goldwasser posed as their main open problem whether prime numbers can be pseudodeterministically constructed in polynomial time.
  We provide a positive solution to this question in the infinitely-often regime. In more detail, we give an *unconditional* polynomial-time randomized algorithm $B$ such that, for infinitely many values of $n$, $B(1^n)$ outputs a canonical $n$-bit prime $p_n$ with high probability. More generally, we prove that for every dense property $Q$ of strings that can be decided in polynomial time, there is an infinitely-often pseudodeterministic polynomial-time construction of strings satisfying $Q$. This improves upon a subexponential-time construction of Oliveira and Santhanam.
  Our construction uses several new ideas, including a novel bootstrapping technique for pseudodeterministic constructions, and a quantitative optimization of the uniform hardness-randomness framework of Chen and Tell, using a variant of the Shaltiel--Umans generator.</description>

      <title>Coloring Grids Avoiding Bicolored Paths</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.12919</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.12919v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The star chromatic number on a graph is the minimum number of colors in a proper vertex coloring forbidding any $P_4$ with two colors (bicolored). This problem was introduced by Gr\"unbaum (1973) together with the acyclic coloring of graphs, where bicolored cycles are avoided. In this paper, we study a generalization of this problem, by considering proper vertex coloring on graphs forbidding bicolored paths of a fixed length, which was initially discussed by Alon, McDiarmid, and Reed (1991). Here, we study this problem on products of two paths. We show that at least 4 colors are needed to properly color the product of paths, $P_m\square P_n$, avoiding a bicolored $P_k,$ unless $n&lt;k-2$ or $m&lt;k-2.$ With this result, the above question is settled for all $k$ on 2-dimensional grids.</description>

      <title>Convolutive sequences, I: Through the lens of integer partition functions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.10965</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.10965v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Motivated by the convolutive behavior of the counting function for partitions with designated summands in which all parts are odd, we consider coefficient sequences $(a_n)_{n\ge 0}$ of primitive eta-products that satisfy the generic convolutive property
  \begin{align*}
  \sum_{n\ge 0} a_{mn} q^n = \left(\sum_{n\ge 0} a_n q^n\right)^m
  \end{align*}
  for a specific positive integer $m$. Given the results of an exhaustive search of the Online Encyclopedia of Integer Sequences for such sequences for $m$ up to $6$, we first focus on the case where $m=2$ with our attention mainly paid to the combinatorics of two $2$-convolutive sequences, featuring bijective proofs for both. For other $2$-convolutive sequences discovered in the OEIS, we apply generating function manipulations to show their convolutivity. We also give two examples of $3$-convolutive sequences. Finally, we discuss other convolutive series that are not eta-products.</description>

      <title>Independent sets and colorings of $K_{t,t,t}$-free graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.17191</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.17191v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Alon, Krivelevich, and Sudakov conjectured in 1999 that every $F$-free graph of maximum degree at most $\Delta$ has chromatic number $O(\Delta / \log \Delta)$. This was previously known only for almost bipartite graphs, that is, for subgraphs of $K_{1,t,t}$ (verified by Alon, Krivelevich, and Sudakov themselves), while most recent results were concerned with improving the leading constant factor in the case where $F$ is almost bipartite. We prove this conjecture for all $3$-colorable graphs $F$, i.e. subgraphs of $K_{t,t,t}$, representing the first progress toward the conjecture since it was posed.
  A closely related conjecture of Ajtai, Erd\H{o}s, Koml\'os, and Szemer\'edi from 1981 asserts that for every graph $F$, every $n$-vertex $F$-free graph of average degree $d$ contains an independent set of size $\Omega(n \log d / d)$. We prove this conjecture in a strong form for all 3-colorable graphs $F$. More precisely, we show that every $n$-vertex $K_{t,t,t}$-free graph of average degree $d$ contains an independent set of size at least $(1 - o(1)) n \log d / d$, matching Shearer's celebrated bound for triangle-free graphs (the case $t = 1$) and thereby yielding a substantial strengthening of it. Our proof combines a new variant of the R\"odl nibble method for constructing independent sets with a Tur\'an-type result on $K_{t,t,t}$-free graphs.</description>
