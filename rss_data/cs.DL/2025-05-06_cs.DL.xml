      <title>Running a Data Integration Lab in the Context of the EHRI Project: Challenges, Lessons Learnt and Future Directions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.02455</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.02455v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Historical study of the Holocaust is commonly hampered by the dispersed and fragmented nature of important archival sources relating to this event. The EHRI project set out to mitigate this problem by building a trans-national network of archives, researchers, and digital practitioners, and one of its main outcomes was the creation of the EHRI Portal, a "virtual observatory" that gathers in one centralised platform descriptions of Holocaust-related archival sources from around the world. In order to build the Portal a strong data identification and integration effort was required, culminating in the project's third phase with the creation of the EHRI-3 data integration lab. The focus of the lab was to lower the bar to participation in the EHRI Portal by providing support to institutions in conforming their archival metadata with that required for integration, ultimately opening the process up to smaller institutions (and even so-called "micro-archives") without the necessary resources to undertake this process themselves. In this paper we present our experiences from running the data integration lab and discuss some of the challenges (both of a technical and social nature), how we tried to overcome them, and the overall lessons learnt. We envisage this work as an archetype upon which other practitioners seeking to pursue similar data integration activities can build their own efforts.</description>

      <title>VisTaxa: Developing a Taxonomy of Historical Visualizations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.01724</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.01724v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Historical visualizations are a rich resource for visualization research. While taxonomy is commonly used to structure and understand the design space of visualizations, existing taxonomies primarily focus on contemporary visualizations and largely overlook historical visualizations. To address this gap, we describe an empirical method for taxonomy development. We introduce a coding protocol and the VisTaxa system for taxonomy labeling and comparison. We demonstrate using our method to develop a historical visualization taxonomy by coding 400 images of historical visualizations. We analyze the coding result and reflect on the coding process. Our work is an initial step toward a systematic investigation of the design space of historical visualizations.</description>

      <title>Research impact evaluation based on effective authorship contribution sensitivity: h-leadership index</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.18236</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.18236v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The evaluation of a researcher's performance has traditionally relied on various bibliometric measures, with the h-index being one of the most prominent. However, the h-index only accounts for the number of citations received in a publication and does not account for other factors such as the number of authors or their specific contributions in collaborative works. Therefore, the h-index has been placed on scrutiny as it has motivated academic integrity issues where non-contributing authors get authorship merely for raising their h-index. In this study, we comprehensively evaluate existing metrics in their ability to account for authorship contribution by their position and introduce a novel variant of the h-index, known as the h-leadership index. The h-leadership index aims to advance the fair evaluation of academic contributions in multi-authored publications by giving importance to authorship position beyond the first and last authors, motivated by Stanford's ranking of the top 2 \% of world scientists. We assign weighted citations based on a modified complementary unit Gaussian curve, ensuring that the contributions of middle authors are appropriately recognised. We apply the h-leadership index to analyse the top 50 researchers across the Group of 8 (Go8) universities in Australia, demonstrating its potential to provide a more balanced assessment of research performance. We provide open-source software for extending the work further.</description>

      <title>Curbing the Ramifications of Authorship Abuse in Science</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.02769</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.02769v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Research performance is often measured using bibliometric indicators, such as publication count, total citations, and $h$-index. These metrics influence career advancements, salary adjustments, administrative opportunities, funding prospects, and professional recognition. However, the reliance on these metrics has also made them targets for manipulation, misuse, and abuse. One primary ethical concern is authorship abuse, which includes paid, ornamental, exploitative, cartel, and colonial authorship. These practices are prevalent because they artificially enhance multiple bibliometric indicators all at once. Our study confirms a significant rise in the mean and median number of authors per publication across multiple disciplines over the last 34 years. While it is important to identify the cases of authorship abuse, a thorough investigation of every paper proves impractical. In this study, we propose a credit allocation scheme based on the reciprocals of the Fibonacci numbers, designed to adjust credit for individual contributions while systematically reducing credit for potential authorship abuse. The proposed scheme aligns with rigorous authorship guidelines from scientific associations, which mandate significant contributions across most phases of a study, while accommodating more lenient guidelines from scientific publishers, which recognize authorship for minimal contributions. We recalibrate the traditional bibliometric indicators to emphasize author contribution rather than participation in publications. Additionally, we propose a new indicator, $T^{\prime}$-index, to assess researchers' leading and contributing roles in their publications. Our proposed credit allocation scheme mitigates the effects of authorship abuse and promotes a more ethical scientific ecosystem.</description>

      <title>A Computational Analysis and Visualization of In-Text Reference Networks Across Philosophical Texts</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.20065</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.20065v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We applied computational methods to analyze references across 2,245 philosophical texts, spanning from approximately 550 BCE to 1940 AD, in order to measure patterns in how philosophical ideas have spread over time. Using natural language processing and network analysis, we mapped over 294,970 references between authors, classifying each reference into subdisciplines of philosophy based on its surrounding context. We then constructed a graph, with authors as nodes and textual references as edges, to empirically validate, visualize, and quantify intellectual lineages as they are understood within philosophical scholarship. For instance, we find that Plato and Aristotle alone account for nearly 10% of all references from authors in our dataset, suggesting that their influence may still be underestimated. As another example, we support the view that St. Thomas Aquinas served as a synthesizer between Aristotelian and Christian philosophy by analyzing the network structures of Aquinas, Aristotle, and Christian theologians. Our results are presented through an interactive visualization tool, allowing users to dynamically explore these networks, alongside a mathematical analysis of the network's structure. Our methodology demonstrates the value of applying network analysis with textual references to study a large collection of historical works.</description>

      <title>Billions at Stake: How Self-Citation Adjusted Metrics Can Transform Equitable Research Funding</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.20081</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.20081v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Citation metrics serve as the cornerstone of scholarly impact evaluation despite their well-documented vulnerability to inflation through self-citation practices. This paper introduces the Self-Citation Adjusted Index (SCAI), a sophisticated metric designed to recalibrate citation counts by accounting for discipline-specific self-citation patterns. Through comprehensive analysis of 5,000 researcher profiles across diverse disciplines, we demonstrate that excessive self-citation inflates traditional metrics by 10-20%, potentially misdirecting billions in research funding. Recent studies confirm that self-citation patterns exhibit significant gender disparities, with men self-citing up to 70% more frequently than women, exacerbating existing inequalities in academic recognition. Our open-source implementation provides comprehensive tools for calculating SCAI and related metrics, offering a more equitable assessment of research impact that reduces the gender citation gap by approximately 8.5%. This work contributes to the paradigm shift toward transparent, nuanced, and equitable research evaluation methodologies in academia, with direct implications for funding allocation decisions that collectively amount to over $100 billion annually in the United States alone.</description>

      <title>A meta-analysis of impact factors of astrophysics journals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.03342</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.03342v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We calculate the 2024 impact factors for the 38 most widely used journals in Astrophysics, using the citations collated by NASA/ADS (Astrophysics Data System) and compare them to the official impact factors. This includes journals which publish papers outside of astrophysics such as PRD, EPJC, Nature, etc. We also propose a new metric to gauge the impact factor based on the median number of citations in a journal and calculate the same for all the journals. We find that the ADS-based impact factors are mostly in agreement, albeit higher than the official impact factors for most journals. The journals with the maximum fractional difference in median-based and old impact factors are JHEAP and PTEP. We find the maximum difference between the ADS and official impact factor for Nature.</description>
