      <title>Incorporating stochastic gene expression, signaling-mediated intercellular interactions, and regulated cell proliferation in models of coordinated tissue development</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.11271</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.11271v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Formulating quantitative and predictive models for tissue development requires consideration of the complex, stochastic gene expression dynamics, its regulation via cell-to-cell interactions, and cell proliferation. Including all of these processes into a practical mathematical framework requires complex expressions that are difficult to interpret and apply. We construct a simple theory that incorporates intracellular stochastic gene expression dynamics, signaling chemicals that influence these dynamics and mediate cell-cell interactions, and cell proliferation and its accompanying differentiation. Cellular states (genetic and epigenetic) are described by a Waddington vector field that allows for non-gradient dynamics (cycles, entropy production, loss of detailed balance) which is precluded in Waddington potential landscape representations of gene expression dynamics. We define an epigenetic fitness landscape that describes the proliferation of different cell types, and elucidate how this fitness landscape is related to Waddington's vector field. We illustrate the applicability of our framework by analyzing two model systems: an interacting two-gene differentiation process and a spatiotemporal organism model inspired by planaria.</description>

      <title>Decoding Dmrt1: Insights into vertebrate sex determination and gonadal sex differentiation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.12060</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.12060v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Dmrt1 is pivotal in testis formation and function by interacting with genes crucial for Sertoli cell differentiation. Dmrt1, or Sox9, forms a conserved antagonistic interaction with Foxl2 across mammals. Across 128 vertebrate species, Dmrt1 exhibits sexually dimorphic expression, implicating its role in master regulation of sex determination and gonadal sex differentiation. Dmrt1 emerges as a master/upstream sex-determining gene in one fish, frog, chicken and turtle. Recent studies suggest epigenetic regulation of Dmrt1 in its promoter methylation, and transposable element insertion introducing epigenetic modification to cis-regulatory elements of Dmrt1, alongside non-coding RNA involvement, in a wide spectrum of sex-determining mechanisms ranging from genetic factors, to interactions between genetic factors with the environment, to solely environmental factors. Additionally, alternative splicing of Dmrt1 was found in all major vertebrate groups except amphibians. Dmrt1 has evolved many lineage-specific isoforms (ranging from 2 to 10), and various isoforms showed sex, tissue or development-specific expression, which is in contrast to the highly conserved sex-specific splicing of its homolog Dsx across insects. Future research should focus on understanding the molecular basis of environmental sex determination from a broader taxon, and the molecular basis of epigenetic regulation. It is also essential to understand why and how multiple alternative splicing variants of Dmrt1 evolve in vertebrates, the specific roles each isoform plays in sex determination and gonadal sex differentiation, as well as the significant differences in the molecular mechanisms and functions of alternative splicing between Dmrt1 in vertebrates and Dsx in insects. Understanding the differences could provide deeper insights into the evolution of sex-determining mechanisms between vertebrates and insects.</description>
