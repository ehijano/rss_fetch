      <title>Joint Transmitter and Receiver Design for Movable Antenna Enhanced Multicast Communications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.11881</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.11881v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Movable antenna (MA) is an emerging technology that utilizes localized antenna movement to pursue better channel conditions for enhancing communication performance. In this paper, we study the MA-enhanced multicast transmission from a base station equipped with multiple MAs to multiple groups of single-MA users. Our goal is to maximize the minimum weighted signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio (SINR) among all the users by jointly optimizing the position of each transmit/receive MA and the transmit beamforming. To tackle this challenging problem, we first consider the single-group scenario and propose an efficient algorithm based on the techniques of alternating optimization and successive convex approximation. Particularly, when optimizing transmit or receive MA positions, we construct a concave lower bound for the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) of each user by applying only the second-order Taylor expansion, which is more effective than existing works utilizing two-step approximations. The proposed design is then extended to the general multi-group scenario. Simulation results demonstrate that significant performance gains in terms of achievable max-min SNR/SINR can be obtained by our proposed algorithm over benchmark schemes. Additionally, the proposed algorithm can notably reduce the required amount of transmit power or antennas for achieving a target level of max-min SNR/SINR performance compared to benchmark schemes.</description>

      <title>On Target Detection in the Presence of Clutter in Joint Communication and Sensing Cellular Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.12133</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.12133v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent works on joint communication and sensing (JCAS) cellular networks have proposed to use time division mode (TDM) and concurrent mode (CM), as alternative methods for sharing the resources between communication and sensing signals. While the performance of these JCAS schemes for object tracking and parameter estimation has been studied in previous works, their performance on target detection in the presence of clutter has not been analyzed. In this paper, we propose a detection scheme for estimating the number of targets in JCAS cellular networks that employ TDM or CM resource sharing. The proposed detection method allows for the presence of clutter and/or temporally correlated noise. This scheme is studied with respect to the JCAS trade-off parameters that allow to control the time slots in TDM and the power resources in CM allocated to sensing and communications. The performance of two fundamental transmit beamforming schemes, typical for JCAS, is compared in terms of the receiver operating characteristics curves. Our results indicate that in general the TDM scheme gives a somewhat better detection performance compared to the CM scheme, although both schemes outperform existing approaches provided that their respective trade-off parameters are tuned properly.</description>

      <title>Tailoring Fault-Tolerance to Quantum Algorithms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.11953</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.11953v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The standard approach to universal fault-tolerant quantum computing is to develop a general purpose quantum error correction mechanism that can implement a universal set of logical gates fault-tolerantly. Given such a scheme, any quantum algorithm can be realized fault-tolerantly by composing the relevant logical gates from this set. However, we know that quantum computers provide a significant quantum advantage only for specific quantum algorithms. Hence, a universal quantum computer can likely gain from compiling such specific algorithms using tailored quantum error correction schemes. In this work, we take the first steps towards such algorithm-tailored quantum fault-tolerance. We consider Trotter circuits in quantum simulation, which is an important application of quantum computing. We develop a solve-and-stitch algorithm to systematically synthesize physical realizations of Clifford Trotter circuits on the well-known $[\![ n,n-2,2 ]\!]$ error-detecting code family. Our analysis shows that this family implements Trotter circuits with optimal depth, thereby serving as an illuminating example of tailored quantum error correction. We achieve fault-tolerance for these circuits using flag gadgets, which add minimal overhead. The solve-and-stitch algorithm has the potential to scale beyond this specific example and hence provide a principled approach to tailored fault-tolerance in quantum computing.</description>

      <title>Unknown Interference Modeling for Rate Adaptation in Cell-Free Massive MIMO Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.12148</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.12148v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Co-channel interference poses a challenge in any wireless communication network where the time-frequency resources are reused over different geographical areas. The interference is particularly diverse in cell-free massive multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) networks, where a large number of user equipments (UEs) are multiplexed by a multitude of access points (APs) on the same time-frequency resources. For realistic and scalable network operation, only the interference from UEs belonging to the same serving cluster of APs can be estimated in real-time and suppressed by precoding/combining. As a result, the unknown interference arising from scheduling variations in neighboring clusters makes the rate adaptation hard and can lead to outages. This paper aims to model the unknown interference power in the uplink of a cell-free massive MIMO network. The results show that the proposed method effectively describes the distribution of the unknown interference power and provides a tool for rate adaptation with guaranteed target outage.</description>

      <title>Secure Semantic Communication for Image Transmission in the Presence of Eavesdroppers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.12170</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.12170v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Semantic communication (SemCom) has emerged as a key technology for the forthcoming sixth-generation (6G) network, attributed to its enhanced communication efficiency and robustness against channel noise. However, the open nature of wireless channels renders them vulnerable to eavesdropping, posing a serious threat to privacy. To address this issue, we propose a novel secure semantic communication (SemCom) approach for image transmission, which integrates steganography technology to conceal private information within non-private images (host images). Specifically, we propose an invertible neural network (INN)-based signal steganography approach, which embeds channel input signals of a private image into those of a host image before transmission. This ensures that the original private image can be reconstructed from the received signals at the legitimate receiver, while the eavesdropper can only decode the information of the host image. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed approach maintains comparable reconstruction quality of both host and private images at the legitimate receiver, compared to scenarios without any secure mechanisms. Experiments also show that the eavesdropper is only able to reconstruct host images, showcasing the enhanced security provided by our approach.</description>

      <title>The Explicit values of the UBCT, the LBCT and the DBCT of the inverse function</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.12208</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.12208v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Substitution boxes (S-boxes) play a significant role in ensuring the resistance of block ciphers against various attacks. The Upper Boomerang Connectivity Table (UBCT), the Lower Boomerang Connectivity Table (LBCT) and the Double Boomerang Connectivity Table (DBCT) of a given S-box are crucial tools to analyze its security concerning specific attacks. However, there are currently no related results for this research. The inverse function is crucial for constructing S-boxes of block ciphers with good cryptographic properties in symmetric cryptography. Therefore, extensive research has been conducted on the inverse function, exploring various properties related to standard attacks. Thanks to the recent advancements in boomerang cryptanalysis, particularly the introduction of concepts such as UBCT, LBCT, and DBCT, this paper aims to further investigate the properties of the inverse function $F(x)=x^{2^n-2}$ over $\gf_{2^n}$ for arbitrary $n$. As a consequence, by carrying out certain finer manipulations of solving specific equations over $\gf_{2^n}$, we give all entries of the UBCT, LBCT of $F(x)$ over $\gf_{2^n}$ for arbitrary $n$. Besides, based on the results of the UBCT and LBCT for the inverse function, we determine that $F(x)$ is hard when $n$ is odd. Furthermore, we completely compute all entries of the DBCT of $F(x)$ over $\gf_{2^n}$ for arbitrary $n$. Additionally, we provide the precise number of elements with a given entry by means of the values of some Kloosterman sums. Further, we determine the double boomerang uniformity of $F(x)$ over $\gf_{2^n}$ for arbitrary $n$. Our in-depth analysis of the DBCT of $F(x)$ contributes to a better evaluation of the S-box's resistance against boomerang attacks.</description>

      <title>Deterministic Patterns for Multiple Access with Latency and Reliability Guarantees</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2202.09890</link>
      <description>arXiv:2202.09890v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study a scenario in which multiple uncoordinated devices aim to achieve reliable transmissions within a given time frame. The devices are intermittently active and access a shared pool of channel resources in a grant-free manner by utilizing multiple transmissions (K-repetition coding). This allows them to achieve diversity and improve the reliability within a certain latency constraint. We focus on two access methods: one where devices choose K slots at random and another one where the access patterns are deterministic and follow a specific code design, namely the Steiner System. We analyze the problem under two signal models that involve different complexity for the receiver. First, collision model is considered, where only interference-free transmissions can be used and combined. Second, a model treating interference as noise is analyzed, where the receiver is capable of utilizing all K replicas, applying maximum ratio combining (MRC). For both signal models, we investigate receivers with and without successive interference cancellation (SIC). We develop approximations and bounds for the outage probabilities that very closely match simulation results. Overall, we show that deterministic access patterns have the potential to significantly outperform random selection in terms of reliability. Furthermore, deterministic access patterns offer a simplified system design.</description>

      <title>Incremental Measurement of Structural Entropy for Dynamic Graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2207.12653</link>
      <description>arXiv:2207.12653v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Structural entropy is a metric that measures the amount of information embedded in graph structure data under a strategy of hierarchical abstracting. To measure the structural entropy of a dynamic graph, we need to decode the optimal encoding tree corresponding to the best community partitioning for each snapshot. However, the current methods do not support dynamic encoding tree updating and incremental structural entropy computation. To address this issue, we propose Incre-2dSE, a novel incremental measurement framework that dynamically adjusts the community partitioning and efficiently computes the updated structural entropy for each updated graph. Specifically, Incre-2dSE includes incremental algorithms based on two dynamic adjustment strategies for two-dimensional encoding trees, i.e., the naive adjustment strategy and the node-shifting adjustment strategy, which support theoretical analysis of updated structural entropy and incrementally optimize community partitioning towards a lower structural entropy. We conduct extensive experiments on 3 artificial datasets generated by Hawkes Process and 3 real-world datasets. Experimental results confirm that our incremental algorithms effectively capture the dynamic evolution of the communities, reduce time consumption, and provide great interpretability.</description>

Abstract: Edge artificial intelligence (AI) has been a promising solution towards 6G to empower a series of advanced techniques such as digital twins, holographic projection, semantic communications, and auto-driving, for achieving intelligence of everything. The performance of edge AI tasks, including edge learning and edge AI inference, depends on the quality of three highly coupled processes, i.e., sensing for data acquisition, computation for information extraction, and communication for information transmission. However, these three modules need to compete for network resources for enhancing their own quality-of-services. To this end, integrated sensing-communication-computation (ISCC) is of paramount significance for improving resource utilization as well as achieving the customized goals of edge AI tasks. By investigating the interplay among the three modules, this article presents various kinds of ISCC schemes for federated edge learning tasks and edge AI inference tasks in both application and physical layers.</description>

      <title>Successive Refinement of Shannon Cipher System Under Maximal Leakage</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.07203</link>
      <description>arXiv:2308.07203v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the successive refinement setting of Shannon cipher system (SCS) under the maximal leakage secrecy metric for discrete memoryless sources under bounded distortion measures. Specifically, we generalize the threat model for the point-to-point rate-distortion setting of Issa, Wagner and Kamath (T-IT 2020) to the multiterminal successive refinement setting. Under mild conditions that correspond to partial secrecy, we characterize the asymptotically optimal normalized maximal leakage region for both the joint excess-distortion probability (JEP) and the expected distortion reliability constraints. Under JEP, in the achievability part, we propose a type-based coding scheme, analyze the reliability guarantee for JEP and bound the leakage of the information source through compressed messages. In the converse part, by analyzing a guessing scheme of the eavesdropper, we prove the optimality of our achievability result. Under expected distortion, the achievability part is established similarly to the JEP counterpart. The converse proof proceeds by generalizing the corresponding results for the rate-distortion setting of SCS by Schieler and Cuff (T-IT 2014) to the successive refinement setting. Somewhat surprisingly, the normalized maximal leakage regions under both JEP and expected distortion constraints are identical under certain conditions, although JEP appears to be a stronger reliability constraint.</description>

      <title>Improved bounds on the interactive capacity via error pattern analysis</title>

      <description>arXiv:2401.15355v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Any interactive protocol between a pair of parties can be reliably simulated in the presence of noise with a multiplicative overhead on the number of rounds (Schulman 1996). The reciprocal of the best (least) overhead is called the interactive capacity of the noisy channel.
  In this work, we present lower bounds on the interactive capacity of the binary erasure channel. Our lower bound improves the best known bound due to Ben-Yishai et al. 2021 by roughly a factor of 1.75. The improvement is due to a tighter analysis of the correctness of the simulation protocol using error pattern analysis. More precisely, instead of using the well-known technique of bounding the least number of erasures needed to make the simulation fail, we identify and bound the probability of specific erasure patterns causing simulation failure.
  We remark that error pattern analysis can be useful in solving other problems involving stochastic noise, such as bounding the interactive capacity of different channels.</description>

Abstract: In this paper, we investigate the application of hexagonal quadrature amplitude modulation (HQAM) in reconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS)-assisted networks, specifically focusing on its efficiency in reducing the number of required reflecting elements. Specifically, we present analytical expressions for the average symbol error probability (ASEP) and propose a new metric for conditioned energy efficiency, which assesses the network energy consumption while ensuring the ASEP remains below a certain threshold. Additionally, we introduce an innovative detection algorithm for HQAM constellations that implements sphere decoding in O(1) complexity. Finally, our study reveals that HQAM significantly enhances both the ASEP and energy efficiency compared to traditional quadrature amplitude modulation (QAM) schemes.</description>

      <title>Geometric relative entropies and barycentric R\'enyi divergences</title>

      <description>arXiv:2207.14282v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We give systematic ways of defining monotone quantum relative entropies and (multi-variate) quantum R\'enyi divergences starting from a set of monotone quantum relative entropies.
  Despite its central importance in information theory, only two additive and monotone quantum extensions of the classical relative entropy have been known so far, the Umegaki and the Belavkin-Staszewski relative entropies. Here we give a general procedure to construct monotone and additive quantum relative entropies from a given one with the same properties; in particular, when starting from the Umegaki relative entropy, this gives a new one-parameter family of monotone and additive quantum relative entropies interpolating between the Umegaki and the Belavkin-Staszewski ones on full-rank states.
  In a different direction, we use a generalization of a classical variational formula to define multi-variate quantum R\'enyi quantities corresponding to any finite set of quantum relative entropies $(D^{q_x})_{x\in X}$ and signed probability measure $P$, as $$ Q_P^{\mathrm{b},\mathbf{q}}((\rho_x)_{x\in X}):=\sup_{\tau\ge 0}\left\{\text{Tr}\,\tau-\sum_xP(x)D^{q_x}(\tau\|\rho_x)\right\}. $$ We show that monotone quantum relative entropies define monotone R\'enyi quantities whenever $P$ is a probability measure. With the proper normalization, the negative logarithm of the above quantity gives a quantum extension of the classical R\'enyi $\alpha$-divergence in the 2-variable case ($X=\{0,1\}$, $P(0)=\alpha$). We show that if both $D^{q_0}$ and $D^{q_1}$ are monotone and additive quantum relative entropies, and at least one of them is strictly larger than the Umegaki relative entropy then the resulting barycentric R\'enyi divergences are strictly between the log-Euclidean and the maximal R\'enyi divergences, and hence they are different from any previously studied quantum R\'enyi divergence.</description>

      <title>Precise Asymptotics for Spectral Methods in Mixed Generalized Linear Models</title>

      <description>arXiv:2211.11368v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In a mixed generalized linear model, the objective is to learn multiple signals from unlabeled observations: each sample comes from exactly one signal, but it is not known which one. We consider the prototypical problem of estimating two statistically independent signals in a mixed generalized linear model with Gaussian covariates. Spectral methods are a popular class of estimators which output the top two eigenvectors of a suitable data-dependent matrix. However, despite the wide applicability, their design is still obtained via heuristic considerations, and the number of samples $n$ needed to guarantee recovery is super-linear in the signal dimension $d$. In this paper, we develop exact asymptotics on spectral methods in the challenging proportional regime in which $n, d$ grow large and their ratio converges to a finite constant. By doing so, we are able to optimize the design of the spectral method, and combine it with a simple linear estimator, in order to minimize the estimation error. Our characterization exploits a mix of tools from random matrices, free probability and the theory of approximate message passing algorithms. Numerical simulations for mixed linear regression and phase retrieval demonstrate the advantage enabled by our analysis over existing designs of spectral methods.</description>

Abstract: Quantum entanglement is a crucial resource for learning properties from nature, but a precise characterization of its advantage can be challenging. In this work, we consider learning algorithms without entanglement to be those that only utilize states, measurements, and operations that are separable between the main system of interest and an ancillary system. Interestingly, we show that these algorithms are equivalent to those that apply quantum circuits on the main system interleaved with mid-circuit measurements and classical feedforward. Within this setting, we prove a tight lower bound for Pauli channel learning without entanglement that closes the gap between the best-known upper and lower bound. In particular, we show that $\Theta(2^n\varepsilon^{-2})$ rounds of measurements are required to estimate each eigenvalue of an $n$-qubit Pauli channel to $\varepsilon$ error with high probability when learning without entanglement. In contrast, a learning algorithm with entanglement only needs $\Theta(\varepsilon^{-2})$ copies of the Pauli channel. The tight lower bound strengthens the foundation for an experimental demonstration of entanglement-enhanced advantages for Pauli noise characterization.</description>

      <title>HCL-MTSAD: Hierarchical Contrastive Consistency Learning for Accurate Detection of Industrial Multivariate Time Series Anomalies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.08224</link>

Abstract: Multivariate Time Series (MTS) anomaly detection focuses on pinpointing samples that diverge from standard operational patterns, which is crucial for ensuring the safety and security of industrial applications. The primary challenge in this domain is to develop representations capable of discerning anomalies effectively. The prevalent methods for anomaly detection in the literature are predominantly reconstruction-based and predictive in nature. However, they typically concentrate on a single-dimensional instance level, thereby not fully harnessing the complex associations inherent in industrial MTS. To address this issue, we propose a novel self-supervised hierarchical contrastive consistency learning method for detecting anomalies in MTS, named HCL-MTSAD. It innovatively leverages data consistency at multiple levels inherent in industrial MTS, systematically capturing consistent associations across four latent levels-measurement, sample, channel, and process. By developing a multi-layer contrastive loss, HCL-MTSAD can extensively mine data consistency and spatio-temporal association, resulting in more informative representations. Subsequently, an anomaly discrimination module, grounded in self-supervised hierarchical contrastive learning, is designed to detect timestamp-level anomalies by calculating multi-scale data consistency. Extensive experiments conducted on six diverse MTS datasets retrieved from real cyber-physical systems and server machines, in comparison with 20 baselines, indicate that HCL-MTSAD's anomaly detection capability outperforms the state-of-the-art benchmark models by an average of 1.8\% in terms of F1 score.</description>
