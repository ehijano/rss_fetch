      <title>Could a gravity inversion exist within the Hollow Earth of Legendary's Monsterverse?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.02867</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.02867v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: One of the most popular movie franchises of late is Legendary's Monsterverse as is evidenced by the gross earnings of the series recently surpassing the two and a half billion dollar mark with the release of $\it{Godzilla X Kong}$. As is typical with many movies of this genre, in order to enjoy them one must suspend their disbelief when it comes to the laws of physics. While there are a plethora of examples of violations of basic principles (the square-cube law being the prime example) the idea of a "gravity inversion" occurring inside of the "Hollow Earth" is among the most debated as well as the most relevant to the storylines of the recent movies. The intent of this paper is to show that, while typical scientific arguments refuting the possibility of such an inversion are definitely completely correct, a slight modification of the conditions assumed to exist inside the planet in these arguments may allow for the inversion to actually occur.</description>

      <title>Careful finite element simulations of cold rolling with accurate through-thickness resolution and prediction of residual stress</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.03242</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.03242v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we carefully develop a finite element (FE) model that gives accurate through-thickness predictions of stress and strain distributions during the steady-state cold rolling process. These through-thickness predictions unveil an oscillatory pattern that is shown to have important consequences for residual stress in the rolled sheet. We believe this is the first time that through-thickness FE results have been accurately validated by comparison to non-FE results, in this case by comparison to a recent analytical model of through-thickness variation in cold rolling. While we use here the ABAQUS commercially available FE software, our observations are relevant to all FE simulations of cold rolling. Care is taken by considering both convergence in number of elements through thickness, convergence to a steady state, and the avoidance of other numerical artefacts such as shear locking and hourglassing. We find that previous FE models of cold rolling are usually woefully under-resolved through-thickness; e.g. using 10 elements through-thickness, while we require 60 here for convergence. Convergence of roll force and roll torque, used in previous studies to validate models, are shown to be poor indicators of through-thickness convergence. We also show that the through-thickness oscillatory pattern may have important consequences for predicting curvature during asymmetric rolling.</description>
