      <title>The universal logic of repeated experiments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.00118</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.00118v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $\mathsf{E}$ be the event space of an experiment that can be indefinitely repeated, in such a way that the result of one repetition does not affect the result of the other. A natural question arises: given a countable cardinal $\kappa$, which is the event space of the $\kappa$-times repeated experiment? In the case of classical experiments, where $\mathsf{E}$ is a (complete) Boolean algebra on some set $S$, i.e. a \textit{classical }or\textit{ distributive logic}, the answer is more and less known: the (complete) Boolean algebra on $S^{\kappa}$ generated by $\mathsf{E}^{\kappa}$. But, what if $\mathsf{E}$ is not a Boolean algebra? In this paper we give a constructive answer to this question for any $\kappa$ and in the context of general orthocomplemented complete lattices, i.e. \textit{general logics}. Concretely, given a general logic $\mathsf{E}$ defining the event space of a given experiment, we construct a logic $\mathsf{U}_{\kappa}\left(\mathsf{E}\right)$ representing the event space of the $\kappa$-times repeated experiment, in such a way that $\mathsf{U}_{\kappa}\left(\mathsf{E}\right)$ and $\mathsf{E}$ are isomorphic if $\kappa=1$, and such that $\mathsf{U}_{\kappa}\left(\mathsf{E}\right)$ is distributive if and only if so is $\mathsf{E}$. We also extend our construction to the case in which the event space changes from one repetition to another and the cardinal $\kappa$ is arbitrary. This gives rise to tensor products $\bigotimes_{\alpha\in\kappa}\mathsf{E}_{\alpha}$ of families $\left\{ \mathsf{E}_{\alpha}\right\} _{\alpha\in\kappa}$ of orthocomplemented complete lattices, in terms of which $\mathsf{U}_{\kappa}\left(\mathsf{E}\right)=\bigotimes_{\alpha\in\kappa}\mathsf{E}$.</description>

      <title>Measures and stability in a model, revisited</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.00211</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.00211v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This article is written in celebration of the 8th Kazakh-French Logical Colloquium. We expand on an unpublished research note of the second author. We record some results concerning local Keisler measures with respect to a formula which is stable in a model. We prove that in this context, every local Keisler measure on the associated local type space is a weighted sum of (at most countably many) types. Using this observation, we give an elementary proof of the commutativity of the Morley product in this context. We then give a functional analytic proof that the double limit property lifts to the appropriate evaluation map on pairs of local measures. We end with some comments on the NOP and local measures in the (properly) stable context.</description>

      <title>Schmidt's Game and Vitali Sets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.00401</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.00401v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: While many types of non-measurable sets are never $(\alpha, \beta)$-winning in the sense of Schmidt's game, we show that this is not the case for certain Vitali sets. Our main theorems show that for certain values of $\alpha, \beta$ one can construct a Vitali set which is $(\alpha, \beta)$-winning, while for other values of $\alpha,\beta$ every Vitali set is $(\alpha,\beta)$-losing. We also investigate the $(\alpha,\beta)$-Schmidt game for various other types of pathological sets, highlighting their differences from Vitali sets.</description>

      <title>Complexity of deep computations via topology of function spaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.00528</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.00528v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We use topological methods to study complexity of deep computations and limit computations. We use topology of function spaces, specifically, the classification Rosenthal compacta, to identify new complexity classes. We use the language of model theory, specifically, the concept of \emph{independence} from Shelah's classification theory, to translate between topology and computation. We use the theory of Rosenthal compacta to characterize approximablility of deep computations, both deterministically and probabilistically.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2601.00006v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this addendum to [4], we provide a pair of counterexamples relevant to the theory of implicit operations. More precisely, we exhibit a pp expansion of a variety that fails to be a variety (although it is a quasivariety). Furthermore, we construct a sequence of varieties possessing a nonequational congruence preserving Beth companion.</description>

      <title>Orbit equivalence of Cantor minimal systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.00179</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.00179v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper we study the descriptive complexity of the topological orbit equvalence relation for some Borel classes of Cantor minimal systems. Specifically, we study the Borel class of all Cantor minimal systems with only finitely many ergodic measures, and show that the orbit equivalence for this class is Borel bireducible with the equivalence relation $=^+$. We prove the same for the subclass of regular $\{0, 1\}$-Toeplitz subshifts or that of the uniquely ergodic minimal subshifts. We also study the orbit equivalence for the Borel class of minimal subshifts of finite topological rank. Denote by $R_n$ the orbit equivalence for minimal subshifts of topological rank $n\geq 2$. We prove that for any $n\geq 2$, $R_n$ is virtually countable, i.e., Borel reducible to a countable Borel equivalence relation. Moreover, $R_2$ is virtually amenable. On the other hand, $R_n$ is not smooth when $n\geq 2$, is not virtually hyperfinite when $n\geq 4$, and is not virtually treeable when $n\geq 5$. For any $n\geq 2$, our contructions yield uniquely ergodic minimal subshifts of topological rank exactly $n$.</description>

      <title>The Complexity of Connectedness Relations on Polish Spaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.00601</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.00601v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We systematically investigate three different equivalence relations of connectedness: being connected by arcs, being connected by continua and being connected by chains of continua of decreasing diameter. The investigation is conducted from the point of view of Borel reductions, mainly on Polish spaces. All of the studied equivalence relations turn out to be tied together and intimately related to the arc-connection relation. Among other results, it is shown that the arc-connection relation in the plane is Borel reducible to the Vitali equivalence relation and thus of a very low complexity. The same is proven for the chain continuum-connection relation on locally compact subsets of the plane, on which the continuum-connection relation is shown to have higher complexity.</description>

      <title>On orthoposets of numerical events in quantum logic</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.00772</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.00772v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Let S be a set of states of a physical system and p(s) the probability of the occurrence of an event when the system is in state s in S. Such a function p from S to [0,1] is known as a numerical event or more accurately an S-probability. A set P of numerical events including the constant functions 0 and 1 and 1-p with every p in P becomes a poset when ordered by the order of real functions and can serve as a general setting for quantum logics. We call such a poset P a general set of events (GSE). The thoroughly investigated algebras of S-probabilities (including Hilbert logics), concrete logics and Boolean algebras can all be represented within this setting. In this paper we study various classes of GSEs, in particular those that are orthoposets and their interrelations and connections to known logics. Moreover, we characterize GSEs as posets by means of states and discuss the situation for GSEs to be lattices.</description>

      <title>On the Provability Logic of HA</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2206.00445</link>
      <description>arXiv:2206.00445v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We axiomatize the provability logic of $\HA$ and prove its decidability. Furthermore, we axiomatize the preservativity and relative admissibility relations for several modal logics extending iK4. A principal technical tool is the introduction of a new type of semantics, termed \emph{provability models}, for modal logics extending iGL. This semantics combines elements of standard Kripke semantics with provability in propositional modal logics.</description>

      <title>Decomposing the automorphism group of the surreal numbers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.22374</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.22374v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the automorphism group of the field of surreal numbers. Our main structure theorem presents a decomposition of this group into a product of five significant factors. Using the representation of surreal numbers as generalized power series via their Conway normal form, we apply results on Hahn fields and groups from the literature in order to obtain this decomposition. Moreover, we provide explicit descriptions of the individual factors enabling us to construct automorphisms on the field of surreal numbers from simpler components. We then extend our study to strongly linear automorphisms in connection to derivations, as well as automorphisms that preserve further exponential structure on the surreals.</description>

      <title>Partition Principle without Choice via Symmetric Iterations and Sheaf-Toposes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.07675</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.07675v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the topos $\mathcal{E}=\mathsf{Sh}(H\ltimes 2^{\mathbb{N}})$ arising from a nontrivial finite group $H$ acting freely on Cantor space.
  Using a local embedding property for the relevant epimorphisms together with effective descent for monomorphisms,
  we show that the \emph{internal} set universe $V$ obtained from algebraic set theory (AST) inside $\mathcal{E}$
  satisfies the Partition Principle.
  On the other hand, the quotient $q:X\to X/H$ is a small epimorphism in $\mathcal{E}$ with no section,
  and this yields (via the display interpretation) an internal surjection in $V$ with no internal section; hence $V\models\neg\mathsf{AC}$.
  In summary, $\mathcal{E}$ contains an internal model of $\mathsf{IZF}+\mathsf{PP}+\neg\mathsf{AC}$
  (and if $\mathcal{E}$ is Boolean, equivalently after $\neg\neg$-sheafification, this upgrades to $\mathsf{ZF}+\mathsf{PP}+\neg\mathsf{AC}$).</description>

      <title>Symmetric Iterations with Countable and $&lt;\kappa$-Support: A Framework for Choiceless ZF Extensions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.07866</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.07866v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present a unified framework for symmetric iterations with countable and, more generally, $&lt;\kappa$-support. Set-length iterations are handled uniformly, and, when the template is first-order definable over a G\"odel-Bernays set theory with Global Choice ground, the same scheme yields class-length iterations. Limit stages with $\mathrm{cf}(\lambda)\ge\kappa$ are treated by direct limits; limits with $\mathrm{cf}(\lambda)&lt;\kappa$ are presented as inverse limits via trees of conditions and tuple-stabilizer filters. The induced limit filters are normal and $\kappa$-complete, which ensures closure of hereditarily symmetric names and preservation of ZF; under a $\kappa$-Baire (strategic-closure) hypothesis we obtain $DC_{&lt;\kappa}$, and under a Localization hypothesis we obtain $DC_\kappa$. For countable support we give an $\omega_1$-length construction that adds reals and refutes AC while preserving ZF+DC, and we show that mixed products (e.g., Cohen with Random) fit naturally via stable pushforwards and restrictions. For singular $\kappa$, we prove the case $\mathrm{cf}(\kappa)=\omega$ in full using block-partition stabilizers and trees; for arbitrary singular $\kappa$ we introduce game-guided fusion of length $\mathrm{cf}(\kappa)$ and a tree-fusion master condition, yielding singular-limit completeness, preservation of $DC_{&lt;\kappa}$, no collapse of $\kappa$, and no new bounded subsets of $\kappa$. The resulting toolkit provides reusable patterns for constructing choiceless inner models that retain targeted fragments of Dependent Choice.</description>

      <title>From Internal to External: Classical Models of ZF + PP + $\neg$AC</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.09764</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.09764v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Goal. We analyze when the Partition Principle ($\mathsf{PP}$) holds without $\mathsf{AC}$ in models arising from a free finite $H$-action on Cantor space, and reconcile two standard routes to such models. Approach. Route I proceeds via a Boolean-valued presentation $\mathrm{Sh}(\mathbb{B})$ and symmetric names; Route II uses direct forcing with $\mathrm{Fn}(\mathbb{N}\times H,2)$ and finite-support automorphisms. We prove a unification theorem identifying the resulting symmetric submodels and develop a Local-to-Global Embedding Principle (LEP) for hereditarily symmetric names. Results. We prove external $\mathsf{PP}$ in the symmetric model $N$ built via Route II. From LEP we obtain that $\mathsf{PP}$ holds in the symmetric model, hence $N\models \mathsf{ZF}+\mathsf{PP}+\neg\mathsf{AC}$. Along the way, we unify the Route I/Route II presentations functorially. Limitations. Our proof exploits the countable-support stratification of $\mathrm{Fn}(\mathbb{N}\times H,2)$; extending the LEP/gluing to uncountable presentations (e.g. $\mathrm{Fn}(\kappa\times H,2)$ for $\kappa&gt;\omega$) or, more generally, to $\kappa$-directed families of finite supports remains open.</description>
