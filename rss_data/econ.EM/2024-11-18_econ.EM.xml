      <title>Bayesian estimation of finite mixtures of Tobit models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.09771</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.09771v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper outlines a Bayesian approach to estimate finite mixtures of Tobit models. The method consists of an MCMC approach that combines Gibbs sampling with data augmentation and is simple to implement. I show through simulations that the flexibility provided by this method is especially helpful when censoring is not negligible. In addition, I demonstrate the broad utility of this methodology with applications to a job training program, labor supply, and demand for medical care. I find that this approach allows for non-trivial additional flexibility that can alter results considerably and beyond improving model fit.</description>

      <title>Sharp Testable Implications of Encouragement Designs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.09808</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.09808v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper studies the sharp testable implications of an additive random utility model with a discrete multi-valued treatment and a discrete multi-valued instrument, in which each value of the instrument only weakly increases the utility of one choice. Borrowing the terminology used in randomized experiments, we call such a setting an encouragement design. We derive inequalities in terms of the conditional choice probabilities that characterize when the distribution of the observed data is consistent with such a model. Through a novel constructive argument, we further show these inequalities are sharp in the sense that any distribution of the observed data that satisfies these inequalities is generated by this additive random utility model.</description>

      <title>Semiparametric inference for impulse response functions using double/debiased machine learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.10009</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.10009v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce a double/debiased machine learning (DML) estimator for the impulse response function (IRF) in settings where a time series of interest is subjected to multiple discrete treatments, assigned over time, which can have a causal effect on future outcomes. The proposed estimator can rely on fully nonparametric relations between treatment and outcome variables, opening up the possibility to use flexible machine learning approaches to estimate IRFs. To this end, we extend the theory of DML from an i.i.d. to a time series setting and show that the proposed DML estimator for the IRF is consistent and asymptotically normally distributed at the parametric rate, allowing for semiparametric inference for dynamic effects in a time series setting. The properties of the estimator are validated numerically in finite samples by applying it to learn the IRF in the presence of serial dependence in both the confounder and observation innovation processes. We also illustrate the methodology empirically by applying it to the estimation of the effects of macroeconomic shocks.</description>

      <title>Dynamic Causal Effects in a Nonlinear World: the Good, the Bad, and the Ugly</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.10415</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.10415v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Applied macroeconomists frequently use impulse response estimators motivated by linear models. We study whether the estimands of such procedures have a causal interpretation when the true data generating process is in fact nonlinear. We show that vector autoregressions and linear local projections onto observed shocks or proxies identify weighted averages of causal effects regardless of the extent of nonlinearities. By contrast, identification approaches that exploit heteroskedasticity or non-Gaussianity of latent shocks are highly sensitive to departures from linearity. Our analysis is based on new results on the identification of marginal treatment effects through weighted regressions, which may also be of interest to researchers outside macroeconomics.</description>

      <title>Time-Varying Parameters as Ridge Regressions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2009.00401</link>
      <description>arXiv:2009.00401v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Time-varying parameters (TVPs) models are frequently used in economics to capture structural change. I highlight a rather underutilized fact -- that these are actually ridge regressions. Instantly, this makes computations, tuning, and implementation much easier than in the state-space paradigm. Among other things, solving the equivalent dual ridge problem is computationally very fast even in high dimensions, and the crucial "amount of time variation" is tuned by cross-validation. Evolving volatility is dealt with using a two-step ridge regression. I consider extensions that incorporate sparsity (the algorithm selects which parameters vary and which do not) and reduced-rank restrictions (variation is tied to a factor model). To demonstrate the usefulness of the approach, I use it to study the evolution of monetary policy in Canada using large time-varying local projections. The application requires the estimation of about 4600 TVPs, a task well within the reach of the new method.</description>

      <title>Reproducible Aggregation of Sample-Split Statistics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.14204</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.14204v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Statistical inference is often simplified by sample-splitting. This simplification comes at the cost of the introduction of randomness not native to the data. We propose a simple procedure for sequentially aggregating statistics constructed with multiple splits of the same sample. The user specifies a bound and a nominal error rate. If the procedure is implemented twice on the same data, the nominal error rate approximates the chance that the results differ by more than the bound. We illustrate the application of the procedure to several widely applied econometric methods.</description>

      <title>Bayesian Bi-level Sparse Group Regressions for Macroeconomic Density Forecasting</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.02671</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.02671v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We propose a Machine Learning approach for optimal macroeconomic density forecasting in a high-dimensional setting where the underlying model exhibits a known group structure. Our approach is general enough to encompass specific forecasting models featuring either many covariates, or unknown nonlinearities, or series sampled at different frequencies. By relying on the novel concept of bi-level sparsity in time-series econometrics, we construct density forecasts based on a prior that induces sparsity both at the group level and within groups. We demonstrate the consistency of both posterior and predictive distributions. We show that the posterior distribution contracts at the minimax-optimal rate and, asymptotically, puts mass on a set that includes the support of the model. Our theory allows for correlation between groups, while predictors in the same group can be characterized by strong covariation as well as common characteristics and patterns. Finite sample performance is illustrated through comprehensive Monte Carlo experiments and a real-data nowcasting exercise of the US GDP growth rate.</description>
