      <title>Visibility property in one and several variables and its applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.15298</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.15298v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper we report our investigations on visibility with respect to the Kobayashi distance and its applications, with a special focus on planar domains. We prove that totally disconnected subsets of the boundary are removable in the context of visibility. We also show that a domain in $\mathbb{C}^n$ is a local weak visibility domain if and only if it is a weak visibility domain. The above holds also for visibility. Along the way, we prove an intrinsic localization result for the Kobayashi distance. Moreover, we observe some interesting consequences of weak visibility; for example, weak visibility implies compactness of the end topology of the closure of the domain. For planar domains: (i) We provide examples of visibility domains that are not locally Goldilocks at any boundary point. (ii) We provide certain general conditions on planar domains that yield the continuous extension of conformal maps, generalizing the Carath\'{e}odory extension theorem. Our conditions are quite general and assume very little regularity of the boundary. We demonstrate this through examples. (iii) We also provide conditions for the homeomorphic extension of biholomorphic maps up to the boundary. (iv) We prove that a hyperbolic, simply connected domain possesses the visibility property if and only if its boundary is locally connected. This leads us to reformulate the MLC conjecture in terms of visibility. (v) We provide a characterization of visibility for a large class of planar domains including certain uncountably connected domains.</description>

      <title>Diverse beam search to find densest-known planar unit distance graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.15317</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.15317v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper addresses the problem of determining the maximum number of edges in a unit distance graph (UDG) of $n$ vertices using computer search. An unsolved problem of Paul Erd\H{o}s asks the maximum number of edges $u(n)$ a UDG of $n$ vertices can have. Those UDGs that attain $u(n)$ are called "maximally dense." In this paper, we seek to demonstrate a computer algorithm to generate dense UDGs for vertex counts up to at least 100. Via beam search with an added visitation metric, our algorithm finds all known maximally dense UDGs up to isomorphism at the push of a button. In addition, for $15 &lt; n$, where $u(n)$ is unknown, i) the algorithm finds all previously published densest UDGs up to isomorphism for $15 &lt; n \le 30$, and ii) the rate of growth of $u(n)/n$ remains similar for $30 &lt; n$. The code and database of over 60 million UDGs found by our algorithm will be open-sourced at time of publication.</description>

      <title>Intrinsic Flat Limit of Positive Scalar Curvature Manifolds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.15332</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.15332v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Here we construct a sequence of closed oriented Riemannian $n$-manifolds, $n\geq 3$, with positive scalar curvature such that their intrinsic flat limit has negative scalar curvature.</description>

      <title>Simplex slicing: an asymptotically-sharp lower bound</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.13224</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.13224v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We show that for the regular n-simplex, the 1-codimensional central slice that's parallel to a facet will achieve the minimum area (up to a 1-o(1) factor) among all 1-codimensional central slices, thus improving the previous best known lower bound (Brzezinski 2013) by a factor of $\frac{2\sqrt{3}}{e} \approx 1.27$. In addition to the standard technique of interpreting geometric problems as problems about probability distributions and standard Fourier-analytic techniques, we rely on a new idea, mainly \emph{changing the contour of integration} of a meromorphic function.</description>

      <title>Analytic capacity and dimension of sets with plenty of big projections</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2204.05804</link>
      <description>arXiv:2204.05804v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Our main result marks progress on an old conjecture of Vitushkin. We show that a compact set in the plane with plenty of big projections (PBP) has positive analytic capacity, along with a quantitative lower bound. A higher dimensional counterpart is also proved for capacities related to the Riesz kernel, including the Lipschitz harmonic capacity. The proof uses a construction of a doubling Frostman measure on a lower content regular set, which may be of independent interest. Our second main result is the Analyst's Traveling Salesman Theorem for sets with plenty of big projections. As a corollary, we obtain a lower bound for the Hausdorff dimension of uniformly wiggly sets with PBP. The second corollary is an estimate for the capacities of subsets of sets with PBP, in the spirit of the quantitative solution to Denjoy's conjecture.</description>
