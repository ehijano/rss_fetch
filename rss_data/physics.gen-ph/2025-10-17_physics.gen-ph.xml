      <title>On the nature of light</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.13833</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.13833v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Electromagnetism is at the heart of the Standard Model, but despite all the successes of modern theory, our basic description of light traveling in free space remains unsatisfactory. The four bosons that compose light are introduced in a rather trivial way, simply by quantizing the (scalar and vector) potential amplitudes. This leads to quite a few conceptual problems linked to the two virtual photons, the longitudinal and scalar ones. Moreover, the spin of the photon is rather poorly handled by the conventional Quantum Electro-Dynamics theory. Therefore: what if the field's Lagrangian density, to some extent, would not be properly chosen? Here we look at these questions from a completely different point of view, bypassing the problems encountered in conventional theories. We choose a pragmatic approach that relies only on basic Condensed Matter like Quantum Mechanics, and a specific gauge fixing procedure for the potential field: we propose the concept of gauge duality, which leads to an original quantization scheme. Building on the Poincar\'e symmetries, all constants of motion are identified. Four bosons are introduced, responsible for a proper spin 1 pseudo-vector and parity and charge related operators. They emerge from scalar fields that can be viewed as generalized fluxes (in the sense of M. Devoret), with quantum conjugate virtual charges responsible for the "confinement" of light in space, within "virtual electrodes", somehow reproducing the holographic principle originally proposed for gravity. All observable properties of light in free space then arise from a specific choice of eigenstates (a procedure replacing here the Ward identity of Quantum Field Theory). Real photons are thus the "helicity" bosons, while virtual ones correspond to a "parity charge". Photon and anti-photon are (as expected) the same particle, linked through an internal gauge transformation.</description>

      <title>Lepton Triptych I: Geometric Foundations of Electroweak Symmetry in the Real Clifford Algebra $\text{Cl}_4(\mathbb{R})$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.13834</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.13834v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper investigates how the gauge group $\text{SU}_{I}(2) \times \text{U}_{Y}(1)$ of the electroweak interactions can be derived using recent geometric techniques within the real Clifford Algebra $\mathbb{R}_4 = \text{Cl}_4(\mathbb{R})$. Central to this approach is a novel procedure for constructing the spinor space of $\mathbb{R}_4$ directly, \emph{without} complexification. We show that $\mathbb{R}_4$ naturally accommodates representations for the $\text{SU}_{I}(2) \times \text{U}_{Y}(1)$ gauge bosons and a single generation of chiral Standard Model leptons, with weak isospin acting exclusively on left-chiral states.
  Specifically, under hypercharge and isospin $(Y, I_3)$, $\mathbb{R}_4$ contains $(-1, \mp \tfrac{1}{2})$ irreps for left-chiral electrons and neutrinos, a $(-2, 0)$ irrep for a right-chiral electron, and a $(0, 0)$ irrep for a sterile right-chiral neutrino. The distinction between left- and right-chiral particles arises from the grade parity of the irreps, providing a natural geometric explanation for why only left-chiral particles couple to $\text{SU}_{I}(2)$.
  The emergence of the correct eigenvalues directly from first principles highlights the promise of this framework for the geometric foundations of Electroweak Theory and the Standard Model, as well as for Grand Unified Theories more broadly. This paper is the first panel of the Lepton Triptych, which will ultimately present the full Yang-Mills theory of the electroweak model based on these principles.</description>

      <title>Evolution of Size, Mass, and Density of Galaxies Since Cosmic Dawn</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.13844</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.13844v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The formation and evolution of galaxies and other astrophysical objects have become of great interest, especially since the launch of the James Webb Space Telescope in 2021. The mass, size, and density of objects in the early universe appear to be drastically different from those predicted by the standard cosmology - the $\Lambda$CDM model. This work shows that the mass-size-density evolution is not surprising when we use the CCC+TL cosmology, which is based on the concepts of covarying coupling constants in an expanding universe and the tired light effect contributing to the observed redshift. This model is consistent with supernovae Pantheon+ data, the angular size of the cosmic dawn galaxies, BAO, CMB sound horizon, galaxy formation time scales, time dilation, galaxy rotation curves, etc., and does not have the coincidence problem. The effective radii $r_e$ of the objects are larger in the new model by $r_e \propto (1+z)^{0.93}$. Thus, the object size evolution in different studies, estimated as $r_e \propto (1+z)^s$ with $s=-1.0 \pm {0.3}$, is modified to $r_e \propto (1+z)^{s+0.93}$, the dynamical mass by $(1+z)^{0.93}$, and number density by $(1+z)^{-2.80}$. The luminosity modification increases slowly with $z$ to 1.8 at $z=20$. Thus, the stellar mass increase is modest, and the luminosity and stellar density decrease are mainly due to the larger object size in the new model. Since the aging of the universe is stretched in the new model, its temporal evolution is much slower (e.g., at $z=10$, the age is about a dex longer); stars, black holes, and galaxies do not have to form at unrealistic rates.</description>

      <title>Lorentz transformations in 1+1 dimensional spacetime: mainly the superluminal case</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.14085</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.14085v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We discuss the most general form of the Lorentz transformation in 1+1 dimensional spacetime, focusing mainly on its superluminal branch. For this purpose, we introduce the 2-velocity of a reference frame and the clockwork postulate. Basic special relativity effects are discussed in the proposed framework. Different forms of the superluminal Lorentz transformation, which were studied in the literature, are critically examined from the perspective of our formalism. Counterintuitive features of the superluminal Lorentz transformation are identified both in our approach and in earlier studies.</description>

      <title>MOND Theory and Thermodynamics of Spacetime</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.14345</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.14345v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Starting from the Modified Newtonian Dynamics (MOND) theory and using an inverse approach, we construct a general form of the entropy expression associated with the horizon based on the entropic nature of gravity. Using the thermodynamics-gravity correspondence in the cosmological setup, we apply the corrected entropy expression and find the modified Friedmann equation by three methods, namely, (i) the first law of thermodynamics, (ii) the entropic force scenario and (iii) the emergence nature of gravity. We confirm that our model guaranties the generalized second law of thermodynamics for the universe enveloped by the apparent horizon. Our studies reveal that the MOND theory of gravity may be naturally deduced from the modification of the horizon entropy. These results may fill in the gap in the literatures, understanding the theoretical origin of the MOND theory from thermodynamics-gravity conjecture.</description>

      <title>Estimation of $\pi$ via experiment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.14561</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.14561v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this study, we conducted an experiment to estimate $\pi$ using body-to-body and body-to-wall collisions. By geometrically analyzing the system's motion, we first review how the collision count corresponds to the digits of $\pi$. This method utilizes the property that the number of collisions corresponds to $\pi$ to the $n$-th decimal place by setting the mass ratio of bodies to $1:100^n$ under ideal conditions. In particular, when the mass ratio is $1:100$ -- which is the case we tested experimentally -- the number of collisions is 31, and $\pi$ to the tenths decimal place (3.1) can be derived. In the experiments, a suspended apparatus was developed to minimize energy losses such as friction and air resistance. We also devised the shape and material of the colliding bodies' surface and the characteristics of the suspension string, aiming for measurements under stable conditions. Based on the experimental results, we reproduced the number of collisions consistent with the theoretical values and confirmed that estimating $\pi$ to the tenths decimal place is possible under realistic conditions.</description>
