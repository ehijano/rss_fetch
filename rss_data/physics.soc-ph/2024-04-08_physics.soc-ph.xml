      <title>The prominent and heterogeneous gender disparities in scientific novelty: evidence from biomedical doctoral theses</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.04259</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.04259v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Scientific novelty is the essential driving force for research breakthroughs and innovation. However, little is known about how early-career scientists pursue novel research paths, and the gender disparities in this process. To address this research gap, this study investigates a comprehensive dataset of 279,424 doctoral theses in biomedical sciences authored by US Ph.D. graduates. Spanning from 1980 to 2016, the data originates from the ProQuest Dissertations &amp; Theses Database. This study aims to shed light on Ph.D. students' pursuit of scientific novelty in their doctoral theses and assess gender-related differences in this process. Using a combinatorial approach and a pre-trained Bio-BERT model, we quantify the scientific novelty of doctoral theses based on bio-entities. Applying fractional logistic and quantile regression models, this study reveals a decreasing trend in scientific novelty over time and heterogeneous gender disparities in doctoral theses. Specifically, female students consistently exhibited lower scientific novelty levels than their male peers. When supervised by female advisors, students' theses are found to be less novel than those under male advisors. The significant interaction effect of female students and female advisors suggests that female advisors may amplify the gender disparity in scientific novelty. Moreover, heterogeneous gender disparities in scientific novelty are identified, with non-top-tier universities displaying more pronounced disparities, while the differences at higher percentile ranges were comparatively more minor. These findings indicate a potential underrepresentation of female scientists pursuing novel research during the early stages of their careers. Notably, the outcomes of this study hold significant policy implications for advancing the careers of female scientists.</description>

      <title>PREDIS-MHI Thermal Data</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.04307v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The French Construction and Housing Code had set an obligation for tertiary buildings to reduce their final energy consumption by 40% in 2030, 50% in 2040, and 60% in 2050. According to ADEME, tertiary buildings in France account for almost a third of the energy consumed in the built environment. As such, buildings in this category could be an important lever to meet these goals necessitated by the energy transition. The availability of high-quality datasets from this sector will be a crucial enabler in meeting these goals by developing and testing new energy management approaches in the buildings. In this paper, we present the thermal energy datasets available and published online for the PREDIS-MHI zone of the GreEn-ER building, a tertiary building with more than a thousand sensors used for research, teaching, and administrative activities in Grenoble.</description>

      <title>Explaining Indian Stock Market through Geometry of Scale free Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.04710</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.04710v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper presents an analysis of the Indian stock market using a method based on embedding the network in a hyperbolic space using Machine learning techniques. We claim novelty on four counts. First, it is demonstrated that the hyperbolic clusters resemble the topological network communities more closely than the Euclidean clusters. Second, we are able to clearly distinguish between periods of market stability and volatility through a statistical analysis of hyperbolic distance and hyperbolic shortest path distance corresponding to the embedded network. Third, we demonstrate that using the modularity of the embedded network significant market changes can be spotted early. Lastly, the coalescent embedding is able to segregate the certain market sectors thereby underscoring its natural clustering ability.</description>

      <title>Tournament design: A review from an operational research perspective</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.05034</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.05034v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Every sport needs rules. Tournament design refers to the rules that determine how a tournament, a series of games between a number of competitors, is organized. This study aims to provide an overview of the tournament design literature from the perspective of operational research. Three important design criteria are discussed: efficacy and effectivity, fairness, and attractiveness. Our survey classifies the papers discussing these properties according to the main components of tournament design: format, seeding, draw, scheduling, and ranking. We also outline several open questions and promising directions for future research.</description>

      <title>Quantifying age-specific household contacts in Aotearoa New Zealand for infectious disease modelling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.04300</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.04300v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Accounting for population age structure and age-specific contact patterns is crucial for accurate modelling of human infectious disease dynamics and impact. A common approach is to use synthetic contact matrices, which estimate the number of contacts between individuals of different ages in specific settings. These contact matrices are frequently based on data collected from populations with very different demographic and socioeconomic characteristics from the population of interest. Here we use a comprehensive household composition dataset based on New Zealand census and administrative data to construct household contact matrices and a synthetic population that can be used for modelling. We investigate the behaviour of a compartment-based and an agent-based epidemic model parameterised using this data, compared to a commonly used synthetic contact matrix. We find that using the household composition data leads to lower attack rates in older age groups compared to using the synthetic contact matrix. This difference becomes larger when household transmission is more dominant relative to non-household transmission. In addition, explicitly account for household structure in an agent-based models leads to lower attack rates at all ages. We provide electronic versions of the synthetic population and household contact matrix for other researchers to use in infectious disease models.</description>

      <title>Economical-Epidemiological Analysis of the Coffee Trees Rust Pandemic</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.14515</link>
      <description>arXiv:2304.14515v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Coffee leaf rust is a prevalent botanical disease that causes a worldwide reduction in coffee supply and its quality, leading to immense economic losses. While several pandemic intervention policies (PIPs) for tackling this rust pandemic are commercially available, they seem to provide only partial epidemiological relief for farmers. In this work, we develop a high-resolution economical-epidemiological model that captures the rust pandemic's spread in coffee tree farms and its associated economic impact. Through extensive simulations for the case of Colombia, a country that consists mostly of small-size coffee farms and is the second-largest coffee producer in the world, our results show that it is economically impractical to sustain any profit without directly tackling the rust pandemic. Furthermore, even in the hypothetical case where farmers perfectly know their farm's epidemiological state and the weather in advance, any rust pandemic-related efforts can only amount to a limited profit of roughly 4% on investment. In the more realistic case, any rust pandemic-related efforts are expected to result in economic losses, indicating that major disturbances in the coffee market are anticipated.</description>

      <title>Growth, Poverty Trap and Escape</title>

      <description>arXiv:2310.09098v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The well-known Solow growth model is the workhorse model of the theory of economic growth, which studies capital accumulation in a model economy as a function of time with capital stock, labour and technology efficiency as the basic ingredients. The capital is assumed to be in the form of manufacturing equipments and materials. Two important parameters of the model are: the saving fraction $s$ of the output of a production function and the technology efficiency parameter $A$, appearing in the production function. The saved fraction of the output is fully invested in the generation of new capital and the rest is consumed. The capital stock also depreciates as a function of time due to the wearing out of old capital and the increase in the size of the labour population. We propose a stochastic Solow growth model assuming the saving fraction to be a sigmoidal function of the per capita capital $k_p$. We derive analytically the steady state probability distribution $P(k_p)$ and demonstrate the existence of a poverty trap, of central concern in development economics. In a parameter regime, $P(k_p)$ is bimodal with the twin peaks corresponding to states of poverty and well-being respectively. The associated potential landscape has two valleys with fluctuation-driven transitions between them. The mean exit times from the valleys are computed and one finds that the escape from a poverty trap is more favourable at higher values of $A$. We identify a critical value of $A_c$ below (above) which the state of poverty (well-being) dominates and propose two early signatures of the regime shift occurring at $A_c$. The economic model, with conceptual foundation in nonlinear dynamics and statistical mechanics, shares universal features with dynamical models from diverse disciplines like ecology and cell biology.</description>

      <title>The Negative Participation Paradox in Three-Candidate Instant Runoff Elections</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.18857</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.18857v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we provide theoretical and empirical estimates for the likelihood of a negative participation paradox under instant runoff voting in three-candidate elections. We determine the probability of the paradox and related conditional probabilities based on the impartial anonymous culture and impartial culture models for both complete and partial ballots. We compare these results to the empirical likelihood of a negative participation paradox occurring under instant runoff voting in a large database of voter profiles which have been reduced to three candidates. Lastly, we analyze the relative likelihood of this paradox in comparison to other well-known paradoxes.</description>

      <title>Causal evidence for social group sizes from Wikipedia editing data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.00595</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.00595v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Human communities have self-organizing properties in which specific Dunbar Numbers may be invoked to explain group attachments. By analyzing Wikipedia editing histories across a wide range of subject pages, we show that there is an emergent coherence in the size of transient groups formed to edit the content of subject texts, with two peaks averaging at around $N=8$ for the size corresponding to maximal contention, and at around $N=4$ as a regular team. These values are consistent with the observed sizes of conversational groups, as well as the hierarchical structuring of Dunbar graphs. We use the Promise Theory model of bipartite trust to derive a scaling law that fits the data and may apply to all group size distributions, when based on attraction to a seeded group process. In addition to providing further evidence that even spontaneous communities of strangers are self-organizing, the results have important implications for the governance of the Wikipedia commons and for the security of all online social platforms and associations.</description>
