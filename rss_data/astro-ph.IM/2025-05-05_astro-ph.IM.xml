      <title>Power Laws Associated with Self-Organized Criticality: A Comparison of Empirical Data with Model Predictions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.00748</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.00748v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the relevance of {\sl self-organized criticality (SOC)} models in previously published empirical datasets, which includes statistical observations in astrophysics, geophysics, biophysics, sociophysics, and informatics. We study 25 interdisciplinary phenomena with five different event detection and power law fitting methods. The total number of analyzed size distributions amounts to 64 cases, of which 80\% are found to be nearly consistent ($\alpha_s=1.99\pm0.30$) with the SOC model predictions. The fractal-diffusive SOC model predicts power law slopes of $\alpha_F=(9/5)=1.80$ for the flux $F$, $\alpha_E=(5/3)\sim1.67$ for the fluence or energy $E$, and $\alpha_T=2.00$ for the avalanche duration $T$. We find that the phenomena of solar flares, earthquakes, and forest fires are consistent with the theoretical predictions, while the size distributions of other phenomena are not conclusive due to neglected background treatment, inadequacy of power law fitting range, small-number statistics, and finite-system size effects.</description>

      <title>Experimental and on-sky demonstration of spectrally dispersed wavefront sensing using a photonic lantern</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.00765</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.00765v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Adaptive optics systems are critical in any application where highly resolved imaging or beam control must be performed through a dynamic medium. Such applications include astronomy and free-space optical communications, where light propagates through the atmosphere, as well as medical microscopy and vision science, where light propagates through biological tissue. Recent works have demonstrated common-path wavefront sensors for adaptive optics using the photonic lantern, a slowly varying waveguide that can efficiently couple multi-moded light into single-mode fibers. We use the SCExAO astrophotonics platform at the 8-m Subaru Telescope to show that spectral dispersion of lantern outputs can improve correction fidelity, culminating with an on-sky demonstration of real-time wavefront control. To our best knowledge, this is the first such result for either a spectrally dispersed or a photonic lantern wavefront sensor. Combined with the benefits offered by lanterns in precision spectroscopy, our results suggest the future possibility of a unified wavefront sensing spectrograph using compact photonic devices.</description>

      <title>The Telescope Calibration of the Imaging X-ray Polarimetry Explorer</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.00851</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.00851v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Fifty years after the very first sounding rocket measurement of cosmic X-ray polarization, the Imaging X-ray Polarimetry Explorer (IXPE) mission has effectively opened a new window into the X-ray sky. Prior to launch of IXPE, an extensive calibration campaign was carried out to fully characterize the response of this new type of instrument. Specifically, the polarization-sensitive detectors were intensively calibrated in Italy, where they were developed and built. The X-ray optics, which collect and focus X rays onto the detectors, were built and calibrated in the U.S. A key question was whether the telescope (optics + detectors) calibrations could be synthesized from the individual component calibrations, avoiding time consuming and costly end-to-end calibrations for a flight program with a fixed schedule.
  The data presented here are from a calibration of the flight spare telescope utilizing the flight spare detector and flight spare mirror assembly combined. These data show that the presence of the mirror module does not affect the polarization response of the detectors (within the required calibration accuracy) and that the angular resolution of the telescopes could be accurately determined. Thus, the original extensive stand-alone ground calibration data of all the flight detectors and all the flight optic can be utilized in full to derive the flight telescopes calibrations.</description>

      <title>Meteoroid rotation and quasi-periodic brightness variation of meteor light curves</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.01100</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.01100v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Meteor light curves are sometimes known to display flickering: rapid, quasi-periodic variations in brightness. This effect is generally attributed to the rotational modulation of the ablation rate, which is caused by the time-varying cross section area presented by a nonspherical rotating meteoroid to the oncoming airflow. In this work we investigate the effects that the rotation of a meteoroid of given shape (spherical, cubic, or cylindrical) has on the meteor's light curve, given state-of-the-art experimental laboratory estimates of the drag and lift coefficients of hypersonic flow (Mach number &gt; 5) around various shaped objects. The meteoroid's shape is important in determining these two forces, due to the different response of the drag and lift coefficients according to the angle of attack. As a case study, the model was applied to a fireball observed on 2018 April 17 by the PRISMA network, a system of all-sky cameras that achieves a systematic monitoring of meteors and fireballs in the skies over the Italian territory. The results show that this methodology is potentially able to yield a powerful diagnostic of the rotation rate of meteoroids prior to their encounter with the atmosphere, while also providing essential information on their pre-fall actual shapes.</description>

      <title>Instrumentation prospects for rocky exoplanet atmospheres studies with high resolution spectroscopy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.01102</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.01102v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Studying the atmospheres of exoplanets is one of the most promising ways to learn about distant worlds beyond our solar system. The composition of an exoplanet's atmosphere can provide critical insights into its geology and potential habitability. For instance, the presence of certain molecules such as water vapor, oxygen, or methane have been proposed to indicate the possibility of life. From an observation point of view, over the past fifteen years, significant progress has been made in characterizing exoplanetary atmospheres. This work reviews recent developments in ground-based high-resolution spectroscopic instruments that make it possible to analyze distant atmospheres in great detail. High-resolution transmission spectroscopy, one of the most effective methods used, has examined the atmospheres of Jupiter-like and is pushing towards the smaller, sub-Neptunian exoplanets. Numerous molecules have been detected using this technique, including CO,H2O,TiO,HCN,CH4,NH3,C2H2,OH. We explore the intriguing possibilities that lie ahead for future ground-based instrumentation, particularly in the context of detecting biologically relevant molecules within Earth-analog exoplanetary atmospheres including molecular oxygen (O2). With detailed exposure time calculations for detecting O2 we find that at the same exposure time spectral resolution of 300,000 reaches higher significance compared to 100,000. The exposure time and therefore the needed number of transits is reduced by a factor of 4 in challenging haze and cloud scenarios.</description>

      <title>New gravitational waveform model for precessing binary neutron stars with double-spin effects</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.15978</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.15978v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present two new frequency-domain gravitational waveform models for the analysis of signals emitted by binary neutron star coalescences: IMRPhenomXAS_NRTidalv2 and IMRPhenomXP_NRTidalv2. Both models are available through the public algorithm library LALSuite and represent the first extensions of IMRPhenomX models including matter effects. We show here that these two models represent a significant advancement in efficiency and accuracy with respect to their phenomenological predecessors, IMRPhenomD_NRTidalv2 and IMRPhenomPv2_NRTidalv2. The computational efficiency of the new models is achieved through the application of the same multibanding technique previously applied to binary black hole models. Furthermore, IMRPhenomXP_NRTidalv2 implements a more accurate description of the precession dynamics, including double-spin effects and, optionally, matter effects in the twisting-up construction. The latter are available through an option to use a numerical integration of the post-Newtonian precession equations. We show that the new precession descriptions allow the model to better reproduce the phenomenology observed in numerical-relativity simulations of precessing binary neutron stars. Finally, we present some applications of the new models to Bayesian parameter estimation studies, including a reanalysis of GW170817 and a study of simulated observations using numerical relativity waveforms for nonprecessing binary neutron stars with highly spinning components. We find that in these cases the new models make a negligible difference in the results. Nevertheless, by virtue of the aforementioned improvements, the new models represent valuable tools for the study of future detections of coalescing binary neutron stars.</description>
