      <title>Trade, Growth, and Product Innovation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.08727</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.08727v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Can trade integration induce product innovation? I document that countries that joined the European Union (EU) started producing more product varieties, investing more in R&amp;D, and trading more compared to candidate countries that did not join at a given horizon. Additionally, I show that a plausibly exogenous increase in market access increases the probability of a given country starting production of and exporting a given product. To rationalize this reduced-form evidence, I propose a new quantitative framework that integrates the forces of specialization and market size. This is a dynamic general equilibrium model of frictional trade and endogenous growth with arbitrarily many asymmetric countries that nests the Eaton-Kortum model of trade and the Romer growth model as special cases. The key result is an analytical expression to decompose gains from trade into dynamic and static components. In this framework, the product innovation growth rate increases with higher market access. Finally, a quantitative version of the model suggests that: (a) the EU enlargement increased its long-run yearly growth rate by about 0.10pp; and (b) dynamic gains can account for between 65-90% of total welfare gains from trade.</description>

      <title>How &amp; Why To Use Audience Segmentation to Maximize (Listener) Demand Across Digital Music Portfolio</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.09226</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.09226v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Digital delivery of songs has radically changed the way people can enjoy music, the sort of music available for listening, and the manner by which rights holders are compensated for their contributions to songs. Listeners enjoy an unlimited potpourri of sounds, uniquely free of incremental acquisition or switching costs which have been replaced by subscription or rentier fees. This regime shift has revealed listening patterns governed by affinity, boredom, attention budget, etc.: instantaneous, dynamic, organic or programmatic song selection. This regime shift in demand availability -- with the commensurate translation of revenue implications -- deprecates current orthodoxy for content curation. The impulse to point-of-sale model is insufficient in a regime where demand revenue is proportional to demand affinity and each are strongly dependent time series processes. We explore strategies &amp; implications -- which are generalizable to any media rights holding firm -- from a prediction &amp; optimization point of view for two straightforward demand models.</description>

      <title>$u^* = \sqrt{uv}$</title>

      <description>arXiv:2206.13012v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper aims to compute the unemployment rate $u^*$ that is consistent with full employment in the United States. First, it argues that the most appropriate economic translation of the legal notion of full employment is social efficiency. Here efficiency requires to minimize the nonproductive use of labor -- both unemployment and recruiting. The nonproductive use of labor is measured by the number of jobseekers and vacancies, $u + v$. Through the Beveridge curve, the numbers of vacancies and jobseekers are inversely related, $uv = \text{constant}$. With such symmetry the labor market is efficient when there are as many jobseekers as vacancies ($u = v$), inefficiently tight when there are more vacancies than jobseekers ($v &gt; u$), and inefficiently slack when there are more jobseekers than vacancies ($u &gt; v$). Accordingly, the full-employment rate of unemployment (FERU) is the geometric average of the unemployment and vacancy rates: $u^* = \sqrt{uv}$. Between 1930 and 2023, the FERU averages $4.1\%$ and is quite stable -- it always remains between $2.5\%$ and $6.6\%$.</description>

      <title>A simulation-optimization framework for food supply chain network design to ensure food accessibility under uncertainty</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.04439</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.04439v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: How to ensure accessibility to food and nutrition while food supply chains suffer from demand and supply uncertainties caused by disruptive forces such as the COVID-19 pandemic and natural disasters is an emerging and critical issue. Unstable access to food influences the level of nutrition that weakens the health and well-being of citizens. Therefore, a food accessibility evaluation index is proposed in this work to quantify how well nutrition needs are met. The proposed index is then embedded in a stochastic multi-objective mixed-integer optimization problem to determine the optimal supply chain design to maximize food accessibility and minimize cost. Considering uncertainty in demand and supply, the multi-objective problem is solved in a two-phase simulation-optimization framework in which Green Field Analysis is applied to determine the long-term, tactical decisions such as supply chain configuration, and then Monte Carlo simulation is performed iteratively to determine the short-term supply chain operations by solving a stochastic programming problem. A case study is conducted on the beef supply chain in Qatar. Pareto efficient solutions are validated in discrete event simulation to evaluate the performance of the designed supply chain in various realistic scenarios and provide recommendations for different decision-makers.</description>

      <title>Artificial Intelligence and Dual Contract</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.12350</link>
      <description>arXiv:2303.12350v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper explores the capacity of artificial intelligence (AI) algorithms to autonomously design incentive-compatible contracts in dual-principal-agent settings, a relatively unexplored aspect of algorithmic mechanism design. We develop a dynamic model where two principals, each equipped with independent Q-learning algorithms, interact with a single agent. Our findings reveal that the strategic behavior of AI principals (cooperation vs. competition) hinges crucially on the alignment of their profits. Notably, greater profit alignment fosters collusive strategies, yielding higher principal profits at the expense of agent incentives. This emergent behavior persists across varying degrees of principal heterogeneity, multiple principals, and environments with uncertainty. Our study underscores the potential of AI for contract automation while raising critical concerns regarding strategic manipulation and the emergence of unintended collusion in AI-driven systems, particularly in the context of the broader AI alignment problem.</description>
