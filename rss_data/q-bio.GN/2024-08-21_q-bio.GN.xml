      <title>Single-cell Curriculum Learning-based Deep Graph Embedding Clustering</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.10511</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.10511v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The swift advancement of single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) technologies enables the investigation of cellular-level tissue heterogeneity. Cell annotation significantly contributes to the extensive downstream analysis of scRNA-seq data. However, The analysis of scRNA-seq for biological inference presents challenges owing to its intricate and indeterminate data distribution, characterized by a substantial volume and a high frequency of dropout events. Furthermore, the quality of training samples varies greatly, and the performance of the popular scRNA-seq data clustering solution GNN could be harmed by two types of low-quality training nodes: 1) nodes on the boundary; 2) nodes that contribute little additional information to the graph. To address these problems, we propose a single-cell curriculum learning-based deep graph embedding clustering (scCLG). We first propose a Chebyshev graph convolutional autoencoder with multi-decoder (ChebAE) that combines three optimization objectives corresponding to three decoders, including topology reconstruction loss of cell graphs, zero-inflated negative binomial (ZINB) loss, and clustering loss, to learn cell-cell topology representation. Meanwhile, we employ a selective training strategy to train GNN based on the features and entropy of nodes and prune the difficult nodes based on the difficulty scores to keep the high-quality graph. Empirical results on a variety of gene expression datasets show that our model outperforms state-of-the-art methods.</description>

      <title>PerturBench: Benchmarking Machine Learning Models for Cellular Perturbation Analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.10609</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.10609v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a comprehensive framework for predicting the effects of perturbations in single cells, designed to standardize benchmarking in this rapidly evolving field. Our framework, PerturBench, includes a user-friendly platform, diverse datasets, metrics for fair model comparison, and detailed performance analysis. Extensive evaluations of published and baseline models reveal limitations like mode or posterior collapse, and underscore the importance of rank metrics that assess the ordering of perturbations alongside traditional measures like RMSE. Our findings show that simple models can outperform more complex approaches. This benchmarking exercise sets new standards for model evaluation, supports robust model development, and advances the potential of these models to use high-throughput and high-content genetic and chemical screens for disease target discovery.</description>
