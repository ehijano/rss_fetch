      <title>Robust Algorithms for Finding Triangles and Computing the Girth in Unit Disk and Transmission Graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.01180</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.01180v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We describe optimal robust algorithms for finding a triangle and the unweighted girth in a unit disk graph, as well as finding a triangle in a transmission graph.In the robust setting, the input is not given as a set of sites in the plane, but rather as an abstract graph. The input may or may not be realizable as a unit disk graph or a transmission graph. If the graph is realizable, the algorithm is guaranteed to give the correct answer. If not, the algorithm will either give a correct answer or correctly state that the input is not of the required type.</description>

      <title>A hypergraph model shows the carbon reduction potential of effective space use in housing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.01290</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.01290v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Humans spend over 90% of their time in buildings which account for 40% of anthropogenic greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions, making buildings the leading cause of climate change. To incentivize more sustainable construction, building codes are used to enforce indoor comfort standards and maximum energy use. However, they currently only reward energy efficiency measures such as equipment or envelope upgrades and disregard the actual spatial configuration and usage. Using a new hypergraph model that encodes building floorplan organization and facilitates automatic geometry creation, we demonstrate that space efficiency outperforms envelope upgrades in terms of operational carbon emissions in 72%, 61% and 33% of surveyed buildings in Zurich, New York, and Singapore. Automatically generated floorplans for a case study in Zurich further increase access to daylight by up to 24%, revealing that auto-generated floorplans have the potential to improve the quality of residential spaces in terms of environmental performance and access to daylight.</description>

      <title>Quantum algorithms for Hopcroft's problem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.01160</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.01160v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this work we study quantum algorithms for Hopcroft's problem which is a fundamental problem in computational geometry. Given $n$ points and $n$ lines in the plane, the task is to determine whether there is a point-line incidence. The classical complexity of this problem is well-studied, with the best known algorithm running in $O(n^{4/3})$ time, with matching lower bounds in some restricted settings. Our results are two different quantum algorithms with time complexity $\widetilde O(n^{5/6})$. The first algorithm is based on partition trees and the quantum backtracking algorithm. The second algorithm uses a quantum walk together with a history-independent dynamic data structure for storing line arrangement which supports efficient point location queries. In the setting where the number of points and lines differ, the quantum walk-based algorithm is asymptotically faster. The quantum speedups for the aforementioned data structures may be useful for other geometric problems.</description>

      <title>Core Bifiltration</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.01214</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.01214v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The motivation of this paper is to recognize a geometric shape from a noisy sample in the form of a point cloud. Inspired by the HDBSCAN clustering algorithm and the multicover bifiltration, we introduce the core- and the alpha-core bifiltrations. The multicover-, core- and alpha-core bifiltrations are all interleaved, and they enjoy similar Prohorov stability properties. We have performed experiments with the core and the alpha-core bifiltrations where we have calculated their persistent homology along lines in the two-dimensional persistence parameter space.</description>
