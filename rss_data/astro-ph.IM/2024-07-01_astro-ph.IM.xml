      <title>Systems design, assembly, integration and lab testing of WALOP-South Polarimeter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.19428</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.19428v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Wide-Area Linear Optical Polarimeter (WALOP)-South is the first wide-field and survey-capacity polarimeter in the optical wavelengths. On schedule for commissioning in 2024, it will be mounted on the 1 m SAAO telescope in Sutherland Observatory, South Africa to undertake the PASIPHAE sky survey. PASIPHAE program will create the first polarimetric sky map in the optical wavelengths, spanning more than 2000 square degrees of the southern Galactic region. The innovative design of WALOP-South will enable it to measure the linear polarization (Stokes parameters $q$ and $u$), in a single exposure, of all sources in a field of view (FoV) of $35\times35$ arcminutes-squared in the SDSS-r broadband and narrowband filters between 500-750 nm with 0.1 % polarization accuracy.
  The unique goals of the instrument place very stringent systems engineering goals, including on the performance of the optical, polarimetric, optomechanical, and electronic subsystems. All the subsystems have been designed carefully to meet the overall instrument performance goals.
  As of May 2024, all the instrument optical and mechanical subsystems have been assembled and are currently getting tested and integrated. The complete testing and characterization of the instrument in the lab is expected to be completed by August 2024.
  In this paper, we will present (a) the design and development of the entire instrument and its major subsystems, focusing on the opto-mechanical design which has not been reported before, and (b) assembly and integration of the instrument in the lab and early results from lab characterization of the instrument.</description>

      <title>MNTES: Modeling Nonlinearity of TES detectors for Enhanced Cosmic Microwave Background measurements with LiteBIRD</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.19567</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.19567v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Traditional methods of converting electronic readout counts to optical power incident on Transition Edge Sensors (TES) for Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) observations involve a linear approximation. For the upcoming LiteBIRD CMB satellite, strict nonlinearity requirements must be met to prevent contamination of the science band at 4f by the 2f signal, which arises from differential transmission or emissivity related to the half-wave plate's rotation rate fHWP. These constraints cannot be met using hardware solutions alone and therefore require a form of nonlinearity correction. We present MNTES, a novel physics-based, nonlinear calibration technique. This method leverages our physical understanding of the TES power balance equation, accounts for imperfect voltage bias by casting the bias network as its Th\'evenin equivalent, and can incorporate external information such as time-varying magnetic fields and focal plane temperature variations. The detector-specific parameters of MNTES will be measured during the ground calibration campaign prior to the LiteBIRD launch, yielding conversion functions that can take raw time-ordered data and output the reconstructed incident optical power. MNTES will allow us to achieve LiteBIRD's goal of measuring the primordial tensor fluctuation spectrum to {\delta}r &lt; 0.001.</description>

      <title>The Simons Observatory: Deployment and current configuration of the Observatory Control System for SAT-MF1 and data access software systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.19576</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.19576v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Simons Observatory (SO) is a Cosmic Microwave Background experiment located in the Atacama Desert in Chile. SO consists of three small aperture telescopes (SATs) and one large aperture telescope (LAT) with a total of 60,000 detectors in six frequency bands. As an observatory, SO encompasses hundreds of hardware components simultaneously running at different readout rates, all separate from its 60,000 detectors on-sky and their metadata. We provide an overview of commissioning SO's data acquisition software system for SAT-MF1, the first SAT deployed to the Atacama site. Additionally, we share insights from deploying data access software for all four telescopes, detailing how performance limitations affected data loading and quality investigations, which led to site-compatible software improvements.</description>

      <title>The space coronagraph optical bench (SCoOB): 3. Mueller matrix polarimetry of a coronagraphic exit pupil</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.19616</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.19616v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: High-contrast imaging in the next decade aims to image exoplanets at smaller angular separations and deeper contrasts than ever before. A problem that has recently garnered attention for telescopes equipped with high-contrast coronagraphs is polarization aberration arising from the optics. These aberrations manifest as low-order aberrations of different magnitudes for orthogonal polarization states and spread light into the dark hole of the coronagraph that cannot be fully corrected. The origin of polarization aberrations has been modeled at the telescope level. However, we don't fully understand how polarization aberrations arise at the instrument level. To directly measure this effect, we construct a dual-rotating-retarder polarimeter around the SCoOB high-contrast imaging testbed to measure its Mueller matrix. With this matrix, we directly characterize the diattenuation, retardance, and depolarization of the instrument as a function of position in the exit pupil. We measure the polarization aberrations in the Lyot plane to understand how polarization couples into high-contrast imaging residuals.</description>

      <title>Initial operations of the Soft X-ray Imager onboard XRISM</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.19910</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.19910v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: XRISM (X-Ray Imaging and Spectroscopy Mission) is an astronomical satellite with the capability of high-resolution spectroscopy with the X-ray microcalorimeter, Resolve, and wide field-of-view imaging with the CCD camera, Xtend. The Xtend consists of the mirror assembly (XMA: X-ray Mirror Assembly) and detector (SXI: Soft X-ray Imager). The components of SXI include CCDs, analog and digital electronics, and a mechanical cooler. After the successful launch on September 6th, 2023 (UT) and subsequent critical operations, the mission instruments were turned on and set up. The CCDs have been kept at the designed operating temperature of $-110^\circ$C ~after the electronics and cooling system were successfully set up. During the initial operation phase, which continued for more than a month after the critical operations, we verified the observation procedure, stability of the cooling system, all the observation options with different imaging areas and/or timing resolutions, and operations for protection against South Atlantic Anomaly. We optimized the operation procedure and observation parameters including the cooler settings, imaging areas for the specific modes with higher timing resolutions, and event selection algorithm. We summarize our policy and procedure of the initial operations for SXI. We also report on a couple of issues we faced during the initial operations and lessons learned from them.</description>

      <title>Status of Xtend telescope onboard X-Ray Imaging and Spectroscopy Mission (XRISM)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.19911</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.19911v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Xtend is one of the two telescopes onboard the X-ray imaging and spectroscopy mission (XRISM), which was launched on September 7th, 2023. Xtend comprises the Soft X-ray Imager (SXI), an X-ray CCD camera, and the X-ray Mirror Assembly (XMA), a thin-foil-nested conically approximated Wolter-I optics. A large field of view of $38^{\prime}\times38^{\prime}$ over the energy range from 0.4 to 13 keV is realized by the combination of the SXI and XMA with a focal length of 5.6 m. The SXI employs four P-channel, back-illuminated type CCDs with a thick depletion layer of 200 $\mu$m. The four CCD chips are arranged in a 2$\times$2 grid and cooled down to $-110$ $^{\circ}$C with a single-stage Stirling cooler. Before the launch of XRISM, we conducted a month-long spacecraft thermal vacuum test. The performance verification of the SXI was successfully carried out in a course of multiple thermal cycles of the spacecraft. About a month after the launch of XRISM, the SXI was carefully activated and the soundness of its functionality was checked by a step-by-step process. Commissioning observations followed the initial operation. We here present pre- and post-launch results verifying the Xtend performance. All the in-orbit performances are consistent with those measured on ground and satisfy the mission requirement. Extensive calibration studies are ongoing.</description>

      <title>Low temperature proton irradiation with DEPFETs for Athena's Wide Field Imager</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.19942</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.19942v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Wide Field Imager (WFI), one of two instruments on ESA's next large X-ray mission Athena, is designed for imaging spectroscopy of X-rays in the range of 0.2 to 15 keV with a large field of view and high count rate capability. The focal plane consists of back-illuminated DEPFET (Depleted p-channel field effect transistor) sensors that have a high radiation tolerance and provide a near Fano-limited energy resolution. To achieve this, a very low noise readout is required, about 3 electrons ENC at beginning of life is foreseen. This makes the device very susceptible to any radiation induced worsening of the readout noise. The main mechanism of degradation will be the increase of dark current due to displacement damage caused primarily by high energy protons. To study the expected performance degradation, a prototype detector module with fully representative pixel layout and fabrication technology was irradiated with 62.4 MeV protons at the accelerator facility MedAustron in Wiener Neustadt. A total dose equivalent to 3.3 $\mathrm{10^{9}}$ 10-MeV protons/$\mathrm{cm^{2}}$ was applied in two steps. During, in-between and after the irradiations the detector remained at the operating temperature of 213 K and was fully biased and operated. Data was recorded to analyze the signal of all incident particles. We report on the increase of dark current after the irradiation and present the current related damage rate at 213 K. The effect of low temperature annealing at 213 K , 236 K, 253 K, 273 K, and 289 K is presented.</description>

      <title>pop-cosmos: Scaleable inference of galaxy properties and redshifts with a data-driven population model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.19437</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.19437v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present an efficient Bayesian method for estimating individual photometric redshifts and galaxy properties under a pre-trained population model (pop-cosmos) that was calibrated using purely photometric data. This model specifies a prior distribution over 16 stellar population synthesis (SPS) parameters using a score-based diffusion model, and includes a data model with detailed treatment of nebular emission. We use a GPU-accelerated affine invariant ensemble sampler to achieve fast posterior sampling under this model for 292,300 individual galaxies in the COSMOS2020 catalog, leveraging a neural network emulator (Speculator) to speed up the SPS calculations. We apply both the pop-cosmos population model and a baseline prior inspired by Prospector-$\alpha$, and compare these results to published COSMOS2020 redshift estimates from the widely-used EAZY and LePhare codes. For the $\sim 12,000$ galaxies with spectroscopic redshifts, we find that pop-cosmos yields redshift estimates that have minimal bias ($\sim10^{-4}$), high accuracy ($\sigma_\text{MAD}=7\times10^{-3}$), and a low outlier rate ($1.6\%$). We show that the pop-cosmos population model generalizes well to galaxies fainter than its $r&lt;25$ mag training set. The sample we have analyzed is $\gtrsim3\times$ larger than has previously been possible via posterior sampling with a full SPS model, with average throughput of 15 GPU-sec per galaxy under the pop-cosmos prior, and 0.6 GPU-sec per galaxy under the Prospector prior. This paves the way for principled modeling of the huge catalogs expected from upcoming Stage IV galaxy surveys.</description>

      <title>A Traveling-Wave Parametric Amplifier and Converter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.19476</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.19476v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: High-fidelity qubit measurement is a critical element of all quantum computing architectures. In superconducting systems, qubits are typically measured by probing a readout resonator with a weak microwave tone which must be amplified before reaching the room temperature electronics. Superconducting parametric amplifiers have been widely adopted as the first amplifier in the chain, primarily because of their low noise performance, approaching the quantum limit. However, they require isolators and circulators to route signals up the measurement chain, as well as to protect qubits from amplified noise. While these commercial components are wideband and very simple to use, their intrinsic loss, size, and magnetic shielding requirements impact the overall measurement efficiency while also limiting prospects for scalable readout in large-scale superconducting quantum computers. Here we demonstrate a parametric amplifier that achieves both broadband forward amplification and backward isolation in a single, compact, non-magnetic circuit that could be integrated on chip with superconducting qubits. It relies on a nonlinear transmission line which supports traveling-wave parametric amplification of forward propagating signals, and isolation via frequency conversion of backward propagating signals. This kind of traveling-wave parametric amplifier and converter is poised to reduce the readout hardware overhead when scaling up the size of superconducting quantum computers.</description>

      <title>Clearing the Air: Updated CS Fluorescence Efficiencies Don't Solve the NUV/Sub-mm Cometary CS Abundance Discrepancy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.19480</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.19480v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Observations of carbon monosulfide (CS), a possible photodissociation fragment of CS$_2$, has a long history serving as a remote proxy for atomic sulfur, and more broadly, one of the sulfur reservoirs in cometary bodies. Interpretations of CS fluorescence emissions in ultraviolet observations of comets have, to-date, relied on a murky and ill-documented lineage of calculations for CS fluorescence efficiencies that can be difficult to assess. We report new fluorescence efficiencies of the CS radical, utilizing a rovibrational structure with vibrational states up to $v = 8$ and rotational states up to $N = 100$. A new set of band transition rates is produced through benchmarking comparisons to laboratory electron impact experiments, and subsequently utilized in the fluorescence calculations. We confirm historical reports of the ultraviolet $(0,0)$ band fluorescence efficiency, and conclude that blends and an expanded rovibrational structure have little impact on the fluorescence properties. Combined, the present results affirm the accuracy of the historical record of sulfur abundances derived via ultraviolet CS emissions in cometary observations with e.g., IUE and HST. Benchmark comparisons to IUE observations of comet Bradfield show favorable agreement with the theoretical models. We expand the model to the time-domain, and find that thermalization of the ground state and/or `hot' initial distributions of CS lead to noticable changes in the shape of the $(0,0)$ band. The impact on existing sulfur abundances derived via ultraviolet CS observations, and new connections to sulfur reservoirs in protoplanetary disks are discussed. The model code and computed fluorescence efficiencies are made publicly available.</description>

      <title>Evaluating potential landing sites for the Artemis III mission using a multi-criteria decision making approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.19863</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.19863v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The selection of a landing site within the Artemis Exploration Zone (AEZ) involves multiple factors and presents a complex problem. This study evaluates potential landing sites for the Artemis III mission using a combination of Geographic Information Systems (GIS) and Multi-Criteria Decision Making (MCDM) methodologies, specifically the TOPSIS algorithm. By integrating topographic, illumination, and mineralogy data of the Moon, we assess 1247 locations that meet the Human Landing System (HLS) requirements within 13 candidate regions and Site 004 near the lunar south pole. Criteria considered include surface visibility, HLS-astronaut line of sight, Permanently Shadowed Regions (PSRs), sunlight exposure, direct communication with Earth, geological units, and mafic mineral abundance. Site DM2 (Nobile Rim 2), particularly the point at latitude 84{\deg}12'5.61" S and longitude 60{\deg}41'59.61" E, is the optimal location for landing. Sensitivity analysis confirms the robustness of our approach, validating the suitability of the best location despite the MCDM method employed and variations in criteria weightings to prioritize illumination and PSRs. This research demonstrates the applicability of GIS-MCDM techniques for lunar exploration and the potential benefits they can bring to the Artemis program.</description>

      <title>The Mean Longitudinal Magnetic Field and its Uses in Radial-Velocity Surveys</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.20023</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.20023v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This work focuses on the analysis of the mean longitudinal magnetic field as a stellar activity tracer in the context of small exoplanet detection and characterisation in radial-velocity (RV) surveys. We use SDO/HMI filtergrams to derive Sun-as-a-star magnetic field measurements, and show that the mean longitudinal magnetic field is an excellent rotational period detector and a useful tracer of the solar magnetic cycle. To put these results into context, we compare the mean longitudinal magnetic field to three common activity proxies derived from HARPS-N Sun-as-a-star data: the full-width at half-maximum, the bisector span and the S-index. The mean longitudinal magnetic field does not correlate with the RVs and therefore cannot be used as a one-to-one proxy. However, with high cadence and a long baseline, the mean longitudinal magnetic field outperforms all other considered proxies as a solar rotational period detector, and can be used to inform our understanding of the physical processes happening on the surface of the Sun. We also test the mean longitudinal magnetic field as a "stellar proxy" on a reduced solar dataset to simulate stellar-like observational sampling. With a Gaussian Process regression analysis, we confirm that the solar mean longitudinal magnetic field is the most effective of the considered indicators, and is the most efficient rotational period indicator over different levels of stellar activity. This work highlights the need for polarimetric time series observations of stars.</description>

      <title>Scalable Bayesian uncertainty quantification with data-driven priors for radio interferometric imaging</title>

Abstract: Next-generation radio interferometers like the Square Kilometer Array have the potential to unlock scientific discoveries thanks to their unprecedented angular resolution and sensitivity. One key to unlocking their potential resides in handling the deluge and complexity of incoming data. This challenge requires building radio interferometric imaging methods that can cope with the massive data sizes and provide high-quality image reconstructions with uncertainty quantification (UQ). This work proposes a method coined QuantifAI to address UQ in radio-interferometric imaging with data-driven (learned) priors for high-dimensional settings. Our model, rooted in the Bayesian framework, uses a physically motivated model for the likelihood. The model exploits a data-driven convex prior, which can encode complex information learned implicitly from simulations and guarantee the log-concavity of the posterior. We leverage probability concentration phenomena of high-dimensional log-concave posteriors that let us obtain information about the posterior, avoiding MCMC sampling techniques. We rely on convex optimisation methods to compute the MAP estimation, which is known to be faster and better scale with dimension than MCMC sampling strategies. Our method allows us to compute local credible intervals, i.e., Bayesian error bars, and perform hypothesis testing of structure on the reconstructed image. In addition, we propose a novel blazing-fast method to compute pixel-wise uncertainties at different scales. We demonstrate our method by reconstructing radio-interferometric images in a simulated setting and carrying out fast and scalable UQ, which we validate with MCMC sampling. Our method shows an improved image quality and more meaningful uncertainties than the benchmark method based on a sparsity-promoting prior.

      <title>Prospects for joint reconstruction of imaging air Cherenkov Telescope array and extensive air shower array</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.11286</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.11286v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper we proposed a joint reconstruction of \gray events using both extensive air array (EAS) and Imaging air Cherenkov Telescope array (IACT). We considered eight Cherenkov telescopes to be built on the LHAASO (Large High Altitude Air Shower Observatory) site and investigate the improvement in differential sensitivity when combining the information from both IACT and Moun detectors of LHAASO-KM2A. We found that due to the higher cosmic ray background rejection power and higher gamma ray retention ratio provided by muon detectors of LHAASO, such a joint reconstruction can significantly improve the sensitivity of IACTs, especially for extended sources and long exposure time. In this article, we have shown the performance of an eight-telescopes mini array, and our results indicate that above $10~\rm TeV$, the sensitivity can be improved by muon detector from $25\% - 60\%$ in different energy ranges.</description>

      <title>Real-time portable muography with Hankuk Atmospheric-muon Wide Landscaping : HAWL</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.02638</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.02638v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Cosmic ray muons prove valuable across various fields, from particle physics experiments to non-invasive tomography, thanks to their high flux and exceptional penetrating capability. Utilizing a scintillator detector, one can effectively study the topography of mountains situated above tunnels and underground spaces. The Hankuk Atmospheric-muon Wide Landscaping (HAWL) project successfully charts the mountainous region of eastern Korea by measuring cosmic ray muons with a detector in motion. The real-time muon flux measurement shows a tunnel length accuracy of 6.0 %, with a detectable overburden range spanning from 8 to 400 meter-water-equivalent depth. This is the first real-time portable muon tomography.</description>

      <title>Long gamma-ray burst light curves as the result of a common stochastic pulse-avalanche process</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.18754</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.18754v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Context. The complexity and variety exhibited by the light curves of long gamma-ray bursts (GRBs) enclose a wealth of information that still awaits being fully deciphered. Despite the tremendous advance in the knowledge of the energetics, structure, and composition of the relativistic jet that results from the core collapse of the progenitor star, the nature of the inner engine, how it powers the relativistic outflow, and the dissipation mechanisms remain open issues. Aims. A promising way to gain insights is describing GRB light curves as the result of a common stochastic process. In the Burst And Transient Source Experiment (BATSE) era, a stochastic pulse avalanche model was proposed and tested through the comparison of ensemble-average properties of simulated and real light curves. Here we aim to revive and further test this model. Methods. We apply it to two independent data sets, BATSE and Swift/BAT, through a machine learning approach: the model parameters are optimised using a genetic algorithm. Results. The average properties are successfully reproduced. Notwithstanding the different populations and passbands of both data sets, the corresponding optimal parameters are interestingly similar. In particular, for both sets the dynamics appears to be close to a critical state, which is key to reproduce the observed variety of time profiles. Conclusions. Our results propel the avalanche character in a critical regime as a key trait of the energy release in GRB engines, which underpins some kind of instability.</description>
