      <title>Acceleration of the CASINO quantum Monte Carlo software using graphics processing units and OpenACC</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.02888</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.02888v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We describe how quantum Monte Carlo calculations using the CASINO software can be accelerated using graphics processing units (GPUs) and OpenACC. In particular we consider offloading Ewald summation, the evaluation of long-range two-body terms in the Jastrow correlation factor, and the evaluation of orbitals in a blip basis set. We present results for three- and two-dimensional homogeneous electron gases and ab initio simulations of bulk materials, showing that significant speedups of up to a factor of 2.5 can be achieved by the use of GPUs when several hundred particles are included in the simulations. The use of single-precision arithmetic can improve the speedup further without significant detriment to the accuracy of the calculations.</description>

      <title>Estimating Free Parameters in Stochastic Oscillatory Models Using a Weighted Cost Function</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.03200</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.03200v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this study, we estimate parameters in stochastic oscillatory systems by developing a novel cost function. This function incorporates power spectral density, analytic signal, and position crossings, each weighted to capture distinct oscillatory characteristics such as amplitude, frequency, and shape. By minimizing this cost via differential evolution, we estimate parameters in two stochastic systems given measured datasets. We validate this procedure by recovering known parameters from a test dataset. We then apply it to a biophysical model for auditory mechanics. Thus, we establish a general methodology for fitting stochastic oscillatory systems.</description>

      <title>Real-time prediction of plasma instabilities with sparse-grid-accelerated optimized dynamic mode decomposition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.03245</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.03245v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Parametric data-driven reduced-order models (ROMs) that embed dependencies in a large number of input parameters are crucial for enabling many-query tasks in large-scale problems. These tasks, including design optimization, control, and uncertainty quantification, are essential for developing digital twins in real-world applications. However, standard training data generation methods are computationally prohibitive due to the curse of dimensionality, as their cost scales exponentially with the number of inputs.This paper investigates efficient training of parametric data-driven ROMs using sparse grid interpolation with (L)-Leja points, specifically targeting scenarios with higher-dimensional input parameter spaces. (L)-Leja points are nested and exhibit slow growth, resulting in sparse grids with low cardinality in low-to-medium dimensional settings, making them ideal for large-scale, computationally expensive problems. Focusing on gyrokinetic simulations of plasma micro-instabilities in fusion experiments as a representative real-world application, we construct parametric ROMs for the full 5D gyrokinetic distribution function via optimized dynamic mode decomposition (optDMD) and sparse grids based on (L)-Leja points. We perform detailed experiments in two scenarios: First, the Cyclone Base Case benchmark assesses optDMD ROM prediction capabilities beyond training time horizons and across variations in the binormal wave number. Second, for a real-world electron temperature gradient driven micro-instability simulation featuring six input parameters, we demonstrate that an accurate parametric optDMD ROM can be constructed at a cost of only $28$ high-fidelity gyrokinetic simulations thanks to sparse grids. In the broader context of fusion research, these results demonstrate the potential of sparse grid-based parametric ROMs to enable otherwise intractable many-query tasks.</description>

      <title>Sequential Neural Operator Transformer for High-Fidelity Surrogates of Time-Dependent Non-linear Partial Differential Equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.03272</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.03272v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Partial differential equations (PDEs) are fundamental to modeling complex and nonlinear physical phenomena, but their numerical solution often requires significant computational resources, particularly when a large number of forward full solution evaluations are necessary, such as in design, optimization, sensitivity analysis, and uncertainty quantification. Recent progress in operator learning has enabled surrogate models that efficiently predict full PDE solution fields; however, these models often struggle with accuracy and robustness when faced with highly nonlinear responses driven by sequential input functions. To address these challenges, we propose the Sequential Neural Operator Transformer (S-NOT), a architecture that combines gated recurrent units (GRUs) with the self-attention mechanism of transformers to address time-dependent,nonlinear PDEs. Unlike S-DeepONet (S-DON), which uses a dot product to merge encoded outputs from the branch and trunk sub-networks, S-NOT leverages attention to better capture intricate dependencies between sequential inputs and spatial query points. We benchmark S-NOT on three challenging datasets from real-world applications with plastic and thermo-viscoplastic highly nonlinear material responses: multiphysics steel solidification, a 3D lug specimen, and a dogbone specimen under temporal and path-dependent loadings. The results show that S-NOT consistently achieves a higher prediction accuracy than S-DON even for data outliers, demonstrating its accuracy and robustness for drastically accelerating computational frameworks in scientific and engineering applications.</description>

      <title>General synthetic iterative scheme for multiscale radiative transfer in the finite-volume framework</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.03975</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.03975v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Achieving efficient and accurate simulation of the radiative transfer has long been a research challenge. Here we introduce the general synthetic iterative scheme as an easy-to-implement approach to address this issue. First, a macroscopic synthetic equation, which combines the asymptotic equation at the diffusion limit and the "high-order terms" extracted from the transport equation to account for transport effects, is introduced to accelerate the simulation of the radiative transfer equation. Second, the asymptotic preserving property is directly provided by the macroscopic process, eliminating the need for fine spatial discretization in optically thick media, as well as the need for consistency enforcement. Third, to address the issue of opacity discontinuity in the finite volume method, an adaptive least square method for gradient approximation is proposed. Numerical results on several canonical tests demonstrate that, in optically thick problems, our method achieves significant speed-up over the conventional iterative schemes. Finally, with our newly developed method, we reveal the importance of resolving the Knudsen layer in the initial stage of Tophat problem, while in steady-state the Knudsen layer can be under-resolved.</description>

      <title>High-Fidelity Modelling of the Molten Salt Fast Reactor</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.04129</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.04129v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Molten Salt Fast Reactor (MSFR) is one of the six GEN-IV reactor designs. In the MSFR, the liquid fuel is the coolant, which moves throughout the primary circuit. This complex phenomenology requires multiphysics modeling. In the present paper, a model of the MSFR is developed in the multiphysics code Cardinal, considering neutronic-thermal hydraulic feedback and the transport of delayed neutron precursors (DNPs) and decay heat precursors (DHPs). OpenMC is used to solve neutronic equations, and NekRS is used to solve mass, momentum, energy, DNPs, and DHPs distribution. A RANS k-t turbulence model is used in NekRS. DNPs and DHPs are modeled using a convective-diffusion equation with modified source terms considering radioactive decay. Cardinal results showed a reasonable behavior for temperature, heat source, velocity, DNPs, and DHPs. However, the current limitations in OpenMC do not allow the modification of delayed neutron source locations. Ongoing efforts look to include this feature in future work to introduce DNP feedback in OpenMC.</description>

      <title>RePlaChem: A dimensionality reduction library for plasma chemical mechanisms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.04401</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.04401v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, we present RePlaChem, a software library for reducing detailed large-scale plasma chemical mechanisms to smaller skeletal ones. The library parses a plasma chemical mechanism in the well-established format compatible with the software ZDPlasKin, runs the reduction algorithm, and generates automatically a skeletal chemical mechanism. This feature allows the seamless implementation of the skeletal chemistry in well-known solvers including ZDPlasKin. In turn, the reduction of the chemistry accelerates otherwise computationally expensive numerical simulations. Furthermore, RePlaChem can be used as an analysis tool to shed light into the underlying reaction physics by identifying the dominant species and associated reactions. In order to validate and demonstrate its capabilities, RePlaChem is used to substantially reduce a large-scale methane-hydrogen plasma chemical mechanism with 77 species and 4404 reactions at various orders with a relatively small loss of accuracy.

      <title>Physics Augmented Machine Learning Discovery of Composition-Dependent Constitutive Laws for 3D Printed Digital Materials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.02991</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.02991v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Multi-material 3D printing, particularly through polymer jetting, enables the fabrication of digital materials by mixing distinct photopolymers at the micron scale within a single build to create a composite with tunable mechanical properties. This work presents an integrated experimental and computational investigation into the composition-dependent mechanical behavior of 3D printed digital materials. We experimentally characterize five formulations, combining soft and rigid UV-cured polymers under uniaxial tension and torsion across three strain and twist rates. The results reveal nonlinear and rate-dependent responses that strongly depend on composition. To model this behavior, we develop a physics-augmented neural network (PANN) that combines a partially input convex neural network (pICNN) for learning the composition-dependent hyperelastic strain energy function with a quasi-linear viscoelastic (QLV) formulation for time-dependent response. The pICNN ensures convexity with respect to strain invariants while allowing non-convex dependence on composition. To enhance interpretability, we apply $L_0$ sparsification. For the time-dependent response, we introduce a multilayer perceptron (MLP) to predict viscoelastic relaxation parameters from composition. The proposed model accurately captures the nonlinear, rate-dependent behavior of 3D printed digital materials in both uniaxial tension and torsion, achieving high predictive accuracy for interpolated material compositions. This approach provides a scalable framework for automated, composition-aware constitutive model discovery for multi-material 3D printing.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2507.03022v2 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Grey wolf optimizer (GWO) is a nature-inspired stochastic meta-heuristic of the swarm intelligence field that mimics the hunting behavior of grey wolves. Differential evolution (DE) is a popular stochastic algorithm of the evolutionary computation field that is well suited for global optimization. In this part, we introduce a new algorithm based on the hybridization of GWO and two DE variants, namely the GWO-DE algorithm. We evaluate the new algorithm by applying various numerical benchmark functions. The numerical results of the comparative study are quite satisfactory in terms of performance and solution quality.</description>

      <title>Electrostatics in semiconducting devices II : Solving the Helmholtz equation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.03131</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.03131v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The convergence of iterative schemes to achieve self-consistency in mean field problems such as the Schr\"odinger-Poisson equation is notoriously capricious. It is particularly difficult in regimes where the non-linearities are strong such as when an electron gas in partially depleted or in presence of a large magnetic field. Here, we address this problem by mapping the self-consistent quantum-electrostatic problem onto a Non-Linear Helmoltz (NLH) equation at the cost of a small error. The NLH equation is a generalization of the Thomas-Fermi approximation. We show that one can build iterative schemes that are provably convergent by constructing a convex functional whose minimum is the seeked solution of the NLH problem. In a second step, the approximation is lifted and the exact solution of the initial problem found by iteratively updating the NLH problem until convergence. We show empirically that convergence is achieved in a handfull, typically one or two, iterations. Our set of algorithms provide a robust, precise and fast scheme for studying the effect of electrostatics in quantum nanoelectronic devices.</description>

      <title>AFLOW4: heading toward disorder</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.03422</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.03422v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: AFLOW4 is the latest iteration of the AFLOW toolkit, specifically tailored to study high-entropy disordered materials. This upgrade includes innovative features like the Soliquidy module, based on the Euclidean transport cost between disordered and ordered material states. AFLOW4 can calculate dielectric functions to understand optical and electronic properties of disordered ceramics. The newly introduced human-readable data export feature ensures the uncomplicated incorporation of AFLOW4 in diverse automated workflows. Features relevant to high-entropy research, like prototype identification, partial occupation method, convex hull calculation, and enthalpy corrections based on local atomic environments, have been improved and exhibit substantial speed-up. Together, these enhancements represent a step forward for AFLOW as a valuable tool for research of high-entropy materials.</description>

      <title>PINN-DG: Residual neural network methods trained with Finite Elements</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.03521</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.03521v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Over the past few years, neural network methods have evolved in various directions for approximating partial differential equations (PDEs). A promising new development is the integration of neural networks with classical numerical techniques such as finite elements and finite differences. In this paper, we introduce a new class of Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs) trained using discontinuous Galerkin finite element methods. Unlike standard collocation-based PINNs that rely on pointwise gradient evaluations and Monte Carlo quadrature, our approach computes the loss functional using finite element interpolation and integration. This avoids costly pointwise derivative computations, particularly advantageous for elliptic PDEs requiring second-order derivatives, and inherits key stability and accuracy benefits from the finite element framework. We present a convergence analysis based on variational arguments and support our theoretical findings with numerical experiments that demonstrate improved efficiency and robustness.</description>

      <title>Super-resolution of turbulent velocity fields in two-way coupled particle-laden flows</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.03567</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.03567v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper introduces a deep learning-based super-resolution (SR) framework specifically developed for accurately reconstructing high-resolution velocity fields in two-way coupled particle-laden turbulent flows. Leveraging conditional generative adversarial networks (cGANs), the generator network architecture incorporates explicit conditioning on physical parameters, such as effective particle mass density and subgrid kinetic energy, while the discriminator network is conditioned on low-resolution data as well as high-frequency content of the input data. High-fidelity direct numerical simulation (DNS) datasets, covering a range of particle Stokes numbers, particle mass loadings, and carrier gas turbulence regimes, including forced- and decaying-turbulence, serve as training and testing datasets. Extensive validation studies, including detailed analyses of energy spectra, probability density functions (PDFs), vorticity distributions, and wavelet-based decomposition demonstrate the model's accuracy and generalization capabilities across different particle parameters. The results show that the network utilizes particle data, mainly in the reconstruction of high-frequency details modulated by particles. Additionally, systematic assessment of the model's performance in capturing previously unseen flow regimes further validates its predictive capabilities.</description>

      <title>Invariance of quantum scattering rate coefficients to anisotropy of atom-molecule interactions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.03801</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.03801v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Quantum scattering calculations for strongly interacting molecular systems are computationally demanding due to the large number of molecular states coupled by the anisotropy of atom - molecule interactions. We demonstrate that thermal rate coefficients for total (elastic + inelastic) atom - molecule scattering are insensitive to the interaction anisotropy of the underlying potential energy surface. In particular, we show that the rate coefficients for Rb-H$_2$ and Rb-N$_2$ scattering at room temperature can be computed to 1% accuracy with anisotropy set to zero, reducing the complexity of coupled channel quantum scattering calculations to numerical solutions of a single differential equation. Our numerical calculations and statistical analysis based on Gaussian process regression elucidate the origin and limitations of the invariance of the total scattering rate coefficients to changes in atom - molecule interaction anisotropy.</description>

      <title>Background in Low Earth Orbiting Cherenkov Detectors, and Mitigation Strategies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.03838</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.03838v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Cherenkov detectors have been used in space missions for many decades, and for a variety of purposes, including for example, for Galactic Cosmic Ray (GCR) and Solar Energetic Particle (SEP) measurements. Cherenkov detectors are sensitive to many types of particles that are present in the environment of space, including gamma rays, trapped particles and cosmic particles, and each particle component acts as essentially a background when trying to view another specific particle component. In this research, GRAS/Geant4 simulations were performed to characterise the count rates that a simple Cherenkov detector design would experience in a low Earth orbit, and we find that Cherenkov count rates due to most particle components vary significantly depending on many different factors, including the location in the orbit, the date of the orbit, whether or not the detector is within the van Allen belts, and whether or not a solar particle event is occurring. We find that a small Cherenkov detector is readily able to gather detailed data on both trapped particles and spectral information during Ground-Level Enhancements. We also investigate the use of coincidence as a method to remove count rates due to trapped particles and delta electrons, finding that this method is generally very effective for resolving count rates due to GLEs amongst intense trapped particle environments, but that some Cherenkov count rates due to trapped particles are still observed in the simulated south Atlantic anomaly region.</description>

      <title>Enhanced accuracy through ensembling of randomly initialized auto-regressive models for time-dependent PDEs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.03863</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.03863v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Systems governed by partial differential equations (PDEs) require computationally intensive numerical solvers to predict spatiotemporal field evolution. While machine learning (ML) surrogates offer faster solutions, autoregressive inference with ML models suffer from error accumulation over successive predictions, limiting their long-term accuracy. We propose a deep ensemble framework to address this challenge, where multiple ML surrogate models with random weight initializations are trained in parallel and aggregated during inference. This approach leverages the diversity of model predictions to mitigate error propagation while retaining the autoregressive strategies ability to capture the system's time dependent relations. We validate the framework on three PDE-driven dynamical systems - stress evolution in heterogeneous microstructures, Gray-Scott reaction-diffusion, and planetary-scale shallow water system - demonstrating consistent reduction in error accumulation over time compared to individual models. Critically, the method requires only a few time steps as input, enabling full trajectory predictions with inference times significantly faster than numerical solvers. Our results highlight the robustness of ensemble methods in diverse physical systems and their potential as efficient and accurate alternatives to traditional solvers. The codes for this work are available on GitHub (https://github.com/Graham-Brady-Research-Group/AutoregressiveEnsemble_SpatioTemporal_Evolution).</description>

      <title>Burnett-level multi-relaxation-time central-moment discrete Boltzmann modeling of reactive flows</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.03877</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.03877v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A multi-relaxation-time central-moment discrete Boltzmann method (CDBM) is developed for compressible reactive flows, incorporating the effects of chemical reactions. The Chapman--Enskog multiscale analysis demonstrates that the model recovers the Burnett equations in the hydrodynamic limit, with tunable specific heat ratios and Prandtl numbers. Within the CDBM framework, a unified Boltzmann equation governs the evolution of hydrodynamic variables, thermodynamic quantities, and higher-order central moments. The collision and reaction term are consistently computed via matrix inversion method. A two-dimensional twenty-five discrete velocities, exhibiting favorable spatial symmetry, is constructed and employed. The model is validated through simulations of the thermal Couette flow, homogeneous chemical reaction, steady detonation wave, and collision of two detonation waves. This work presents a versatile numerical simulation tool capable of addressing complex reactive flows characterized by hydrodynamic and thermodynamic nonequilibrium effects, applicable to both scientific research and engineering practice.</description>

      <title>Noise Reinstates Collapsed Populations: Stochastic Reversal of Deterministic Extinction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.03954</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.03954v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Conventional wisdom suggests that environmental noise drives populations toward extinction. In contrast, we report a paradoxical phenomenon in which stochasticity reverses a deterministic tipping point, thereby preventing collapse. Using a hybrid model that integrates logistic growth with a density-triggered sigmoidal collapse, we uncover a striking reversal: deterministic fragility on one side, and stochastic rescue under weak noise on the other. Our analysis demonstrates that noise disrupts the convergence of deterministic trajectories toward extinction by altering the phase space topology, enabling back-transitions to viable states. This mechanism gives rise to noise-induced metastability and reveals a form of stochastic robustness not captured by deterministic models. These findings suggest that natural fluctuations can serve as a stabilizing force in complex systems, offering a compelling counter-narrative to classical models in ecology, epidemiology, and beyond. We advocate for a re-evaluation of stabilization strategies, emphasizing the constructive role of stochasticity in averting population collapse.</description>

      <title>Understanding Reaction Mechanisms from Start to Finish</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.04052</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.04052v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Understanding mechanisms of rare but important events in complex molecular systems, such as protein folding or ligand (un)binding, requires accurately mapping transition paths from an initial to a final state. The committor is the ideal reaction coordinate for this purpose, but calculating it for high-dimensional, nonlinear systems has long been considered intractable. Here, we introduce an iterative path sampling strategy for computing the committor function for systems with high free energy barriers. We start with an initial guess to define isocommittor interfaces for transition interface sampling. The resulting path ensemble is then reweighted and used to train a neural network, yielding a more accurate committor model. This process is repeated until convergence, effectively solving the long-standing circular problem in enhanced sampling where a good reaction coordinate is needed to generate efficient sampling, and vice-versa. The final, converged committor model can be interrogated to extract mechanistic insights. We demonstrate the power of our method on a benchmark 2D potential and a more complex host-guest (un)binding process in explicit solvent.</description>

      <title>Orbital distortion and parabolic channel effects transform minima in molecular ionization probabilities into maxima</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.04096</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.04096v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In the tunneling regime and at sufficiently low field amplitudes, the shape of orientation-dependent molecular ionization rate curves usually resembles the shape of the ionized orbital. As the ionizing field strength increases, the shape of the ionization rate can deviate from this pattern. The oft-cited explanation is that the increasing contribution of excited states relative to the ground state modifies the distribution. In this paper, we show that orbital distortion and parabolic channel effects, which are independent of excited-state effects, can also significantly modify the angular dependence of the yields of widely studied molecules where excited state effects are negligible. For example, we find that in CH$_3$Br, the interplay between orbital distortion and parabolic channel effects transforms a local minimum in the orientation-dependent ionization rate to a local maximum as the ionizing field strength increases. To simulate orbital distortion and parabolic channel effects, we use the one-electron weak-field asymptotic theory including the first-order correction (OE-WFAT(1)) in the integral representation. Since OE-WFAT(1) incurs expensive computations when the number of orientation angles is large, we also reformulate the original OE-WFAT(1) algorithm into a partial-wave expansion form, which greatly enhances the efficiency of the method.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2507.04115v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a modular user-oriented simulation toolbox for studying highharmonic generation in gases. The first release consists of the computational pipeline to 1) compute the unidirectional IR-pulse propagation incylindrical symmetry, 2) solve the microscopic responses in the whole macroscopic volume using a 1D-TDSE solver, 3) obtain the far-field harmonic field using a diffraction-integral approach. The code comes with interfaces and tutorials, based on practical laboratory conditions, to facilitate the usage and deployment of the code both locally and in HPC-clusters. Additionally, the modules are designed to work as stand-alone applications as well, e.g., 1D-TDSE is available through Pythonic interface.</description>

      <title>Model selection for stochastic dynamics: a parsimonious and principled approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.04121</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.04121v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This thesis focuses on the discovery of stochastic differential equations (SDEs) and stochastic partial differential equations (SPDEs) from noisy and discrete time series. A major challenge is selecting the simplest possible correct model from vast libraries of candidate models, where standard information criteria (AIC, BIC) are often limited.
  We introduce PASTIS (Parsimonious Stochastic Inference), a new information criterion derived from extreme value theory. Its penalty term, $n_\mathcal{B} \ln(n_0/p)$, explicitly incorporates the size of the initial library of candidate parameters ($n_0$), the number of parameters in the considered model ($n_\mathcal{B}$), and a significance threshold ($p$). This significance threshold represents the probability of selecting a model containing more parameters than necessary when comparing many models.
  Benchmarks on various systems (Lorenz, Ornstein-Uhlenbeck, Lotka-Volterra for SDEs; Gray-Scott for SPDEs) demonstrate that PASTIS outperforms AIC, BIC, cross-validation (CV), and SINDy (a competing method) in terms of exact model identification and predictive capability.
  Furthermore, real-world data can be subject to large sampling intervals ($\Delta t$) or measurement noise ($\sigma$), which can impair model learning and selection capabilities. To address this, we have developed robust variants of PASTIS, PASTIS-$\Delta t$ and PASTIS-$\sigma$, thus extending the applicability of the approach to imperfect experimental data.
  PASTIS thus provides a statistically grounded, validated, and practical methodological framework for discovering simple models for processes with stochastic dynamics.</description>

Abstract: Physics-informed neural networks (PINNs) and neural operators (NOs) for solving the problem of diffraction of Extreme Ultraviolet (EUV) electromagnetic waves from a mask are presented. A novel hybrid Waveguide Neural Operator (WGNO) is introduced, which is based on a waveguide method with its most computationally expensive part replaced by a neural network. Numerical experiments on realistic 2D and 3D masks show that the WGNO achieves state-of-the-art accuracy and inference time, providing a highly efficient solution for accelerating the design workflows of lithography masks.</description>

      <title>The occupation dependent DFT-1/2 method</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.04804v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: There has been a high demand in rectifying the band gap under-estimation problem in density functional theory (DFT), while keeping the computational load at the same level as local density approximation. DFT-1/2 and shell DFT-1/2 are useful attempts, as they correct the spurious electron self-interaction through the application of self-energy potentials, which pull down the valence band. Nevertheless, the self-energy potential inevitably disturbs the conduction band, and these two methods fail for semiconductors whose hole and electron are entangled in the same shell-like regions. In this work, we introduce the occupation-dependent DFT-1/2 method, where conduction band states are not subject to the additional self-energy potential disturbance. This methodology works for difficult cases such as $\text{Li}_2\text{O}_2$, $\text{Cu}_2\text{O}$ and two-dimensional semiconductors. Using a shell-like region for the self-energy potential, and allowing for downscaling of the atomic self-energy potential (with an $A$ &lt; 1 factor), the occupation-dependent shell DFT+$A$-1/2 method yields more accurate conduction band and valence band edge levels for monolayer $\text{MoS}_2$, compared with the computationally demanding hybrid functional approach.</description>

      <title>A novel parallelizable convergence accelerating method: Pointwise Frequency Damping</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.04873</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.04873v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper proposes a novel class of data-driven acceleration methods for steady-state flow field solvers. The core innovation lies in predicting and assigning the asymptotic limit value for each parameter during iterations based on its own historical data, rather than processing and assigning the entire flow field at once. This approach fundamentally guarantees identical results between serial and parallel computations. Subsequently, a formula for representing the asymptotic limit based on historical data is derived and discretized, yielding a purely algebraic expression.Furthermore, the applicability scope of the method is discussed, along with the underlying reasons for its acceleration capability. A quantitative expression for estimating the speedup ratio is also provided. Extensive validation cases were tested, ranging from the simplest inviscid airfoil flow to complex three-dimensional viscous transonic cruise flow around a aircraft, and solving asymmetric linear systems via GMRES. These tests consistently demonstrate significant acceleration effects with speedup factors ranging from 2.5 to 4. Combined with the near-zero computational overhead of the purely algebraic formulation during the solving process and the inherently parallel-compatible pointwise prediction principle, the results strongly indicate that this method is highly suitable for large-scale industrial mesh computations.</description>

      <title>Quantum transport in nitrogen-doped nanoporous graphenes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.04892</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.04892v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Bottom-up on-surface synthesized nanoporous graphenes (NPGs), realized as 2D arrays of laterally covalently bonded pi-conjugated graphene nanoribbons (GNRs), are a family of carbon nanomaterials which are receiving increasing attention for nanoelectronics and biosensing. Recently, a so-called hybrid-NPG (hNPG) was synthesized, featuring an alternating sequence of doped and non-doped GNRs, resulting in a band staggering effect in its electronic structure. Such a feature is appealing for photo-catalysis, photovoltaics and even carbon nanocircuitry. However, to date, little is known about the transport properties of hNPG and its derivatives, which is key for most applications. Here, via Green's functions simulations, we study the quantum transport properties of hNPGs. We find that injected carriers in hNPG spread laterally through a number of GNRs, though such spreading may take place exclusively through GNRs of one type (doped or non-doped). We propose a simple model to discern the key parameters determining the electronic propagation in hNPGs and explore alternative hNPG designs to control the spreading/confinement and anisotropy of charge transport in these systems. For one such design, we find that it is possible to send directed electric signals with sub-nanometer precision for as long as one micrometer - a result first reported for any NPG.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2507.04986v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The multi-direct-forcing immersed boundary method allows for high accuracy of the no-slip condition in moving-particle problems but suffers from numerical instability if simulation parameters are not carefully chosen. This study investigates the numerical accuracy and stability of the accelerated multidirect-forcing immersed boundary method. An analysis of the discretized equations of body motion in moving boundary problems identifies a critical parameter that solely determines the numerical stability for the body motion. Additionally, numerical simulations reveal the optimal acceleration parameter that minimizes the error in the no-slip condition and is independent of details of the boundary discretisation, the boundary shape, and spatial dimensionality. This study provides a guideline for establishing numerically stable simulations of moving boundary problems at optimal accuracy of the no-slip condition.</description>

      <title>A COMPASS to Model Comparison and Simulation-Based Inference in Galactic Chemical Evolution</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.05060</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.05060v2 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present COMPASS, a novel simulation-based inference framework that combines score-based diffusion models with transformer architectures to jointly perform parameter estimation and Bayesian model comparison across competing Galactic Chemical Evolution (GCE) models. COMPASS handles high-dimensional, incomplete, and variable-size stellar abundance datasets. Applied to high-precision elemental abundance measurements, COMPASS evaluates 40 combinations of nucleosynthetic yield tables. The model strongly favours Asymptotic Giant Branch yields from NuGrid and core-collapse SN yields used in the IllustrisTNG simulation, achieving near-unity cumulative posterior probability. Using the preferred model, we infer a steep high-mass IMF slope and an elevated Supernova Ia normalization, consistent with prior solar neighbourhood studies but now derived from fully amortized Bayesian inference. Our results demonstrate that modern SBI methods can robustly constrain uncertain physics in astrophysical simulators and enable principled model selection when analysing complex, simulation-based data.</description>

      <title>Atomistic study of dislocation formation during Ge epitaxy on Si</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.05082</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.05082v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We performed classical molecular dynamics simulations to investigate, from an atomistic point of view, the formation of dislocations during the epitaxial growth of Ge on Si. We show that simulations at 900 and 1000 K with deposition rates of 10$^8$ monolayers per second provide a good compromise between computational cost and accuracy. In these conditions, the ratio between the Ge deposition rate and the ad-atom jump rate is analogous to that of out-of-equilibrium experiments. In addition, the main features of the grown film (intermixing, critical film thickness, dislocation typology, and surface morphology) are well described. Our simulations reveal that dislocations originate in low-density amorphous regions that form under valleys of the rough Ge film surface. Atoms are squeezed out of these regions to the surface, releasing the stress accumulated in the film and smoothing its surface. Amorphous regions grow until atoms begin to rearrange in dislocation half-loops that propagate throughout the Ge film. The threading arm ends of the dislocation half-loops move along the surface following valleys and avoiding islands. The film surface morphology affects the propagation path of the dislocation half-loops and the resulting dislocation network.</description>

      <title>Dequantized particle algorithm for the nonlinear Vlasov-Poisson system</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.05151</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.05151v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a dequantization algorithm for the Vlasov--Poisson (VP) system, termed the dequantized particle algorithm, by systematically dequantizing the underlying many-body quantum theory. Starting from the second-quantized Hamiltonian description, we derive a finite-dimensional dequantized system and show that it furnishes a structure-preserving discretization of the Schr\"odinger--Poisson (SP) equations. Through the Wigner or Husimi transformations, this discretization provides an efficient approximation of the VP system when quantum effects are negligible. Unlike conventional structure-preserving algorithms formulated in 6D phase space, this dequantized particle algorithm operates in 3D configuration space, potentially offering more compact and efficient representations of physical information under appropriate conditions. A numerical example of the classical nonlinear two-stream instability, simulated using merely 97 dequantized particles, demonstrates the efficiency, accuracy, and conservation properties of the algorithm and confirms its potential as a foundation for developing quantum and quantum-inspired classical algorithms for kinetic plasma dynamics.</description>

      <title>The design, verification, and applications of Hotspice: a Monte Carlo simulator for artificial spin ice</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.05580</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.05580v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present Hotspice, a Monte Carlo simulation software designed to capture the dynamics and equilibrium states of Artificial Spin Ice (ASI) systems with both in-plane (IP) and out-of-plane (OOP) geometries. An Ising-like model is used where each nanomagnet is represented as a macrospin, with switching events driven by thermal fluctuations, magnetostatic interactions, and external fields. To improve simulation accuracy, we explore the impact of several corrections to this model, concerning for example the calculation of the dipole interaction in IP and OOP ASI, as well as the impact of allowing asymmetric rather than symmetric energy barriers between stable states. We validate these enhancements by comparing simulation results with experimental data for pinwheel and kagome ASI lattices, demonstrating how these corrections enable a more accurate simulation of the behavior of these systems. We finish with a demonstration of `clocking' in pinwheel and OOP square ASI as an example of reservoir computing.</description>

      <title>Extreme scaling of the metadynamics of paths algorithm on the pre-exascale JUWELS Booster supercomputer</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.11962</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.11962v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Molecular dynamics (MD)-based path sampling algorithms are a very important class of methods used to study the energetics and kinetics of rare (bio)molecular events. They sample the highly informative but highly unlikely reactive trajectories connecting different metastable states of complex (bio)molecular systems. The metadynamics of paths (MoP) method proposed by Mandelli, Hirshberg, and Parrinello [Pys. Rev. Lett. 125 2, 026001 (2020)] is based on the Onsager-Machlup path integral formalism. This provides an analytical expression for the probability of sampling stochastic trajectories of given duration. In practice, the method samples reactive paths via metadynamics simulations performed directly in the phase space of all possible trajectories. Its parallel implementation is in principle infinitely scalable, allowing arbitrarily long trajectories to be simulated. Paving the way for future applications to study the thermodynamics and kinetics of protein-ligand (un)binding, a problem of great pharmaceutical interest, we present here the efficient implementation of MoP in the HPC-oriented biomolecular simulation software GROMACS. Our benchmarks on a membrane protein (150,000 atoms) show an unprecedented weak scaling parallel efficiency of over 70% up to 3200 GPUs on the pre-exascale JUWELS Booster machine at the J\"ulich Supercomputing Center.</description>

      <title>Physics-informed neural networks for solving moving interface flow problems using the level set approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.02440</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.02440v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper advances the use of physics-informed neural networks (PINNs) architectures to address moving interface problems via the level set method. Originally developed for other PDE-based problems, we particularly leverage PirateNet's features, including causal training, sequence-to-sequence learning, random weight factorization, and Fourier feature embeddings, and tailor them to handle problems with complex interface dynamics. Numerical experiments validate this framework on benchmark problems such as Zalesak's disk rotation and time-reversed vortex flow. We demonstrate that PINNs can efficiently solve level set problems exhibiting significant interface deformation without the need for upwind numerical stabilization, as generally required by classic discretization methods, or additional mass conservation schemes. However, incorporating an Eikonal regularization term in the loss function with an appropriate weight can further enhance results in specific scenarios. Our results indicate that PINNs with the PirateNet architecture surpass conventional PINNs in accuracy, achieving state-of-the-art error rates of $L^2=0.14\%$ for Zalesak's disk and $L^2=0.85 \%$ for the time-reversed vortex flow problem, as compared to reference solutions. Additionally, for a complex two-phase flow dam break problem coupling the level set with the Navier-Stokes equations, we propose a geometric reinitialization method embedded within the sequence-to-sequence training scheme to ensure long-term stability and accurate inference of the level set field.</description>

      <title>Atomic Confinement Potentials and the Generation of Numerical Atomic Orbitals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.09540</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.09540v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We aim to develop novel reusable open source infrastructure [Lehtola, J. Chem. Phys. 159, 180901 (2023)] for numerical atomic orbitals (NAOs). Soft confinement potentials are typically used to force the NAO radial basis functions ${\psi}_{nl}(r)$ to vanish smoothly in increasing $r$ and to generate localized unoccupied states; we review such potentials and other commonly-used techniques in NAO generation as a follow-up to our recent study on atoms in hard-wall confinement [{\AA}str\"om and Lehtola, J. Phys. Chem. A 129, 2791 (2025)]. In addition to NAO generation, confinement potentials are also employed to simulate environmental effects in other research areas, such as studies of (i) atoms in solids, (ii) quantum dots, and (iii) high-pressure chemistry. As in our earlier work, we perform fully numerical density functional calculations with spherically averaged densities, as is usual in NAO studies. Our calculations employ the the finite element method (FEM) implemented in the HelFEM program, yielding variational energies and enabling the use of various boundary conditions. We consider four families of potentials to study the Mg and Ca atoms, which are textbook examples of extended electronic structures. We show that the resulting ground-state orbitals are surprisingly insensitive to the employed form of the confinement potential, and that the orbitals decay quickly under confinement. We study increasingly steep potentials and examine how they approach the hard-wall limit. Finally, we assess NAO basis set truncation errors for types of singular potentials that are now broadly used in the NAO literature.</description>

      <title>Machine Learning Accelerated Descriptor Design for Catalyst Discovery in CO$_2$ to Methanol Conversion</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.13838v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Transforming CO$_2$ into methanol represents a crucial step towards closing the carbon cycle, with thermoreduction technology nearing industrial application. However, obtaining high methanol yields and ensuring the stability of heterocatalysts remain significant challenges. Herein, we present a sophisticated computational framework to accelerate the discovery of thermal heterogeneous catalysts, using machine-learned force fields. We propose a new catalytic descriptor, termed adsorption energy distribution, that aggregates the binding energies for different catalyst facets, binding sites, and adsorbates. The descriptor is versatile and can be adjusted to a specific reaction through careful choice of the key-step reactants and reaction intermediates. By applying unsupervised machine learning and statistical analysis to a dataset comprising nearly 160 metallic alloys, we offer a powerful tool for catalyst discovery. We propose new promising candidates such as ZnRh and ZnPt$_3$, which to our knowledge, have not yet been tested, and discuss their possible advantage in terms of stability.</description>

      <title>Learning Physically Interpretable Atmospheric Models from Data with WSINDy</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.00738v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The multiscale and turbulent nature of Earth's atmosphere has historically rendered accurate weather modeling a hard problem. Recently, there has been an explosion of interest surrounding data-driven approaches to weather modeling, which in many cases show improved forecasting accuracy and computational efficiency when compared to traditional methods. However, many of the current data-driven approaches employ highly parameterized neural networks, often resulting in uninterpretable models and limited gains in scientific understanding. In this work, we address the interpretability problem by explicitly discovering partial differential equations governing atmospheric phenomena, identifying symbolic mathematical models with direct physical interpretations. The purpose of this paper is to demonstrate that, in particular, the Weak form Sparse Identification of Nonlinear Dynamics (WSINDy) algorithm can learn effective atmospheric models from both simulated and assimilated data. Our approach adapts the standard WSINDy algorithm to work with high-dimensional fluid data of arbitrary spatial dimension.</description>

      <title>A symmetric boundary integral formulation for time-domain acoustic-elastic scattering</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.04767v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A symmetric boundary integral formulation for the transient scattering of acoustic waves off homogeneous and isotropic elastic obstacles is analyzed. Both the acoustic scattered field and the elastodynamic excited field are represented through a direct integral representation, resulting in a coupled system of interior/exterior integral equations that is symmetrized through the introduction of an auxiliary mortar variable. The analysis of each system and of its Galerkin discretization is done through the passage to the Laplace domain, which allows for the use of convolution quadrature for time discretization. Since the operators of the acustic and elastic Calder\'on calculus appear independently of each other, the formulation is well suited for non-intrusive numerical impementations (i.e. existing codes for acoustic and elastic problems can be used without any modification).</description>

      <title>CO2 Hydration at the Air-Water Interface: A Surface-Mediated 'In and Out' Mechanism</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.08348</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.08348v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: An understanding of the CO$_2$ + H$_2$O hydration reaction is crucial for modeling the effects of ocean acidification, for enabling novel carbon storage solutions, and as a model process in the geosciences. While the mechanism of this reaction has been investigated extensively in the condensed phase, its mechanism at the air-water interface remains elusive, leaving uncertain the contribution that surface-adsorbed CO$_2$ makes to the overall acidification reaction. In this study, we employ machine-learned potentials trained to various levels of theory to provide a molecular-level understanding of CO$_2$ hydration at the air-water interface. We show that reaction at the interface follows a surface-mediated `In and Out' mechanism: CO$_2$ diffuses into the aqueous surface layer, reacts to form carbonic acid, and is subsequently expelled from solution. We show that this surface layer provides a bulk-like solvation environment, engendering similar modes of reactivity and near-identical free energy profiles for the bulk and interfacial processes. Our study unveils a new, unconventional reaction mechanism that underscores the dynamic nature of the molecular reaction site at the air-water interface. The similarity between bulk and interfacial profiles shows that CO$_2$ hydration is equally as feasible under these two solvation environments and that acidification rates are likely enhanced by this additional surface contribution.</description>

      <title>Entropy plateaus can emerge from gas replacement at a characteristic halo mass in simulated groups and clusters of galaxies</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.05675v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The evolution of the intergalactic medium (IGM) is influenced by gravitational collapse, radiative cooling, and baryonic feedback. Using cosmological hydrodynamic zoom-in simulations of a $8.83 \times 10^{12}$ M$_\odot$ group and a $2.92 \times 10^{14}$ M$_\odot$ cluster at $z=0$, we investigate the emergence of entropy plateaus and their connection to feedback mechanisms. This set-up uses the SWIFT-EAGLE model with three resolutions, down to an initial particle gas mass of $2.29 \times 10^5$ M$_\odot$ and $1.23 \times 10^6$ M$_\odot$ for dark matter. We find that, when halos reach the characteristic mass of $\sim 10^{12}$ M$_{\odot}$, their entropy profiles flatten at the virial radius, marking a transition from supernova to AGN feedback-driven regulation. As halos grow into groups ($\sim 10^{13}$ M$_{\odot}$), the entropy plateau extends inward and isentropic cores form in massive systems ($\sim 10^{14}$ M$_{\odot}$). By tracking the Lagrangian history of gas particles, we demonstrate that this entropy buildup is primarily driven by AGN feedback, which efficiently removes low-entropy gas from progenitors of groups and clusters, redistributing it throughout the IGM before falling into the core. Recent observations of X-GAP groups reveal large entropy excesses and plateaus, in line with our findings and in contrast to the power-law-like profiles of most previous observations. While entropy plateaus and large entropy excesses may be observationally confirmed in unbiased samples, reproducing the full diversity of entropy profiles remains an outstanding challenge for next-generation feedback models. Our results suggest that current feedback models may be overly efficient in expelling low-entropy gas from the potential cool-core progenitors, disrupting the balance between heating and cooling required for long-lived cool cores.</description>

      <title>Modeling the g-factors, hyperfine interaction and optical properties of semiconductor QDs: the atomistic and eight-band $k \cdot p$ approaches</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.22380</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.22380v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present a detailed comparative study of two important theoretical approaches: atomistic sp$^3$d$^5$s$^*$ tight-binding and continuum eight-band $k \cdot p$ methods, for modeling the spin and optical properties of quantum dots (QDs). Our investigation spans key physical observables, including single-particle energy levels, g-factors, exciton radiative lifetimes, and hyperfine-induced Overhauser field fluctuations. We perform our calculations for self-assembled InGaAs/GaAs QD systems as representative case studies. While both methods yield qualitatively consistent trends, quantitative discrepancies arise due to different treatment of atomistic details, strain effects, and confinement. We introduce targeted corrections to the eight-band $k \cdot p$ framework, including a modified deformation potential scheme and adjusted remote-band contributions, to improve agreement with atomistic results, especially for electron g-factors and single-particle energies. Furthermore, we validate the eight-band implementation of hyperfine interactions by benchmarking it against the tight-binding model, showing reasonable convergence for both electrons and holes. Our results establish criteria for selecting the appropriate modeling framework based on the desired physical accuracy and computational efficiency in spin-optical studies of semiconductor QDs.</description>

      <title>Dilution, Diffusion and Symbiosis in Spatial Prisoner's Dilemma with Reinforcement Learning</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.02211v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recent studies in the spatial prisoner's dilemma games with reinforcement learning have shown that static agents can learn to cooperate through a diverse sort of mechanisms, including noise injection, different types of learning algorithms and neighbours' payoff knowledge. In this work, using an independent multi-agent Q-learning algorithm, we study the effects of dilution and mobility in the spatial version of the prisoner's dilemma. Within this setting, different possible actions for the algorithm are defined, connecting with previous results on the classical, non-reinforcement learning spatial prisoner's dilemma, showcasing the versatility of the algorithm in modeling different game-theoretical scenarios and the benchmarking potential of this approach. As a result, a range of effects is observed, including evidence that games with fixed update rules can be qualitatively equivalent to those with learned ones, as well as the emergence of a symbiotic mutualistic effect between populations that forms when multiple actions are defined.</description>
