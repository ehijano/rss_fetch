      <title>Flipping odd matchings in geometric and combinatorial settings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.18457</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.18457v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the problem of reconfiguring odd matchings, that is, matchings that cover all but a single vertex. Our reconfiguration operation is a so-called flip where the unmatched vertex of the first matching gets matched, while consequently another vertex becomes unmatched. We consider two distinct settings: the geometric setting, in which the vertices are points embedded in the plane and all occurring odd matchings are crossing-free, and a combinatorial setting, in which we consider odd matchings in general graphs.
  For the latter setting, we provide a complete polynomial time checkable characterization of graphs in which any two odd matchings can be reconfigured into each another. This complements the previously known result that the flip graph is always connected in the geometric setting [Aichholzer, Br\"otzner, Perz, and Schnider. Flips in odd matchings]. In the combinatorial setting, we prove that the diameter of the flip graph, if connected, is linear in the number of vertices. Furthermore, we establish that deciding whether there exists a flip sequence of length $k$ transforming one given matching into another is NP-complete in both the combinatorial and the geometric settings. To prove the latter, we introduce a framework that allows us to transform partial order types into general position with only polynomial overhead. Finally, we demonstrate that when parameterized by the flip distance $k$, the problem is fixed-parameter tractable (FPT) in the geometric setting when restricted to convex point sets.</description>

      <title>Tangling and Untangling Trees on Point-sets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.18535</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.18535v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study a question that lies at the intersection of classical research subjects in Topological Graph Theory and Graph Drawing: Computing a drawing of a graph with a prescribed number of crossings on a given set $S$ of points, while ensuring that its curve complexity (i.e., maximum number of bends per edge) is bounded by a constant. We focus on trees: Let $T$ be a tree, $\vartheta(T)$ be its thrackle number, and $\chi$ be any integer in the interval $[0,\vartheta(T)]$. In the tangling phase we compute a topological linear embedding of $T$ with $\vartheta(T)$ edge crossings and a constant number of spine traversals. In the untangling phase we remove edge crossings without increasing the spine traversals until we reach $\chi$ crossings. The computed linear embedding is used to construct a drawing of $T$ on $S$ with $\chi$ crossings and constant curve complexity. Our approach gives rise to an $O(n^2)$-time algorithm for general trees and an $O(n \log n)$-time algorithm for paths. We also adapt the approach to compute RAC drawings, i.e. drawings where the angles formed at edge crossings are $\frac{\pi}{2}$.</description>

      <title>A convex polyhedron without Rupert's property</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.18475</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.18475v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A three-dimensional convex body is said to have Rupert's property if its copy can be passed through a straight hole inside that body. In this work we construct a polyhedron which is provably not Rupert, thus we disprove a conjecture from 2017. We also find a polyhedron that is Rupert but not locally Rupert.</description>

      <title>Discrete Level Set Persistence for Finite Discrete Functions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.17794</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.17794v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study sublevel set and superlevel set persistent homology on discrete functions through the perspective of finite ordered sets of both linearly ordered and cyclically ordered domains. Finite ordered sets also serve as the codomain of our functions making all arguments finite and discrete. We prove duality of filtrations of sublevel sets and superlevel sets that undergirths a range of duality results of sublevel set persistent homology without the need to invoke complications of continuous functions or classical Morse theory. We show that Morse-like behavior can be achieved for flat extrema without assuming genericity. Additionally, we show that with inversion of order, one can compute sublevel set persistence from superlevel set persistence, and vice versa via a duality result that does not require the boundary to be treated as a special case. Furthermore, we discuss aspects of barcode construction rules, surgery of circular and linearly ordered sets, as well as surgery on auxiliary structures such as box snakes, which segment the ordered set by extrema and monotones.</description>
