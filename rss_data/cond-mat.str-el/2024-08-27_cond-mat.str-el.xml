      <title>Obstruction to Broken Symmetries in Topological Flat Bands</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.14533</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.14533v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Motivated by the abundance of symmetry breaking states in magic-angle twisted bilayer graphene and other two-dimensional materials, we study superconducting (SC) and charge orders in two-dimensional topological flat bands in the strong correlation regime. By relating the half-filled 2D topological flat bands to the surface states of 3D topological insulators in symmetry class AIII, we reveal the topological obstruction to the formation of gapped SC and inter-valley charge orders without intrinsic topological orders, in the presence of the anti-unitary particle-hole symmetry at half filling. This is a generalization of the Li-Haldane arguments for nodal superconductivity to strongly interacting electrons. In contrast to the $\mathbb{Z}$-valued obstruction derived from the non-interacting band topology, the topological obstruction of interacting electrons in half-filled flat bands has a $\mathbb{Z}_{8}$ classification, depending on the charge (valley) Chern number of the superconducting (inter-valley charge) orders. This is demonstrated by an interacting Hamiltonian for half-filled flat bands with a net Chern number $C=4$, where superconductivity and $\mathbb{Z}_2$ topological order coexist in a gapped ground state with particle-hole symmetry.</description>

      <title>Connection between f-electron correlations and magnetic excitations in UTe2</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.14619</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.14619v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The detailed anisotropy of the low-temperature, low-energy magnetic excitations of the candidate spin-triplet superconductor UTe$_2$ is revealed using inelastic neutron scattering. The magnetic excitations emerge from the Brillouin zone boundary at the high symmetry $Y$ and $T$ points and disperse along the crystallographic $\hat{b}$-axis. In applied magnetic fields to at least $\mu_0 H=11$~T along the $\hat{c}-$axis, the magnetism is found to be field-independent in the $(hk0)$ plane. The scattering intensity is consistent with that expected from U$^{3+}$/U$^{4+}$ $f$-electron spins with preferential orientation along the crystallographic $\hat{a}$-axis, and a fluctuating magnetic moment of 2.3(7) $\mu_B$. These characteristics indicate that the excitations are due to intraband spin excitons arising from $f$-electron hybridization.</description>

      <title>Phonon effects, impact ionization and power conversion in Mott photovoltaic systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.14822</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.14822v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We analyze the effect of acoustic phonons on the photocurrent and the spectral characteristics of a simplified photovoltaic setup made of Mott insulating layers between two metallic leads among which a bias voltage is applied. This paper extends and completes the study made in a previous work by the authors [Gazzaneo et al., Phys. Rev. B 109, 235134]. We include acoustic phonons via the Migdal approximation and we use real-space Floquet dynamical mean-field theory to address the nonequilibrium Floquet steady-state. The so-called auxiliary master equation approach is employed as impurity solver. We find that impact ionization is only weakly affected by dissipation by acoustic phonons at low bias voltages. For higher biases instead, the Hartree shift considerably alters the on-site energies of the Hubbard bands and suppresses the photocurrent for intermediate electron-phonon coupling strengths. Impact ionization processes play a fundamental role in enhancing the electrical output power, which decreases when electron-phonon interaction is considered.</description>

      <title>Non-Fermi liquid over extended range at zero temperature without quantum criticality</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.14858</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.14858v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A strange metal state appears in many strongly correlated materials from the cuprates, pnictides, and twisted bilayer graphenes to even bosonic systems. Enormous efforts are being made to unravel the nature of the non-Fermi liquid (NFL) which underlies the strange metallicity, yet progress is rather slow. Understanding the NFL behavior is crucial, in addition to its importance in replacing the Fermi liquid paradigm, in that NFL is the normal state from which new states of matter emerge like high temperature superconductivity. Here, we report the appearance of an NFL phase in a discontinuous metal-NFL-insulator transition in a ``non-engineered'' Hamiltonian of the Holstein model away from half-filling. The discontinuity of the phase transition between NFL and Fermi liquid metal renders the ground state at the phase boundary a mixture between them over an extended range like the extended criticality observed in cuprates and other quantum materials. The dynamical mean-field theory was employed in combination with Wilson's numerical renormalization group technique. We identify the origin of the NFL metal phase as the opening of a spin gap in the absence of a charge gap. Also, strong lattice fluctuations emerge at the boundary which should enhance superconductivity.</description>

      <title>A Field Guide to non-Onsager Quantum Oscillations in Metals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.15092</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.15092v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum oscillation (QO) measurements constitute a powerful method to measure the Fermi surface (FS) properties of metals. The observation of QOs at specific frequencies is usually taken as strong evidence for the existence of extremal cross-sectional areas of the FS that directly correspond to the measured frequency value according to the famous Onsager relation. Here, we review mechanisms that generate QO frequencies that defy the Onsager relation and discuss material candidates. These include magnetic breakdown, magnetic interaction, chemical potential oscillations, and Stark quantum interference, most of which lead to signals occurring at combinations of "parent" Onsager frequencies. A special emphasis is put on the recently discovered mechanism of quasi-particle lifetime oscillations (QPLOs). We aim to provide a field guide that allows, on the one hand, to distinguish such non-Onsager QOs from conventional QOs arising from extremal cross sections and, on the other hand, to distinguish the various non-Onsager mechanisms from each other. We give a practical classification of non-Onsager QOs in terms of the prerequisites for their occurrence and their characteristics. We show that, in particular, the recently discovered QPLOs may pose significant challenges for the interpretation of QO spectra, as they may occur quite generically as frequency differences in multi-orbit systems, without the necessity of visible "parent" frequencies in the spectrum, owing to a strongly suppressed temperature dephasing of QPLOs. We present an extensive list of material candidates where QPLOs may represent an alternative explanation for the observation of unexpected QO frequencies.</description>

      <title>Flavor Nernst effects in quantum paramagnets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.15160</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.15160v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent advances in spin transport research have highlighted the potential of quantum paramagnets as platforms for exploring novel phenomena and developing next-generation technologies. In this paper, we investigate the flavor Nernst effect (FNE) in quantum paramagnets, focusing on the Hall-type thermal spin transport of crystal electric field (CEF) excitations with spin-orbit couplings. As a proof of principle, we investigate the quantum paramagnetic ground state in an effective spin-1 Hamiltonian with Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interactions and a large hard-axis anisotropy. We employ linear flavor-wave theory to analyze the low-energy excitations, and obtain the flavor Nernst coefficients from the linear response theory. We demonstrate the FNE in a 2D pyrochlore thin film with an all-in-all-out Ising axis configuration, and investigate their dependence on temperature, anisotropy, DM interaction, and external fields. Our results reveal the connection between the FNE and the Berry curvature of the CEF excitations, suggesting potential applications in manipulating thermal spin currents and exploring topological spin transport phenomena in quantum paramagnets.</description>

      <title>Theoretical investigation of quantum oscillations of specific heat in Kondo insulators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.15216</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.15216v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The electronic specific heat of Kondo insulators in magnetic field is studied for the half-filled Kondo lattice model on simple cubic lattice using a low-temperature theory in Kumar representation. The calculated specific heat is found to show quantum oscillations, which appear soon after the inversion transition and become prominent with decreasing Kondo coupling. Interestingly, it is noted that the field derivative of specific heat closely resembles the magnetic quantum oscillations, and exhibits more pronounced oscillations at finite temperatures than the magnetization itself. An empirical Lifshitz-Kosevich fit with two frequencies given by the theory describes these quantum oscillations reasonably well, where the frequencies correspond to the extremal areas on the surface of charge gap, a remnant of the Fermi surface in the insulating case.</description>

Abstract: A detailed spectroscopic simulation of the original Pu N4,5 and O4,5 X-Ray Absorption Spectroscopy (XAS) has been performed. Additionally, a fundamental flaw in the Electron Energy Loss Spectroscopy (EELS) measurement has been corrected. Thus, the determination of the 5f occupation (n) in elemental Pu has been re-evaluated with the result that n = 5.0 +/- 0.1 for alphaPu and n = 4.9 +/- 0.2 for deltaPu. These values are significantly lower than the value of ~5.5 that was propagated earlier.</description>

      <title>Semiclassical scattering by edge imperfections in topological insulators under magnetic field</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.14540</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.14540v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the scattering of edge states of 2D topological insulator (TI) in the uniform external magnetic field due to edge imperfections, common in realistic 2D TI samples. The external magnetic field breaks time reversal (TR) symmetry, opening the possibility of the scattering of otherwise topologically protected fermionic edge states. The scattering happens to be always an over-barrier event, irrespective of the shape of the edge deformation and magnitude of the magnetic field. We use the advanced Pokrovsky-Khalatnikov semiclassical approach, which allows us to obtain analytically both the main exponential and pre-exponential factors of the scattering amplitude for wide classes of analytic deformation profiles.</description>

      <title>A recipe for local simulation of strongly-correlated fermionic matter on quantum computers: the 2D Fermi-Hubbard model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.14543</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.14543v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The simulation of quantum many-body systems, relevant for quantum chemistry and condensed matter physics, is one of the most promising applications of near-term quantum computers before fault-tolerance. However, since the vast majority of quantum computing technologies are built around qubits and discrete gate-based operations, the translation of the physical problem into this framework is a crucial step. This translation will often be device specific, and a suboptimal implementation will be punished by the exponential compounding of errors on real devices. The importance of an efficient mapping is already revealed for models of spinful fermions in two or three dimensions, which naturally arise when the relevant physics relates to electrons. Using the most direct and well-known mapping, the Jordan-Wigner transformation, leads to a non-local representation of local degrees of freedom, and necessities efficient decompositions of non-local unitary gates into a sequence of hardware accessible local gates. In this paper, we provide a step-by-step recipe for simulating the paradigmatic two-dimensional Fermi-Hubbard model on a quantum computer using only local operations. To provide the ingredients for such a recipe, we briefly review the plethora of different approaches that have emerged recently but focus on the Derby-Klassen compact fermion mapping in order to make our discussion concrete. We provide a detailed recipe for an end-to-end simulation including embedding on a physical device, preparing initial states such as ground states, simulation of unitary time evolution, and measurement of observables and spectral functions. We explicitly compute the resource requirements for simulating a global quantum quench and conclude by discussing the challenges and future directions for simulating strongly-correlated fermionic matter on quantum computers.</description>

      <title>Engineering a Josephson junction chain for the simulation of the clock model</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.14549v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The continuous improvement of fabrication techniques and high-quality semiconductor-superconductor interfaces allowed for unprecedented tunability of Josephson junction arrays (JJA), making them a promising candidate for analog quantum simulations of many-body phenomena. While most experimental proposals so far focused on quantum simulations of ensembles of two-level systems, the possibility of tuning the current-phase relation beyond the sinusoidal regime paves the way for studying statistical physics models with larger local Hilbert spaces. Here, we investigate a particular JJA architecture that can be mapped into a $\mathbb{Z}_3$ clock model. Through matrix-product-states simulations and bosonization analysis, we show that few experimentally accessible control parameters allow for the exploration of the rich phase diagrams of the associated low-energy field theories. Our results expand the horizon for analog quantum simulations with JJAs towards models that can not be efficiently captured with qubit architectures.</description>

      <title>Optically Resolved Exchange Splittings in the Doped Van der Waals Ferromagnet CrBr3:Yb3+</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.14663v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The chromium-trihalides (CrX3; X = Cl, Br, I) have long served as model systems for understanding magnetism and magneto-optics in ionic crystals, and they have recently also emerged as archetypes of magnetic two-dimensional (2D) Van der Waals materials. Although the physical properties of CrX3 compounds have now been explored in great depth, the use of impurity doping to generate new properties remains surprisingly underexplored. Here we report on the magnetic and magneto-optical properties of lanthanide-doped CrBr3, in which Yb3+ is introduced as a spin-bearing optical point defect. Narrow-line near-infrared dopant photoluminescence is efficiently sensitized by CrBr3-to-Yb3+ energy transfer. Magneto-optical measurements show facile spin manipulation of the paramagnetic Yb3+ impurities by the surrounding CrBr3 lattice. Photoluminescence data reveal that the Kramers spin degeneracies of the ground- and excited-state Yb3+ doublets are spontaneously lifted by strong magnetic exchange with neighboring Cr3+ ions, such that individual Yb3+ spin transitions are easily resolved even at zero external magnetic field. The temperature and field dependence of these splittings can be used to probe both local and long-range spin correlations. These results highlight the use of extrinsic optical impurities to add new spin-photonic functionality to this classic 2D Van der Waals magnet.</description>

      <title>Practical quantum advantage on partially fault-tolerant quantum computer</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.14848</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.14848v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Achieving quantum speedups in practical tasks remains challenging for current noisy intermediate-scale quantum (NISQ) devices. These devices always encounter significant obstacles such as inevitable physical errors and the limited scalability of current near-term algorithms. Meanwhile, assuming a typical architecture for fault-tolerant quantum computing (FTQC), realistic applications inevitably require a vast number of qubits, typically exceeding $10^6$, which seems far beyond near-term realization. In this work, to bridge the gap between the NISQ and FTQC eras, we propose an alternative approach to achieve practical quantum advantages on early-FTQC devices. Our framework is based on partially fault-tolerant logical operations to minimize spatial overhead and avoids the costly distillation techniques typically required for executing non-Clifford gates. To this end, we develop a space-time efficient state preparation protocol to generate an ancillary non-Clifford state consumed for implementing an analog rotation gate with an arbitrary small angle $\theta$ and a remarkably low worst-case error rate below $\mathcal{O}(|\theta| p_{\text{ph}})$, where $p_{\text{ph}}$ is the physical error rate. Furthermore, we propose several error suppression schemes tailored to our preparation protocol, which are essential to minimize the overhead for mitigating errors. Based on this framework, we present several promising applications that leverage the potential of our framework, including the Trotter simulation and quantum phase estimation (QPE). Notably, we demonstrate that our framework allows us to perform the QPE for $(8\times 8)$-site Hubbard model with fewer than $4.9\times 10^4$ qubits and an execution time of 9 days (or 12 minutes with full parallelization) under $p_{\text{ph}}=10^{-4}$, which is significantly faster than recent classical estimation with tensor network techniques (DMRG and PEPS).</description>

      <title>Compilation of Trotter-Based Time Evolution for Partially Fault-Tolerant Quantum Computing Architecture</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.14929</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.14929v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Achieving practical quantum speedup with limited resources is a crucial challenge in both academic and industrial communities. To address this, a partially fault-tolerant quantum computing architecture called ``space-time efficient analog rotation quantum computing architecture (STAR architecture)'' has been recently proposed. This architecture focuses on minimizing resource requirements while maximizing the precision of non-Clifford gates, essential for universal quantum computation. However, non-deterministic processes such as the repeat-until-success (RUS) protocol and state injection can introduce significant computational overhead. Therefore, optimizing the logical circuit to minimize this overhead by using efficient fault-tolerant operations is essential. This paper presents an efficient method for simulating the time evolution of the 2D Hubbard model Hamiltonian, a promising application of the STAR architecture. We present two techniques, parallel injection protocol and adaptive injection region updating, to reduce unnecessary time overhead specific to our architecture. By integrating these with the existing fSWAP technique, we develop an efficient Trotter-based time evolution operation for the 2D Hubbard model. Our analysis reveals an acceleration of over 10 times compared to naive serial compilation. This optimized compilation enables us to estimate the computational resources required for quantum phase estimation of the 2D Hubbard model. For devices with a physical error rate of $p_{\rm phys} = 10^{-4}$, we estimate that approximately $6.5 \times 10^4$ physical qubits are required to achieve faster ground state energy estimation of the $8\times8$ Hubbard model compared to classical computation.</description>

      <title>Fragile-to-strong glass transition in two-dimensional vortex liquids</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.14985</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.14985v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The fragile-to-strong glass transition is a fascinating phenomenon that still presents many theoretical and experimental challenges. A major one is how to tune the fragility of a glass-forming liquid. Here, we study a two-dimensional (2D) system composed of vortices in a superconducting film, which effectively behaves as a 2D glass-forming liquid. We show that the kinetic fragility in this system can be experimentally varied by tuning a single parameter: the external magnetic field $H$ applied transversely to the film. This conclusion is supported by the direct comparison between the analysis of experimental measurements in an amorphous MoGe superconducting film and Monte Carlo simulations in a disordered XY model, that captures the universality class of the two-step melting transition. We show that by increasing disorder strength a fragile-to-strong transition is induced, in close similarity with the experimental findings in a magnetic field. Our numerical results shed light on the evolution of the dynamical heterogeneity from a fragile to strong glass, as due to the subtle interplay between caging effects arising from hexatic order and strong random pinning.</description>

      <title>Squeezed state protection of fine structure in "Poor Man's Majorana" via quantum spin coupling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.15080</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.15080v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The "Poor Man's Majorana" [Phys. Rev. B 86, 134528 (2012)] devoid of topological protection has been theoretically predicted to rely on the minimal Kitaev chain. Afterward, a pair of superconducting and spinless quantum dots turned the proposal practicable and differential conductance pinpointed consistent fingerprints with such a scenario [Nature 614, 445 (2023) and Nature 630, 329 (2024)]. In this work, we propose a model wherein the "Poor Man's Majorana" presents protection when one of the dots is exchange coupled to a quantum spin. If this quantum dot is perturbed by tuning the exchange coupling, the well-known spill over-like behavior of this Majorana surprisingly remains unchanged, and solely half of the fine structure is unexpectedly viewed. As a matter of fact, the "Poor Man's Majorana" zero mode consists in squeezing of the other half at zero frequency, which imposes its pinning there and prevents the mixing of the mode with the explicit fine structure. We claim that if the supposed unavoidable split of the zero mode by the fine structure is unexpectedly absent, then the "Poor Man's Majorana" can be considered robust against the quantum spin. In this way, it becomes protected and the lack of topological protection paradigm of the "Poor Man's Majorana" has been revisited, pushing this seemingly well-established issue into a new direction.</description>

      <title>Resolving the pressure induced 'self-insertion' in skutterudite CoSb3</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.15105</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.15105v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: CoSb3, a skutterudite compound, is key in studying thermoelectric materials. Under compression, it undergoes a 'self-insertion' isostructural transition, redistributing large Sb atoms among crystallographic sites. We investigated CoSb3's structural stability up to 70 GPa using single crystal X-ray diffraction and high-resolution X-ray scattering, including Bragg Coherent Diffraction Imaging. We examined the material in three pressure transmitting media (PTMs), exploring how PTMs and nonhydrostatic stresses affect CoSb3. Notably, the 'self-insertion' transition may reduce or even make compressibility negative. Additionally, we report a previously unknown phase transformation from cubic Im-3 to trigonal R-3 above 40 GPa and discuss the phases' distinctive behaviors.</description>

Abstract: We prove special cases of a general conjecture: If an invertible field theory admits a projectively topological boundary theory, then it has finite order in the abelian group of invertible field theories. One can substitute `gapped' for `projectively topological'. Our proofs use evaluations of a field theory in parametrized families.</description>

      <description>arXiv:1712.09412v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We propose a framework based on the concept of the semigroup to understand the fermion sign problem. By using properties of contraction semigroups, we obtain sufficient conditions for quantum lattice fermion models to be sign-problem-free. Many previous results can be considered as special cases of our new results. As a direct application of our new results, we construct a class of sign-problem-free fermion lattice models, which cannot be understood by previous frameworks. This framework also provides an interesting aspect in understanding related quantum many-body systems. We establish a series of inequalities for all the sign-problem-free fermion lattice models that satisfy our sufficient conditions.</description>

      <title>Transport properties in non-Fermi liquid phases of nodal-point semimetals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.08635</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.08635v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this review, we survey the current progress in computing transport properties in semimetals which harbour non-Fermi liquid phases. We first discuss the widely-used Kubo formalism, which can be applied to the effective theory describing the stable non-Fermi liquid phase obtained via a renormalization group procedure and, hence, is applicable for temperatures close to zero (e.g., optical conductivity). For finite-temperature regimes, which apply to the computations of the generalized DC conductivity tensors, we elucidate the memory matrix approach. This approach is based on an effective hydrodynamic description of the system, and is especially suited for tackling transport calculations in strongly-interacting quantum field theories, because it does not rely on the existence of long-lived quasiparticles. As a concrete example, we apply these two approaches to find the response of the so-called Luttinger-Abrikosov-Benelavskii phase of isotropic three-dimensional Luttinger semimetals, which arises under the effects of long-ranged (unscreened) Coulomb interactions, with the chemical potential fine-tuned to cut exactly the nodal point. In particular, we focus on the electric conductivity tensors, thermal and thermoelectric response, Raman response, free energy, entropy density, and shear viscosity.</description>

      <title>Interacting Crystalline Topological Insulators in two-dimensions with Time-Reversal Symmetry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.11650</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.11650v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Topology is routinely used to understand the physics of electronic insulators. However, for strongly interacting electronic matter, such as Mott insulators, a comprehensive topological characterization is still lacking. When their ground state only contains short-range entanglement and does not break symmetries spontaneously, they generically realize crystalline fermionic symmetry-protected topological phases (cFSPTs), supporting gapless modes at the boundaries or at the lattice defects. Here, we provide an exhaustive classification of cFSPTs in two dimensions with $\mathrm{U}(1)$ charge-conservation and spinful time-reversal symmetries, namely, those generically present in spin-orbit coupled insulators, for any of the 17 wallpaper groups. It has been shown that the classification of cFSPTs can be understood from appropriate real-space decorations of lower-dimensional subspaces, and we expose how these relate to the Wyckoff positions of the lattice. We find that all nontrivial one-dimensional decorations require electronic interactions. Furthermore, we provide model Hamiltonians for various decorations, and discuss the signatures of cFSPTs. This classification paves the way to further explore topological interacting insulators, providing the backbone information in generic model systems and ultimately in experiments.</description>

      <title>Emergent Gauge Fields and the "Choi-Spin Liquids" in Steady States</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.07125</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.07125v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We demonstrate that the steady states of the evolution of a class of Lindbladians can be mapped to the "Gutzwiller projected" wave functions in the doubled Hilbert space, i.e. the representation of the density matrix through the Choi-Jamiolkowski isomorphism. A Gutzwiller projection is a standard approach of constructing spin liquid states. For example, if one starts with a gapless free fermion pure quantum state, the steady state of the Lindbladian evolution in the doubled Hilbert space is an analog of an algebraic spin liquid, which is dubbed the "Choi-spin liquid". The Choi-spin liquid can also be produced through strong measurement without post-selection. Predictions of the Choi-spin liquids can be made based on the understanding on spin liquids, and we will design the experimental protocol to test these predictions. If one starts with a Chern insulator, theory predicts that the steady state of the Lindbladian evolution is expected to have a spontaneous "strong-to-weak" U(1) symmetry breaking, which corresponds to a superconductor in the doubled Hilbert space.</description>

      <title>Post-experiment coincidence detection techniques for direct detection of two-body correlations</title>

      <description>arXiv:2308.16746v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: It is one challenge to develop experimental techniques for direct detection of the many-body correlations of strongly correlated electrons, which exhibit a variety of unsolved mysteries. In this article, we present a post-experiment coincidence counting method and propose two post-experiment coincidence detection techniques, post-experiment coincidence angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy (cARPES) and post-experiment coincidence inelastic neutron scattering (cINS). By coincidence detection of two photoelectric processes or two neutron-scattering processes, the post-experiment coincidence detection techniques can detect directly the two-body correlations of strongly correlated electrons in particle-particle channel or two-spin channel. The post-experiment coincidence detection techniques can be implemented upon the pulse-resolved angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy (ARPES) or inelastic neutron scattering (INS) experimental apparatus with pulse photon or neutron source. When implemented experimentally, they will be powerful techniques to study the highly esoteric high-temperature superconductivity and the highly coveted quantum spin liquids.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2312.08601v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this work, we explore the interplay of confinement, string breaking and entanglement asymmetry on a 1D quantum Ising chain. We consider the evolution of an initial domain wall and show that, surprisingly, while the introduction of confinement through a longitudinal field typically suppresses entanglement, it can also serve to increase it beyond a bound set for free particles. Our model can be tuned to conserve the number of domain walls, which gives an opportunity to explore entanglement asymmetry associated with link variables. We study two approaches to deal with the non-locality of the link variables, either directly or following a Kramers-Wannier transformation that maps bond variables (kinks) to site variables (spins). We develop a numerical procedure for computing the asymmetry using tensor network methods and use it to demonstrate the different types of entanglement and entanglement asymmetry.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2402.09517v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: I consider a nonlinear response of conventional superconductors contaminated with potential impurities or imperfections to a circular polarized light. I focus on dc contributions to the induced current density which describe the emergence of the static magnetization in a superconductor. This effect is known as inverse Faraday effect. By employing quasiclassical theory of superconductivity I derive an expression for the induced static magnetization as a function of frequency of an external ac field and disorder scattering rate. The scattering of electrons off potential impurities is taken into account within the framework of the self-consistent Born approximation. It is found that the magnitude of the inverse Faraday effect decreases with an increase in disorder scattering rate. I have also discovered that the value of the induced magnetization has a characteristic minimum at a frequency which approximately equals twice the value of the pairing gap in a clean superconductor and shifts to higher values with an increase in disorder scattering rate.</description>

      <title>Quantum 2D Liouville Path-Integral Is a Sum over Geometries in AdS$_3$ Einstein Gravity</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.03179v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: There is a renowned solution of the modular bootstrap that defines the UV complete quantum Liouville theory. We triangulate the path-integral of this Liouville CFT on any 2D surface $\mathcal{M}$, by proposing a shrinkable boundary condition for this special CFT that allows small holes to close, analogous to the proposal in rational CFTs [1-3]. This is essentially a tensor network that admits an interpretation of a state-sum of a 3D topological theory constructed with quantum 6j symbols of $\mathcal{U}_q(SL(2,\mathbb{R}))$ with non-trivial boundary conditions, and it reduces to a sum over 3D geometries weighted by the Einstein-Hilbert action to leading order in large $c$. The boundary conditions of quantum Liouville theory specifies a very special sum over bulk geometries to faithfully reproduce the CFT path-integral. The triangulation coincides with producing a network of geodesics in the AdS bulk, which can be changed making use of the pentagon identity and orthogonality condition satisfied by the 6j symbols, and arranged into a precise holographic tensor network.</description>

Abstract: The fermion gaps are classified into order gap or Mott gap depending on the presence/absence of the order parameter. We construct the holographic model of the Mott gap using the field that is supported by the density only without introducing any order parameter. We then classify the Mott gap, depending on the shape of the gap in the density of states and whether the Fermi surface is touching the valence bond or not, into three classes: i) Symmetric gap, ii) Asymmetric gap with isolated Fermi sea. iii) Asymmetric gap with Fermi sea touching the valence band. Finally, we identify possible non-minimal gauge interactions that produce a flatband without symmetry breaking.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.14590v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Quantum phase transitions (QPTs) are explored to improve quantum sensing and weak signal detection. Changes in the ground state at a QPT enhance indicators of parameter estimation, such as the quantum Fischer information. Here, we show that in systems that lack a QPT, quantum sensitivity can still be enhanced due to excited-state quantum phase transitions (ESQPTs). Our analysis is done for a Kerr parametric oscillator with two ESQPTs associated with the onset of a hyperbolic point and a local maximum in the classical limit. These points change the system's phase space structure, which results in the amplification of the quantum Fisher information and the squeezing of the uncertainty in position at specific values of the control parameter. Our study showcases the relationship between non-conventional quantum critical phenomena and quantum sensing with potential experimental applications in exciton-polariton condensates and superconducting circuits.</description>

Abstract: The recently discovered spin-triplet superconductor candidate UTe2 with Tc = 2 K has attracted enormous attention because it possesses many interesting properties, such as the extremely high upper critical field Hc2(0), chiral superconductivity and spontaneous time-reversal symmetry breaking, etc., all these suggest that it may be the long-sought spin-triplet superconductor. Here we report the discovery of superconductivity up to Tc = 4K in one of its siblings, i.e., UAs2 under high pressures. Interestingly, the UAs2 shows metallic behavior with an antiferromagnetic (AFM) transition at about 274 K under ambient pressure. Upon applying pressure, this transition is pushed down to lower temperatures with improved electric conductivity. When the pressure rises to about 20-22 GPa, superconductivity occurs together with the emergence of a linear temperature dependence of normal state resistance, the latter is a hallmark of the strange-metal state. The superconductivity with the highest Tc = 4 K is reached under a pressure of about 26.8 GPa, and it is robust against magnetic field with the upper critical field {\mu}0Hc2(0) ~ 12 T, far beyond the Pauli limit. Higher pressures will suppress the superconductivity and bring back the Fermi liquid behavior, showing a clear signature of quantum criticality. Our results open a new avenue for investigating the unconventional superconductivity concerning the mysterious 5f-band electrons in this uranium-based system.</description>
