      <title>Path-integral Monte Carlo estimator for the dipole polarizability of quantum plasma</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.26836</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.26836v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a path-integral Monte Carlo estimator for calculating the dipole polarizability of interacting Coulomb plasma in the long-wavelength limit, i.e., the optical region. Unlike the conventional dynamic structure factor in reciprocal space, our approach is based on the real-space dipole autocorrelation function and is suited for long wavelengths and small cell sizes, including finite clusters. The simulation of thermal equilibrium in imaginary time has exact Coulomb interactions and Boltzmann quantum statistics. For reference, we demonstrate analytic continuation of the Drude model into the imaginary time and Matsubara series, showing perfect agreement with our data within ranges of finite temperatures and densities. Method parameters, such as the finite time-step and finite-size effects prove only modestly significant. Our method, here carefully validated against an exactly solvable reference, remains amenable to more interesting domains in higher-order optical response, quantum confinements and quantum statistical effects, and applications in plasmonics, heterogeneous plasmas and nonlinear optics, such as epsilon-near-zero materials.</description>

      <title>Distributing entanglement between distant semiconductor qubit registers using a shared-control shuttling link</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.26860</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.26860v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Semiconductor quantum processors have potential to scale to modular quantum computers, in which qubit registers are coupled by quantum links, enabling high connectivity and space for control circuitry. Individual spin-qubit registers have progressed to two-dimensional systems and execution of small quantum algorithms. Separately, high-fidelity spin shuttling has been demonstrated in linear channels defined by individual gate electrodes. Here, we realize the first shared-control shuttling link integrated between distant qubit registers to demonstrate quantum entanglement in a basic modular quantum processor based on hole spin qubits in germanium. We develop a protocol to compensate for spin-orbit-induced rotations during qubit transfer, allowing for shuttling between qubit registers separated by more than one micrometer in approximately a hundred nanoseconds. Combining local qubit operation with coherent shuttling, we generate Bell states formed by spins residing in separate registers. Characterizing them using quantum state tomography, we demonstrate entanglement between spin qubits in distant registers.</description>

      <title>Rydberg excitons in Cu$_2$O at millikelvin temperatures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.26966</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.26966v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Rydberg excitons in the semiconductor Cu$_2$O have been observed in absorption experiments up to a principal quantum number of n = 28 at millikelvin temperatures [1]. Here, we extend the experimental parameter space by variing both temperature and excitation power. In particular, we show that the P excitons close to the band gap react more sensitively to an increase of the excitation power than states of the associated D exciton multiplet, even though the latter are located at comparatively higher energy. This finding is similar to the one observed when applying an external electric field, suggesting that the observed behavior arises from internal electric fields created by charged impurities that are optically ionized. At laser intensities below 1 $\mu$W/cm$^2$, absorption lines of excitons with n=29 are observed.</description>

      <title>Characterizing Skyrmion Flow Phases with Principal Component Analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.26987</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.26987v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Principal component analysis (PCA) is a powerful method that can identify patterns in large, complex data sets by constructing low-dimensional order parameters from higher-dimensional feature vectors. There are increasing efforts to use space-and-time-dependent PCA to detect transitions in nonequilibrium systems that are difficult to characterize with equilibrium methods. Here, we demonstrate that feature vectors incorporating the position and velocity information of driven skyrmions moving through random disorder permit PCA to resolve different types of disordered skyrmion motion as a function of driving force and the ratio of the Magnus force to the dissipation. Since the Magnus force creates gyroscopic motion and a finite Hall angle, skyrmions can exhibit a greater range of flow phases than what is observed in overdamped driven systems with quenched disorder. We show that in addition to identifying previously known skyrmion flow phases, PCA detects several additional phases, including different types of channel flow, moving fluids, and partially ordered states. Guided by the PCA analysis, we further characterize the disordered flow phases to elucidate the different microscopic dynamics and show that the changes in the PCA-derived order parameters can be connected to features in bulk transport measures, including the transverse and longitudinal velocity-force curves, differential conductivity, topological defect density, and changes in the skyrmion Hall angle as a function of drive. We discuss how asymmetric feature vectors can be used to improve the resolution of the PCA analysis, and how this technique can be extended to find disordered phases in other nonequilibrium systems with time-dependent dynamics.</description>

      <title>Metallic electro-optic effects in topological chiral crystals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.26992</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.26992v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Topological chiral crystals have emerged as a fertile material platform for investigating optical phenomena derived from the distinctive Fermi surface Berry curvature and orbital magnetic moment textures around multifold chiral band crossings pinned at the time-reversal invariant momenta. In this work, by means of tight-binding model and first principles based calculations, we investigate metallic electro-optic (EO) responses stemming from the Berry curvature and orbital magnetic moment of Bloch electrons across 37 materials belonging to space group 198 (SG198). Previously thought to vanish in SG198, our findings reveal a nonzero Berry curvature dipole attributed to the energetic misalignment between topologically charged point nodes of opposite chirality. Moreover, we find that the recently predicted magnetoelectric EO effects, which arise from the interplay between the Berry curvature and magnetic moment on the Fermi surface, are readily accessible in BeAu under experimentally feasible electric biases.</description>

      <title>Spin Dependence of Charge Dynamics and Group Velocity in Chiral Molecules</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.27061</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.27061v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Chiral molecules are known to preferentially select electrons with a particular spin state, an effect termed chirality-induced spin selectivity (CISS). In this work, the transient CISS dynamics in a chiral molecule are investigated through time-dependent quantum-transport simulations, an important step toward further understanding CISS and its application in devices such as magnetoresistive random access memories and spin-based quantum computers. We show that a nonzero spin polarization throughout the chiral molecule can be attributed to a spin-dependent group velocity of electrons. Contrary to the case where a chiral molecule is connected to a single lead, this spin polarization persists into the steady state when two leads are connected. We show that the simulated spin polarization qualitatively agrees with a reference experiment, as evidenced by the distinct magnetic-field signatures calculated from the spin polarization within a monolayer of chiral molecules.</description>

      <title>Theoretical Investigation of Anomalous Hall and Nernst Responses in Potassium Tri Vanadium Pentantimonide</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.27230</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.27230v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a theoretical study of the anomalous Nernst and Hall conductance in the Kagome metal potassium tri vanadium pentantimonide, based on a system Hamiltonian incorporating nearest neighbour and complex next nearest neighbour hopping, Rashba spin orbit coupling, an exchange field induced by magnetic proximity, and a charge density wave potential. Our analysis reveals that the Nernst conductivity exhibits a non monotonic temperature dependence. It increases with temperature, reaches a pronounced peak, and subsequently declines at higher temperatures due to thermal broadening, which diminishes the influence of Berry curvature. Notably, small shifts in the chemical potential can lead to dramatic changes in the Nernst signal enhancing its magnitude or even reversing its sign highlighting the system sensitivity to carrier density. We further explore the anomalous Hall behaviour within this framework. The band structure hosts multiple bands with nonzero Berry curvature, and preliminary Chern number calculations suggest weak topological features, namely, while not fully quantized, the system exhibits significant Berry curvature accumulation. Upon introducing momentum space winding, implemented via a momentum dependent phase in the complex hopping terms to mimic orbital magnetic flux, we observe that two bands acquire opposite Chern numbers. The remaining bands remain topologically trivial.</description>

      <title>Single femtosecond laser pulse-driven ferromagnetic switching</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.27288</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.27288v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Light pulses offer a faster, more energy-efficient, and direct route to magnetic bit writing, pointing toward a hybrid memory and computing paradigm based on photon transmission and spin retention. Yet progress remains hindered, as deterministic, single-pulse optical toggle switching has so far been achieved only with ferrimagnetic materials, which require too specific a rare-earth composition and temperature conditions for technological use. In mainstream ferromagnet--central to spintronic memory and storage--such bistable switching is considered fundamentally difficult, as laser-induced heating does not inherently break time-reversal symmetry. Here, we report coherent magnetization switching in ferromagnets, driven by thermal anisotropy torque with single laser pulses. The toggle switching behavior is robust over a broad range of pulse durations, from femtoseconds to picoseconds, a prerequisite for practical applications. Furthermore, the phenomenon exhibits reproducibility in CoFeB/MgO-based magnetic tunnel junctions with a high magnetoresistance exceeding 110%, as well as the scalability down to nanoscales with remarkable energy efficiency (17 fJ per 100-nm-sized bit). These results mark a notable step toward integrating opto-spintronics into next-generation memory and storage technologies.</description>

      <title>On-chip cavity electro-acoustics using lithium niobate phononic crystal resonators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.27496</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.27496v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Mechanical systems are pivotal in quantum technologies because of their long coherent time and versatile coupling to qubit systems. So far, the coherent and dynamic control of gigahertz-frequency mechanical modes mostly relies on optomechanical coupling and piezoelectric coupling to superconducting qubits. Here, we demonstrate on-chip cavity electro-acoustic dynamics using our microwave-frequency electrically-modulated phononic-crystal (PnC) resonators on lithium niobate (LN). Leveraging the high dispersion of PnC, our phononic modes space unevenly in the frequency spectrum, emulating atomic energy levels. Atomic-like transitions between different phononic modes are achieved by applying electrical fields to modulate phononic modes via nonlinear piezoelectricity of LN. Among two modes, we demonstrate Autler-Townes splitting (ATS), alternating current (a.c.) Stark shift, and Rabi oscillation with a maximum cooperativity of 4.18. Extending to three modes, we achieve non-reciprocal frequency conversions with an isolation up to 20 dB. Nonreciprocity can be tuned by the time delay between the two modulating pulses. Our cavity electro-acoustic platform could find broad applications in sensing, microwave signal processing, phononic computing, and quantum acoustics.</description>

      <title>Proximity-induced superconductivity and emerging topological phases in altermagnet-based heterostructures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.26894</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.26894v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a theoretical framework for investigating superconducting proximity effect in altermagnet (AM)-superconductor (SC) heterostructures. In general, AMs, characterized by vanishing net magnetization but spin-split electronic spectra, provide a promising platform for realizing unconventional magnetic phases. We consider a two-dimensional $d$-wave AM proximity coupled to a three dimensional ordinary $s$-wave SC. By integrating out the superconducting degrees of freedom, we derive an effective Hamiltonian that describes the proximity-induced modifications in the AM layer in the form of a self-energy. We then derive an effective Green's function to obtain the proximity-induced pairing amplitudes in the AM layer and classify the induced pairing amplitudes according to their parity, frequency, and spin. We find the presence of even-parity singlet and triplet pairing amplitudes in the AM layer. To achieve the odd-parity triplet components, important to realize topological superconductivity, we introduce a layer of Rashba spin-orbit coupling (RSOC) in the heterostructure. We analyse the band topology of this proximity-induced AM-RSOC layer and demonstrate the emergence of both weak and strong topological superconducting phases with edge-localized modes, characterized by winding number and Chern number. These findings highlight the role of AM-SC hybrid setup as a versatile platform for realizing odd-parity triplet pairings and engineering topological superconductivity in two-dimension.</description>

      <title>Thermoelectricity of moir\'e heavy fermions in MoTe2/WSe2 bilayers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.26958</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.26958v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Tunable Kondo lattice and heavy fermion physics have been recently reported in moir\'e materials, but most of the studies have focused on the electrical and magnetic properties. Quantitative thermoelectric measurements, which can reveal entropic information of the heavy fermions, have yet to be achieved. Here, we report a comprehensive thermoelectric study on the moir\'e heavy fermion phase realized in hole-doped angle-aligned MoTe2/WSe2 bilayers. By electrically gating the material to the Kondo lattice region of the phase diagram, we observe a sign change in the Seebeck coefficient near the Kondo coherence temperature, where the heavy fermion phase with an electron-like Fermi surface evolves into an itinerant Fermi liquid with a hole-like Fermi surface. We compare the results with the semiclassical Mott relation and discuss the observed discrepancies. In addition to the thermal dissociation of Kondo singlets in the heavy Fermi liquid, a sign change accompanied by a strong peak in the Seebeck coefficient is also observed near a Zeeman breakdown of the Kondo singlets, signaling an entropy accumulation. Our results provide entropic information on both the formation and breakdown of heavy fermions in moir\'e semiconductors.</description>

      <title>How Do Proteins Fold?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.27074</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.27074v2 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: How proteins fold remains a central unsolved problem in biology. While the idea of a folding code embedded in the amino acid sequence was introduced more than 6 decades ago, this code remains undefined. While we now have powerful predictive tools to predict the final native structure of proteins, we still lack a predictive framework for how sequences dictate folding pathways. Two main conceptual models dominate as explanations of folding mechanism: the funnel model, in which folding proceeds through many alternative routes on a rugged, hyperdimensional energy landscape; and the foldon model, which proposes a hierarchical sequence of discrete intermediates. Recent advances on two fronts are now enabling folding studies in unprecedented ways. Powerful experimental approaches; in particular, single-molecule force spectroscopy and hydrogen (deuterium exchange assays) allow time-resolved tracking of the folding process at high resolution. At the same time, computational breakthroughs culminating in algorithms such as AlphaFold have revolutionized static structure prediction, opening opportunities to extend machine learning toward dynamics. Together, these developments mark a turning point: for the first time, we are positioned to resolve how proteins fold, why they misfold, and how this knowledge can be harnessed for biology and medicine.</description>

      <title>Plastic or Viscous? A Reappraisal of Yielding in Soft Matter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.27116</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.27116v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Many soft jammed materials, such as pastes, gels, concentrated emulsions, and suspensions, possess a threshold stress, known as yield stress, that must be exceeded to cause permanent deformation or flow. In rheology, the term plastic flow is commonly used to describe continuous flow (unbounded increase in strain with time) that a material undergoes above a yield stress threshold. However, in solid mechanics, plasticity refers to irreversible but finite, rate-independent deformation (strain that does not evolve with time). In addition, many soft materials exhibit viscosity bifurcation, a prominent thixotropic signature, which further complicates the definition and interpretation of yield stress. The threshold stress at which viscosity bifurcation occurs is also termed a yield stress, even though deformation below this threshold is not purely elastic, while above this threshold, the material flows homogeneously with a constant shear rate. This paper revisits these critical issues by analyzing the rheological and solid mechanics perspectives on plasticity. The insights presented here are intended to address certain terminological ambiguities for interpreting flow in soft jammed materials.</description>

      <title>Absence of Parity Anomaly in Massive Dirac Fermions on a Lattice</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.27215</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.27215v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The parity anomaly for Dirac fermions in two spatial dimensions has shaped perspectives in quantum field theory and condensed matter physics. In condensed matter it has evolved as a mechanism for half-quantized Hall responses in systems described by massive Dirac fermions. Here we reexamine the issue on a lattice and show that the half-quantized Hall conductivity is absent for massive Dirac fermions when lattice regularization is properly implemented and the translational invariant symmetry is taken into account. We realize that a single massive Dirac cone on a lattice always leads to an integer quantized Hall conductivity and to the half-quantized Hall conductivity only in the unphysical limit of infinite momentum cut-off. The half-quantized Hall conductivity appears with nonzero longitudinal conductance as a signature of a single massless Dirac cone on a lattice. Consequently, the parity anomaly is a property of massless Dirac fermions in a semimetal/metal, not of massive Dirac fermions in an insulator on a lattice.</description>

      <title>Zitterbewegung Effect and Quantum Geometry in Non-Hermitian Exciton-Polariton Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.27220</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.27220v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this work, we analytically derive a semi-classical equation of motion describing the zitterbewegung effects arising in the dynamics of wavepackets in non-Hermitian systems. In Hermitian non-relativistic quantum systems, the zitterbewegung effects can arise due to the spin precession and spin-orbit coupling. Interestingly, the spin dynamics in non-Hermitian systems are qualitatively different because of the effective nonlinear terms induced by the non-Hermitian part of the Hamiltonian. In this work, we show the effects from the non-Hermitian spin dynamics by generalising the description of zitterbewegung effects to non-Hermitian systems. We also uncover novel non-Hermitian correction to the group velocity, which can be expressed in terms of the non-Hermitian quantum metric tensor in the absence of out-of-plane effective field.</description>

      <title>First-principles design of excitonic insulators: A review</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.27231</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.27231v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The excitonic insulator (EI) is a more than 60-year-old theoretical proposal that yet remains elusive. It is a purely quantum phenomenon involving the spontaneous generation of excitons in quantum mechanics and the spontaneous condensation of excitons in quantum statistics. At this point, the excitons represent the ground state rather than the conventional excited state. Thus, the scarcity of candidate materials is a key factor contributing to the lack of recognized EI to date. In this review, we begin with the birth of EI, presenting the current state of the field and the main challenges it faces. We then focus on recent advances in the discovery and design of EIs based on the first-principles Bethe-Salpeter scheme, in particular the dark-exciton rule guided screening of materials. It not only opens up new avenues for realizing excitonic instability in direct-gap and wide-gap semiconductors, but also leads to the discovery of novel quantum states of matter such as half-EIs and spin-triplet EIs. Finally, we will look ahead to possible research pathways leading to the first recognized EI, both computationally and theoretically.</description>

Abstract: High-quality micropillar cavities were grown using molecular-beam epitaxy. Stable continuous-wave lasing at room-temperature was demonstrated for microlasers with semiconductor and hybrid output mirrors. At 300 K, single-mode lasing was demonstrated for micropillars with a diameter of 5 $\mu$m at a wavelength of 960 nm, with a minimum lasing threshold of 1.2 mW and a bare quality-factor exceeding 8000.</description>

      <title>Salt crystallization and deliquescence triggered by humidity cycles in nanopores</title>

      <description>arXiv:2510.27309v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the response of materials with nanoscale pores containing sodium chloride solutions, to cycles of relative humidity (RH). Compared to pure fluids, we show that these sorption isotherms display much wider hysteresis, with a shape determined by salt crystallization and deliquescence rather than capillary condensation and Kelvin evaporation. Both deliquescence and crystallization are significantly shifted compared to the bulk and occur at unusually low RH. We systematically analyze the effect of pore size and salt amount, and rationalize our findings using confined thermodynamics, osmotic effects and classical nucleation theory.</description>

      <title>Lattice dynamics in chiral tellurium by linear and circularly polarized Raman spectroscopy: crystal orientation and handedness</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.27341</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.27341v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Trigonal tellurium (Te) has attracted researchers' attention due to its transport and optical properties, which include electrical magneto-chiral anisotropy, spin polarization and bulk photovoltaic effect. It is the anisotropic and chiral crystal structure of Te that drive these properties, so the determination of its crystallographic orientation and handedness is key to their study. Here we explore the structural dynamics of Te bulk crystals by angle-dependent linearly polarized Raman spectroscopy and symmetry rules in three different crystallographic orientations. The angle-dependent intensity of the modes allows us to determine the arrangement of the helical chains and distinguish between crystallographic planes parallel and perpendicular to the chain axis. Furthermore, under different configurations of circularly polarized Raman measurements and crystal orientations, we observe the shift of two phonon modes only in the (0 0 1) plane. The shift is positive or negative depending on the handedness of the crystals, which we determine univocally by chemical etching. Our analysis of three different crystal faces of Te highlights the importance of selecting the proper orientation and crystallographic plane when investigating the transport and optical properties of this material. These results offer insight into the crystal structure and symmetry in other anisotropic and chiral materials, and open new paths to select a suitable crystal orientation when fabricating devices.</description>

      <title>Inverse-Designed Grating Couplers with Tunable Wavelength via Scaling and Biasing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.27476</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.27476v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Photonic integrated circuits are heavily researched devices for telecommunication, biosensing, and quantum technologies. Wafer-scale fabrication and testing are crucial for reducing costs and enabling large-scale deployment. Grating couplers allow non-invasive measurements before packaging, but classical designs rely on long tapers and narrow bandwidths. In this work, we present compact, inverse-designed grating couplers with broadband transmission. We optimized and fabricated arrays of devices and characterized them with a 4f-scanning setup. The nominal design reached simulated efficiencies of 52 %, while measurements confirmed robust performance with up to 32 % efficiency at the target 1540 nm wavelength and 46 % at shifted wavelengths. Without scaling and contour biasing, the measured efficiency at the target wavelength drops to only 4.4 %. Thus, a key finding is that systematic scaling and edge biasing recover up to an eightfold improvement in efficiency. These inverse-designed grating couplers can be efficiently corrected post-design, enabling reliable performance despite fabrication deviations. This approach allows simple layout adjustments to compensate for process-induced variations, supporting wafer-scale testing, cryogenic photonic applications, and rapid design wavelength tuning.</description>

      <title>First-principles calculations of thermal transport at metal/silicon interfaces: evidence of interfacial electron-phonon coupling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.27499</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.27499v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: With the increasing miniaturization of electronic components and the need to optimize thermal management, it has become essential to understand heat transport at metal/semiconductor interfaces. While it has been recognized decades ago that an electron phonon channel may take place at metal-semiconductor interfaces, its existence is still controversial. Here, we investigate thermal transport at metal-silicon interfaces using the combination of first principles calculations and nonequilibrium Green's function (NEGF). We explain how to correct NEGF formalism to account for the out of equilibrium nature of the energy carriers in the vicinity of the interface. The relative corrections to the equilibrium distribution are shown to arise from the spectral mean free paths of silicon and may reach 15 percents. Applying these corrections, we compare the predictions of NEGF to available experimental data for Au/Si, Pt/Si and Al/Si interfaces. Based on this comparison, we infer the value of the electron phonon interfacial thermal conductance by employing the two temperature model. We find that interfacial thermal transport at Au/Si interfaces is mainly driven by phonon phonon processes, and that electron phonon processes play a negligible role in this case. By contrast, for Al/Si interfaces, we show that phonon-phonon scattering alone can not explain the experimental values reported so far, and we estimate that the electron-phonon interfacial conductance accounts for one third of the total conductance. This work demonstrates the importance of the electron-phonon conductance at metal-silicon interfaces and calls for systematic experimental investigation of thermal transport at these interfaces at low temperatures. It paves the way for an accurate model to predict the conductance associated to the interfacial electron phonon channel.</description>

      <title>Magnetic wideband VHF localized field probe using magnon polaritons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.27601</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.27601v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present here an optimisation and demonstration of a wide band instrument capable of measuring localised and directionally alternated magnetic fields below pT in the very high frequency (VHF) range. We take advantage of the magnon-photon hybridization between a yttrium iron garnet (YIG) sphere and a copper resonant cavity to employ a resonant heterodyne detection scheme. The measurement is near instantaneous due to the strong coupling attained between magnons and photons.In this work measurements are reported showing a significant widening of the measurement bandwidth, obtained by tuning the YIG Larmor frequency with a bias magnetic field and adjusting the magnon-photon coupling strength. Minimum sensitivity in the sub pT regime is demonstrated in the range 150 -- 225 MHz at room temperature and expected to go to fT in cryogenic temperatures. Dynamic range is estimated to be above 100 dB. The sensitivity is found to be independent on size, being ready to in-chip miniaturization. Such device can be an important building block to quantum circuits, such as baluns, transducers or signal processing units.</description>

Abstract: Topology is key in describing unconventional quantum phases of matter and devising robust quantum technology. Exactly how topology mixes with quantum mechanics remains largely unclear, as testified by the lack of a unifying microscopic theory for the ever-expanding and still puzzling transport behavior of electrons in the Quantum Hall Effect. Here we formulate a microscopic theory able to quantitatively describe the large wealth of Quantum Hall physics starting from one basic assumption, that the topological constraint in actual space leads to a superposition of states in the associated angular space. This allows us to identify the mechanism underlying quantum topology, single-particle wavefunction regularity in 3D, while many-body physics and disorder play no fundamental role. Our findings introduce a new far-reaching perspective in analyzing topological quantum systems and applications, such as topological quantum computing.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2301.06829v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We analyze and observe the Fock-Darwin (FD) states in a circular n-p junction (CNPJ) of topological surface states. Theoretically, in the CNPJ induced by the sub-surface point charge, the FD states of Dirac fermions are found to have a unique core-shell structure of trapped electrons and holes. The interplay between them is highly tunable by the magnetic field, which has no analog in their conventional counterparts and even in FD states of Dirac fermions confined by the most-studied parabolic-like potentials. A modified Einstein-Brillouin-Keller method is introduced to derive the electron-core states semiclassically. Experimentally, we obtain the clearly resolved FD states of topological surface states up to 14 Tesla which are very different from those of conventional electrons. Our data also visualizes directly directly the field-dependent potential landscape that may be modified by the electron-electron interactions in a CNPJ at the surface of a three-dimensional topological insulator thin film. Our findings signal the high tunability of the FD states of topological surface states in CNPJs that can be obtained by molecular beam epitaxy.</description>

Abstract: In this work, we have validated the application of Hertzian contact mechanics models and corrections for the analysis of force vs indentation curves, acquired using spherical indenters on linearly elastic samples, by means of finite elements simulations and AFM nanomechanical measurements of polyacrylamide gels possessing a thickness gradient. We have systematically investigated the impact of both large indentations and vertical spatial confinement (bottom effect) on the accuracy of the nanomechanical analysis performed with the Hertz model for the parabolic indenter compared to the Sneddon model for the spherical indenter. We demonstrated the accuracy of the combined correction of large indentation and bottom effects for the Hertz model proposed in the literature in the framework of linearized force vs indentation curves acquired using spherical indenters, as well as a validation of a new linearized form of the Sneddon model. Our results show that the corrected Hertz model allows to accurately quantify the Young's modulus of elasticity of linearly elastic samples with variable thickness at arbitrarily large indentations.</description>

Abstract: We generalize Landauer's theory of ballistic transport in a one-dimensional (1D) conductor to situations where charge carrier injection and extraction are not any more confined to electrodes at either end of the channel, but may occur along its whole length. This type of distributed injection is expected to occur from the two-dimensional (2D) bulk of, e.g., a quantum spin (or anomalous) Hall insulator to its topologically protected edge states. We apply our conceptual solution to the case of two metal electrodes contacting the 2D bulk, enabling us to derive criteria that discriminate ballistic from resistive edge channels in multi-terminal transport experiments.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2506.20162v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In bilayer graphene the exact energy levels of quantum dots can be derived from the four-component continuum Hamiltonian. Here, we study the quantum dot energy levels with approximate equations and compare them with the exact levels. The starting point of our approach is the four-component continuum model and the quantum dot is defined by a continuous potential well in a uniform magnetic field. Using some simple arguments we demonstrate realistic regimes where approximate quantum dot equations can be derived. Interestingly these approximate equations can be solved semi-analytically, in the same context as a single-component Schr\"odinger equation. The approximate equations provide valuable insight into the physics with minimal numerical effort compared with the four-component quantum dot model. We show that the approximate quantum dot energy levels agree very well with the exact levels in a broad range of parameters and find realistic regimes where the relative error is vanishingly small.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2508.14745v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Unconventional magnets with momentum-dependent spin-splitting but zero net magnetization form a recently identified class of collinear magnets that are challenging to probe via conventional means. We show that these systems can be distinguished through their intrinsic gyrotropic magnetic (IGM) currents, enabled by the Zeeman quantum geometry, which captures the coupled response of electronic states to momentum translation and spin rotation. Examining two prototypical two-dimensional unconventional magnets with Rashba spin-orbit coupling, a time-reversal-broken $d$-wave altermagnet and a time-reversal-symmetric $p$-wave magnet, we uncover a direct link between crystalline symmetry, spin-split band structures, and transport signatures. The $d_{x^2-y^2}$-wave altermagnet exhibits both transverse conduction and longitudinal displacement IGM currents, whereas the $p$-wave magnet supports only a transverse conduction IGM current. Remarkably, the mixed $d$-wave altermagnet supports all four types of IGM currents, including a longitudinal conduction current enabled by symmetric (Zeeman) Berry curvature that is forbidden in conventional quantum geometry. These responses, measurable via Hall transport and optical probes, persist even when conventional quantum geometry-driven linear responses vanish, offering unique access to hidden spin-split band structures. Our results establish Zeeman quantum geometry as both a diagnostic tool and a design principle for novel magnetic materials.</description>

      <title>Spin-wave propagation at low temperatures in YIG thin films on YSGG substrates</title>

      <description>arXiv:2510.04330v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The use of spin waves in magnetic thin films at cryogenic temperatures has long been hindered by the lack of a suitable material platform. Yttrium iron garnet (YIG) is the leading candidate, yet it is typically grown on gadolinium gallium garnet (GGG) substrates, which develop a large paramagnetic moment at low temperatures. This substrate effect limits spin-wave propagation. In this work, we demonstrate that thin YIG films grown on yttrium scandium gallium garnet (YSGG) substrates support robust spin-wave propagation in the Damon-Eshbach geometry, measurable down to 2 K under applied magnetic fields up to 150 mT. Compared with YIG/GGG, YIG/YSGG films exhibit narrower ferromagnetic resonance (FMR) linewidths at low temperatures and are free from the atomic interdiffusion effects that degrade the performance of YIG/GGG systems. These results establish YIG/YSGG thin films as a promising low-temperature platform, overcoming the intrinsic limitations of YIG/GGG and opening new opportunities for scalable magnonic and hybrid quantum devices operating under cryogenic conditions.</description>

      <title>Stability of graphene hyperbolic pseudospheres under harsh conditions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2510.04699v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We demonstrate the high stability of simulated graphene hyperbolic pseudospheres under large externally imposed deformations and high temperature annealing. Hyperbolic pseudospheres are produced in a two-step Molecular Dynamics simulation process. First, carbon atoms are forced down a thin three-dimensional volume of a chosen shape. During this extrusion process the carbon atoms form a precursor to graphene that is unrealistically less stable than graphite or diamond. Then the unstable carbon structure is annealed inside the thin volume at high temperature, turning the carbon into realistic polycrystalline, curved graphene. Point defects naturally appear in numbers and places that stabilize the graphene in the desired shape, without high residual stresses. We applied this new methodology to the creation of graphene hyperbolic pseudosphere surfaces, which reproduce analogs to some aspects of classical or quantum gravity. The free edges of the pseudosphere cause bending of the graphene. When these free edges are removed from the simulations by attaching periodic flat graphene sheets to the pseudosphere edges, the carbon atoms assume positions just some tenths of \r{A} from the mathematical hyperbolic pseudosphere surface. In demanding tests of their stability, the hyperbolic pseudospheres proved stable against $20^\circ$ shearing or $20\%$ elongation and then being released, which eventually raised their temperatures by $\sim 300 \ \text{K}$. Our methodology is relatively easy to use and offers a practical way to create simulated curved graphene surfaces of almost any shape. It allows for thorough testing in advance of the stability of graphene shapes that are to be produced experimentally.</description>

      <title>Coupling between vibration and Luttinger liquid in mechanical nanowires</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.25608</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.25608v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The vibration of the mechanical nanowire coupled to photons via photon pressure and coupled to charges via the capacity has been widely explored in experiments in the past decades. This system is electrically neutral, thus its coupling to the other degrees of freedom is always challenging. Here, we show that the vibration can slightly change the nanowire length and the associated Fermi velocity, which leads to coupling between vibration and Luttinger liquid. We consider the transverse and longitudinal vibrations of the nanowires, showing that the transverse vibration is much more significant than the longitudinal vibration, which can be measured through the sizable frequency shift. We predict an instability of the vibration induced by this coupling when the frequency becomes negative at a critical temperature for the transverse vibrations in nanowires with low Fermi energy, which can be reached by tuning the chemical potential and magnetic field. The time-dependent oscillation of the conductance, which directly measures the Luttinger parameter, can provide evidence for this coupling. Our theory offers a new mechanism for exploring the coupling between the vibration and the electronic excitations, which may lead to intriguing applications in cooling and controlling the mechanical oscillators with currents.</description>

      <title>Three-dimensional nanoscale control of magnetism in crystalline Yttrium Iron Garnet</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.17722</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.17722v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The exceptional magnetic, optical and phononic properties of Yttrium Iron Garnet (YIG) make it unique for spin-wave based and photonic applications. Yet, nanostructuring crystalline YIG and manipulating its magnetism in a non-destructive way is an outstanding challenge, and so far mostly limited to two-dimensional capabilities. Here, we show that irradiation of single-crystal YIG films with a focused UV laser drives a stable, giant enhancement of the perpendicular magnetic anisotropy, preserving the crystalline quality. This modulation is highly confined at the nanoscale in both the lateral and vertical directions, and its extension within the volume can be finely tuned with a continuous depth-control. By harnessing these three-dimensional anisotropy profiles, we demonstrate a large tuning of the spin-wave band structure, volume spatial localization, and non-reciprocity, realizing proof-of-principle 3D magnonic crystals. This straightforward, single-step, laser nanofabrication of three-dimensional magnetic systems based on crystalline YIG thin films opens the way to design novel functions in magnonic and magneto-optic devices.</description>

      <title>Resistance switch in ferromagnet/spin glass/ferromagnet spin valves</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.05960v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We obtain in single van-der-Waals layer of MnBi2Te4 the spin-valve-like ferromagnet/spin glass (SG)/ferromagnet architecture, where the switch of individual spin states in the SG-like layer appears as the resistance switch behavior. The characteristic temperature of SG can be effectively tuned by fine-control of Bi-doping in the SG layer. A doping- and temperature-dependent phase diagram is established. We demonstrate the remote manipulation and detection of the states of individual Mn-layer spins by tunneling electrons in favor of the electron-phonon, spin-phonon, spin-transfer torque and spin-flip interactions among hot electrons, lattice and local spins, where the spin valve layer is even buried below two-quintuple-layer Bi2Te3. The integration of the SG state into spin valves opens the opportunity of realizing atomic-scale spintronics by integrating different degrees of freedom in two dimensional materials.</description>

      <title>The spin-switch scanning tunneling microscopy: an architecture to probe electron-phonon interactions in the atomic scale</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.13410v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: On the spin-valve-like ferromagnet/spin glass/ferromagnet (FM/SG/FM) structure, the tunneling current is dominated by resistance switch (RS) instead of the local density of states according to the conventional tunneling theory. Here we show lattice-site dependent RS behaviors in one-quintuple-layer Bi2Te3 deposited on single MnBi2Te4 septuple layer, which comes from the difference in the efficiency of tunneling electrons to induce focused current or phonons at different sites, switching remotely the spin valve by spin-transfer torque or spin-phonon interactions. These lead to the observation of the dynamic 2-state lattice when the tip scans across the surface as well as the ability of scanning tunneling microscope (STM) to reveal atomic-scale features of electron-phonon (EP) interactions. Our work demonstrates the possibility of the spin-switch STM to image lattice-site dependent EP interactions of any materials deposited on the FM/SG/FM structure.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2501.11751v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present a general mechanism for large charge and spin Josephson diode effects in strongly spin-polarized superconductor-ferromagnet hybrid structures with a noncoplanar spin texture, formulated in terms of quantum-geometric phases. We present necessary conditions for this effect to occur, and show numerical results for disordered materials, relevant for applications. We calculate Josephson diode efficiencies for both charge- and spin-diodes and show that a spin-diode efficiency of 100% can be reached. Finally, we present a SQUID device that can switch between nearly pure spin-up and spin-down equal-spin supercurrents across the ferromagnet by reversing the flux. These findings establish functionalities that are absent for coplanar spin textures.</description>

      <title>Atomistic Theory of Plasmon-Induced Hot-carriers in Al Nanoparticles</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.16251v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Hot electrons and holes generated from the decay of localized surface plasmons (LSPs) in aluminum nanostructures have significant potential for applications in photocatalysis, photodetection and other optoelectronic devices. Here, we present a theoretical study of hot-carrier generation in aluminum nanospheres using a recently developed modelling approach that combines a solution of the macroscopic Maxwell equation with large-scale atomistic tight-binding simulations. Different from standard plasmonic metals, such as gold or silver, we find that the energetic distribution of hot electrons and holes in aluminium nanoparticles is almost constant for all allowed energies. Only at relatively high photon energies, a reduction of the generation rate of highly energetic holes and electrons close to the Fermi level is observed which is attributed to band structure effects suppressing interband decay channels. We also investigate the dependence of hot-carrier properties on the nanoparticle diameter and the environment dielectric constant. The insights from our study can inform experimental efforts towards highly efficient aluminum-based hot-carrier devices.</description>

      <title>Colossal dielectric response of HfxZr1-xO2 nanoparticles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.04697</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.04697v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We reveal a colossal dielectric response of small (5 - 10 nm) oxygen-deficient HfxZr1-xO2 nanoparticles (x = 1 - 0.4), prepared by the solid-state organonitrate synthesis. The effective dielectric permittivity of the pressed HfxZr1-xO2 nanopowders has a pronounced maximum at 38 - 88 C, which shape can be fitted by the Curie-Weiss type dependence modified for the diffuse ferroelectric-paraelectric phase transition. The maximal value of the dielectric permittivity increases from 1.5*10^3 (for x = 1) to 1.5*10^5 (for x= 0.4) at low frequencies (~4 Hz); being much smaller, namely changing from 7 (for x = 1) to 20 (for x = 0.4) at high frequencies (~500 kHz). The frequency dispersion of the dielectric permittivity maximum position is almost absent, meanwhile the shape and width of the maximum changes in a complex way with increase in frequency. The temperature dependencies of the dielectric permittivity and resistivity are almost mirror-like turned over in respect to each other, which means that all their features, such as position and shape of maxima, plateau, minima and inflexions, almost coincide after the mirror reflection in respect to the temperature axis. These correlations of resistivity and dielectric permittivity are well-described in the Heywang barrier model applied together with the variable range hopping conduction model in semiconducting ferroelectrics. The ferroelectric-like behavior of the small oxygen-deficient HfxZr1-xO2 nanoparticles is expected from the Landau-Ginzburg-Devonshire approach and density functional theory calculations. Obtained results may be useful for developing silicon-compatible functional nanomaterials based on HfxZr1-xO2 nanoparticles.</description>
