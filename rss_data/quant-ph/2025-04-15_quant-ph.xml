      <title>End-to-End Portfolio Optimization with Quantum Annealing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.08843</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.08843v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: With rapid technological progress reshaping the financial industry, quantum technology plays a critical role in advancing risk management, asset allocation, and financial strategies. Realizing its full potential requires overcoming challenges like quantum hardware limits, algorithmic stability, and implementation barriers. This research explores integrating quantum annealing with portfolio optimization, highlighting quantum methods' ability to enhance investment strategy efficiency and speed. Using hybrid quantum-classical models, the study shows combined approaches effectively handle complex optimization better than classical methods. Empirical results demonstrate a portfolio increase of 200,000 Indian Rupees over the benchmark. Additionally, using rebalancing leads to a portfolio that also surpasses the benchmark value.</description>

      <title>Is Productivity in Quantum Programming Equivalent to Expressiveness?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.08876</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.08876v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The expressiveness of quantum programming languages plays a crucial role in the efficient and comprehensible representation of quantum algorithms. Unlike classical programming languages, which offer mature and well-defined abstraction mechanisms, quantum languages must integrate cognitively challenging concepts such as superposition, interference and entanglement while maintaining clarity and usability. However, identifying and characterizing differences in expressiveness between quantum programming paradigms remains an open area of study. Our work investigates the landscape of expressiveness through a comparative analysis of hosted quantum programming languages such as Qiskit, Cirq, Qrisp, and quAPL, and standalone languages including Q# and Qmod. We focused on evaluating how different quantum programming languages support the implementation of core quantum algorithms -- Deutsch-Jozsa, Simon, Bernstein-Vazirani, and Grover -- using expressiveness metrics: Lines of Code (LOC), Cyclomatic Complexity (CC), and Halstead Complexity (HC) metrics as proxies for developer productivity. Our findings suggest that different quantum programming paradigms offer distinct trade-offs between expressiveness and productivity, highlighting the importance of language design in quantum software development.</description>

      <title>Engineering Dark Spin-Free Diamond Interfaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.08883</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.08883v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Nitrogen-vacancy (NV) centers in diamond are extensively utilized as quantum sensors for imaging fields at the nanoscale. The ultra-high sensitivity of NV magnetometers has enabled the detection and spectroscopy of individual electron spins, with potentially far-reaching applications in condensed matter physics, spintronics, and molecular biology. However, the surfaces of these diamond sensors naturally contain electron spins, which create a background signal that can be hard to differentiate from the signal of the target spins. In this study, we develop a surface modification approach that eliminates the unwanted signal of these so-called dark electron spins. Our surface passivation technique, based on coating diamond surfaces with a thin titanium oxide (TiO2) layer, reduces the dark spin density. The observed reduction in dark spin density aligns with our findings on the electronic structure of the diamond-TiO2 interface. The reduction, from a typical value of $2,000$~$\mu$m$^{-2}$ to a value below that set by the detection limit of our NV sensors ($200$~$\mu$m$^{-2}$), results in a two-fold increase in spin echo coherence time of near surface NV centers. Furthermore, we derive a comprehensive spin model that connects dark spin depolarization with NV coherence, providing additional insights into the mechanisms behind the observed spin dynamics. Our findings are directly transferable to other quantum platforms, including nanoscale solid state qubits and superconducting qubits.</description>

      <title>Planar quantum low-density parity-check codes with open boundaries</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.08887</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.08887v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We construct high-performance planar quantum low-density parity-check (qLDPC) codes with open boundaries, demonstrating substantially improved resource efficiency compared to the surface code. We present planar code families with logical dimensions ranging from $k=6$ to $k=13$ (e.g., $[[79, 6, 6]]$, $[[107, 7, 7]]$, $[[173, 8, 9]]$, $[[268, 8, 12]]$, $[[405, 9, 15]]$, $[[374, 10, 13]]$, $[[409, 11, 13]]$, $[[386, 12, 12]]$, $[[362, 13, 11]]$), all using local stabilizers of weight 6 or lower. These codes achieve an efficiency metric ($kd^2/n$) that is an order of magnitude greater than that of the surface code. They can be interpreted as planar bivariate bicycle codes, adapted from the original design based on a torus that is challenging to implement physically. Our construction method, which combines boundary anyon condensation with a novel "lattice grafting" optimization, circumvents this difficulty and produces codes featuring only local low-weight stabilizers suitable for 2D planar hardware architectures. Furthermore, we observe fractal logical operators in the form of Sierpinski triangles, with the code distances scaling proportionally to the area of the truncated fractal in finite systems. We anticipate that our codes and construction methods offer a promising pathway toward realizing near-term fault-tolerant quantum computers.</description>

      <title>Network Requirements for Distributed Quantum Computation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.08891</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.08891v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Physical constraints and engineering challenges, including wafer dimensions, classical control cabling, and refrigeration volumes, impose significant limitations on the scalability of quantum computing units. As a result, a modular quantum computing architecture, comprising small processors interconnected by quantum links, is emerging as a promising approach to fault-tolerant quantum computing. However, the requirements that the network must fulfill to enable distributed quantum computation remain largely unexplored. We consider an architecture tailored for qubits with nearest-neighbor physical connectivity, leveraging the surface code for error correction and enabling fault-tolerant operations through lattice surgery and magic state distillation. We propose measurement teleportation as a tool to extend lattice surgery techniques to qubits located on different computing units interconnected via Bell pairs. Through memory simulations, we build an error model for logical operations and deduce an end-to-end resource estimation of Shor's algorithm over a minimalist distributed architecture. Concretely, for a characteristic physical gate error rate of 1e-3, a processor cycle time of 1 microsecond, factoring a 2048-bit RSA integer is shown to be possible with 379 computing processors, each made with 89781 qubits, with negligible space and time overhead with respect to a monolithic approach without parallelization, if 70 Bell pairs are available per cycle time between each processor with a fidelity exceeding 98.4 percent.</description>

      <title>Laser-induced spectral diffusion of T centers in silicon nanophotonic devices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.08898</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.08898v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Color centers in silicon are emerging as spin-photon interfaces operating at telecommunication wavelengths. The nanophotonic device integration of silicon color centers via ion implantation leads to significant optical linewidth broadening, which makes indistinguishable photon generation challenging. Here, we study the optical spectral diffusion of T centers in a silicon photonic crystal cavity. We investigate the linewidth broadening timescales and origins by measuring the temporal correlations of the resonance frequency under different conditions. Spectral hole burning measurements reveal no spectral broadening at short timescales from 102 ns to 725 ns. We probe broadening at longer timescales using a check pulse to herald the T center frequency and a probe pulse to measure frequency after a wait time. The optical resonance frequency is stable up to 3 ms in the dark. Laser pulses below the silicon band gap applied during the wait time leads to linewidth broadening. Our observations establish laser-induced processes as the dominant spectral diffusion mechanism for T centers in devices, and inform materials and feedback strategies for indistinguishable photon generation.</description>

      <title>Fault-tolerant protocols through spacetime concatenation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.08918</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.08918v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce a framework called spacetime concatenation for fault-tolerant compilation of syndrome extraction circuits of stabilizer codes. Spacetime concatenation enables efficient compilation of syndrome extraction circuits into dynamical codes through structured gadget layouts and encoding matrices, facilitating low-weight measurements while preserving logical information. Our framework uses conditions that are sufficient for fault-tolerance of the dynamical code, including not measuring logical operators and preserving the spacetime distance. We construct explicit examples of dynamical codes using this framework, including the dynamical bivariate bicycle code and a dynamical Haah code, while illustrating their fault-tolerant properties. Furthermore, we analyze the classification and resource trade-offs of dynamical codes, demonstrating their adaptability to hardware constraints, including fabrication defects and qubit dropout scenarios.</description>

      <title>Robust High-Fidelity Quantum Entanglement Distribution over Large-Scale Metropolitan Fiber Networks with Co-propagating Classical Signals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.08927</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.08927v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Quantum Internet, a network of quantum-enabled infrastructure, represents the next frontier in telecommunications, promising unprecedented capabilities that cannot be attained by classical counterparts. A crucial step in realizing such large-scale quantum networks is the integration of entanglement distribution within existing telecommunication infrastructure. Here, we demonstrate a real-world scalable quantum networking testbed deployed within Deutsche Telekom's metropolitan fibers in Berlin. Using commercially available quantum devices and standard add-drop multiplexing hardware, we distribute polarization-entangled photon pairs over dynamically selectable fiber paths ranging from 10 m to 82 km. Quantum signals, transmitted at 1324 nm (O-band), coexist with conventional bidirectional C-band traffic without dedicated fibers or infrastructure changes. Active stabilization of the polarization enables robust long-term performance, achieving entanglement fidelities between 85-99% and Clauser-Horne-Shimony-Holt parameter S-values between 2.36-2.74 during continuous multiday operation. By achieving high-fidelity entanglement distribution under real urban conditions with less than 1% downtime, we confirm the feasibility of hybrid quantum-classical networks under real-world conditions at metropolitan scale. These results establish deployment benchmarks and provide a practical roadmap for telecom operators to integrate quantum capabilities.</description>

      <title>Analog Quantum Simulation of Dirac Hamiltonians in Circuit QED Using Rabi Driven Qubits</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.08944</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.08944v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum simulators hold promise for solving many intractable problems. However, a major challenge in quantum simulation, and quantum computation in general, is to solve problems with limited physical hardware. Currently, this challenge is tackled by designing dedicated devices for specific models, thereby allowing to reduce control requirements and simplify the construction. Here, we suggest a new method for quantum simulation in circuit QED, that provides versatility in model design and complete control over its parameters with minimal hardware requirements. We show how these features manifest through examples of quantum simulation of Dirac dynamics, which is relevant to the study of both high-energy physics and 2D materials. We conclude by discussing the advantages and limitations of the proposed method.</description>

      <title>Non-Abelian Extensions of the Dirac Oscillator: A Theoretical Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.08978</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.08978v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper presents a mathematical formulation of the Dirac oscillator within a non-Abelian gauge field. The Dirac equation, a fundamental equation in relativistic quantum mechanics, has been modified to include interactions with non-Abelian gauge fields governed by Lie groups, such as SU(2). This theoretical framework aims to capture the complex quantum dynamics arising from these interactions.
  We derive the interaction terms and provide a comprehensive description of the modified Dirac oscillator by integrating concepts from both Abelian and non-Abelian interactions. The primary contributions of this work include introducing additional interaction terms in the Hamiltonian and formulating non-Abelian electromagnetic tensors. These findings pave the way for exploring quantum systems influenced by non-Abelian gauge fields, with potential applications in quantum field theory and particle physics.</description>

      <title>Quantum Intuition XR: Tangible Quantum Mechanics using Interactive XR Experience</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.08984</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.08984v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Understanding quantum mechanics is inherently challenging due to its counterintuitive principles. Quantum Intuition XR is an interactive, extended reality (XR) experience designed to make quantum concepts tangible. Our system visualizes core principles of quantum computing, including qubits, superposition, entanglement, and measurement, through immersive interaction. Using a Mixed Reality headset, participants engage with floating qubits, manipulate their states via controllers, and observe entanglement dynamics through real-time audiovisual feedback. A key feature of our implementation is the mathematically accurate and dynamic representation of qubits, both individually and while interacting with each other. The visualization of the qubit states evolve -- rotate, shrink, grow, entangle -- depending on their actual quantum states, which depend on variables such as proximity to other qubits and user interaction. Preliminary expert interviews and demonstrations with quantum specialists indicate that the system accurately represents quantum phenomena, suggesting strong potential to educate and enhance quantum intuition for non-expert audiences. This approach bridges abstract quantum mechanics with embodied learning, offering an intuitive and accessible way for users to explore quantum phenomena. Future work will focus on expanding multi-user interactions and refining the fidelity of quantum state visualizations.</description>

      <title>Spectral compression of single-photon wave packets by sum-frequency conversion in slow-light waveguides</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.08993</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.08993v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A slow-light scheme is proposed for simultaneous frequency conversion and spectral compression of a weak optical pulse, which may be in any quantum state including a single-photon state. Such a process plays crucial roles in a number of schemes for constructing quantum networks. Assuming that appropriate slow-light waveguides can be fabricated, theoretical modeling shows that a 3-ps pulse can be converted by sum-frequency generation into a pulse with duration in the ns regime with a corresponding spectral compression factor of the order of 1000 and a useful intrinsic efficiency up to 83%. Independent of the input pulse shape, the converted pulse will have a near-exponential rising shape, which is suitable for temporal-mode matching into an optical cavity.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2504.09122v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We analyze the weak and critical points of various uncertainty relations that follow from the inequalities for the norms of vectors in the Hilbert space of states of a quantum system. There are studied uncertainty relations for sums of standard deviations, for sums of variances, and other relations between standard deviations or variances. The obtained results are compared with the conclusions obtained in similar cases using the standard Heisenberg-Robertson uncertainty relation. We also show that there exists an upper bound on the product of standard deviations that appears in the Heisenberg-Robertson uncertainty relation.</description>

      <title>Compact Circuits for Constrained Quantum Evolutions of Sparse Operators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.09133</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.09133v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce a general framework for constructing compact quantum circuits that implement the real-time evolution of Hamiltonians of the form $H = \sigma P_B$, where $\sigma$ is a Pauli string commuting with a projection operator $P_B$ onto a subspace of the computational basis. Such Hamiltonians frequently arise in quantum algorithms, including constrained mixers in QAOA, fermionic and excitation operators in VQE, and lattice gauge theory applications. Our method emphasizes the minimization of non-transversal gates, particularly T-gates, critical for fault-tolerant quantum computing. We construct circuits requiring $\mathcal{O}(n|B|)$ CX gates and $\mathcal{O}{n |B| + \log(|B|) \log (1/\epsilon)}$ T-gates, where $n$ is the number of qubits, $|B|$ the dimension of the projected subspace, and $\epsilon$ the desired approximation precision. For group-generated subspaces, we further reduce complexity to $\mathcal{O}(n \log |B|)$ CX gates and $\mathcal{O}{n+\log(\frac{1}{\epsilon})}$ T gates. Our constructive proofs yield explicit algorithms and include several applications, such as improved transposition circuits, efficient implementations of fermionic excitations, and oracle operators for combinatorial optimization.</description>

      <title>Tile Codes: High-Efficiency Quantum Codes on a Lattice with Boundary</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.09171</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.09171v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce tile codes, a simple yet powerful way of constructing quantum codes that are local on a planar 2D-lattice. Tile codes generalize the usual surface code by allowing for a bit more flexibility in terms of locality and stabilizer weight. Our construction does not compromise on the fact that the codes are local on a lattice with open boundary conditions. Despite its simplicity, we use our construction to find codes with parameters $[[288, 8, 12]]$ using weight-6 stabilizers and $[[288, 8, 14]]$ using weight-8 stabilizers, outperforming all previously known constructions in this direction. Allowing for a slightly higher non-locality, we find a $[[512, 18, 19]]$ code using weight-8 stabilizers, which outperforms the rotated surface code by a factor of more than 12. Our approach provides a unified framework for understanding the structure of codes that are local on a 2D planar lattice and offers a systematic way to explore the space of possible code parameters. In particular, due to its simplicity, the construction naturally accommodates various types of boundary conditions and stabilizer configurations, making it a versatile tool for quantum error correction code design.</description>

      <title>Classical Autoencoder Distillation of Quantum Adversarial Manipulations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.09216</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.09216v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum neural networks have been proven robust against classical adversarial attacks, but their vulnerability against quantum adversarial attacks is still a challenging problem. Here we report a new technique for the distillation of quantum manipulated image datasets by using classical autoencoders. Our technique recovers quantum classifier accuracies when tested under standard machine learning benchmarks utilising MNIST and FMNIST image datasets, and PGD and FGSM adversarial attack settings. Our work highlights a promising pathway to achieve fully robust quantum machine learning in both classical and quantum adversarial scenarios.</description>

      <title>Commutators with multiple unitary symmetry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.09232</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.09232v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Commutators are essential in quantum information theory, influencing quantum state symmetries and information storage robustness. This paper systematically investigates the characteristics of bipartite and multipartite quantum states invariant under local unitary group actions. The results demonstrate that any quantum states commuting with $U \otimes U^{\dagger}$ and $U \otimes V$ can be expressed as $\frac{1}{n}I_n$, where $U$ and $V$ are arbitary $n\times n$ unitary matrices. Furthermore, in tripartite systems, any quantum states commuting with $U \otimes U \otimes U^{\dagger}$ must necessarily adopt the form: $W = xI_{n^3} + y\left(\sum_{i,j=1}^n (|i\rangle \langle j|) \otimes (|j\rangle \langle i|)\right) \otimes I_n$, where $F_n$ represents the canonical swap operator. These results provide theoretical tools for characterizing multipartite entanglement constraints and designing symmetry-protected quantum protocols.</description>

      <title>The boundary of Kirkwood-Dirac quasiprobability</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.09238</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.09238v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Kirkwood-Dirac (KD) quasiprobability describes measurement statistics of joint quantum observables, and has generated great interest as prominent indicators of non-classical features in various quantum information processing tasks. It relaxes the Kolmogorov axioms of probability by allowing for negative and even imaginary probabilities, and thus incorporates the classical probability theory as its inner boundary. In this work, we introduce the postquantum quasiprobability under mild assumptions to provide an outer boundary for KD quasiprobability. Specifically, we present qualitative and quantitative evidence to show that the classical, KD, and postquantum quasiprobabilities form a strict hierarchy, in the sense that joint probability distributions are a strict subset of KD quasiprobability distributions that are a strict subset of postquantum ones. Surprisingly, we are able to derive some nontrivial bounds valid for both classical probability and KD quasiprobability, and even valid for the KD quasiprobability generated by an arbitrary number of measurements. Finally, other interesting bounds are obtained, and their implications are noted. Our work solves the fundamental problems of what and how to bound the KD quasiprobability, and hence provides a deeper understanding of utilizing it in quantum information processing.</description>

      <title>Adiabatic Encoding of Pre-trained MPS Classifiers into Quantum Circuits</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.09250</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.09250v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Although Quantum Neural Networks (QNNs) offer powerful methods for classification tasks, the training of QNNs faces two major training obstacles: barren plateaus and local minima. A promising solution is to first train a tensor-network (TN) model classically and then embed it into a QNN.\ However, embedding TN-classifiers into quantum circuits generally requires postselection whose success probability may decay exponentially with the system size. We propose an \emph{adiabatic encoding} framework that encodes pre-trained MPS-classifiers into quantum MPS (qMPS) circuits with postselection, and gradually removes the postselection while retaining performance. We prove that training qMPS-classifiers from scratch on a certain artificial dataset is exponentially hard due to barren plateaus, but our adiabatic encoding circumvents this issue. Additional numerical experiments on binary MNIST also confirm its robustness.</description>

      <title>A mixed-integer program for circuit execution time minimization with precedence constraints</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.09268</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.09268v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a mixed-integer programming (MIP) model for scheduling quantum circuits to minimize execution time. Our approach maximizes parallelism by allowing non-overlapping gates (those acting on distinct qubits) to execute simultaneously. Our methods apply to general circuits with precedence constraints. First, we derive closed-formulas for the execution time of circuits generated by ma-QAOA on star graphs for a layered, greedy, and MIP schedules. We then compare the MIP schedule against layered and greedy scheduling approaches on the circuits generated by ma-QAOA for solving the MaxCut problem on all non-isomorphic connected graphs with 3-7 vertices. These experiments demonstrate that the MIP scheduler consistently results in shorter circuit execution times than greedy and layered approaches, with up to 24\% savings.</description>

      <title>Non-Markovian spontaneous emission in a tunable cavity formed by atomic mirrors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.09281</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.09281v2 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We analyze the non-Markovian spontaneous emission dynamics of a two-level test atom placed in a cavity formed by two atomic arrays in a waveguide quantum electrodynamics (QED) setup. We demonstrate a crossover from single-mode to multimode strong coupling cavity QED as the cavity length $ \sim d$ becomes comparable to the coherence length associated with collective spontaneous emission $\sim v/(N\gamma)$. The resulting non-Markovian dynamics of the test atom and the emergent spectral density of the field are analyzed as a function of various tunable atomic array parameters: number of atoms, length of the atomic cavity, and resonance frequency of the atoms forming the atomic mirrors. Our results show limitations to cooperatively enhanced light-matter coupling in the presence of time-delayed feedback. We further illustrate that the non-Markovian system dynamics can be efficiently approximated in terms of a few modes of the emergent spectral density of the field.</description>

      <title>Chip-Based 16 GBaud Continuous-Variable Quantum Key Distribution</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.09308</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.09308v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum key distribution (QKD) stands as the most successful application of quantum information science, providing information-theoretic security for key exchange. While it has evolved from proof-of-concept experiments to commercial products, widespread adoption requires chip-based integration to reduce costs, enable mass production, facilitate miniaturization, and enhance system performance. Here, we demonstrate the first fully photonic-integrated continuous-variable QKD (CVQKD) system operating at a classical telecom symbol rate of 16 GBaud. Our system integrates a silicon photonic transmitter circuit (excluding the laser source) and a 20 GHz photonic-electronic receiver, which features a phase-diverse silicon photonic integrated circuit and custom-designed GaAs pHEMT transimpedance amplifiers. Advanced digital signal processing allows our system to achieve the highest reported secure key rate to date, reaching 0.289 Gb/s and 0.246 Gb/s over a 20 km fiber link in the asymptotic and finite-size regimes, respectively. These results establish a record key rate and represent a critical step toward scalable, cost-effective, and mass-deployable quantum-secure communication using photonic-integrated CVQKD systems.</description>

      <title>Hypergraphic representation for adaptive quantum circuits</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.09318</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.09318v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Adaptive quantum circuits enhance flexibility and efficiency over traditional static circuits by dynamically adjusting their structure and parameters in real-time based on intermediate measurement outcomes. This paper introduces a novel hypergraph representation for adaptive quantum circuits, where groups of gates are considered as participants of hyperedges. By incorporating these gate groups into hyperedges, we create an extended hypergraph that includes constraints usable during the partitioning process. This approach guides the partitioning to maintain groups of ports associated with classical operations, ensuring that the resulting partitions prioritize qubits involved in the same sections of classical operations inherent to the adaptive approach. We present a new hypergraph partitioning algorithm based as an extension of Fiduccia-Mattheyses heuristic, to support hypergraphs created from adaptive quantum circuits. Comparative analysis between static and adaptive methods demonstrates the effectiveness of the proposed hypergraph techniques for adaptive circuits. Experimental results using benchmark quantum circuits validate our theoretical insights, showing improvements in circuit representation for partitioning heuristics. These findings highlight the practical benefits of hypergraph representation in adaptive quantum computing.</description>

      <title>Mesoscopic cavity quantum electrodynamics with phase-disordered emitters in a Kerr nonlinear resonator</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.09324</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.09324v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The field of cavity quantum electrodynamics (QED) has seen a recent resurgence of interest in few- and many-body physics owing to the realization that the breaking of symmetries and the presence of disorder can give rise to entirely new phenomena. Here we demonstrate a few-emitter cavity QED system capable of realizing new Hamiltonians in quantum optics based on breaking of symmetries and the realization of an in situ Kerr nonlinearity. Our experiment relies on a high-finesse silicon carbide whispering gallery mode resonator hosting an ensemble of silicon vacancy color centers. The simultaneous presence of spectral and spatial disorder of the mesoscopic atom system gives rise to emergent chirality, and the optical nonlinearity of the silicon carbide host crystal enables the observation of atom-photon correlations induced by a four-photon nonlinear process. This work demonstrates the potential for solid state defect systems to realize emerging proposals and to study fundamental physics in quantum electrodynamics.</description>

      <title>Spatial and temporal circuit cutting with hypergraphic partitioning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.09334</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.09334v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum computing promises to revolutionize problem-solving through quantum mechanics, but current NISQ devices face limitations in qubit count and error rates, hindering the execution of large-scale quantum circuits. To address these challenges and improve scalability, two main circuit cutting strategies have emerged: the gate-cut approach, which distributes circuit segments across multiple QPUs (spatial), and the qubit wire cut approach, which divides circuits for sequential execution (temporal). This paper presents a hypergraph-based circuit cutting methodology suitable for both spatial and temporal scenarios. By modeling quantum circuits as high-level hypergraphs, we apply partitioning heuristics such as Stoer-Wagner, Fiduccia-Mattheyses, and Kernighan-Lin to optimize the partitioning process. Our approach aims to reduce communication overhead in spatial cuts and minimize qubit initialization costs in temporal ones. To assess effectiveness, we propose a new evaluation metric called the coupling ratio, which quantifies the trade-offs between communication and initialization. Comparative analyses show that hypergraph partitioning improves the efficiency of distributed quantum architectures. Notably, the Fiduccia-Mattheyses heuristic offers superior performance and adaptability for real-time circuit cutting on multi-QPU systems. Overall, this work positions hypergraph partitioning as a foundational technique for scalable quantum computing in distributed environments.</description>

      <title>An Exact Link between Nonlocal Magic and Operator Entanglement</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.09360</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.09360v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Nonstabilizerness, commonly referred to as magic, is a quantum property of states associated with the non-Clifford resources required for their preparation. As a resource, magic complements entanglement, and the interplay between these two concepts has garnered significant attention in recent years. In this work, we establish an exact correspondence between the generation of nonlocal magic and operator entanglement under unitary evolutions. Nonlocal magic refers to nonstabilizerness that cannot be erased via local operations, while operator entanglement generalizes entanglement to operator space, characterizing the complexity of operators across a bipartition. Specifically, we prove that a unitary map generates nonlocal magic if and only if it generates operator entanglement on Pauli strings. Guided by this result, we introduce an average measure of a unitary's Pauli-entangling power, serving as a proxy for nonlocal magic generation. We derive analytical formulas for this measure and examine its properties, including its typical value and upper bounds in terms of the nonstabilizerness properties of the evolution.</description>

      <title>Identifying Protein Co-regulatory Network Logic by Solving B-SAT Problems through Gate-based Quantum Computing</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.09365v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: There is growing awareness that the success of pharmacologic interventions on living organisms is significantly impacted by context and timing of exposure. In turn, this complexity has led to an increased focus on regulatory network dynamics in biology and our ability to represent them in a high-fidelity way, in silico. Logic network models show great promise here and their parameter estimation can be formulated as a constraint satisfaction problem (CSP) that is well-suited to the often sparse, incomplete data in biology. Unfortunately, even in the case of Boolean logic, the combinatorial complexity of these problems grows rapidly, challenging the creation of models at physiologically-relevant scales. That said, quantum computing, while still nascent, facilitates novel information-processing paradigms with the potential for transformative impact in problems such as this one. In this work, we take a first step at actualizing this potential by identifying the structure and Boolean decisional logic of a well-studied network linking 5 proteins involved in the neural development of the mammalian cortical area of the brain. We identify the protein-protein connectivity and binary decisional logic governing this network by formulating it as a Boolean Satisfiability (B-SAT) problem. We employ Grover's algorithm to solve the NP-hard problem faster than the exponential time complexity required by deterministic classical algorithms. Using approaches deployed on both quantum simulators and actual noisy intermediate scale quantum (NISQ) hardware, we accurately recover several high-likelihood models from very sparse protein expression data. The results highlight the differential roles of data types in supporting accurate models; the impact of quantum algorithm design as it pertains to the mutability of quantum hardware; and the opportunities for accelerated discovery enabled by this approach.</description>

      <title>Quantum Rabi oscillations in the semiclassical limit: backreaction on the cavity field and entanglement</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.09366</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.09366v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The goal of this chapter is to compare the predictions of the semiclassical Rabi model (SRM), which describes the interaction between a two-level system (qubit) and a classical monochromatic wave, and the quantum Rabi model (QRM), under the assumption that the cavity field is initiated in a coherent state with a large average number of photons, ranging from 5K to 40K. First, we show that for a strong atom-field coupling, when the duration of the $\pi $-pulse (the time interval required to completely excite or deexcite the qubit in the resonant regime) is below $100\omega ^{-1}$, the behaviour of the atomic excitation probability deviates significantly from the textbook sinusoidal formula derived for the SRM under the rotating-wave approximation, and we present simple analytical and semi-analytical methods to describe more accurately the dynamics. Then we show that the QRM reproduces the qubit's dynamics predicted by the SRM only for initial times, since in the QRM the qubit excitation probability exhibits a collapse behaviour even in the lossless scenario; we also notice that the qualitative behaviour of such collapses is different from the ones occurring in the dissipative SRM. In the rest of this work we study numerically the backreaction of the qubit on the cavity field and the resulting atom--field entanglement, which are disregarded in the SRM. It is shown that the atom-field entanglement increases over time and a maximally entangled state is attained for large times. Moreover, we illustrate how the Rabi oscillations continuously modify the quantum state of the cavity field, which becomes increasingly different from the original coherent state as the time increases.</description>

      <title>Survival of the Optimized: An Evolutionary Approach to T-depth Reduction</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.09391v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum Error Correction (QEC) is essential for realizing practical Fault-Tolerant Quantum Computing (FTQC) but comes with substantial resource overhead. Quantum circuits must be compiled into the Clifford+T gate set, where the non-transversal nature of the T-gates necessitates costly magic distillation. As circuit complexity grows, so does the T-depth: the sequential T-gate layers, due to the decomposition of arbitrary rotations, further increasing the QEC demands. Optimizing T-depth poses two key challenges: it is NP-hard and existing solutions like greedy or brute-force algorithms are either suboptimal or computationally expensive. We address this by framing the problem as a search task and propose a Genetic Algorithm (GA)-based approach to discover near-optimal T-gate merge patterns across circuit layers. To improve upon convergence and solution quality, we incorporate a mathematical expansion scheme that facilitates reordering layers to identify better merge opportunities, along with a greedy initialization strategy based on T-gate density. Our method achieves up to 79.23% T-depth reduction and 41.86% T-count reduction in large circuits (90-100 qubits). Compared to state-of-the-art methods like the lookahead-based approach, our framework yields an average improvement of 1.2x across varying circuit sizes and T-gate densities. Our approach is hardware-agnostic making it compatible with diverse QEC architectures such as surface codes and QLDPCs, resulting in a scalable and practical optimization framework for near-term fault-tolerant quantum computing.</description>

      <title>Dissipation induced localization-delocalization transition in a flat band</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.09444</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.09444v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The interplay between dissipation and localization in quantum systems has garnered significant attention due to its potential to manipulate transport properties and induce phase transitions. In this work, we explore the dissipation-induced extended-localized transition in a flat band model, where the system's asymptotic state can be controlled by tailored dissipative operators. By analyzing the steady-state density matrix and dissipative dynamics, we demonstrate that dissipation is able to drive the system to states dominated by either extended or localized modes, irrespective of the initial conditions. The control mechanism relies on the phase properties of the dissipative operators, which selectively favor specific eigenstates of the Hamiltonian. Our findings reveal that dissipation can be harnessed to induce transitions between extended and localized phases, offering a novel approach to manipulate quantum transport in flat band systems. This work not only deepens our understanding of dissipation-induced phenomena in flat band systems but also provides a new avenue for controlling quantum states in open systems.</description>

      <title>Arbitrary state creation via controlled measurement</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.09462</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.09462v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose the algorithm for creating an arbitrary pure quantum superposition state with required accuracy of encoding the amplitudes and phases of this state. The algorithm uses controlled measurement of the ancilla state to avoid the problem of small probability of detecting the required ancilla state. This algorithm can be a subroutine generating the required input state in various algorithms, in particular, in matrix-manipulation algorithms developed earlier.</description>

      <title>Tight tradeoff relation and optimal measurement for multi-parameter quantum estimation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.09490</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.09490v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The main challenge in multi-parameter quantum estimation lies in the incompatibility between optimal schemes for different parameters, which leads to nontrivial tradeoffs between the precision limits for estimating different parameters. Understanding and characterizing this tradeoff is essential in determining the ultimate precision limits in multi-parameter quantum estimation, making it a central topic in the field of quantum metrology. In this article, we present an approach that precisely quantifies the tradeoff resulting from incompatible optimal measurements in multi-parameter estimation. We derive a tight analytical tradeoff relation that determines the ultimate precision limits for estimating an arbitrary number of parameters encoded in pure quantum states. Additionally, we provide a systematic methodology for constructing optimal measurements that saturate this tight bound in an analytical and structured manner. To demonstrate the power of our findings, we applied our methodology to quantum radar, resulting in a refined Arthurs-Kelly relation that characterizes the ultimate performance for the simultaneous estimation of range and velocity. This showcases the transformative potential of our findings for many applications in quantum metrology.</description>

      <title>Variational principle for the time evolution operator, its usefulness in effective theories of condensed matter systems and a glimpse into the role played by the quantum geometry of unitary transformations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.09512</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.09512v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This work discusses a variational approach to determining the time evolution operator. We directly see a glimpse of how a generalization of the quantum geometric tensor for unitary operators plays a central role in parameter evolution. We try the method with the simplest ansatz (a power series in a time-independent Hamiltonian), which yields considerable improvements over a Taylor series. These improvements are because, unlike for a Taylor series of $\exp(-iHt)$, time $t$ is not forced to appear in the same order as $H$, giving more flexibility for the description. We demonstrate that our results can also be employed to improve degenerate perturbation theory in a non-perturbative fashion. We concede that our approach described here is most useful for finite-dimensional Hamiltonians. As a first example of applications to perturbation theory, we present AB bilayer graphene, which we downfolded to a 2x2 model; our energy results considerably improve typical second-order degenerate perturbation theory. We then demonstrate that the approach can also be used to derive a non-perturbatively valid Heisenberg Hamiltonian. Here, the approach for a finite-size lattice yields excellent results. However, the corrections are not ideal for the thermodynamic limit (they depend on the number of sites $N$). Nevertheless, the approach adds almost no additional technical complications over typical perturbative expansions of unitary operators, making it ready for deployment in physics questions. One should expect considerably improved couplings for the degenerate perturbation theory of finite-size systems. More work is needed in the many-body case, and we suggest a possible remedy to issues with the thermodynamic limit. Our work hints at how the appearance of mathematically beautiful concepts like quantum geometry can indicate an opportunity to dig for approximations beyond typical perturbation theory</description>

      <title>Time-of-Flow Distribution in Discrete Quantum Systems: From Experimental Protocol to Optimization and Decoherence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.09571</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.09571v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this letter, we propose to quantify the timing of quantum state transitions in discrete systems via the time-of-flow (TF) distribution. Derived from the rate of change of state occupation probability, the TF distribution is experimentally accessible via projective measurements at discrete time steps on independently prepared systems, avoiding Zeno inhibition. In monotonic regimes and limiting cases, it admits a clear interpretation as a time-of-arrival or time-of-departure distribution. We show how this framework can be used in the optimization of quantum control protocols and in diagnostic tools for assessing decoherence in open quantum systems.</description>

      <title>Hierarchical Quantum Optimization via Backbone-Driven Problem Decomposition: Integrating Tabu-Search with QAOA</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.09575</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.09575v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: As quantum computing advances, quantum approximate optimization algorithms (QAOA) have shown promise in addressing combinatorial optimization problems. However, the limitations of Noisy Intermediate Scale Quantum (NISQ) devices hinder the scalability of QAOA for large-scale optimization tasks. To overcome these challenges, we propose Backbone-Driven QAOA, a hybrid framework that leverages adaptive Tabu search for classical preprocessing to decompose large-scale quadratic unconstrained binary (QUBO) problems into NISQ-compatible subproblems. In our approach, adaptive Tabu search dynamically identifies and fixes backbone variables to construct reduced-dimensional subspaces that preserve the critical optimization landscape. These quantum-tractable subproblems are then solved via QAOA, with the resulting solutions iteratively refining the backbone selection in a closed-loop quantum-classical cycle. Experimental results demonstrate that our approach not only competes with, and in some cases surpasses, traditional classical algorithms but also performs comparably with recently proposed hybrid classical-quantum algorithms. Our proposed framework effectively orchestrates the allocation of quantum and classical resources, thereby enabling the solution of large-scale combinatorial optimization problems on current NISQ hardware.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.09576</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.09576v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a systematic investigation of bimodule quantum Markov semigroups within the framework of quantum Fourier analysis. Building on the structure of quantum symmetries, we introduce the concepts of bimodule equilibrium and bimodule detailed balance conditions, which not only generalize the classical notions of equilibrium and detailed balance but also expose interesting structures of quantum channels. We demonstrate that the evolution of densities governed by the bimodule quantum Markov semigroup is the bimodule gradient flow for the relative entropy with respect to quantum symmetries. Consequently, we obtain bimodule logarithmic Sobelov inequalities and bimodule Talagrand inequality with respect to a hidden density from higher dimensional structure. Furthermore, we establish a bimodule Poincar\'{e} inequality for irreducible inclusions and relative ergodic bimodule quantum semigroups.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2504.09581v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider a localized quantum system living in a curved spacetimes. By translating into this scenario the paradgmatic two-point measument scheme in quantum statistical mechanics we are able to prove a relativistic version of the quantum flutuation theorem. One of the consequences of such a theorem is that entropy production is deeply observer dependent. The main ideas of this chapter are published in [M. L. W. Basso, J. Maziero and L. C. C\'eleri. The irreversibility of relativistic time-dilation. Class. Quantum Grav. \textbf{40}, 195001 (2023); M. L. W. Basso, J. Maziero and L. C. C\'eleri.

Abstract: The quantum algorithm with polynomial time for discrete logarithm problem proposed by Shor is one of the most significant quantum algorithms, but a large number of qubits may be required in the Noisy Intermediate-scale Quantum (NISQ) era. The main contributions of this paper are as follows: (1) A distributed quantum algorithm for discrete logarithm problem is designed, and its space complexity and success probability exhibit certain advantages to some extent; (2) The classical error correction technique proposed by Xiao and Qiu et al. is generalized by extending three bits to more than three bits.</description>

Abstract: Simon's problem is one of the most important problems demonstrating the power of quantum computing. Recently, an interesting distributed quantum algorithm for Simon's problem was proposed, where a key sorting operator requiring a large number of qubits was employed. In this paper, we design an improved distributed quantum algorithm for Simon's problem without using sorting operators, and our algorithm has the advantage of reducing half number of qubits required for a single computing node. Moreover, our algorithm does not involve the classical search process.</description>

      <title>Nonequilibrium plasmon fluid in a Josephson junction chain</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.09721v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Equilibrium quantum systems are often described by a collection of weakly-interacting normal modes. Bringing such systems far from equilibrium, however, can drastically enhance mode-to-mode interactions. Understanding the resulting quantum fluid is a fundamental question for quantum statistical mechanics, and a practical question for engineering driven quantum devices. To tackle this question, we probe the nonequilibrium kinetics of one-dimensional plasmons in a long chain of Josephson junctions. We introduce multimode spectroscopy to controllably study the departure from equilibrium, witnessing the evolution from pairwise coupling between plasma modes at weak driving to dramatic, high-order, cascaded couplings at strong driving. Scaling to many-mode drives, we stimulate interactions between hundreds of modes, resulting in near-continuum internal dynamics. Imaging the resulting nonequilibrium plasmon populations, we then resolve the non-local redistribution of energy in the response to a weak perturbation -- an explicit verification of the emergence of a strongly interacting, non-equilibrium fluid of plasmons.</description>

Abstract: We study the entanglement dynamics of multi-qubit systems coupled to a common dissipative environment, focusing on systems with one or two initially excited qubits. Using the Lindblad master equation, we derive the time evolution of the density matrix and analyze the entanglement between qubit pairs via the concurrence measure. The solution method involves applying the Lindblad super-operator to the initial density matrix, generating a subspace of non-duplicate states. We extend our analysis to $n$-qubit systems, including three-qubit and four-qubit configurations, and explore the effects of thermal noise on entanglement dynamics. Our results demonstrate how initial conditions, system size, and environmental interactions shape entanglement, providing valuable insights for quantum information processing applications.</description>

      <title>Implementing and benchmarking dynamically corrected gates on superconducting devices using space curve quantum control</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.09767</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.09767v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We use Space Curve Quantum Control (SCQC) to design, experimentally demonstrate, and benchmark dynamically corrected single-qubit gates on IBM hardware, comparing their performance to that of the standard gates provided by IBM. Our gates are designed to dynamically suppress both detuning and pulse-amplitude noise, with gate times as short as 88 ns. We compare our gates against those of IBM on two separate IBM devices and across sets of up to 18 qubits. Randomized benchmarking is done utilizing our detuning- and amplitude-robust gates in randomized Clifford circuits containing up to 4000 gates. Our gates achieve error-per-Clifford rates that reach as low as 7$\times10^{-5}$ ($\pm10^{-6}$) and which remain nearly constant as the compound noise is increased up to 4% amplitude noise and up to a detuning noise of 342 kHz; this is in contrast to the IBM gates, which exhibit rates that drop to order $10^{-3}$ across this range. This range is consistent with the commonly reported frequency fluctuations and with the upper bound of the statistical uncertainty in gate calibration. In addition, we investigate the performance across larger noise ranges of up to 20% amplitude and 3.5 MHz detuning noise using quantum process tomography. Finally, we experimentally demonstrate how SCQC can be tailored to different practical use cases by trading off amplitude-robustness for ultrafast 60 ns dephasing-only robust pulses. Our work establishes experimental guidelines for implementing SCQC-designed dynamically corrected gates on a broad range of qubit hardware to limit the effect of noise-induced errors and decoherence.</description>

Abstract: The paper presents a generalization bound for quantum neural networks based on a dynamical Lie algebra. Using covering numbers derived from a dynamical Lie algebra, the Rademacher complexity is derived to calculate the generalization bound. The obtained result indicates that the generalization bound is scaled by O(sqrt(dim(g))), where g denotes a dynamical Lie algebra of generators. Additionally, the upper bound of the number of the trainable parameters in a quantum neural network is presented. Numerical simulations are conducted to confirm the validity of the obtained results.</description>

      <title>Stark-induced tunable phase transition in the two-photon Dicke-Stark model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.09782</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.09782v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We theoretically investigate the superradiant phase transition (SPT) in the two-photon Dicke-Stark model, which incorporates both Rabi and Stark coupling. By introducing a Stark coupling term, we significantly reduce the critical Rabi coupling strength required to achieve the SPT, enabling it to occur even in strong coupling regimes. Using mean-field theory, we derive the conditions for the SPT and show that it exhibits a second-order phase transition. Surprisingly, we demonstrate that the transition point can be widely tuned by the Stark coupling strength. The signatures of these Stark-tunable SPT points are manifested through atomic averages. When quantum fluctuations are included, the spin-squeezing distributions also reveal the effects of Stark-tunable SPT points. In addition, we propose an experimentally feasible realization using an ion trap system driven by three lasers. Our scheme enables optical switching between normal and superradiant phases through pump field intensity modulation, where the Stark coupling coefficient serves as the optically tunable parameter. Our results offer a new approach to engineer the SPT, extending superradiance-based quantum technologies beyond the ultrastrong coupling regime.</description>

      <title>Practical Advantage of Classical Communication in Entanglement Detection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.09791</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.09791v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Entanglement is the cornerstone of quantum communication, yet conventional detection relies solely on local measurements. In this work, we present a unified theoretical and experimental framework demonstrating that one-way local operations and classical communication (1-LOCC) can significantly outperform purely local measurements in detecting high-dimensional quantum entanglement. By casting the entanglement detection problem as a semidefinite program (SDP), we derive protocols that minimize false negatives at fixed false-positive rates. A variational generative machine-learning algorithm efficiently searches over high-dimensional parameter spaces, identifying states and measurement strategies that exhibit a clear 1-LOCC advantage. Experimentally, we realize a genuine event-ready protocol on a three-dimensional photonic entanglement source, employing fiber delays as short-lived quantum memories. We implement rapid, FPGA-based sampling of the optimized probabilistic instructions, allowing Bob's measurement settings to adapt to Alice's outcomes in real time. Our results validate the predicted 1-LOCC advantage in a realistic noisy setting and reduce the experimental trials needed to certify entanglement. These findings mark a step toward scalable, adaptive entanglement detection methods crucial for quantum networks and computing, paving the way for more efficient generation and verification of high-dimensional entangled states.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2504.09806v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider classical theories described by Hamiltonians $H(p,q)$ that have a non-degenerate minimum at the point where generalized momenta $p$ and generalized coordinates $q$ vanish. We assume that the sum of squares of generalized momenta and generalized coordinates is an integral of motion. In this situation, in the neighborhood of the point $p=0, q=0$ quadratic part of a Hamiltonian plays a dominant role. We suppose that a classical observer can observe only physical quantities corresponding to quadratic Hamiltonians and show that in this case, he should conclude that the laws of quantum theory govern his world.</description>

      <title>A Practical Framework for Assessing the Performance of Observable Estimation in Quantum Simulation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.09813</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.09813v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Simulating dynamics of physical systems is a key application of quantum computing, with potential impact in fields such as condensed matter physics and quantum chemistry. However, current quantum algorithms for Hamiltonian simulation yield results that are inadequate for real use cases and suffer from lengthy execution times when implemented on near-term quantum hardware. In this work, we introduce a framework for evaluating the performance of quantum simulation algorithms, focusing on the computation of observables, such as energy expectation values. Our framework provides end-to-end demonstrations of algorithmic optimizations that utilize Pauli term groups based on k-commutativity, generate customized Clifford measurement circuits, and implement weighted shot distribution strategies across these groups. These demonstrations span multiple quantum execution environments, allowing us to identify critical factors influencing runtime and solution accuracy. We integrate enhancements into the QED-C Application-Oriented Benchmark suite, utilizing problem instances from the open-source HamLib collection. Our results demonstrate a 27.1% error reduction through Pauli grouping methods, with an additional 37.6% improvement from the optimized shot distribution strategy. Our framework provides an essential tool for advancing quantum simulation performance using algorithmic optimization techniques, enabling systematic evaluation of improvements that could maximize near-term quantum computers' capabilities and advance practical quantum utility as hardware evolves.</description>

      <title>Investigation of Rare-Earth Ion-Photon Interaction and Strong Coupling in Optical Microcavities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.09863</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.09863v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The strong coupling between an emitter and a cavity is significant for advancing quantum networks. Due to their long optical and spin coherence times, rare-earth ions (REIs) represent a compelling platform for quantum networks. However, their inherently weak intra-4f optical transitions typically result in low coupling strength, thus restricting most current achievements to the weak coupling regime. This work proposes a scheme to realize an on-chip quantum network by coupling REIs to high-quality whispering gallery mode (WGM) microcavities. Additionally, we provide numerical validation for a parametric amplification technique to enhance the emitter-cavity coupling strength. As an extension of this approach, the coupled system efficiently achieves the quantum entanglement of local and flying qubits. This study deepens the understanding of emitter-cavity interactions and contributes to realizing REIs-based photonic platforms, which are crucial to distributed quantum computing and developing robust quantum networks.</description>

      <title>Scalable fluxonium qubit architecture with tunable interactions between non-computational levels</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.09888</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.09888v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The fluxonium qubit has emerged as a promising candidate for superconducting quantum computing due to its long coherence times and high-fidelity gates. Nonetheless, further scaling up and improving performance remain critical challenges for establishing fluxoniums as a viable alternative to transmons. A key obstacle lies in developing scalable coupling architectures. In this work, we introduce a scalable fluxonium architecture that enables decoupling of qubit states while maintaining tunable couplings between non-computational states. Beyond the well-studied ZZ crosstalk, we identify that an always-on interaction involving non-computational levels can significantly degrade the fidelities of initialization, control, and readout in large systems, thereby impeding scalability. We demonstrate that this issue can be mitigated by implementing tunable couplings for fluxonium's plasmon transitions, meanwhile enabling fast, high-fidelity gates with passive ZZ suppression. Furthermore, since fluxonium transitions span multiple frequency octaves, we emphasize the importance of carefully designing coupling mechanisms and parameters to suppress residual interactions.</description>

      <title>Laser-induced spectral diffusion and excited-state mixing of silicon T centres</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.09908</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.09908v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: To find practical application as photon sources for entangled optical resource states or as spin-photon interfaces in entangled networks, semiconductor emitters must produce indistinguishable photons with high efficiency and spectral stability. Nanophotonic cavity integration increases efficiency and bandwidth, but it also introduces environmental charge instability and spectral diffusion. Among various candidates, silicon colour centres have emerged as compelling platforms for integrated-emitter quantum technologies. Here we investigate the dynamics of spectral wandering in nanophotonics-coupled, individual silicon T centres using spectral correlation measurements. We observe that spectral fluctuations are driven predominantly by the near-infrared excitation laser, consistent with a power-dependent Ornstein-Uhlenbeck process, and show that the spectrum is stable for up to 1.5 ms in the dark. We demonstrate a 35x narrowing of the emitter linewidth to 110 MHz using a resonance-check scheme and discuss the advantage for pairwise entanglement rates and optical resource state generators. Finally, we report laser-induced spin-mixing in the excited state and discuss potential mechanisms common to both phenomena. These effects must be considered in calibrating T centre devices for high-performance entanglement generation.</description>

      <title>All-optical Raman control of ultracold atomic hyperfine states using pulsed jump protocol</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.09921</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.09921v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We develop a pulse-driven jump protocol to achieve all-optical Raman control of ultracold atomic hyperfine states. By establishing general conditions for adiabatic evolution between quantum states in parameter space, we derive the essential pulse area and phase conditions necessary for quantum state transfer in a resonant single-$\Lambda$ three-level system. We extend this approach to a double-$\Lambda$ four-level system by incorporating a neighboring intermediate state, which leads to a single-photon detuned $\Lambda$ three-level system. Through numerical simulations of the ultracold $^{87}$Rb atomic system, we demonstrate that high-fidelity and robust control of quantum state transfer can be achieved in the single-$\Lambda$ three-level system using stimulated Raman adiabatic passage (STIRAP) and the pulsed jump protocol. Furthermore, we show that the destructive quantum interference effects between resonant and detuned Raman pathways in the double-$\Lambda$ four-level system can be mitigated by optimizing the pulse area and two-photon detuning parameters within the pulsed jump protocol. This work presents a promising approach for achieving all-optical Raman control of quantum state transfer in ultracold atomic hyperfine states.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2504.09957v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose a method for the programmable generation of time-frequency mode (TFM) encoded quantum states of light on the silicon-on-insulator (SOI) platform. The state generator consists of an N-tap finite impulse response filter and a Mach-Zehnder interferometer (MZI)-based coupled-ring resonator. Through numerical simulations, its capability of producing TFM-encoded maximally entangled states in two, three, and four dimensions is theoretically demonstrated, with fidelities of 0.950, 0.954, and 0.971, respectively.</description>

      <title>Collective Superradiance: Estimating the Peak Emission Rate and Time</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.09985</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.09985v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Determining the peak photon emission time and rate for an ensemble of $N$ quantum systems undergoing collective superradiant decay typically requires tracking the time evolution of the density operator, a process with computational costs scaling exponentially with $N$. We present compact, analytic formulas for evaluating the peak emission rate and time for initially fully excited quantum emitter ensembles, valid for any geometric configuration and emitter type. These formulas rely solely on the variance of the eigenvalues of a real symmetric $N \times N$ matrix, which describes collective dissipation. We demonstrate the versatility of these results across various environments, including free space, solid-state, and waveguide reservoirs. For large $N$ the formulas simplify further to depend on just two parameters: average nearest-neighbor spacing and emitter number. Finally, we present scaling laws and bounds on the spatial size of emitter ensembles, such that superradiance is maintained, independent of emitter number or density.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2504.09999v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Based on the realignment moments of density matrix, we study parameterized entanglement criteria for bipartite and multipartite states. By adjusting the different parameter values, our criterion can detect not only bound entangled states, but also non-positive partial transpose entangled states for bipartite quantum systems. Moreover, we propose the definition of multipartite realignment moments and generalize the result of bipartite systems to obtain a sufficient criterion to detect entanglement for multipartite quantum states in arbitrary dimensions. And we further improve the conclusion to obtain another new entanglement criterion. The new method can detect more entangled states than previous methods as backed by detailed examples.</description>

      <title>Quantum Squeezing Effects in Coupled van der Pol Oscillators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.10029</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.10029v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Achieving synchronized quantum states within the quantum realm is a significant goal. This regime is characterized by restricted excitation occurrences and a highly nonclassical stable state of the self-oscillating system. However, many existing approaches to observe synchronization in this quantum realm face a major challenge: the influence of noise tends to overshadow the synchronization phenomenon. In coupled van der Pol oscillators, synchronization occurs when a system of two or more oscillators interacts. Our investigation demonstrates that introducing the squeezing Hamiltonian in two coupled van der Pol oscillators enhances nonclassical effects, increases quantum correlations, and improves the robustness of synchronization dynamics. This was evidenced through the analysis of the Wigner function and power spectrum, showing significant improvements compared to systems without squeezing.</description>

      <title>The Security of Quantum Computing in 6G: from Technical Perspectives to Ethical Implications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.10040</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.10040v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum technologies hold promise as essential components for the upcoming deployment of the future 6G network. In this future network, the security and trustworthiness requirements are not considered fulfilled with the current state of the quantum computers, as the malicious behaviour on the part of the service provider towards the user may still be present. Therefore, this article provides an initial interdisciplinary work of regulations and solutions in the scope of trustworthy quantum computing for future 6G that can be viewed as complimentary regulations to the existing strategies shared by different actors of states and organizations. More precisely, we describe the importance of a reliable quantum service provider and its implication on the ethical aspects concerning digital sovereignty. By exploring the critical relationship between trustworthiness and digital sovereignty in the context of future 6G networks, we analyse a trade-off between accessibility to this new technology and preservation of digital sovereignty engaging in parallel the United Nation's (UN's) sustainable development goals. Furthermore, we propose a partnership model based on cooperation, coordination, and collaboration giving rise to a trusted, ethical, and inclusive quantum ecosystem, whose implications can spill over to the entire global scenario.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.10069</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.10069v2 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a relativistic quantum simulation framework for modeling hydrogen sulfide (H2S) decomposition relevant to hydrogen energy applications. The approach integrates Dirac-Coulomb relativistic quantum chemistry with the variational quantum eigensolver (VQE), implemented on a hybrid quantum-classical architecture. Using quantum algorithms based on Jordan-Wigner encoding and relativistic integrals, we simulate ground-state energies and potential energy surfaces for H2, H2O, and H2S molecules. Results demonstrate that the relativistic VQE correctly reproduces known energy shifts and molecular trends. Optimizer performance, energy variance, and Pauli term complexity are also evaluated. The findings offer insight into scalable quantum simulations of chemically and physically significant systems involving heavy atoms.</description>

      <title>Comparative Analysis of Quantum Support Vector Machines and Variational Quantum Classifiers for B-cell Epitope Prediction in Vaccine Design</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.10073</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.10073v2 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum computing offers new opportunities for addressing complex classification tasks in biomedical applications. This study investigates two quantum machine learning models-the Quantum Support Vector Machine (QSVM) and the Variational Quantum Classifier (VQC)-in the context of B-cell epitope prediction, a key step in modern vaccine design. QSVM builds upon the classical SVM framework by using quantum circuits to encode nonlinear kernel computations, while VQC replaces the entire classification pipeline with trainable quantum circuits optimized variationally.
  A benchmark dataset from the Immune Epitope Database (IEDB) is used for model evaluation. Each epitope is represented by 10 physicochemical features, and dimensionality reduction via Principal Component Analysis (PCA) is applied to assess model performance across different feature spaces. We also examine the effect of sample size on prediction outcomes.
  Experimental results show that QSVM performs well under limited data conditions, while VQC achieves higher accuracy in larger datasets. These findings highlight the potential of quantum-enhanced models for bioinformatics tasks, particularly in supporting efficient and scalable epitope-based vaccine development.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2504.10086v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Hartree-Fock-Rothaan equations are solved for He-like ions using the iterative self-consistent method. Bagci-Hoggan complete and orthonormal sets of exponential-type orbitals are employed as the basis. These orbitals satisfy the orthonormality relationship for quantum numbers with fractional order. They are solution of Schrodinger-like differential equation derived by the author. In a recent study conducted for the calculation of the hydrogen atom energy levels, it has been demonstrated that the fractional formalism of the principal and the angular momentum quantum numbers converges to the 1s level of the ground state energy of hydrogen atom, obtained from the solution of the standard Schrodinger equation. This study examines the effect of fractional values of the quantum numbers for two-electron systems, where electron correlation effects exist.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.10172</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.10172v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum state diffusion is a framework within which measurement may be described as the continuous and gradual collapse of a quantum system to an eigenstate as a result of interaction with its environment. The irreversible nature of the quantum trajectories that arise may be characterised by the environmental stochastic entropy production associated with the measurement. We consider a system of two spin 1/2 particles undergoing either single particle measurements or measurements of the total z-spin component S_{z}. The mean asymptotic rates of environmental stochastic entropy production associated with collapse can depend on the eigenstate of S_{z} selected, and on the initial state of the system, offering an additional avenue for characterising quantum measurement.</description>

      <title>Entanglement-Enabled Connectivity Bounds for Quantum Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.10186</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.10186v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the Quantum Internet, multipartite entanglement enables a new form of network connectivity, referred to as artificial connectivity namely and able to augment the physical connectivity with artificial links between pairs of nodes, without any additional physical link deployment. In this paper, by engineering such an artificial connectivity, we theoretically determine upper and lower bounds for the number of EPR pairs and GHZ states that can be extracted among nodes that are not adjacent in the artificial network topology. The aforementioned analysis is crucial, since the extraction of EPR pairs and GHZ states among remote nodes constitutes the resource primitives for on-demand and end-to-end communications. Indeed, within the paper, we not only determine whether a certain number of remote EPR pairs and GHZ states can be extracted, but we also provide the locations, namely the identities, of the nodes interconnected by such entangled resources. Thus, our analysis is far from being purely theoretical, rather it is constructive, since we provide the sequence of operations required for performing such extractions.</description>

      <title>A Novel Quantum Fourier Ordinary Differential Equation Solver for Solving Linear and Nonlinear Partial Differential Equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.10218</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.10218v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, a novel quantum Fourier ordinary differential equation (ODE) solver is proposed to solve both linear and nonlinear partial differential equations (PDEs). Traditional quantum ODE solvers transform a PDE into an ODE system via spatial discretization and then integrate it, thereby converting the task of solving the PDE into computing the integral for the driving function $f(x)$. These solvers rely on the quantum amplitude estimation algorithm, which requires the driving function $f(x)$ to be within the range of [0, 1] and necessitates the construction of a quantum circuit for the oracle R that encodes $f(x)$. This construction can be highly complex, even for simple functions like $f(x) = x$. An important exception arises for the specific case of $f(x) = sin^2(mx+c)$, which can be encoded more efficiently using a set of $Ry$ rotation gates. To address these challenges, we expand the driving function $f(x)$ as a Fourier series and propose the Quantum Fourier ODE Solver. This approach not only simplifies the construction of the oracle R but also removes the restriction that $f(x)$ must lie within [0,1]. The proposed method was evaluated by solving several representative linear and nonlinear PDEs, including the Navier-Stokes (N-S) equations. The results show that the quantum Fourier ODE solver produces results that closely match both analytical and reference solutions.</description>

      <title>Exponentially Decaying Quantum Simulation Error with Noisy Devices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.10247</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.10247v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum simulation is a promising way toward practical quantum advantage, but noise in current quantum hardware poses a significant obstacle. We theoretically and numerically revealed that not only the physical error but also the algorithmic error in a single Trotter step decreases exponentially with the circuit depth. In particular, according to our results, we derive the optimal number of Trotter steps and the noise requirement to guarantee total simulation precision. At last, we demonstrate that our improved error analysis leads to significant resource-saving for fault-tolerant Trotter simulation. By addressing these aspects, this work systematically characterizes the robustness of Trotter simulation errors in noisy quantum devices and paves the way toward practical quantum advantage.</description>

      <title>Dissipation-Induced Threshold on Integrability Footprints</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.10255</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.10255v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The presence of a dissipative environment disrupts the unitary spectrum of dynamical quantum maps. Nevertheless, key features of the underlying unitary dynamics -- such as their integrable or chaotic nature -- are not immediately erased by dissipation. To investigate this, we model dissipation as a convex combination of a unitary evolution and a random Kraus map, and study how signatures of integrability fade as dissipation strength increases. Our analysis shows that in the weakly dissipative regime, the complex eigenvalue spectrum organizes into well-defined, high-density clusters. We estimate the critical dissipation threshold beyond which these clusters disappear, rendering the dynamics indistinguishable from chaotic evolution. This threshold depends only on the number of spectral clusters and the rank of the random Kraus operator. To characterize this transition, we introduce the eigenvalue angular velocity as a diagnostic of integrability loss. We illustrate our findings through several integrable quantum circuits, including the dissipative quantum Fourier transform. Our results provide a quantitative picture of how noise gradually erases the footprints of integrability in open quantum systems.</description>

      <title>Cross-talk in superconducting qubit lattices with tunable couplers - comparing transmon and fluxonium architectures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.10298</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.10298v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Cross-talk between qubits is one of the main challenges for scaling superconducting quantum processors. Here, we use the density-matrix renormalization-group to numerically analyze lattices of superconducting qubits from a perspective of many-body localization. Specifically, we compare different architectures that include tunable couplers designed to decouple qubits in the idle state, and calculate the residual ZZ interactions as well as the inverse participation ratio in the computational basis states. For transmon qubits outside of the straddling regime, the results confirm that tunable C-shunt flux couplers are significantly more efficient in mitigating the ZZ interactions than tunable transmons. A recently proposed fluxonium architecture with tunable transmon couplers is demonstrated to also maintain its strong suppression of the ZZ interactions in larger systems, while having a higher inverse participation ratio in the computational basis states than lattices of transmon qubits. Our results thus suggest that fluxonium architectures may feature lower cross talk than transmon lattices when designed to achieve similar gate speeds and fidelities.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2504.10339v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent experiments demonstrate all-electric spinning of levitated nanodiamonds with embedded nitrogen-vacancy spins. Here, we argue that such gyroscopically stabilized spin rotors offer a promising platform for probing and exploiting quantum spin-rotation coupling of particles hosting a single spin degree of freedom. Specifically, we derive the effective Hamiltonian describing how an embedded spin affects the rotation of rapidly revolving quantum rotors due to the Einstein-de Haas and Barnett effects, which we use to devise experimental protocols for observing this coupling in state-of-the-art experiments. This will open the door for future exploitations of quantum spin rotors for superposition experiments with massive objects.</description>

Abstract: In a recent article [Phys. Rev. A 111, 022204 (2025)], Genovese and Piacentini analyzed recent experiments measuring what they call "the entire Bell-CHSH parameter". They claimed those experiments may have implications for interpreting loophole-fee tests of the Bell-CHSH inequality. We explain that the Bell-CHSH inequality is not based on the entire Bell parameter, so these experiments are unrelated to their empirical tests and cannot close eventual loopholes that still might persist. We point out that the physical meaning of these new experiments measuring the entire Bell parameter could be interpreted differently.</description>

      <title>Trapping potentials and quantum gates for microwave-dressed Rydberg atoms on an atom chip</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.10349</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.10349v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Rydberg atoms in static electric fields possess permanent dipole moments. When the atoms are close to a surface producing an inhomogeneous electric field, such as by the adsorbates on an atom chip, depending on the sign of the dipole moment of the Rydberg-Stark eigenstate, the atoms may experience a force towards or away from the surface. We show that by applying a bias electric field and coupling a desired Rydberg state by a microwave field of proper frequency to another Rydberg state with opposite sign of the dipole moment, we can create a trapping potential for the atom at a prescribed distance from the surface. Perfectly overlapping trapping potentials for several Rydberg states can also be created by multi-component microwave fields. A pair of such trapped Rydberg states of an atom can represent a qubit. Finally, we discuss an optimal realization of the swap gate between pairs of such atomic Rydberg qubits separated by a large distance but interacting with a common mode of a planar microwave resonator at finite temperature.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2504.10363v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Buhrman, Patro, and Speelman presented a framework of conjectures that together form a quantum analogue of the strong exponential-time hypothesis and its variants. They called it the QSETH framework. In this paper, using a notion of quantum natural proofs (built from natural proofs introduced by Razborov and Rudich), we show how part of the QSETH conjecture that requires properties to be `compression oblivious' can in many cases be replaced by assuming the existence of quantum-secure pseudorandom functions, a standard hardness assumption. Combined with techniques from Fourier analysis of Boolean functions, we show that properties such as PARITY and MAJORITY are compression oblivious for certain circuit class $\Lambda$ if subexponentially secure quantum pseudorandom functions exist in $\Lambda$, answering an open question in [Buhrman-Patro-Speelman 2021].</description>

      <title>Universal fault-tolerant logic with heterogeneous holographic codes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.10386</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.10386v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The study of holographic bulk-boundary dualities has led to the construction of novel quantum error correcting codes. Although these codes have shed new light on conceptual aspects of these dualities, they have widely been believed to lack a crucial feature of practical quantum error correction: The ability to support universal fault-tolerant quantum logic. In this work, we introduce a new class of holographic codes that realize this feature. These heterogeneous holographic codes are constructed by combining two seed codes in a tensor network on an alternating hyperbolic tiling. We show how this construction generalizes previous strategies for fault tolerance in tree-type concatenated codes, allowing one to implement non-Clifford gates fault-tolerantly on the holographic boundary. We also demonstrate that these codes allow for high erasure thresholds under a suitable heterogeneous combination of specific seed codes. Compared to previous concatenated codes, heterogeneous holographic codes achieve large overhead savings in physical qubits, e.g., a $21.8\%$ reduction for a two-layer Steane/quantum Reed-Muller combination. Unlike standard concatenated codes, we establish that the new codes can encode more than a single logical qubit per code block by applying ``black hole'' deformations with tunable rate and distance, while possessing fully addressable, universal fault-tolerant gate sets. Therefore, our work strengthens the case for the utility of holographic quantum codes for practical quantum computing.</description>

      <title>Quantum Liouvillian Tomography</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.10393v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Characterization of near-term quantum computing platforms requires the ability to capture and quantify dissipative effects. This is an inherently challenging task, as these effects are multifaceted, spanning a broad spectrum from Markovian to strongly non-Markovian dynamics. We introduce Quantum Liouvillian Tomography (QLT), a protocol to capture and quantify non-Markovian effects in time-continuous quantum dynamics. The protocol leverages gradient-based quantum process tomography to reconstruct dynamical maps and utilizes regression over the derivatives of Pauli string probability distributions to extract the Liouvillian governing the dynamics. We benchmark the protocol using synthetic data and quantify its accuracy in recovering Hamiltonians, jump operators, and dissipation rates for two-qubit systems. Finally, we apply QLT to analyze the evolution of an idling two-qubit system implemented on a superconducting quantum platform to extract characteristics of Hamiltonian and dissipative components and, as a result, detect inherently non-Markovian dynamics. Our work introduces the first protocol capable of retrieving generators of generic open quantum evolution from experimental data, thus enabling more precise characterization of many-body non-Markovian effects in near-term quantum computing platforms.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2504.10410v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Cold atoms can adsorb to a surface with the emission of a single phonon when the binding energy is sufficiently small. The effects of phonon damping and adsorbent size on the adsorption rate in this quantum regime are studied using the multimode Rabi model. It is demonstrated that the adsorption rate can be either enhanced or suppressed relative to the Fermi golden rule rate, in analogy to cavity effects in the spontaneous emission rate in QED. A mesoscopic-sized adsorbent behaves as an acoustic cavity that enhances the adsorption rate when tuned to the adsorption transition frequency and suppresses the rate when detuned. This acoustic cavity effect occurs in the regime where the frequency spacing between vibrational modes exceeds the phonon linewidth.</description>

      <title>Capacities of highly Markovian divisible quantum channels</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.10436</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.10436v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We analyze information transmission capacities of quantum channels acting on $d$-dimensional quantum systems that are highly Markovian divisible, i.e., channels of the form \begin{equation*}
  \Phi = \underbrace{\Psi\circ \Psi \circ \ldots \circ \Psi}_{l \,\operatorname{times}} \end{equation*} with $l \geq \gamma d^2 \log d$ for some constant $\gamma=\gamma(\Psi)$ that depends on the spectral gap of the dividing channel $\Psi$. We prove that capacities of such channels are approximately strongly additive and can be efficiently approximated in terms of the structure of their peripheral spaces. Furthermore, the quantum and private classical capacities of such channels approximately coincide and approximately satisfy the strong converse property. We show that these approximate results become exact for the corresponding zero-error capacities when $l \geq d^2$. To prove these results, we show that for any channel $\Psi$, the classical, private classical, and quantum capacities of $\Psi_\infty$, which is its so-called asymptotic part, satisfy the strong converse property and are strongly additive. In the zero-error case, we introduce the notion of the stabilized non-commutative confusability graph of a quantum channel and characterize its structure for any given channel.</description>

      <title>The stellar decomposition of Gaussian quantum states</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.10455</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.10455v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce the stellar decomposition, a novel method for characterizing non-Gaussian states produced by photon-counting measurements on Gaussian states. Given an (m+n)-mode Gaussian state G, we express it as an (m+n)-mode "Gaussian core state" G_core followed by a fixed m-mode Gaussian transformation T that only acts on the first m modes. The defining property of the Gaussian core state G_core is that measuring the last n of its modes in the photon-number basis leaves the first m modes on a finite Fock support, i.e. a core state. Since T is measurement-independent and G_core has an exact and finite Fock representation, this decomposition exactly describes all non-Gaussian states obtainable by projecting n modes of G onto the Fock basis. For pure states we prove that a physical pair (G_core, T) always exists with G_core pure and T unitary. For mixed states, we establish necessary and sufficient conditions for (G_core, T) to be a Gaussian mixed state and a Gaussian channel. Finally, we develop a semidefinite program to extract the "largest" possible Gaussian channel when these conditions fail. The stellar decomposition leads to practical bounds on achievable state quality in photonic circuits and for GKP state generation in particular. Our results are based on a new characterization of Gaussian completely positive maps in the Bargmann picture, which may be of independent interest. As a result, this work provides novel tools for improved simulations of quantum optical systems, and for understanding the generation of non-Gaussian resource states.</description>

      <title>Quantum Barcodes: Persistent Homology for Quantum Phase Transitions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.10468</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.10468v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce "quantum barcodes," a theoretical framework that applies persistent homology to classify topological phases in quantum many-body systems. By mapping quantum states to classical data points through strategic observable measurements, we create a "quantum state cloud" analyzable via persistent homology techniques. Our framework establishes that quantum systems in the same topological phase exhibit consistent barcode representations with shared persistent homology groups over characteristic intervals. We prove that quantum phase transitions manifest as significant changes in these persistent homology features, detectable through discontinuities in the persistent Dirac operator spectrum. Using the SSH model as a demonstrative example, we show how our approach successfully identifies the topological phase transition and distinguishes between trivial and topological phases. While primarily developed for symmetry-protected topological phases, our framework provides a mathematical connection between persistent homology and quantum topology, offering new methods for phase classification that complement traditional invariant-based approaches.</description>

      <title>Twist-Induced Effects on Weyl Pairs in Magnetized Graphene Nanoribbons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.08789</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.08789v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper presents an analytical investigation into the dynamics of Weyl pairs within magnetized helicoidal graphene nanoribbons. By embedding a curved surface into flat Minkowski space-time, we derive a fully covariant two-body Dirac equation specific to this system. We begin by formulating a non-perturbative wave equation that governs the relative motion of the Weyl pairs and obtain exact solutions. Our results demonstrate the influence of the uniform magnetic field and the number of twists on the dynamics of Weyl pairs in graphene nanoribbons, providing precise energy values that lay a robust foundation for future research. Furthermore, we examine the material's response to perturbation fields by calculating the polarization function and investigating how twisting and magnetic fields affect this response. Our findings indicate that, in principle, the material's properties, which are crucial for practical applications, can be effectively controlled by precisely tuning the magnetic field and the number of twists in graphene nanoribbons.</description>

      <title>Tuning Charge Density Wave in the Transition from Magnetically Frustrated Conductor to Ferrimagnetic Insulator in Carbon Nanowire within Boron Nitride Nanotube</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.08830</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.08830v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The emergence of exotic charge density wave (CDW) alongside ferrimagnetism materials opens exciting new possibilities for quantum switching, particularly in field-tuning CDW electronics. However, these two phenomena often compete and rely heavily on strong electronic correlations. While carbon nanowire arrays have been experimentally shown to exhibit ferromagnetism above 400 K, our research shows that encapsulating a linear carbon chain (LCC) within zigzag boron nitride nanotubes (BNT) induces a short-range CDW state under a competing effect of ferrimagnetism and magnetic frustrations. However, for this exotic feature to occur, the LCC needs to break the symmetry along the circular plane of the BNT. Then we utilize a Monte Carlo model to identify the optimal length of LCC@BNT to tackle its size effect, while also comparing the stability of chains provided by carbon nanotubes. The shorter LCC@BNT displays a more prominent long-range CDW pattern with a tunneling barrier of 2.3 eV on the Fermi surface, transitioning into an unconventional insulator. Meanwhile, magnetic frustrations disappear, and ferrimagnetism remains stable up to 280 K. Our discovery of ferrimagnetic CDW carbyne insulators, which function without conventional periodic lattice distortion, spin-orbit coupling, or complex d and f hybridization represents a groundbreaking shift in thinking, which demonstrates that such exotic properties are not exclusive to transition metal elements. We anticipate that spin fluctuations in LCC@BNT could enable fine-tuning of the CDW pattern, and applying an electric excitation of 2.3 eV triggers an abrupt insulator-to-conductor transition for quantum switching applications.</description>

      <title>The temperature dependent thermal vector potential in spinor Boltzmann equation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.08845v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The thermal scalar and vector potential were introduced to investigate the thermal transport under a temperature gradient in terms of linear response theory[1,2]. However, the microscopic origin of these phenomenological thermal potentials had not been addressed clearly. In this manuscript, we try to derive a temperature dependent damping force based on the spinor Boltzmann equation (SBE), and relate it with the thermal gauge potential, which is exactly the temperature dependent thermal scalar and vector potential. It is shown that the thermal potential originates from the scattering of conduction electrons and impurity or other scattering mechanisms. We also derive a temperature dependent inverse relaxation time, which depends on momentum, it is different from the usual constant relaxation time. We evaluate the temperature dependent damping force by an approximated analytical solution of SBE. The other physical observable such as charge current and spin current are also explored.</description>

      <title>Measurement-induced phase transitions in quantum inference problems and quantum hidden Markov models</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.08888v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recently, there is interest in coincident 'sharpening' and 'learnability' transitions in monitored quantum systems. In the latter, an outside observer's ability to infer properties of a quantum system from measurements undergoes a phase transition. Such transitions appear to be related to the decodability transition in quantum error correction, but the precise connection is not clear. Here, we study these problems under one framework we call the general quantum inference problem. In cases as above where the system has a Markov structure, we say that the inference is on a quantum hidden Markov model. We show a formal connection to classical hidden Markov models and that they coincide for certain setups. For example, we prove this for those involving Haar-random unitaries and measurements. We introduce the notion of Bayes non-optimality, where parameters used for inference differs from true ones. This allows us to expand the phase diagrams of above models. At Bayes optimality, we obtain an explicit relation between 'sharpening' and 'learnability' order parameters, explicitly showing that the two transitions coincide. Next, we study concrete examples. We review quantum error correction on the toric and repetition code and their mapping to 2D random-bond Ising model (RBIM) through our framework. We study the Haar-random U(1)-symmetric monitored quantum circuit and tree, mapping each to inference models that we call the planted SSEP and planted XOR, respectively, and expanding the phase diagram to Bayes non-optimality. For the circuit, we deduce the phase boundary numerically and analytically argue that it is of a single universality class. For the tree, we present an exact solution of the entire phase boundary, which displays re-entrance as does the 2D RBIM. We discuss these phase diagrams, with their interpretations for quantum inference problems and rigorous arguments on their shapes.</description>

      <title>Tunable Magnon Polaritons via Eddy-Current-Induced Dissipation in Metallic-Banded YIG Spheres</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.08917</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.08917v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We demonstrate a robust method to dynamically tune magnon dissipation in yttrium iron garnet spheres by equipping a metallic band around the sphere's equator, enabling precise control over magnon-photon coupling states. The collective magnetization dynamics in the YIG sphere induce circular eddy currents in the metallic band, whose magnitude can be systematically varied by adjusting the angle between the metallic band plane and an external static magnetic field. This angular dependence yields a pronounced modulation of the ferromagnetic resonance (FMR) linewidth, facilitating seamless transitions between the Purcell and strong coupling regimes without altering photon cavity parameters. Systematic FMR and cavity spectroscopy measurements confirm that eddy-current-induced losses govern the primary mechanism behind the observed tunable damping. By achieving extensive periodic-angular dependence of magnon relaxation rate, we precisely control the magnon-photon coupling state, approaching the critical coupling condition. These results establish the YIG-metallic-band platform as a versatile and practical approach for engineering tunable magnon-polariton systems and advancing magnonic applications, including those exploring non-Hermitian magnonics.</description>

      <title>Observability of Acausal and Uncorrelated Optical-Quasar Pairs for Quantum-Mechanical Experiments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.08928</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.08928v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Viewing high-redshift sources at near-opposite directions on the sky can assure, by light-travel-time arguments, acausality between their emitted photons. One utility would be true random-number generation, by sensing these via two independent telescopes that each flip a switch based on those latest-arrived colours; for example, to autonomously control a quantum-mechanical (QM) experiment. Although demonstrated with distant quasars, those were not fully acausal pairs, which are restricted in simultaneous view from the ground at any single observatory. In optical light such faint sources also require large telescope aperture to avoid sampling assumptions when imaged at fast camera framerates: either unsensed intrinsic correlations between them or equivalently-correlated noise may ruin the expectation of pure randomness. One such case which could spoil a QM test is considered. Based on that, allowed geometries and instrumental limits are modelled for any two ground-based sites, and their data simulated. To compare, an analysis of photometry from the Gemini twin 8-m telescopes is presented, using archival data of well-separated bright stars, obtained with the instruments 'Alopeke (on Gemini-North in Hawai'i) and Zorro (on Gemini-South in Chile) simultaneously in two bands (centred at 562 nm and 832 nm) with 17 Hz framerate. No flux correlation is found, calibrating an analytic model, predicting where a search at signal-to-noise over 50 at 50 Hz with the same instrumentation can be made. Finally, the software PDQ (Predict Different Quasars) is presented which searches a large catalogue of known quasars, reporting those with brightness and visibility suitable to verify acausal, uncorrelated photons at those limits.</description>

      <title>Heatpipe-cooled in-vacuum electromagnet for quantum science experiment</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.08931v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Quantum inertial sensors test general relativity, measure fundamental constants, and probe dark matter and dark energy in the laboratory with outstanding accuracy. Their precision relies heavily on carefully choreographed quantum control of the atomic states with a collection of lasers, microwaves, electric and magnetic fields. Making this technology available outside of the laboratory would unlock many applications, such as geophysics, geodesy and inertial navigation. However, this requires an apparatus of reduced size, weight, power use and increased robustness, modularity and ease-of-use. Here, we describe the design and implementation of an in-vacuum electromagnet able to create the magnetic fields necessary for various quantum control operations, such as magneto-optical trapping or magnetic levitation to assist evaporative cooling. Placing the electromagnet inside the vacuum chamber has significant advantages, such as fast switching times that are not limited by induced current inside the vacuum chamber metal, reduced size, weight and power usage. However, dissipating the heat produced typically requires complex designs that include bulky metal heatsinks or cooling using water or cryogens. Our design implements heatpipes in a compact, low-vibration and robust apparatus, which use a phase transition in the working fluid to achieve thermal conductivity that is more than one hundred times larger than that of typical bulk metal. We show that the setup can conduct more than 50 W of thermal power in a configuration that provides ample optical access and is compatible with the ultra-high vacuum requirements of atomic and molecular experiments.</description>

      <title>From spin to pseudospin symmetry: The origin of magic numbers in nuclear structure</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.09148</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.09148v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Magic numbers lie at the heart of nuclear structure, reflecting enhanced stability in nuclei with closed shells. While the emergence of magic numbers beyond 20 is commonly attributed to strong spin-orbit coupling, the microscopic origin of the spin-orbit potential remains elusive, owing to its dependence on the resolution scale and renormalization scheme of nuclear forces. Here, we investigate the evolution of shell structure with varying momentum resolution in nuclear interactions derived from chiral effective field theory, using the similarity renormalization group, which provides a fundamental framework for linking different scales. We uncover a universal transition from spin symmetry to pseudospin symmetry as the resolution scale decreases, during which magic numbers emerge naturally. A similar pattern is found in calculations using relativistic one-boson-exchange potentials, underscoring the robustness of the phenomenon. This work establishes a direct connection between realistic nuclear forces with a high resolution scale and effective nuclear forces at coarse-grained scales, offering a first-principles explanation for the origin of magic numbers and pseudospin symmetry in nuclear shell structure, and new insights into the structure of exotic nuclei far from stability.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2504.09234v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Dynamic quantum circuits enable adaptive operations through intermediate measurements and classical feedback. Current transpilation toolchains, such as Qiskit and T$\ket{\text{ket}}$, however, fail to fully exploit branch-specific simplifications. In this work, we propose recursive branch expansion as a novel technique which systematically expands and refines conditional branches. Our method complements existing transpilers by creating additional opportunities for branch-specific simplifications without altering the overall circuit functionality. Using randomly generated circuits with varying patterns and scales, we demonstrate that our method consistently reduces the depth and gate count of execution paths of dynamic circuits. We also showcase the potential of our method to enable optimizations on error-corrected circuits.</description>

      <title>Voltage and power-frequency electric field measurements with Rydberg-atom interferometry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.09531</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.09531v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a Rydberg-atom interferometry-based technique for voltage measurement between electrodes embedded in an atomic vapor cell, enabling the detection of weak voltages ($&lt;0.1$V) and unambiguous discrimination between positive and negative polarities. This makes up for the shortcomings of measurements based on the Stark effect, which suffer from quadratic field dependence (limiting sensitivity in weak-field regimes) and incapable of distinguishing the electric field direction. Furthermore, this method extends naturally to power-frequency (PF) electric field measurements by exploiting the quasi-static approximation-valid given the PF field's characteristic timescale ($\sim10^{-2}$s) vastly exceeds the interferometric measurement duration ($\sim10^{-6}$s). Crucially, our protocol provides instantaneous PF field reconstruction, providing comprehensive information including amplitude, frequency and phase. These advancements have direct implications for traceable voltage measurements and non-invasive characterization of PF fields near high-voltage infrastructure.</description>

      <title>Subwavelength micromachined vapor-cell based Rydberg sensing</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.09559v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In recent years, micromachined vapor cells have been revolutionizing the field of chip-scale quantum sensors such as magnetometers and atomic clocks. In parallel, Rydberg atomic quantum sensing has emerged as a powerful technique for broadband, non-invasive, and ultra-sensitive electrometry. Yet, to date, Rydberg sensing has largely been limited to glass-blown, cm-scale vapor cells. Here, we perform Rydberg spectroscopy using a wafer-scale fabricated Pyrex-Si-Pyrex cell with mm-scale dimensions. The Rydberg spectroscopic line is characterized with respect to critical parameters such as temperature, the frequency and amplitude of the applied radiofrequency field, light intensity, and the spatial position of atom interrogation. Our study reveals lineshapes directly influenced by a complex landscape of electrostatic fields with values up to approximately $0.6\ \mathrm{V/cm}$. By controlling key parameters, we were able to reduce the effect of these internal electric fields and demonstrate the detection of RF fields with a sensitivity as low as $10\ \mu\mathrm{V/cm}$. These results highlight the potential of micromachined vapor cells for sub-wavelength electromagnetic field measurements, with applications in communications, near-field RF imaging, and chip-scale quantum technologies.</description>

      <title>Q-ball mechanism of electron transport properties of high-T$_c$ superconductors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.09610</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.09610v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Proposed recently by the author Q-ball mechanism of the pseudogap state and high-Tc superconductivity in cuprates (2022) was supported by micro X-ray diffraction data in HgBa$_2$CuO$_{4+y}$ (2023). In the present paper it is demonstrated that T-linear temperature dependence of electrical resistivity arises naturally in the Q-ball gas phase, that may explain corresponding experimental data in the "strange metal" phase of high-T$_c$ cuprates, as reviewed by Barisic et al. (2013). In the present theory it arises due to scattering of electrons on the Q-balls gas of condensed charge/spin fluctuations. Close to the lowest temperature boundary of the "strange metal" phase, at which Q-ball radius diverges, electrical resistivity caused by a slide of the Q-balls as a whole is calculated using fluctuation paraconductivity calculation method by Alex Abrikosov (1987). The diamagnetic response of Q-balls gas is calculated as well and shows good accord with experimental data by L.Li et al. (2010) in the "strange metal" phase. In total, obtained results demonstrate different properties of the correlated electrons systems that arise due to formation of Q-balls possessing internal bosonic frequency $\Omega=2\pi nT$ in Matsubara time and, thus, forming the quantum thermodynamic time polycrystals. Presented theory may give a clue concerning a possible mechanism of the experimentally measured properties of high-T$_c$ cuprates in the "strange metal" phase of their phase diagram. We believe , these results provide support to the quantum thermodynamic time crystal model of the Euclidean Q-balls considered in the present paper.</description>

Abstract: We study the finite-temperature dynamics of non-interacting bosons with a single static spinful impurity immersed. A non-zero contact boson-impurity pairwise interaction is assumed only for the spin-up impurity state. By tracing out bosonic degrees of freedom, the exact time evolution of the impurity spin is calculated for pure and mixed initial ensembles of states. The time-dependent momentum distribution of bosons initially created in the Bose condensed state and driven by the interaction with spin is analyzed.</description>

      <title>Beyond Spin: Torsion-Driven Nonlinearity in Spinless Quantum Mechanics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.09698</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.09698v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a novel stochastic variational method (SVM) for quantizing non-relativistic spinless particles in curved spaces with torsion. Unlike canonical quantization, this approach is naturally suited for quantization in general coordinate systems and shows that torsion, typically associated with spin, can influence the quantum dynamics of spinless particles through quantum fluctuations. In a flat space, this torsion-induced effect appears as a logarithmic nonlinearity in the Schroedinger equation, which is relevant to studies of solitons, wave function collapse, and possible modifications to conventional quantum mechanics. Since torsion arises in various modified gravity theories, particularly those related to the early universe and dark matter, our findings suggest a new mechanism through which such effects may impact quantum behavior. We also provide a rough estimate for the upper bound of the torsion magnitude.</description>

Abstract: We present a method for probing the quantum capacitance associated with the Rydberg transition of surface electrons on liquid helium using RF reflectometry. Excitation to Rydberg states induces a redistribution of image charges on capacitively coupled electrodes, giving rise to a quantum capacitance. By applying frequency-modulated resonant microwaves to drive the Rydberg transition, we systematically measured a capacitance sensitivity of 0.38~aF/$\sqrt{\mathrm{Hz}}$. This level of sensitivity is sufficient to resolve the Rydberg transition of a single electron, providing a scalable pathway toward the implementation of qubit readout schemes based on surface electrons on helium.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2504.09916v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: One-dimensional scattering of a wave packet of a relativistic fermion under a temporally oscillating electric field superimposed on a potential step is discussed by using the Furry-picture perturbation theory, where the oscillating electric field is treated as a perturbation. Reflection and transmission probabilities of the wave packet, which in its single-mode limit are consistent with those in the stationary scattering off the potential step alone, are investigated up to the second order. We show that even in the absence of the so-called Klein region, a positive-frequency incoming wave can penetrate the negative-frequency region below the potential step by emitting its energy to the oscillating electric field with a finite tunneling probability.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2504.10098v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the reduced density matrices obtained for the quantum states in the context of 3d Chern-Simons theory with gauge group SU(2) and Chern-Simons level $k$. We focus on the quantum states associated with the $T_{p,p}$ torus link complements, which is a $p$-party pure quantum state. The reduced density matrices are obtained by taking the $(1|p-1)$ bi-partition of the total system. We show that the characteristic polynomials of these reduced density matrices are monic polynomials with rational coefficients.</description>

      <title>Universality, Robustness, and Limits of the Eigenstate Thermalization Hypothesis in Open Quantum Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.10261</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.10261v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The eigenstate thermalization hypothesis (ETH) underpins much of our modern understanding of the thermalization of closed quantum many-body systems. Here, we investigate the statistical properties of observables in the eigenbasis of the Lindbladian operator of a Markovian open quantum system. We demonstrate the validity of a Lindbladian ETH ansatz through extensive numerical simulations of several physical models. To highlight the robustness of Lindbladian ETH, we consider what we dub the dilute-click regime of the model, in which one postselects only quantum trajectories with a finite fraction of quantum jumps. The average dynamics are generated by a non-trace-preserving Liouvillian, and we show that the Lindbladian ETH ansatz still holds in this case. On the other hand, the no-click limit is a singular point at which the Lindbladian reduces to a doubled non-Hermitian Hamiltonian and Lindbladian ETH breaks down.</description>

      <title>Out of the box approach to Black hole Information paradox</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.10429v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Suppose a black hole forms from a pure quantum state $\ket{\psi}$. The black hole information loss paradox arises from semiclassical arguments suggesting that, even in a closed system, the process of black hole formation and evaporation evolves a pure state into a mixed state. Resolution to the paradox typically demands violation of quantum mechanics or relativity in domains where they should hold. Instead, I propose that in a complete theory of quantum gravity, any region $\mathcal{U}$ that could collapse into a black hole should already be described by a mixed state, thus bypassing the paradox entirely. To that end, I present a model in which the universe is in a quantum error-corrected state, such that any local black hole appears mixed and encodes no information locally.</description>

      <title>Donor-Acceptor Pairs near Silicon Carbide surfaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.10476</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.10476v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Donor-acceptor pairs (DAPs) in wide-bandgap semiconductors are promising platforms for the realization of quantum technologies, due to their optically controllable, long-range dipolar interactions. Specifically, Al-N DAPs in bulk silicon carbide (SiC) have been predicted to enable coherent coupling over distances exceeding 10 nm. However, their practical implementations require an understanding of the properties of these pairs near surfaces and interfaces. Here, using first principles calculations we investigate how the presence of surfaces influence the stability and optical properties of Al-N DAPs in SiC, and we show that they retain favorable optical properties comparable to their bulk counterparts, despite a slight increase in electron-phonon coupling. Furthermore, we introduce the concept of surface-defect pairs (SDPs), where an electron-hole pair is generated between a near-surface defect and an occupied surface state located in the bandgap of the material. We show that vanadium-based SDPs near OH-terminated 4H-SiC surfaces exhibit dipoles naturally aligned perpendicular to the surface, greatly enhancing dipole-dipole coupling between SDPs. Our results also reveal significant polarization-dependent modulation in the stimulated emission and photoionization cross sections of V-based SDPs, which are tunable by two orders of magnitude via the polarization angle of the incident laser light. The near-surface defects investigated here provide novel possibilities for the development of hybrid quantum-classical interfaces, as they can be used to mediate information transfer between quantum nodes and integrated photonic circuits.</description>

Abstract: We show that the proof of the generalised quantum Stein's lemma [Brand\~ao &amp; Plenio, Commun. Math. Phys. 295, 791 (2010)] is not correct due to a gap in the argument leading to Lemma III.9. Hence, the main achievability result of Brand\~ao &amp; Plenio is not known to hold. This puts into question a number of established results in the literature, in particular the reversibility of quantum entanglement [Brand\~ao &amp; Plenio, Commun. Math. Phys. 295, 829 (2010); Nat. Phys. 4, 873 (2008)] and of general quantum resources [Brand\~ao &amp; Gour, Phys. Rev. Lett. 115, 070503 (2015)] under asymptotically resource non-generating operations. We discuss potential ways to recover variants of the newly unsettled results using other approaches.</description>

Abstract: We study the performance of quantum thermal machines in which the working fluid of the model is represented by a many-body quantum system that is periodically connected with external baths via local couplings. A formal characterization of the limit cycles of the set-up is presented in terms of the mixing properties of the quantum channel that describes the evolution of the fluid over a thermodynamic cycle. For the special case in which the system is a collection of spin 1/2 particles coupled via magnetization preserving Hamiltonians, a full characterization of the possible operational regimes (i.e., thermal engine, refrigerator, heater and thermal accelerator) is provided: in this context we show in fact that the different regimes only depend upon a limited number of parameters (essentially the ratios of the energy gaps associated with the local Hamiltonians of the parts of the network which are in direct thermal contact with the baths).</description>

Abstract: This paper introduces the foliage partition, an easy-to-compute LC-invariant for graph states, of computational complexity $\mathcal{O}(n^3)$ in the number of qubits. Inspired by the foliage of a graph, our invariant has a natural graphical representation in terms of leaves, axils, and twins. It captures both, the connection structure of a graph and the $2$-body marginal properties of the associated graph state. We relate the foliage partition to the size of LC-orbits and use it to bound the number of LC-automorphisms of graphs. We also show the invariance of the foliage partition when generalized to weighted graphs and qudit graph states.</description>

      <title>A method of approximation of discrete Schr\"odinger equation with the normalized Laplacian by discrete-time quantum walk on graphs</title>

      <description>arXiv:2308.13741v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We propose a class of continuous-time quantum walk models on graphs induced by a certain class of discrete-time quantum walk models with the parameter $\epsilon\in [0,1]$. Here the graph treated in this paper can be applied both finite and infinite cases. The induced continuous-time quantum walk is an extended version of the (free) discrete-Schr\"odinger equation driven by the normalized Laplacian: the element of the weighted Hermitian takes not only a scalar value but also a matrix value depending on the underlying discrete-time quantum walk. We show that each discrete-time quantum walk with an appropriate setting of the parameter $\epsilon$ in the long time limit identifies with its induced continuous-time quantum walk and give the running time for the discrete-time to approximate the induced continuous-time quantum walk with a small error $\delta$. We also investigate the detailed spectral information on the induced continuous-time quantum walk.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2310.05635v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Thermalization phenomena, while ubiquitous in quantum systems, have traditionally been viewed as obstacles to be mitigated. In this study, we demonstrate the ability, instead, to harness thermalization to dynamically engineer and stabilize structured quantum states in a mesoscopically large ensemble of spins. Specifically, we showcase the capacity to generate, control, stabilize, and read out 'shell-like' spin texture with interacting $ {}^{ 13}\mathrm{C}$ nuclear spins in diamond, wherein spins are polarized oppositely on either side of a critical radius. The texture spans several nanometers and encompasses many hundred spins. We capitalize on the thermalization process to impose a quasi-equilibrium upon the generated texture; as a result, it is highly stable, immune to spin diffusion, and endures over multiple-minute long periods -- over a million times longer than the intrinsic interaction scale of the spins. Additionally, the texture is created and interrogated without locally controlling or probing the nuclear spins. These features are accomplished using an electron spin as a nanoscale injector of spin polarization, and employing it as a source of spatially varying dissipation, allowing for serial readout of the emergent spin texture. Long-time stabilization is achieved via prethermalization to a Floquet-induced Hamiltonian under the electronic gradient field. Our work presents a new approach to robust nanoscale spin state engineering and paves the way for new applications in quantum simulation, quantum information science, and nanoscale imaging.</description>

      <title>$\mathcal{PT}$-symmetric mapping of three states and its implementation on a cloud quantum processor</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.16680</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.16680v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: $\mathcal{PT}$-symmetric systems have garnered significant attention due to their unconventional properties. Despite the growing interest, there remains an ongoing debate about whether these systems outperform their Hermitian counterparts in practical applications, and if so, by what metrics this performance should be measured. We developed $\mathcal{PT}$-symmetric approach for mapping $N = 3$ pure qubit states to address this, implemented it using the dilation method, and demonstrated it on a superconducting quantum processor from the IBM Quantum Experience. For the first time, we derived exact expressions for the population of the post-selected $\mathcal{PT}$-symmetric subspace for both $N = 2$ and $N = 3$ states. When applied to the discrimination of $N = 2$ pure states, our algorithm provides an equivalent result to the conventional unambiguous quantum state discrimination. For $N = 3$ states, our approach introduces novel capabilities not available in traditional Hermitian systems, enabling the transformation of an arbitrary set of three pure quantum states into another, at the cost of introducing an inconclusive outcome. Our algorithm has the same error rate for the attack on the three-state QKD protocol as the conventional minimum error, maximum confidence, and maximum mutual information strategies. For post-selected quantum metrology, our results provide precise conditions where $\mathcal{PT}$-symmetric quantum sensors outperform their Hermitian counterparts in terms of information-cost rate. Combined with punctuated unstructured quantum database search, our method significantly reduces the qubit readout requirements at the cost of adding an ancilla, while maintaining the same average number of oracle calls as the original punctuated Grover's algorithm. Our work opens new pathways for applying $\mathcal{PT}$ symmetry in quantum communications, computing, and cryptography.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2401.15066v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The use of higher-dimensional photonic encodings (qudits) instead of two-dimensional encodings (qubits) can improve the loss tolerance and reduce the computational resources of photonic-based quantum information processing. To harness this potential, efficient schemes for entangling operations such as the high-dimensional generalization of a linear optics Bell measurement will be required. We show how an efficient high-dimensional entangled state analyzer can be implemented with a linear optics interferometer and auxiliary photonic states. The degree of entanglement of the auxiliary state is much less than in previous protocols as quantified by an exponentially smaller Schmidt rank. In addition, the auxiliary state only occupies a single spatial mode, allowing it to be generated deterministically from a single quantum emitter coupled to a small qubit register. The reduced complexity of the auxiliary states results in a high robustness to imperfections and we show that auxiliary states with fidelities above 0.9 for qudit dimensions 4 can be generated in the presence of qubit error rates on the order of 10%. This paves the way for experimental demonstrations with current hardware.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2401.16781v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Bosonic pure-loss channel, which represents the process of photons decaying into a vacuum environment, has zero quantum capacity when the channel's transmissivity is less than 50%. Modeled as a beam splitter interaction between the system and its environment, the performance of bosonic pure-loss channel can be enhanced by controlling the environment state. We show that by choosing the ideal Gottesman-Kitaev-Preskill (GKP) states for the system and its environment, perfect transmission of quantum information through a beam splitter is achievable at arbitrarily low transmissivities. Our explicit constructions allow for experimental demonstration of the improved performance of a quantum channel through passive environment assistance, which is potentially useful for quantum transduction where the environment state can be naturally controlled. In practice, it is crucial to consider finite-energy constraints, and high-fidelity quantum communication through a beam splitter remains achievable with GKP states at the few-photon level.</description>

Abstract: In this work, we study the complexity of graph-state preparation. We consider general quantum algorithms consisting of Clifford operations acting on at most two qubits for graph-state preparations. We define the CZ-complexity of a graph state $|G\rangle$ as the minimum number of two-qubit Clifford operations (excluding single-qubit Clifford operations) for generating $|G\rangle$ from a trivial state $|0\rangle^{\otimes n}$. We first prove that a graph state $|G\rangle$ is generated by at most $t$ two-qubit Clifford operations if and only if $|G\rangle$ is generated by at most $t$ controlled-Z (CZ) operations. We next prove that a graph state $|G\rangle$ is generated from another graph state $|H\rangle$ by $t$ CZ operations if and only if the graph $G$ is generated from $H$ by some combinatorial graph transformation with cost $t$. As the main results, we show a connection between the CZ-complexity of graph state $|G\rangle$ and the rank-width of the graph $G$. Indeed, we prove that for any graph $G$ with $n$ vertices and rank-width $r$,
  1. The CZ-complexity of $|G\rangle$ is $O(rn)$.
  2. If $G$ is connected, the CZ-complexity of $|G\rangle$ is at least $n + r - 2$.
  We also demonstrate the existence of graph states whose CZ-complexities are close to the upper and lower bounds. Finally, we present quantum algorithms for preparing graph states for three specific graph classes related to intervals: interval graphs, interval containment graphs, and circle graphs. We prove that the CZ-complexity is $O(n)$ for interval graphs, and $O(n\log n)$ for both interval containment graphs and circle graphs.</description>

Abstract: Classification is a central task in deep learning algorithms. Usually, images are first captured and then processed by a sequence of operations, of which the artificial neuron represents one of the fundamental units. This paradigm requires significant resources that scale (at least) linearly in the image resolution, both in terms of photons and computational operations. Here, we present a quantum optical pattern recognition method for binary classification tasks. It classifies objects without reconstructing their images, using the rate of two-photon coincidences at the output of a Hong-Ou-Mandel interferometer, where both the input and the classifier parameters are encoded into single-photon states. Our method exhibits the behaviour of a classical neuron of unit depth. Once trained, it shows a constant $\mathcal{O}(1)$ complexity in the number of computational operations and photons required by a single classification. This is a superexponential advantage over a classical artificial neuron.</description>

      <title>Positive and non-positive measurements in energy extraction from quantum batteries</title>

Abstract: We extend the concept of stochastic energy extraction from quantum batteries to the scenario where both positive operator-valued (POV) and physically realizable non-positive operator-valued measurements (NPOVMs) are applied on the auxiliary connected to the battery in presence of noise. The process involves joint evolution of the battery and the auxiliary, an interaction of the auxiliary with its environment which induces noise in the auxiliary, and performing a POVM or NPOVM on the auxiliary, and finally the selection of a particular measurement outcome. Application of POVM on the auxiliary can be realized by attaching an external system to the auxiliary, which is initially in a product state with the rest of the system, and performing a joint projective measurement on the auxiliary and external. On the other hand, NPOVMs can be performed in two ways: if there are interactions leading to correlations among the auxiliary and environment, then performing a projective measurement on the auxiliary environment system can be interpreted as a physically realizable NPOVM on the auxiliary. Moreover, if there exists interaction among auxiliary, environment and external initially then the global measurement on the auxiliary, environment and external is also effectively an NPOVM on the auxiliary. We find the expressions of the maximum stochastically extractable energy by performing POVMs and NPOVMs of both types on the auxiliary and show that the latter does not depend on the applied noise. Focusing on a particular model of a battery, auxiliary, environment, and external, all being qubits, we show that stochastically extractable energy by POVMs is less than or equal to the same by type-1 NPOVM under various noise models. We additionally consider the case when a limited set of measurement operators is allowed and compare the accessible energy using these restricted set of POVM and NPOVM of type-1.</description>

      <title>Q-Newton: Hybrid Quantum-Classical Scheduling for Accelerating Neural Network Training with Newton's Gradient Descent</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.00252</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.00252v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Optimization techniques in deep learning are predominantly led by first-order gradient methodologies, such as SGD. However, neural network training can greatly benefit from the rapid convergence characteristics of second-order optimization. Newton's GD stands out in this category, by rescaling the gradient using the inverse Hessian. Nevertheless, one of its major bottlenecks is matrix inversion, which is notably time-consuming in $O(N^3)$ time with weak scalability.
  Matrix inversion can be translated into solving a series of linear equations. Given that quantum linear solver algorithms (QLSAs), leveraging the principles of quantum superposition and entanglement, can operate within a $\text{polylog}(N)$ time frame, they present a promising approach with exponential acceleration. Specifically, one of the most recent QLSAs demonstrates a complexity scaling of $O(d\cdot\kappa \log(N\cdot\kappa/\epsilon))$, depending on: {size~$N$, condition number~$\kappa$, error tolerance~$\epsilon$, quantum oracle sparsity~$d$} of the matrix. However, this also implies that their potential exponential advantage may be hindered by certain properties (i.e. $\kappa$ and $d$).
  We propose Q-Newton, a hybrid quantum-classical scheduler for accelerating neural network training with Newton's GD. Q-Newton utilizes a streamlined scheduling module that coordinates between quantum and classical linear solvers, by estimating &amp; reducing $\kappa$ and constructing $d$ for the quantum solver.
  Our evaluation showcases the potential for Q-Newton to significantly reduce the total training time compared to commonly used optimizers like SGD. We hypothesize a future scenario where the gate time of quantum machines is reduced, possibly realized by attoseconds physics. Our evaluation establishes an ambitious and promising target for the evolution of quantum computing.</description>

      <title>Simulating Floquet scrambling circuits on trapped-ion quantum computers</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.07613v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Complex quantum many-body dynamics spread initially localized quantum information across the entire system. Information scrambling refers to such a process, whose simulation is one of the promising applications of quantum computing. We demonstrate the Hayden-Preskill recovery protocol and the interferometric protocol for calculating out-of-time-ordered correlators to study the scrambling property of a one-dimensional kicked-Ising model on 20-qubit trapped-ion quantum processors. The simulated quantum circuits have a geometrically local structure that exhibits the ballistic growth of entanglement, resulting in the circuit depth being linear in the number of qubits for the entire state to be scrambled. We experimentally confirm the growth of signals in the Hayden-Preskill recovery protocol and the decay of out-of-time-ordered correlators at late times. As an application of the created scrambling circuits, we also experimentally demonstrate the calculation of the microcanonical expectation values of local operators adopting the idea of thermal pure quantum states. Our experiments are made possible by extensively utilizing one of the highest-fidelity quantum processors currently available and, thus, should be considered as a benchmark for the current status of the most advanced quantum computers.</description>

Abstract: Quantum computers have long been anticipated to excel in simulating quantum many-body physics. While most previous work has focused on Hermitian physics, we demonstrate the power of variational quantum circuits for resource-efficient simulations of dynamical and equilibrium physics in non-Hermitian systems, revealing new phenomena beyond standard Hermitian quantum machines. Using a variational quantum compilation scheme for fermionic systems, we reduce gate count, save qubits, and eliminate the need for postselection, a major challenge in simulating non-Hermitian dynamics via standard Trotterization. Experimentally, we observed a supersonic mode in the connected density-density correlation function on an $ n = 18 $ fermionic chain after a non-Hermitian, locally interacting quench, which would otherwise be forbidden by the Lieb-Robinson bound in a Hermitian system. Additionally, we investigate sequential quantum circuits generated by tensor networks for ground state preparation, here defined as the eigenstate with the lowest real part eigenvalue, using a variance minimization scheme. Through a trapped-ion implementation on the Quantinuum H1 quantum processor, we accurately capture correlation functions and energies across an exceptional point on a dissipative spin chain up to length $ n = 20 $ using only 3 qubits. Motivated by these advancements, we provide an analytical example demonstrating that simulating single-qubit non-Hermitian dynamics for $\Theta(\log(n))$ time from certain initial states is exponentially hard on a quantum computer, offering insights into the opportunities and limitations of using quantum computation for simulating non-Hermitian physics.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.18055v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Critical systems represent a valuable resource in quantum sensing and metrology. Critical quantum sensing (CQS) protocols can be realized using finite-component phase transitions, where criticality arises from the rescaling of system parameters rather than the thermodynamic limit. Here, we show that a collective quantum advantage can be achieved in a multipartite CQS protocol using a chain of parametrically coupled critical resonators in the weak-nonlinearity limit. We derive analytical solutions for the low-energy spectrum of this unconventional quantum many-body system, which is composed of locally critical elements. We then assess the scaling of the quantum Fisher information with respect to fundamental resources. We demonstrate that the coupled chain outperforms an equivalent ensemble of independent critical sensors, achieving quadratic scaling in the number of resonators. Finally, we show that even with finite Kerr nonlinearity or Markovian dissipation, the critical chain retains its advantage, making it relevant for implementing quantum sensors with current microwave superconducting technologies.</description>

      <title>Generalized Quantum Stein's Lemma and Second Law of Quantum Resource Theories</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.02722v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The second law of thermodynamics is the cornerstone of physics, characterizing the convertibility between thermodynamic states through a single function, entropy. Given the universal applicability of thermodynamics, a fundamental question in quantum information theory is whether an analogous second law can be formulated to characterize the convertibility of resources for quantum information processing by a single function. In 2008, a promising formulation was proposed, linking resource convertibility to the optimal performance of a variant of the quantum version of hypothesis testing. Central to this formulation was the generalized quantum Stein's lemma, which aimed to characterize this optimal performance by a measure of quantum resources, the regularized relative entropy of resource. If proven valid, the generalized quantum Stein's lemma would lead to the second law for quantum resources, with the regularized relative entropy of resource taking the role of entropy in thermodynamics. However, in 2023, a logical gap was found in the original proof of this lemma, casting doubt on the possibility of such a formulation of the second law. In this work, we address this problem by developing alternative techniques to successfully prove the generalized quantum Stein's lemma under a smaller set of assumptions than the original analysis. Based on our proof, we reestablish and extend the second law of quantum resource theories, applicable to both static resources of quantum states and a fundamental class of dynamical resources represented by classical-quantum (CQ) channels. These results resolve the fundamental problem of bridging the analogy between thermodynamics and quantum information theory.</description>

      <title>A Monte Carlo Tree Search approach to QAOA: finding a needle in the haystack</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.12648v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The search for quantum algorithms to tackle classical combinatorial optimization problems has long been one of the most attractive yet challenging research topics in quantum computing. In this context, variational quantum algorithms (VQA) are a promising family of hybrid quantum-classical methods tailored to cope with the limited capability of near-term quantum hardware. However, their effectiveness is hampered by the complexity of the classical parameter optimization which is prone to getting stuck either in local minima or in flat regions of the cost-function landscape. The clever design of efficient optimization methods is therefore of fundamental importance for fully leveraging the potential of VQAs. In this work, we approach QAOA parameter optimization as a sequential decision-making problem and tackle it with an adaptation of Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS), a common artificial intelligence technique designed for efficiently exploring complex decision graphs. We show that leveraging regular parameter patterns deeply affects the decision-tree structure and allows for a flexible and noise-resilient optimization strategy suitable for near-term quantum devices. Our results shed further light on the interplay between artificial intelligence and quantum information and provide a valuable addition to the toolkit of variational quantum circuits.</description>

Abstract: We implement the Multi-Reference Unitary Coupled Cluster Singles and Doubles (MR-UCCSD) model with a quantum circuit that conserves the particle number to study the ground state energies of LiH, BeH$_2$, and H$_6$. This approach simplifies the MR-UCCSD computation by integrating quantum computing techniques, and reduces its complexity. As a profit of the better MR states, our MR-UCCSD approach satisfies systematically the predefined errors below 10$^{-5}$ Hartree,which is the highest precision of single reference UCCSD approach, along the whole bond length with only hundreds of CNOT gates, and meets satisfactory the requirements of both computational precision and quantum resource reduction.</description>

      <title>Hard Quantum Extrapolations in Quantum Cryptography</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.16516v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Although one-way functions are well-established as the minimal primitive for classical cryptography, a minimal primitive for quantum cryptography is still unclear. Universal extrapolation, first considered by Impagliazzo and Levin (1990), is hard if and only if one-way functions exist. Towards better understanding minimal assumptions for quantum cryptography, we study the quantum analogues of the universal extrapolation task. Specifically, we put forth the classical$\rightarrow$quantum extrapolation task, where we ask to extrapolate the rest of a bipartite pure state given the first register measured in the computational basis. We then use it as a key component to establish new connections in quantum cryptography: (a) quantum commitments exist if classical$\rightarrow$quantum extrapolation is hard; and (b) classical$\rightarrow$quantum extrapolation is hard if any of the following cryptographic primitives exists: quantum public-key cryptography (such as quantum money and signatures) with a classical public key or 2-message quantum key distribution protocols.
  For future work, we further generalize the extrapolation task and propose a fully quantum analogue. We show that it is hard if quantum commitments exist, and it is easy for quantum polynomial space.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.12385v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Quantum networks (QNs) promise to enhance the performance of various quantum technologies in the near future by distributing entangled states over long distances. The first step towards this is to develop novel entanglement measures that are both informative and computationally tractable at large scales. While numerous such entanglement measures exist for discrete-variable (DV) systems, a comprehensive exploration for experimentally preferred continuous-variable (CV) systems is lacking. Here, we introduce a class of CV entanglement measures, among which we identify a nonconvex entanglement monotone -- the ratio negativity, which possesses a simple, scalable form that determines the exponential decay of optimal entanglement swapping on a chain of pure Gaussian states. This characterization opens avenues for leveraging statistical physics tools to analyze swapping-protocol-based CV QNs.</description>

Abstract: Thermal effects in a one-dimensional Su-Schrieffer-Hegger (SSH) topological insulator are studied. Particularly, we focus on quantum information processing (QIP) capacity for thermal ensembles. To evaluate QIP an optimized quantum Fisher information (OQFI) is introduced as a quantifier of entanglement and topological phases are calculated by a definition in real space for the electric polarization of mixture states. For the thermal ensemble, there is a relationship between the Fisher metric and the electric polarization in such a way that in the topological region, there is more entanglement, therefore, these generate more robustness and protection in the quantum information due to thermal effects. Also, long-range hopping effects are studied and it is found that in this case, the OQFI captures these topological phase transitions in the limit of low temperature by this formalism in real space.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.17672v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Two-dimensional coherent spectroscopy (2DCS) offers significant advantages in terms of high temporal and frequency resolutions and signal-to-noise ratio. Until now, the response-function (RF) formalism has been the prevalent theoretical description. In this study, we compare the non-Hermitian Hamiltonian (NHH) method with the RF formalism in a three-level system with a constant control field. We obtain the signals from both approaches and compare their population dynamics and 2DCS. We propose the quasi-Green functions for the NHH method, which allows all dominant Liouville paths to be inferred. We further simulate the 2DCS of Rh(CO)$_2$C$_5$H$_7$O$_2$ (RDC) dissolved in hexane with the NHH method, which is in good agreement with the previous experiments. Although the NHH method overestimates relaxations, it provides all important paths by analytical solutions, which are different from the four paths used in the RF formalism. Our results demonstrate that the NHH method is more suitable than the RF formalism for investigating the systems including relaxation and control fields via the 2DCS.</description>

Abstract: Quantum computing applications in the noisy intermediate-scale quantum (NISQ) era require algorithms that can generate shallower circuits feasible for today's quantum systems. This is particularly challenging for quantum chemistry applications due to the inherent complexity of molecular systems. Working with pharmaceutically relevant molecules containing sulfonyl fluoride ($SO_2F$) warheads used in targeted covalent drug development, we combine Hamiltonian terms truncation, Clifford Decomposition and Transformation (CDAT), and optimized transpilation techniques to achieve up to a 28.5-fold reduction in circuit depth when assuming all-to-all connectivity of quantum hardware. When employed on IBMQ's Heron architecture, we demonstrate up to a 15.5-fold reduction. Through these methods, we reduced circuit depths to 1330 gates for 8-qubit Hamiltonian dynamics simulations. Using middleware solutions for circuit decomposition, we successfully executed sub-circuits with depths up to 371 gates containing 216 2-qubit gates, representing one of the largest electronic structure Hamiltonian dynamics calculations implemented on current quantum hardware. The systematic circuit reduction approach shows promise for scaling to larger active spaces, while maintaining sufficient accuracy for molecular reactivity predictions using the Quantum-Centric Data-Driven R&amp;D framework. This work highlights practical methods for exploring commercially relevant chemistry problems on quantum hardware through Hamiltonian simulation, with direct applications to pharmaceutical drug development.</description>

Abstract: Current fault-tolerant quantum computer (FTQC) architectures utilize several encoding techniques to enable reliable logical operations with restricted qubit connectivity. However, such logical operations demand additional memory overhead to ensure fault tolerance. Since the main obstacle to practical quantum computing is the limited qubit count, our primary mission is to design floorplans that can reduce memory overhead without compromising computational capability. Despite extensive efforts to explore FTQC architectures, even the current state-of-the-art floorplan strategy devotes 50% of memory space to this overhead, not to data storage, to ensure unit-time random access to all logical qubits.
  In this paper, we propose an FTQC architecture based on a novel floorplan strategy, Load/Store Quantum Computer Architecture (LSQCA), which can achieve almost 100% memory density. The idea behind our architecture is to separate all memory regions into small computational space called Computational Registers (CR) and space-efficient memory space called Scan-Access Memory (SAM). We define an instruction set for these abstract structures and provide concrete designs named point-SAM and line-SAM architectures. With this design, we can improve the memory density by allowing variable-latency memory access while concealing the latency with other bottlenecks. We also propose optimization techniques to exploit properties of quantum programs observed in our static analysis, such as access locality in memory reference timestamps. Our numerical results indicate that LSQCA successfully leverages this idea. In a resource-restricted situation, a specific benchmark shows that we can achieve about 90% memory density with 5% increase in the execution time compared to a conventional floorplan, which achieves at most 50% memory density for unit-time random access. Our design ensures broad quantum applicability.</description>

      <title>Gate teleportation-assisted routing for quantum algorithms</title>

Abstract: The limited qubit connectivity of quantum processors poses a significant challenge in deploying practical algorithms and logical gates, necessitating efficient qubit mapping and routing strategies. When implementing a gate that requires additional connectivity beyond the native connectivity, the qubit state must be moved to a nearby connected qubit to execute the desired gate locally. This is typically achieved using a series of SWAP gates creating a SWAP path. However, routing methods relying on SWAP gates often lead to increased circuit depth and gate count, motivating the need for alternative approaches. This work explores the potential of teleported gates to improve qubit routing efficiency, focusing on implementation within specific hardware topologies and benchmark quantum algorithms. We propose a routing method that is assisted by gate teleportation. It establishes additional connectivity using gate teleportation paths through available unused qubits, termed auxiliary qubits, within the topology. To optimize this approach, we have developed an algorithm to identify the best gate teleportation connections, considering their potential to reduce the depth of the circuit and address possible errors that may arise from the teleportation paths. Finally, we demonstrate depth reduction with gate teleportation-assisted routing in various benchmark algorithms, including case studies on the compilation of the Deutsch-Jozsa algorithm and the Quantum Approximation Optimization Algorithm (QAOA) for heavy-hexagon topology used in IBM 127-qubit Eagle r3 processors. Our benchmark results show a 10-25 $\%$ depth reduction in the routing of selected algorithms compared to regular routing without using the teleported gate.</description>

      <title>Frame-dependent coherence of a quantum state</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.04178v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The tight frames can be regarded as a particular case of POVMs (positive operator-valued measures describing generalized measurements), namely the case when all the operators are rank-one. Each orthonormal basis is a tight frame, and every tight frame, after the embedding into a higher-dimensional space, is the orthogonal projection of an orthonormal basis. There exist several POVM-based definitions of coherence, and they are well-investigated. Our aim is to identify properties specific to the particular case of tight frames, and to look for some applications. All the POVM-based definitions use a Naimark extension. The frame-dependent coherence can be regarded as a particular case of POVM-based coherence, but it can be defined directly, without to use a Naimark extension. Its definition is a direct generalization of the basis-dependent $\ell_1$-norm of coherence, and it offers a more accurate description because we can use a frame containing several orthogonal bases. A frame-invariant definition of coherence for qubits and multi-qubit systems is presented.</description>

      <title>On the utility of the switching theorem for adiabatic state preparation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.06534v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The viability of adiabatic quantum computation depends on the slow evolution of the Hamiltonian. The adiabatic switching theorem provides an asymptotic series for error estimates in $1/T$, based on the lowest non-zero derivative of the Hamiltonian and its eigenvalues at the endpoints. Modifications at the endpoints in practical implementations can modify this scaling behavior, suggesting opportunities for error reduction by altering endpoint behavior while keeping intermediate evolution largely unchanged. Such modifications can significantly reduce errors for long evolution times, but they may also require exceedingly long timescales to reach the hyperadiabatic regime, limiting their practicality. This paper explores the transition between the adiabatic and hyperadiabatic regimes in simple low-dimensional Hamiltonians, highlighting the impact of modifications of the endpoints on approaching the asymptotic behavior described by the switching theorem.</description>

      <title>Cavity-Mediated Collective Resonant Suppression of Local Molecular Vibrations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.10917</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.10917v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Recent advances in polaritonic chemistry suggest that chemical reactions can be controlled via collective vibrational strong coupling (VSC) in a cavity. In this fully analytical work, we demonstrate that the collective vibrations of a molecular ensemble under VSC execute a beating with a period inversely proportional to the collective vacuum Rabi splitting. Significantly, this collective beating is imprinted on the local dynamics and resonantly suppresses individual molecular vibrations when a fraction of molecules are vibrationally excited, as in activated complexes formed in chemical reactions. This emergent beating occurs on significantly longer time scales than the individual molecular vibration or the cavity field oscillation period, peaking at the cavity-molecule resonance, consistent with polaritonic chemistry experiments. The cavity mediates an energy exchange between excited and ground-state molecules, affecting the dynamics of the entire ensemble. These findings suggest that the dynamics in polaritonic chemical reactions may not be in full equilibrium. In the ultra-strong coupling regime, we find that the local vibrations are modified by the cavity even at short time scales. Our analytical model offers insights into how collective VSC can dampen local molecular vibrations at resonance, potentially altering chemical reactivity.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2502.16578v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We report the image current detection of electrons in a room-temperature Paul trap at microwave frequencies. By selectively leveraging distinct cavity modes for trapping and detection, our approach effectively extracts electron signals otherwise buried in the microwave drive used for pseudo-potential formation. When the trapped electrons resonate with the cavity mode, we observe a mode excitation and its exponential decay attributed to resistive cooling. Detuning electrons from the cavity resonance halts this decay, and sweeping electrons' secular frequency reveals their oscillatory spectrum. Implementing this experiment at cryogenic temperatures could enable the image current detection and ground-state cooling of a single electron in Paul traps.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2502.17200v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Strongly driven nonlinear systems are frequently encountered in physics, yet their accurate control is generally challenging due to the intricate dynamics. In this work, we present a non-perturbative, semi-analytical framework for tailoring such systems. The key idea is heuristically extending the Floquet theory to nonlinear differential equations using the Harmonic Balance method. Additionally, we establish a novel constrained optimization technique inspired by the Lagrange multiplier method. This approach enables accurate engineering of effective potentials across a broader parameter space, surpassing the limitations of perturbative methods. Our method offers practical implementations in diverse experimental platforms, facilitating nonclassical state generation, versatile bosonic quantum simulations, and solving complex optimization problems across quantum and classical applications.</description>

      <title>Maximal Magic for Two-qubit States</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.17550v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Magic is a quantum resource essential for universal quantum computation and represents the deviation of quantum states from those that can be simulated efficiently using classical algorithms. Using the Stabilizer R\'enyi Entropy (SRE), we investigate two-qubit states with maximal magic, which are most distinct from classical simulability, and provide strong numerical evidence that the maximal second order SRE is $\log (16/7)\approx 0.827$, establishing a tighter bound than the prior $\log(5/2)\approx 0.916$. We identity 480 states saturating the new bound, which turn out to be the fiducial states for the mutually unbiased bases (MUBs) generated by the orbits of the Weyl-Heisenberg (WH) group, and conjecture that WH-MUBs are the maximal magic states for $n$-qubit, when $n\neq 1$ and 3. We also reveal a striking interplay between magic and entanglement: the entanglement of maximal magic states is restricted to two possible values, $1/2$ and $1/\sqrt{2}$, as quantified by the concurrence; none is maximally entangled.</description>

      <title>Harnessing Hybrid Frequency-Entangled Qudits through Quantum Interference</title>

Abstract: High-dimensional (HD) quantum entanglement expands the Hilbert space, offering a robust framework for quantum information processing with enhanced capacity and error resilience. In this work, we present a novel HD frequency-domain entangled state, the hybrid frequency-entangled qudit (HFEQ), generated via Hong-Ou-Mandel (HOM) interference, exhibiting both discrete-variable (DV) and continuous-variable (CV) characteristics in the frequency domain. By tuning HOM interference, we generate and control HFEQs with dimensions $D=5,7,9,11, confirming their DV nature. Franson interferometry confirms the global frequency correlations with visibility exceeding 98% and verifies the CV entanglement within individual frequency modes with visibility greater than 95%. Our findings provide deeper insight into the physical nature of frequency-entangled qudits generated by quantum interference and introduce a novel resource for HD time-frequency quantum information processing.</description>

      <title>Nonviolation of the CHSH inequality under local spin-1 measurements on two spin qutrits</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.05172</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.05172v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In the present paper, based on the general analytical expression [arXiv:2412.03470] for the maximum of the CHSH expectation under local Alice and Bob spin-$s$ measurements in a two-qudit state of dimension $d=2s+1$, $s\geq 1/2$, we analyze whether or not, under spin-$1$ measurements in an arbitrary two-qutrit state, the CHSH inequality is violated. We find analytically for a variety of pure nonseparable two-qutrit states and also, numerically for $1,000,000$ randomly generated pure nonseparable two-qutrit states, that, under local Alice and Bob spin-$1$ measurements in each of these nonseparable states, including maximally entangled, the CHSH inequality is not violated. These results together with the spectral decomposition of a mixed state lead us to the Conjecture that, under local Alice and Bob spin-$1$ measurements, every nonseparable two-qutrit state, pure or mixed, does not violate the CHSH inequality. For a variety of pure two-qutrit states, we further find the values of their concurrence and compare them with the values of their spin-$1$ CHSH parameter, which determines violation or nonviolation by a two-qutrit state of the CHSH inequality under spin-$1$ measurements. This comparison indicates that, in contrast to spin-$\frac{1}{2}$ measurements, where the spin-$\frac{1}{2}$ CHSH parameter of a pure two-qubit state is increasing monotonically with a growth of its entanglement, for a pure two-qutrit state, this is not the case. In particular, for the two-qutrit GHZ state, which is maximally entangled, the spin-$1$ CHSH parameter is equal to $\sqrt{\frac{8}{9}}$, while, for some separable pure two-qutrit states, this parameter can be equal to unity. Moreover, for the two-qutrit Horodecki state, the spin-$1$ CHSH parameter is equal to $4\sqrt{2}/21&lt;1$ regardless of the entanglement type of this mixed state.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.05446v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Creating highly spin-squeezed states for quantum metrology surpassing the standard quantum limit is a topic of great interest. Spin squeezing has been achieved by either entangling different atoms in an ensemble, or by controlling the multi-level internal spin state of an atom. Here, we experimentally demonstrate combined internal and collective spin squeezing in a hot atomic ensemble with $\sim 10^{11}$ rubidium atoms. By synergistically combining these two types of squeezing and carefully aligning their squeezing quadratures, we have achieved a metrologically relevant spin squeezing of $-6.21\pm0.84$ dB, significantly outperforming the results obtained by utilizing either type of squeezing alone. Our approach provides a new perspective on fully harnessing the degrees of freedom inherent in quantum states of an atomic ensemble.</description>

Abstract: We describe and analyze LOBE (Ladder Operator Block-Encoding), a framework for block-encoding second-quantized ladder operators that act upon fermionic and bosonic modes. We numerically benchmark these constructions using models arising in quantum field theories including the quartic oscillator, and $\phi^4$ and Yukawa Hamiltonians on the light front. These benchmarks show that LOBE produces block-encodings with fewer non-Clifford operations, fewer block-encoding ancillae and overall number of qubits, and lower rescaling factors for various second-quantized operators as compared to block-encoding frameworks that expand the ladder operators in the Pauli basis. The LOBE constructions also demonstrate favorable scaling with respect to key parameters, including the maximum occupation of bosonic modes, the total number of fermionic and bosonic modes, and the locality of the operators. LOBE is implemented as an open source python package to enable further applications.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.13128v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The solution of large sparse linear systems via factorization methods such as LU or Cholesky decomposition, can be computationally expensive due to the introduction of non-zero elements, or ``fill-in.'' Graph partitioning can be used to reduce the ``fill-in,'' thereby speeding up the solution of the linear system. We introduce a quantum approach to the graph partitioning problem based on variational quantum imaginary time evolution (VarQITE). We develop a hybrid quantum/classical method to accelerate Finite Element Analysis (FEA) by using VarQITE in Ansys's LS-DYNA multiphysics simulation software. This allows us to study different types of FEA problems, from mechanical engineering to computational fluid dynamics in simulations and on quantum hardware (IonQ Aria and IonQ Forte).
  We demonstrate that VarQITE has the potential to impact LS-DYNA workflows by measuring the wall-clock time to solution of FEA problems. We report performance results for our hybrid quantum/classical workflow on selected FEA problem instances, including simulation of blood pumps, automotive roof crush, and vibration analysis of car bodies on meshes of up to six million elements. We find that the LS-DYNA wall clock time can be improved by up to 12\% for some problems. Finally, we introduce a classical heuristic inspired by Fiduccia-Mattheyses to improve the quality of VarQITE solutions obtained from hardware runs. Our results highlight the potential impact of quantum computing on large-scale FEA problems in the NISQ era.</description>

Abstract: Coherent storage and retrieval of single photons in a quantum memory enables scalable growth of photonic entangled states via linear optics. The resulting increase in power of photonic quantum computers will unlock new applications on the pathway to fault tolerance. Quantum memories based on off-resonant cascaded absorption (ORCA) in rubidium vapour allow this storage to be broadband, noise-free, and high efficiency. Through algorithmic pulse-shape optimisation, we have previously demonstrated single-pass memory efficiency of almost 90\%. Here, we implement a cavity-enhanced GHz-bandwidth ORCA memory with smaller footprint and reduced power requirements compared to conventional single-pass schemes. By combining a strong magnetic field with polarisation control, we maintain a Doppler-free two-photon interaction and eliminate the need for optical pumping. The performance provided by the cavity establishes the feasibility of large arrays of ultra-compact, high-efficiency, room-temperature quantum memories, while the low control power requirements highlight a route to single-photon-level nonlinearities.</description>

Abstract: We investigate the use of driven qubits coupled to a harmonic oscillator to implement a $\sqrt{i\mathrm{SWAP}}$-gate. By dressing the qubits through an external driving field, the qubits and the harmonic oscillator can be selectively coupled, leading to effective qubit-qubit interactions. We analyze a qubit readout mechanism based on the detection of a shift of the harmonic oscillator's resonance frequency, and demonstrate that when coupled to low-frequency resonators, dressed qubits provide a more robust readout than bare qubits in the presence of damping and thermal effects. Furthermore, we study the impact of various system parameters on the fidelity of the two-qubit gate, identifying an optimal range for quantum computation. Our findings guide the implementation of high-fidelity quantum gates in experimental setups, for example those employing nanoscale mechanical resonators.</description>

Abstract: The utility of near-term quantum computers for simulating realistic quantum systems hinges on the stability of digital quantum matter--realized when discrete quantum gates approximate continuous time evolution--and whether it can be maintained at system sizes and time scales inaccessible to classical simulations. Here, we use Quantinuum's H2 quantum computer to simulate digitized dynamics of the quantum Ising model and observe the emergence of Floquet prethermalization on timescales where accurate simulations using current classical methods are extremely challenging (if feasible at all). In addition to confirming the stability of dynamics subject to achievable digitization errors, we show direct evidence of the resultant local equilibration by computing diffusion constants associated with an emergent hydrodynamic description of the dynamics. Our results were enabled by continued advances in two-qubit gate quality (native partial entangler fidelities of 99.94(1)%) that allow us to access circuit volumes of over 2000 two-qubit gates. This work establishes digital quantum computers as powerful tools for studying continuous-time dynamics and demonstrates their potential to benchmark classical heuristics in a regime of scale and complexity where no known classical methods are both efficient and trustworthy.</description>

      <title>Feedback Connections in Quantum Reservoir Computing with Mid-Circuit Measurements</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.22380v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Existing approaches to quantum reservoir computing can be broadly categorized into restart-based and continuous protocols. Restart-based methods require reinitializing the quantum circuit for each time step, while continuous protocols use mid-circuit measurements to enable uninterrupted information processing. A gap exists between these two paradigms: while restart-based methods naturally have high execution times due to the need for circuit reinitialization, they can employ novel feedback connections to enhance performance. In contrast, continuous methods have significantly faster execution times but typically lack such feedback mechanisms. In this work, we investigate a novel quantum reservoir computing scheme that integrates feedback connections, which can operate within the coherence time of a qubit. We demonstrate our architecture using a minimal example and evaluate memory capacity and predictive capabilities. We show that the correlation coefficient for the short-term memory task on past inputs is nonzero, indicating that feedback connections can effectively operate during continuous processing to allow the model to remember past inputs.</description>

      <title>Spin-Phonon Relaxation of Boron-Vacancy Centers in Two-Dimensional Boron Nitride Polytypes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.00154</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.00154v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Two-dimensional (2D) materials hosting color centers and spin defects are emerging as key platforms for quantum technologies. However, the impact of reduced dimensionality on the spin-lattice relaxation time ($T_1$) of embedded defect spins -- critical for quantum applications -- remains largely unexplored. In this study, we present a systematic first-principles investigation of the negatively charged boron-vacancy (V$_{\text{B}}^-$) defect in monolayer boron nitride (BN), as well as in AA$^\prime$-stacked hexagonal BN (hBN) and ABC-stacked rhombohedral BN (rBN). Our results reveal that the $T_1$ times of V$_{\text{B}}^-$ in monolayer BN and hBN are nearly identical at room temperature. Surprisingly, despite the symmetry reduction in rBN opening additional spin relaxation channels, V$_{\text{B}}^-$ exhibits a longer $T_1$ compared to hBN. We attribute this effect to the stiffer out-of-plane phonon modes in rBN, which activate spin-phonon relaxation at reduced strength. These findings suggest that V$_{\text{B}}^-$ in rBN offers enhanced spin coherence properties, making it a promising candidate for quantum technology applications.</description>

      <title>How does the entanglement entropy of a many-body quantum system change after a single measurement?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.04071</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.04071v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: For one-dimensional free Dirac fermions, we compute numerically the probability distribution of the change in the entanglement entropy (EE), after the saturation time, resulting from a single measurement of the occupation number by using different measurement protocols. For the quantum jump and the projective measurement protocols, we observe clear deviations from Gaussianity characterized by broader and asymmetric tails, exponential for positive values of the change, and a peak at zero that increases with the system size and the monitoring strength supporting that in all cases the EE is in the area law phase. Another distinct feature of the distribution is its spatial inhomogeneity. In the weak monitoring limit, the distribution is close to Gaussian with a broad support for boundary point separating the two subsystems defining the EE while for the rest of sites has asymmetric exponential tails and a much narrower support. For a quantum state diffusion protocol, the distribution is Gaussian for weak monitoring. As the monitoring strength increases, it gradually develops symmetric exponential tails. In the strong monitoring limit, the tails are still exponential but the core turns from Gaussian to strongly peaked at zero suggesting the dominance of quantum Zeno effect. For all monitoring strengths, the distribution is size independent.</description>

      <title>Scalable MHz-Rate Entanglement Distribution in Low-Latency Quantum Networks Interconnecting Heterogeneous Quantum Processors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.05567</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.05567v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Practical distributed quantum computing and error correction require high-qubit-rate, high-fidelity, and low-reconfiguration-latency quantum networks between heterogeneous quantum information processors. Unfortunately, in a quantum network with homogeneous quantum processors, the theoretical entanglement distribution rate for a single channel is limited to the 100-kHz level with a millisecond-level reconfiguration latency, which is not sufficient for error-corrected distributed quantum computing. Here, we propose a quantum network architecture by introducing the concept of a reconfigurable quantum interface. In our protocol, through tuning the frequency and temporal mode of the photonic qubits to dense wavelength division multiplexing (DWDM) channels, a 4.5 MHz Bell pair distribution rate, with a potential of more than 40 MHz Bell pair rate, is achieved. Through the use of reconfigurable quantum interfaces and wavelength-selective switches, a nanosecond network reconfiguration latency can be demonstrated with low-loss, low-infidelity and high-dimensional switches. To the best of our knowledge, our architecture is the first practical solution that can accommodate the entanglement distribution between heterogeneous quantum nodes with a rate and latency that satisfy most distributed quantum circuits and error correction requirements. The proposed architecture is compatible with the industry-standard DWDM infrastructure, offering a scalable and cost-effective solution for distributed quantum computing.</description>

      <title>Spin Squeezing via One-Axis Twisting in a Quadrupolar NMR system under relaxation effects</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.06204v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This study investigates spin squeezed states in nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) quadrupolar systems with spins $I=3/2$ and $I=7/2$ at room temperature, taking into account the effects of relaxation on the dynamics. The origin of spin squeezing is attributed to the interaction between the nuclear quadrupole moment and the electric field gradients in the molecular environment. The formal description of the nonlinear operators responsible for spin squeezing is achieved using the spin angular momentum representation via the one-axis twisting mechanism. This approach provides a framework for quantum control and metrology over the spin squeezing process while accounting for the influence of relaxation phenomena. Non-Cartesian angular momentum operators are proposed, with their variances products catching the quantum effects during the dynamics. An upper bound for the squeezing parameter and the Heisenberg uncertainty at thermal equilibrium are also predicted for any spin quantum number.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2504.06951v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This work explores structured matrix sequences arising in mean-field quantum spin systems. We express these sequences within the framework of generalized locally Toeplitz (GLT) $*$-algebras, leveraging the fact that each GLT matrix sequence has a unique GLT symbol. This symbol characterizes both the asymptotic singular value distribution and, for Hermitian or quasi-Hermitian sequences, the asymptotic spectral distribution. Specifically, we analyze two cases of real symmetric matrix sequences stemming from mean-field quantum spin systems and determine their associated distributions using GLT theory. Our study concludes with visualizations and numerical tests that validate the theoretical findings, followed by a discussion of open problems and future directions.</description>

Abstract: We consider a 2D atomic array coupled to different photonic environments, focusing on the half-filled excitation subspace, where strong photon interactions can give rise to complex many-body states. In particular, we demonstrate that the least radiant state in this sector is well described by a coherent superposition of all possible quantum dimer coverings: a resonating valence bond (RVB) liquid state. We discuss possible strategies to probe this exotic state, along with their limitations and challenges. Finally, we show that such a quantum dimer covering can also emerge as the ground state of the coherent Hamiltonian describing a 2D atomic array coupled to a photonic band-gap material.</description>

      <title>Noise-Aware Entanglement Generation Protocols for Superconducting Qubits with Impedance-Matched FBAR Transducers</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.07253v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Connecting superconducting quantum processors to telecommunications-wavelength quantum networks is critically necessary to enable distributed quantum computing, secure communications, and other applications. Optically-mediated entanglement heralding protocols offer a near-term solution that can succeed with imperfect components, including sub-unity efficiency microwave-optical quantum transducers. The viability and performance of these protocols relies heavily on the properties of the transducers used: the conversion efficiency, resonator lifetimes, and added noise in the transducer directly influence the achievable entanglement generation rate and fidelity of an entanglement generation protocol. Here, we use an extended Butterworth-van Dyke (BVD) model to optimize the conversion efficiency and added noise of a Thin Film Bulk Acoustic Resonator (FBAR) piezo-optomechanical transducer. We use the outputs from this model to calculate the fidelity of one-photon and two-photon entanglement heralding protocols in a variety of operating regimes. For transducers with matching circuits designed to either minimize the added noise or maximize conversion efficiency, we theoretically estimate that entanglement generation rates of greater than $160\;\mathrm{kHz}$ can be achieved at moderate pump powers with fidelities of $&gt;90\%$. This is the first time a BVD equivalent circuit model is used to both optimize the performance of an FBAR transducer and to directly inform the design and implementation of an entanglement generation protocol. These results can be applied in the near term to realize quantum networks of superconducting qubits with realistic experimental parameters.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2504.07386v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Quantum entanglement systems based on qudits dilate high-dimensional (HD) state spaces and enhance resistance to loss in quantum information processing (QIP). To fully exploit this potential, effective schemes for generating HD entanglement are crucial. In this paper, we propose a flexible heralded scheme generating random 4D two-qudit maximal entanglement for hybrid photon-emitter system by entering different input ports. This approach can be further extended to prepare 4D n-qudit (n is greater than or equal 3) maximal entanglement utilizing the 4D single-qudit Z^m (m=1,2,3) gate for the first qudit and X^m gate for the other qudits (except the second qudit). For the hybrid system, the first 4D qudit is encoded on the hybrid polarization-path states of a flying photon, while the second and subsequent 4D qudits are represented by two stationary emitters coupled to respective 1D waveguide. The qudit-encoded hybrid HD entanglement offers advantages over economizing quantum resource without any auxiliary qudits, and obtaining robust fidelities of various HD entanglement by the error-detected mechanism of the emitter-waveguide systems. Moreover, the proposed protocol can be spread to generate dD n-qudit (d is greater than or equal 2^(p+1), n, p=2,3,...) entangled states, further broadening its applicability in HD QIP.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2504.07523v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: High-frequency mechanical oscillators with long coherence times are essential to realizing a variety of high-fidelity quantum sensors, transducers, and memories. However, the unprecedented coherence times needed for quantum applications require exquisitely sensitive new techniques to probe the material origins of phonon decoherence and new strategies to mitigate decoherence in mechanical oscillators. Here, we combine non-invasive laser spectroscopy techniques with materials analysis to identify key sources of phonon decoherence in crystalline media. Using micro-fabricated high-overtone bulk acoustic-wave resonators ($\mu$HBARs) as an experimental testbed, we identify phonon-surface interactions as the dominant source of phonon decoherence in crystalline quartz; lattice distortion, subsurface damage, and high concentration of elemental impurities near the crystal surface are identified as the likely causes. Removal of this compromised surface layer using an optimized polishing process is seen to greatly enhance coherence times, enabling $\mu$HBARs with Q-factors of &gt; 240 million at 12 GHz frequencies, corresponding to &gt; 6 ms phonon coherence times and record-level f-Q products. Complementary phonon linewidth and time-domain ringdown measurements, performed using a new Brillouin-based pump-probe spectroscopy technique, reveal negligible dephasing within these oscillators. Building on these results, we identify a path to &gt; 100 ms coherence times as the basis for high-frequency quantum memories. These findings clearly demonstrate that, with enhanced control over surfaces, dissipation and noise can be significantly reduced in a wide range of quantum systems.</description>

Abstract: To understand the properties and interactions of materials, and determining the ground state energies is one of the important challenges in quantum chemistry, materials science, and quantum mechanics, where quantum computing can play an important role for studying the properties of materials. In this study, we have explored the quantum processor application to compute the He molecule ground state energy which utilizes the Variational Quantum Eigensolver (VQE) algorithm. In here, we have implemented VQE on a state-of-the-art quantum processor, optimizing a parameterized quantum circuit to minimize the energy expectation value of the He molecule's Hamiltonian on the four qubits processor. The obtained results of this work show a significant improvement in accuracy compared to classical computational methods, such as Hartree-Fock and density functional theory, which demonstrate the compute potential of quantum algorithms in quantum many-body problems. Thus, these results demonstrate the advantages of quantum computing in achieving high accuracy in simulations of molecular and material properties, and pave the way for future applications in more complex systems. This work highlights the potential of quantum processors in the fields of quantum chemistry, computational physics, and data science.</description>

Abstract: We present a conceptually clear introduction to quantum theory, deriving the theory from scratch from the point of view of quantum information. Different subsets of these lectures were taught to a wide variety of audiences, including exceptional high-school students in the International Summer School for Young Physicists (ISSYP) at Perimeter Institute, 2nd-year physics undergraduates at the University of Toronto, and 4th-year physics and math undergraduate and graduate students at Brock University. The lectures are completely self-contained, including all the necessary mathematical background: complex numbers, linear algebra, and probability theory. They cover topics such as the axioms of quantum theory, qubits, superposition, entanglement, the uncertainty principle, quantum gates, unitary transformations and evolution, interpretations of quantum mechanics, the no-cloning theorem, quantum teleportation, quantum algorithms, Hamiltonians, the Schrodinger equation, canonical and path integral quantization, quantum harmonic oscillators, wavefunctions, and much more. The lectures also contain 163 computational exercises and proof-based problems.</description>

      <title>Comments on the holographic description of Narain theories</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2012.15830</link>
      <description>arXiv:2012.15830v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We discuss the holographic description of Narain $U(1)^c\times U(1)^c$ conformal field theories, and their potential similarity to conventional weakly coupled gravity in the bulk, in the sense that the effective IR bulk description includes "$U(1)$ gravity" amended with additional light degrees of freedom. Starting from this picture, we formulate the hypothesis that in the large central charge limit the density of states of any Narain theory is bounded by below by the density of states of $U(1)$ gravity. This immediately implies that the maximal value of the spectral gap for primary fields is $\Delta_1=c/(2\pi e)$. To test the self-consistency of this proposal, we study its implications using chiral lattice CFTs and CFTs based on quantum stabilizer codes. First we notice that the conjecture yields a new bound on quantum stabilizer codes, which is compatible with previously known bounds in the literature. We proceed to discuss the variance of the density of states, which for consistency must be vanishingly small in the large-$c$ limit. We consider ensembles of code and chiral theories and show that in both cases the density variance is exponentially small in the central charge.</description>

      <title>Theoretical bound of the efficiency of learning</title>

      <description>arXiv:2209.08096v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A unified thermodynamic formalism describing the efficiency of learning is proposed. First, we derive an inequality, which is more strength than Clausius's inequality, revealing the lower bound of the entropy-production rate of a subsystem. Second, the inequality is transformed to determine the general upper limit for the efficiency of learning. In particular, we exemplify the bound of the efficiency in nonequilibrium quantum-dot systems and networks of living cells. The framework provides a fundamental trade-off relationship between energy and information inheriting in stochastic thermodynamic processes.</description>

      <title>Minimal ring extensions of the integers exhibiting Kochen-Specker contextuality</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2211.13216</link>
      <description>arXiv:2211.13216v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper is a contribution to the algebraic study of contextuality in quantum theory. As an algebraic analogue of Kochen and Specker's no-hidden-variables result, we investigate rational subrings over which the partial ring of $d \times d$ symmetric matrices ($d \geq 3$) admits no morphism to a commutative ring, which we view as an "algebraic hidden state." For $d = 3$, the minimal such ring is shown to be $\mathbb{Z}[1/6]$, while for $d \geq 6$ the minimal subring is $\mathbb{Z}$ itself. The proofs rely on the construction of new sets of integer vectors in dimensions 3 and 6 that have no Kochen-Specker coloring.</description>

      <title>Operator dynamics in Floquet many-body systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.14234</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.14234v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study operator dynamics in many-body quantum systems, focusing on generic features of systems that are ergodic, spatially extended, and lack conserved densities. Quantum circuits of various types provide simple models for such systems. We focus on Floquet quantum circuits, comparing their behaviour with what has been found previously for circuits that are random in time. Floquet circuits, which have discrete time-translation symmetry, represent an intermediate case between circuits that are random in time and lack any symmetry, and systems with a time-independent Hamiltonian and continuous time-translation invariance. By making this comparison, one of our aims is to identify signatures of time-translation symmetry in Floquet operator dynamics. To characterise behaviour we examine a variety of quantities in solvable models and numerically: operator autocorrelation functions; the partial spectral form factor; the out-of-time-order correlator (OTOC); and the paths in operator space that make the dominant contributions to the ensemble-averaged autocorrelation functions. Our most striking result is that ensemble-averaged autocorrelation functions show behaviour that is distinctively different in Floquet systems compared to systems in which successive time-steps are independent. Specifically, while average autocorrelation functions decay on a microscopic timescale for circuits that are random in time, in Floquet systems they have a late-time tail with a duration that grows parametrically with the size of the operator support. The existence of these tails provides a way to understand deviations of the spectral form factor from random matrix behaviour at times shorter than the Thouless time. In contrast to this feature in autocorrelation functions, we find no new aspects to the behaviour of OTOCs for Floquet models compared to random-in-time circuits.</description>

      <title>Dynamics of a Nonequilibrium Discontinuous Quantum Phase Transition in a Spinor Bose-Einstein Condensate</title>

      <description>arXiv:2312.16555v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Symmetry-breaking quantum phase transitions lead to the production of topological defects or domain walls in a wide range of physical systems. In second-order transitions, these exhibit universal scaling laws described by the Kibble-Zurek mechanism, but for first-order transitions a similarly universal approach is still lacking. Here we propose a spinor Bose-Einstein condensate as a testbed system where critical scaling behavior in a first-order quantum phase transition can be understood from generic properties. We demonstrate the applicability of the Kibble-Zurek mechanism for this transition to determine the critical exponents for: (1) the onset of the decay of the metastable state on short times scales, and (2) the number of resulting phase-separated ferromagnetic domains at longer times, as a one-dimensional spin-1 condensate is ramped across a first-order quantum phase transition. The predictions are in excellent agreement with mean-field numerical simulations and provide a paradigm for studying the decay of metastable states in experimentally accessible systems.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.10029v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We consider a random quantum channel obtained by taking a selection of $d$ independent and Haar distributed $N$ dimensional unitaries. We follow the argument of Hastings to bound the spectral gap in terms of eigenvalues and adapt it to give an exact estimate of the spectral gap in terms of singular values \cite{hastings2007random,harrow2007quantum}. This shows that we have constructed a random quantum expander in terms of both singular values and eigenvalues. The lower bound is an analog of the Alon-Boppana bound for $d$-regular graphs. The upper bound is obtained using Schwinger-Dyson equations.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2408.14651v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We develop a model describing long-range atom-atom interactions in a two-dimensional periodic or a-periodic lattice of optical centers considering spectral and spatial broadening effects. Using both analytical and numerical Green's function techniques, we develop a mathematical framework to describe effective atom-atom interactions and collective behaviors in the presence of disorder. This framework is applicable to a broad range of quantum systems with arbitrary lattice geometries, including cold atoms, solid-state photonics, and superconducting platforms. The model can be used, for example, to scalably design quantum optical elements, e.g. a quantum lens, harnessing atomistic engineering (e.g. via ion implantation) of collective interactions in materials to enhance quantum properties at scale.</description>

      <title>Entanglement Spectrum Dynamics as a Probe for Non-Hermitian Bulk-Boundary Correspondence in Systems with Periodic Boundaries</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.07279v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: It has recently been established that open quantum systems may exhibit a strong spectral sensitivity to boundary conditions, known as the non-Hermitian/Liouvillian skin effect (NHSE/LSE), making the topological properties of the system boundary-condition sensitive. In this Letter, we ask the query: Can topological phase transitions of open quantum systems, captured by open boundary conditioned invariants, be observed in the dynamics of a system in a periodic boundary condition, even in the presence of NHSE/LSE? We affirmatively respond to this question, by considering the quench dynamics of entanglement spectrum in a periodic open quantum fermionic system. We demonstrate that the entanglement spectrum exhibits zero-crossings only when this periodic system is quenched from a topologically trivial to non-trivial phase, defined from the spectrum in open boundary conditions, even in systems featuring LSE. Our results reveal that non-Hermitian topological phases leave a distinctive imprint on the unconditional dynamics within a subsystem of fermionic systems.</description>

      <title>Finite Correlation Length Scaling of Disorder Parameter at Quantum Criticality</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.01009v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The disorder parameter, defined as the expectation value of the symmetry transformation acting on a subsystem, can be used to characterize symmetric phases as an analogy to detecting spontaneous symmetry breaking (SSB) phases using local order parameters. In a dual picture, disorder parameters actually detect SSB of higher-form symmetries. In this work, we show that the non-local disorder parameters can be conveniently and efficiently evaluated using infinite projected entangled pair states (iPEPS). Moreover, we propose a finite correlation length scaling theory of the disorder parameter within the quantum critical region and validate the scaling theory with variationally optimized iPEPS. We find from the finite correlation length scaling that the disorder parameter satisfies perimeter law at a critical point, i.e., it decays exponentially with the boundary size of the subsystem, indicating spontaneous higher-form symmetry breaking at the critical point of the dual model.</description>

      <title>Regularized stress tensor of vector fields in de Sitter space</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.03961</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.03961v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the Stueckelberg field in de Sitter space, which is a massive vector field with the gauge fixing (GF) term $\frac{1}{2\zeta} (A^\mu\,_{;\, \mu})^2$. We obtain the vacuum stress tensor, which consists of the transverse, longitudinal, temporal, and GF parts, and each contains various UV divergences. By the minimal subtraction rule, we regularize each part of the stress tensor to its pertinent adiabatic order. The transverse stress tensor is regularized to the 0th adiabatic order, the longitudinal, temporal, and GF stress tensors are regularized to the 2nd adiabatic order. The resulting total regularized vacuum stress tensor is convergent and maximally-symmetric, has a positive energy density, and respects the covariant conservation, and thus can be identified as the cosmological constant that drives the de Sitter inflation. Under the Lorenz condition $A^\mu\,_{;\, \mu}=0$, the regularized Stueckelberg stress tensor reduces to the regularized Proca stress tensor that contains only the transverse and longitudinal modes. In the massless limit, the regularized Stueckelberg stress tensor becomes zero, and is the same as that of the Maxwell field with the GF term, and no trace anomaly exists. If the order of adiabatic regularization were lower than our prescription, some divergences would remain. If the order were higher, say, under the conventional 4th-order regularization, more terms than necessary would be subtracted off, leading to an unphysical negative energy density and the trace anomaly simultaneously.</description>

      <title>Bipartite Relativistic Quantum Information from Effective Field Theory Approach with Implications to Contextual Meanings of Locality and Quantumness</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.09409</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.09409v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In a recent work \cite{biggs2024comparing}, the effective field theory (EFT) is adopted to consider the quantum decoherence of a near-horizon Unrhu-DeWitt (UDW) charged qubit in a macroscopic cat state. We generalize this EFT approach to study the relativistic quantum information (RQI) of two static UDW-charged qubits with or without a black hole. This EFT is obtained by integrating out a massless mediator field, yielding the direct Coulombic interactions among intrinsic multipole moments of UDW detectors and the induced one on the black hole. The RQI of the quantum state of the mediator field can be probed by the reduced final states of UDW detectors by tracing out the induced internal states of the black hole. From the reduced final state, we find the patterns of entanglement harvesting agree with the ones obtained by the conventional approach based on master theory. However, the more detailed study suggests that the contextual meanings of (non-)locality may or may not be the same in quantum field theory (QFT) and RQI. To explore the contextual meanings of quantumness and locality more, we also calculate quantum discord and locality bound of the Bell-type experiments, with the former characterizing the non-classical correlations and the latter the (non-)locality in the hidden-variable context of RQI. We find that QFT and RQI agree on quantumness based on different physical reasons but may not agree on locality.</description>

      <title>Identifying Quantum Mechanical Statistics in Italian Corpora</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.07919v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present a theoretical and empirical investigation of the statistical behaviour of the words in a text produced by human language. To this aim, we analyse the word distribution of various texts of Italian language selected from a specific literary corpus. We firstly generalise a theoretical framework elaborated by ourselves to identify 'quantum mechanical statistics' in large-size texts. Then, we show that, in all analysed texts, words distribute according to 'Bose--Einstein statistics' and show significant deviations from 'Maxwell--Boltzmann statistics'. Next, we introduce an effect of 'word randomization' which instead indicates that the difference between the two statistical models is not as pronounced as in the original cases. These results confirm the empirical patterns obtained in texts of English language and strongly indicate that identical words tend to 'clump together' as a consequence of their meaning, which can be explained as an effect of 'quantum entanglement' produced through a phenomenon of 'contextual updating'. More, word randomization can be seen as the linguistic-conceptual equivalent of an increase of temperature which destroys 'coherence' and makes classical statistics prevail over quantum statistics. Some insights into the origin of quantum statistics in physics are finally provided.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2501.16200v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In understanding strongly correlated quantum systems, quantifying the non-Gaussian nature of interparticle correlations is invaluable. We show that, for a uniform quantum gas, there exists a natural connection between non-Gaussian correlations and the generation of momentum-space entanglement. Furthermore, this entanglement can be directly measured in an experiment using time-of-flight techniques. To prototype our method, we numerically study entanglement generation in a degenerate Bose gas following a quench to the unitary regime, where Gaussian and non-Gaussian correlations are generated sequentially in time.</description>

      <title>Rigorous Test for Quantum Integrability and Nonintegrability</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.18400v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The integrability of a quantum many-body system, which is characterized by the presence or absence of local conserved quantities, drastically impacts the dynamics of isolated systems, including thermalization. Nevertheless, a rigorous and comprehensive method for determining integrability or nonintegrability has remained elusive. In this paper, we address this challenge by introducing rigorously provable tests for integrability and nonintegrability of quantum spin systems with finite-range interactions. Our results significantly simplify existing proofs of nonintegrability, such as those for the $S=1/2$ Heisenberg chain with nearest-and next-nearest-neighbor interactions, the $S=1$ bilinear-biquadratic chain and the $S=1/2$ XYZ model in two or higher dimensions. Moreover, our results also yield the first proof of nonintegrability for models such as the $S=1/2$ Heisenberg chain with a non-uniform magnetic field, the $S=1/2$ XYZ model on the triangular lattice, and the general spin XYZ model. This work also offers a partial resolution to the long-standing conjecture that integrability is governed by the existence of local conserved quantities with small support. Our framework ensures that the nonintegrability of one-dimensional spin systems with translational symmetry can be verified algorithmically, independently of system size.</description>

Abstract: The electronic and emission properties of correlated multi-particle states are studied theoretically using ${\bf k}\cdot{\bf p}$ and the configuration interaction methods on a well-known and measured GaAs/AlGaAs quantum dots as a test system. The convergence of the calculated energies and radiative lifetimes of Coulomb correlated exciton, biexciton, positive and negative trions to experimentally observed values is reached when the electron-electron and hole-hole exchange interactions are neglected. That unexpected and striking result uncovers a rich structure of multi-particle states in the studied system, which is further quantitatively compared to published measurements in the literature, obtaining astonishingly good agreement. It is proposed that in real experiments the neglected electron-electron and hole-hole exchange interactions are emitted as acoustic phonons during the radiative recombination of the ground state of complexes, leading to the observation of polaronic multi-particle states. Analysis of their energy spectra provides a direct and measurable insight into the Coulomb correlation, being interesting both on the fundamental level and as possible experimentally tunable property in a wide variety of solid-state systems, in particular associated with quantum computing.</description>

      <title>Traversable AdS Wormhole via Non-local Double Trace or Janus Deformation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.03531</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.03531v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study (i) Janus deformations and (ii) non-local double trace deformations of a pair of CFTs, as two different ways to construct CFT duals of traversable AdS wormholes. First, we construct a simple model of traversable wormholes by gluing two Poincar\'e AdS geometries and BTZ black holes and compute holographic two point functions and (pseudo) entanglement entropy. We point out that a Janus gravity solution describes a traversable wormhole when the deformation parameter takes imaginary values. On the other hand, we show that double trace deformations between two decoupled CFTs can reproduce two point functions of traversable AdS wormholes. By considering the case where the double trace deformation is given by a non-local $T\overline{T}$ deformation, we analyze the dual gravity which implies emergence of wormholes. We present toy model of these deformed CFTs by using free scalars and obtain qualitative behaviors expected for them. We argue that the crucial difference between the two constructions is that a global time slice of wormhole is described by a pure state for Janus deformations, while it is a mixed state for the double trace deformations.</description>

      <title>Programmable photonic waveguide arrays: opportunities and challenges</title>

Abstract: The field of programmable photonics has advanced significantly in recent decades, driven by the rising demand for complex applications, such as optical quantum computing and photonic neural networks. However, as the complexity of these applications increases, there is an increasing need for novel designs that enhance circuit transmission and enable further miniaturization. Photonic waveguide arrays (WAs) hold a unique position in integrated photonics, as they implement ``always-on'' Hamiltonians and have no direct analogs in free-space optics. They find applications in various fields, including light propagation studies, quantum walks, and topological photonics. Despite their versatility, the lack of reconfigurability has limited their utility and hindered further advancements for a long time. Recently, programmable waveguide arrays (PWAs) have emerged as a promising solution for overcoming the limitations of static WAs and PWA-based architectures have been proven to be universal. This perspective proposes a vision for photonic circuits based on PWAs as a new, interdisciplinary field. We review the history of the development of PWAs and outline their potential in areas such as simulation, communication, sensing, and classical and quantum information processing. This technology is expected to become increasingly feasible with advancements in programmable photonics, nanofabrication, and quantum control.</description>

      <title>Intrinsic Phononic Dressed States in a Nanomechanical System</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.18587</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.18587v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Nanoelectromechanical systems (NEMS) provide a platform for probing the quantum nature of mechanical motion in mesoscopic systems. This nature manifests most profoundly when the device vibrations are nonlinear and, currently, achieving vibrational nonlinearity at the single-phonon level is an active area of pursuit in quantum information science. Despite much effort, however, this has remained elusive. Here, we report the first observation of intrinsic mesoscopic vibrational dressed states. The requisite nonlinearity results from strong resonant coupling between an eigenmode of our NEMS resonator and a single, two-level system (TLS) that is intrinsic to the device material. We control the TLS in situ by varying mechanical strain, tuning it in and out of resonance with the NEMS mode. Varying the resonant drive and/or temperature allows controlled ascent of the nonequidistant energy ladder and reveals the energy multiplets of the hybridized system. Fluctuations of the TLS on and off resonance with the mode induces switching between dressed and bare states; this elucidates the complex quantum nature of TLS-like defects in mesoscopic systems. These quintessential quantum effects emerge directly from the intrinsic material properties of mechanical systems - without need for complex, external quantum circuits. Our work provides long-sought insight into mesoscopic dynamics and offers a new direction to harness nanomechanics for quantum measurements.</description>

      <title>Deconfined criticality as intrinsically gapless topological state in one dimension</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.01198</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.01198v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Deconfined criticality and gapless topological states have recently attracted growing attention, as both phenomena go beyond the traditional Landau paradigm. However, the deep connection between these two critical states, particularly in lattice realization, remains insufficiently explored. In this Letter, we reveal that certain deconfined criticality can be regarded as an intrinsically gapless topological state without gapped counterparts in a one dimensional lattice model. Using a combination of field-theoretic arguments and large-scale numerical simulations, we establish the global phase diagram of the model, which features deconfined critical lines separating two distinct spontaneous symmetry breaking ordered phases. More importantly, we unambiguously demonstrate that the mixed anomaly inherent to deconfined criticality enforces topologically robust edge modes near the boundary, providing a general mechanism by which deconfined criticality manifests as a gapless topological state. Our findings not only offer a new perspective on deconfined criticality but also deepen our understanding of gapless topological phases of matter.</description>

      <title>Time operator from parametrization invariance and implications for cosmology</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.02055v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Motivated by the parametrization invariance of cosmological Lagrangians and their equivalence to systems describing the motion of particles in curved backgrounds, we identify the phase space analogue of the notion of proper time. We define the corresponding quantum operator, which results in being canonically conjugate to that of the vanishing Hamiltonian. In the context of particle dynamics, this leads to an uncertainty relation of the form $\Delta E_0 \,\Delta T \geq \hbar$, where $E_0$ is the rest energy of the particle. By studying the non-relativistic limit, we show that the action of the operator reduces to multiplication by the classical time coordinate. Finally, we derive the generic expression for the introduced time variable in the cosmological setting.</description>

      <title>Neutrino Decoherence in kappa-Minkowski Quantum Spacetime: An Open Quantum Systems Paradigm</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.13061</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.13061v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate neutrino decoherence within the framework of quantum spacetime, focusing on the $\kappa$-Minkowski model. We show that stochastic fluctuations in quantum spacetime induce an energy-dependent decoherence effect, where the decoherence rate scales as $E^{-4}$. This result aligns with recent IceCube observations, indicating that quantum gravity does not induce significant decoherence for high-energy neutrinos. Additionally, we establish conditions under which quantum spacetime effects could influence relic neutrinos, such as those in the cosmic neutrino background ($C\nu B$). Our results shed light on how quantum spacetime fluctuations impact neutrino oscillation physics.</description>

      <title>Quantum Strong-to-Weak Spontaneous Symmetry Breaking in Decohered One Dimensional Critical States</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.14221</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.14221v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Symmetry breaking has been a central theme in classifying quantum phases and phase transitions. Recently, this concept has been extended to the mixed states of open systems, attracting considerable attention due to the emergence of novel physics beyond closed systems. In this Letter, we reveal a new type of phase transition in mixed states, termed \emph{quantum} strong-to-weak spontaneous symmetry breaking (SWSSB). Using a combination of field theory calculations and large-scale matrix product state simulations, we map out the global phase diagram of the XXZ critical spin chain under two-site XX decoherence, which features an SWSSB phase and a trivial Luttinger liquid phase, separated by a straight critical line that belongs to the boundary Berezinskii-Kosterlitz-Thouless universality class with a varying effective central charge. Remarkably, the SWSSB transition in our case is \emph{purely quantum} in the sense that it can only be driven by tuning the Hamiltonian parameter even under arbitrarily small decoherence strength, fundamentally distinguishing it from the decoherence-driven SWSSB transitions extensively discussed in previous literature. Conversely, no such phase transition occurs under ZZ decoherence. Finally, we also discuss the experimental relevance of our theory on quantum simulator platforms.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.18936v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate phase transitions in a non-Hermitian Su-Schrieffer-Heeger (SSH) model with an imaginary chemical potential via Krylov spread complexity and Krylov fidelity. The spread witnesses the $\mathcal{PT}$-transition for the non-Hermitian Bogoliubov vacuum of the SSH Hamiltonian, where the spectrum goes from purely real to complex (oscillatory dynamics to damped oscillations). In addition, it also witnesses the transition occurring in the $\mathcal{PT}$-broken phase, where the spectrum goes from complex to purely imaginary (damped oscillations to sheer decay). For a purely imaginary spectrum, the Krylov spread fidelity, which measures how the time-dependent spread reaches its stationary state value, serves as a probe of previously undetected dynamical phase transitions.</description>

      <title>The fundamental localization phases in quasiperiodic systems: A unified framework and exact results</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.24380</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.24380v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The disordered quantum systems host three types of quantum states, the extended, localized, and critical, which bring up various distinct fundamental phases, including the pure phases and coexisting ones with mobility edges. The quantum phases involving critical states are of particular importance, but are less understood compared with the other ones, and the different phases have been separately studied in different quasiperiodic models. Here we propose a unified framework based on a spinful quasiperiodic system which unifies the realizations of all the fundamental Anderson phases, with the exact and universal results being obtained for these distinct phases. Through the duality transformation and renormalization group method, we show that the pure phases are obtained when the (emergent) chiral symmetry preserves in the proposed spin-1/2 quasiperiodic model, which provides a criterion for the emergence of the pure phases or the coexisting ones with mobility edges. Further, we uncover a new universal mechanism for the critical states that the emergence of such states is protected by the generalized incommensurate matrix element zeros in the spinful quasiperiodic model, as a novel generalization of the quasiperiodic hopping zeros in the spinless systems. We also show with the Avila's global theory the criteria of exact solvability for the present unified quasiperiodic system, with which we identify several new quasiperiodic models derived from the spinful system hosting exactly solvable Anderson phases. In particular, we reach a single model that hosts all the seven fundamental phases of Anderson localization. Finally, an experimental scheme is proposed to realize these models using quasiperiodic optical Raman lattices.</description>

      <title>A Clue on Small-Capacitance Josephson Junction: What to Expect from Cooper Pair Ideal Conductor and Ohmic Resistor in Parallel?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.00258</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.00258v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: By using analytical and Worldline Monte Carlo approaches, we investigate the effects induced by quantum phase fluctuations combined with quasiparticle subgap and shunt resistances on a small-capacitance Josephson junction. By using the linear response theory in the presence of two biasing schemes, we prove that the ideal conduction, foreseen in the pioneering papers on this topic, is not robust against either quantum phase fluctuations or dissipative effects. By including both of them in the Hamiltonian, we prove that an increase of the Ohmic dissipation strength induces a Berezinskii-Kosterlitz-Thouless quantum phase transition in thermodynamic equilibrium. Then we study charge and phase fluctuations at the thermodynamic equilibrium within the linear response theory. We find that the phase particle motion, in a quantum Josephson junction, does not change from diffusive to localized, resulting in an insulator-superconductor transition, as is commonly believed. At the transition, we prove that: i) the motion of the phase particle changes from ballistic to localized; ii) by turning on the coupling with the environment, a long-lived excitation at finite frequency emerges in the charge response function: it evolves first into a resonance and then disappears at the transition. Consequences beyond the linear response regime are investigated, leading to an alternative comprehensive physical picture for this system: we predict a transition from a dissipative quasiparticle current to a polaronic Cooper pair current.</description>

      <title>Coupling and particle number intertwiners in the Calogero model</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.01177v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: It is long known that quantum Calogero models feature intertwining operators, which increase or decrease the coupling constant by an integer amount, for any fixed number of particles. We name these as ``horizontal'' and construct new ``vertical'' intertwiners, which \emph{change the number of interacting particles} for a fixed but integer value of the coupling constant. The emerging structure of a grid of intertwiners exists only in the algebraically integrable situation (integer coupling) and allows one to obtain each Liouville charge from the free power sum in the particle momenta by iterated intertwining either horizontally or vertically. We present recursion formul\ae\ for the intertwiners as a factorization problem for partial differential operators and prove their existence for small values of particle number and coupling. As a byproduct, a new basis of non-symmetric Liouville integrals appears, algebraically related to the standard symmetric one.</description>

      <title>Graph theory and tunable slow dynamics in quantum East Hamiltonians</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.03458</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.03458v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We show how graph theory concepts can provide an insight into the origin of slow dynamics in systems with kinetic constraints. In particular, we observe that slow dynamics is related to the presence of strong hierarchies between nodes on the Fock-space graph in the particle occupation basis, which encodes configurations connected by a given Hamiltonian. To quantify hierarchical structures, we develop a measure of centrality of the nodes, which is applicable to generic Hamiltonian matrices and inspired by established centrality measures from graph theory. We illustrate these ideas in the quantum East (QE) model. We introduce several ways of detuning nodes in the corresponding graph that alter the hierarchical structure, defining a family of QE models. We numerically demonstrate how these detunings affect the degree of non-ergodicity on finite systems, as evidenced by both the time dependence of density autocorrelations and eigenstate properties in the detuned QE models.</description>
