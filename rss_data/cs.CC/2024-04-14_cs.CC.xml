      <title>On the Power of Interactive Proofs for Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.08158</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.08158v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We continue the study of doubly-efficient proof systems for verifying agnostic PAC learning, for which we obtain the following results.
  - We construct an interactive protocol for learning the $t$ largest Fourier characters of a given function $f \colon \{0,1\}^n \to \{0,1\}$ up to an arbitrarily small error, wherein the verifier uses $\mathsf{poly}(t)$ random examples. This improves upon the Interactive Goldreich-Levin protocol of Goldwasser, Rothblum, Shafer, and Yehudayoff (ITCS 2021) whose sample complexity is $\mathsf{poly}(t,n)$.
  - For agnostically learning the class $\mathsf{AC}^0[2]$ under the uniform distribution, we build on the work of Carmosino, Impagliazzo, Kabanets, and Kolokolova (APPROX/RANDOM 2017) and design an interactive protocol, where given a function $f \colon \{0,1\}^n \to \{0,1\}$, the verifier learns the closest hypothesis up to $\mathsf{polylog}(n)$ multiplicative factor, using quasi-polynomially many random examples. In contrast, this class has been notoriously resistant even for constructing realisable learners (without a prover) using random examples.
  - For agnostically learning $k$-juntas under the uniform distribution, we obtain an interactive protocol, where the verifier uses $O(2^k)$ random examples to a given function $f \colon \{0,1\}^n \to \{0,1\}$. Crucially, the sample complexity of the verifier is independent of $n$.
  We also show that if we do not insist on doubly-efficient proof systems, then the model becomes trivial. Specifically, we show a protocol for an arbitrary class $\mathcal{C}$ of Boolean functions in the distribution-free setting, where the verifier uses $O(1)$ labeled examples to learn $f$.</description>

      <title>Resolution Over Linear Equations: Combinatorial Games for Tree-like Size and Space</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.08370</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.08370v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider the proof system Res($\oplus$) introduced by Itsykson and Sokolov (Ann. Pure Appl. Log.'20), which is an extension of the resolution proof system and operates with disjunctions of linear equations over $\mathbb{F}_2$.
  We study characterizations of tree-like size and space of Res($\oplus$) refutations using combinatorial games. Namely, we introduce a class of extensible formulas and prove tree-like size lower bounds on it using Prover-Delayer games, as well as space lower bounds. This class is of particular interest since it contains many classical combinatorial principles, including the pigeonhole, ordering, and dense linear ordering principles.
  Furthermore, we present the width-space relation for Res($\oplus$) generalizing the results by Atserias and Dalmau (J. Comput. Syst. Sci.'08) and their variant of Spoiler-Duplicator games.</description>

      <title>Complexity of Probabilistic Reasoning for Neurosymbolic Classification Techniques</title>

Abstract: Neurosymbolic artificial intelligence is a growing field of research aiming to combine neural network learning capabilities with the reasoning abilities of symbolic systems. Informed multi-label classification is a sub-field of neurosymbolic AI which studies how to leverage prior knowledge to improve neural classification systems. A well known family of neurosymbolic techniques for informed classification use probabilistic reasoning to integrate this knowledge during learning, inference or both. Therefore, the asymptotic complexity of probabilistic reasoning is of cardinal importance to assess the scalability of such techniques. However, this topic is rarely tackled in the neurosymbolic literature, which can lead to a poor understanding of the limits of probabilistic neurosymbolic techniques. In this paper, we introduce a formalism for informed supervised classification tasks and techniques. We then build upon this formalism to define three abstract neurosymbolic techniques based on probabilistic reasoning. Finally, we show computational complexity results on several representation languages for prior knowledge commonly found in the neurosymbolic literature.</description>

      <title>Counting Subgraphs in Somewhere Dense Graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2209.03402</link>
      <description>arXiv:2209.03402v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the problems of counting copies and induced copies of a small pattern graph $H$ in a large host graph $G$. Recent work fully classified the complexity of those problems according to structural restrictions on the patterns $H$. In this work, we address the more challenging task of analysing the complexity for restricted patterns and restricted hosts. Specifically we ask which families of allowed patterns and hosts imply fixed-parameter tractability, i.e., the existence of an algorithm running in time $f(H)\cdot |G|^{O(1)}$ for some computable function $f$. Our main results present exhaustive and explicit complexity classifications for families that satisfy natural closure properties. Among others, we identify the problems of counting small matchings and independent sets in subgraph-closed graph classes $\mathcal{G}$ as our central objects of study and establish the following crisp dichotomies as consequences of the Exponential Time Hypothesis: (1) Counting $k$-matchings in a graph $G\in\mathcal{G}$ is fixed-parameter tractable if and only if $\mathcal{G}$ is nowhere dense. (2) Counting $k$-independent sets in a graph $G\in\mathcal{G}$ is fixed-parameter tractable if and only if $\mathcal{G}$ is nowhere dense. Moreover, we obtain almost tight conditional lower bounds if $\mathcal{G}$ is somewhere dense, i.e., not nowhere dense. These base cases of our classifications subsume a wide variety of previous results on the matching and independent set problem, such as counting $k$-matchings in bipartite graphs (Curticapean, Marx; FOCS 14), in $F$-colourable graphs (Roth, Wellnitz; SODA 20), and in degenerate graphs (Bressan, Roth; FOCS 21), as well as counting $k$-independent sets in bipartite graphs (Curticapean et al.; Algorithmica 19).</description>

      <title>On the complexity of isomorphism problems for tensors, groups, and polynomials IV: linear-length reductions and their applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.16317</link>
      <description>arXiv:2306.16317v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Many isomorphism problems for tensors, groups, algebras, and polynomials were recently shown to be equivalent to one another under polynomial-time reductions, prompting the introduction of the complexity class TI (Grochow &amp; Qiao, ITCS '21; SIAM J. Comp., '23). Using the tensorial viewpoint, Grochow &amp; Qiao (CCC '21) then gave moderately exponential-time search- and counting-to-decision reductions for a class of $p$-groups. A significant issue was that the reductions usually incurred a quadratic increase in the length of the tensors involved. When the tensors represent $p$-groups, this corresponds to an increase in the order of the group of the form $|G|^{\Theta(\log |G|)}$, negating any asymptotic gains in the Cayley table model.
  In this paper, we present a new kind of tensor gadget that allows us to replace those quadratic-length reductions with linear-length ones, yielding the following consequences:
  1. If Graph Isomorphism is in P, then testing equivalence of cubic forms in $n$ variables over $F_q$, and testing isomorphism of $n$-dimensional algebras over $F_q$, can both be solved in time $q^{O(n)}$, improving from the brute-force upper bound $q^{O(n^2)}$ for both of these.
  2. Combined with the $|G|^{O((\log |G|)^{5/6})}$-time isomorphism-test for $p$-groups of class 2 and exponent $p$ (Sun, STOC '23), our reductions extend this runtime to $p$-groups of class $c$ and exponent $p$ where $c&lt;p$, and yield algorithms in time $q^{O(n^{1.8}\cdot \log q)}$ for cubic form equivalence and algebra isomorphism.
  3. Polynomial-time search- and counting-to-decision reduction for testing isomorphism of $p$-groups of class $2$ and exponent $p$ when Cayley tables are given. This answers questions of Arvind and T\'oran (Bull. EATCS, 2005) for this group class, thought to be one of the hardest cases of Group Isomorphism.</description>

      <title>Agreement theorems for high dimensional expanders in the small soundness regime: the role of covers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.09582</link>
      <description>arXiv:2308.09582v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Given a family $X$ of subsets of $[n]$ and an ensemble of local functions $\{f_s:s\to\Sigma\; | \; s\in X\}$, an agreement test is a randomized property tester that is supposed to test whether there is some global function $G:[n]\to\Sigma$ such that $f_s=G|_s$ for many sets $s$. A "classical" small-soundness agreement theorem is a list-decoding $(LD)$ statement, saying that \[\tag{$LD$} Agree(\{f_s\}) &gt; \varepsilon \quad \Longrightarrow \quad \exists G^1,\dots, G^\ell,\quad P_s[f_s\overset{0.99}{\approx}G^i|_s]\geq poly(\varepsilon),\;i=1,\dots,\ell. \] Such a statement is motivated by PCP questions and has been shown in the case where $X=\binom{[n]}k$, or where $X$ is a collection of low dimensional subspaces of a vector space.
  In this work we study small the case of on high dimensional expanders $X$. It has been an open challenge to analyze their small soundness behavior. Surprisingly, the small soundness behavior turns out to be governed by the topological covers of $X$.We show that:
  1. If $X$ has no connected covers, then $(LD)$ holds, provided that $X$ satisfies an additional expansion property.
  2. If $X$ has a connected cover, then $(LD)$ necessarily fails.
  3. If $X$ has a connected cover (and assuming the additional expansion property), we replace the $(LD)$ by a weaker statement we call lift-decoding:
  \[ \tag{$LFD$}
  Agree(\{f_s\})&gt; \varepsilon \Longrightarrow \quad \exists\text{ cover }\rho:Y\twoheadrightarrow X,\text{ and }G:Y(0)\to\Sigma,\text{ such that }\] \[P_{{\tilde s\twoheadrightarrow s}}[f_s \overset{0.99}{\approx} G|_{\tilde s}] \geq poly(\varepsilon),\] where ${\tilde s\twoheadrightarrow s}$ means that $\rho(\tilde s)=s$.
  The additional expansion property is cosystolic expansion of a complex derived from $X$ holds for the spherical building and for quotients of the Bruhat-Tits building.</description>

      <title>Low Acceptance Agreement Tests via Bounded-Degree Symplectic HDXs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.01078</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.01078v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We solve the derandomized direct product testing question in the low acceptance regime, by constructing new high dimensional expanders that have no small connected covers. We show that our complexes have swap cocycle expansion, which allows us to deduce the agreement theorem by relying on previous work.
  Derandomized direct product testing, also known as agreement testing, is the following problem. Let X be a family of k-element subsets of [n] and let $\{f_s:s\to\Sigma\}_{s\in X}$ be an ensemble of local functions, each defined over a subset $s\subset [n]$. Suppose that we run the following so-called agreement test: choose a random pair of sets $s_1,s_2\in X$ that intersect on $\sqrt k$ elements, and accept if $f_{s_1},f_{s_2}$ agree on the elements in $s_1\cap s_2$. We denote the success probability of this test by $Agr(\{f_s\})$. Given that $Agr(\{f_s\})=\epsilon&gt;0$, is there a global function $G:[n]\to\Sigma$ such that $f_s = G|_s$ for a non-negligible fraction of $s\in X$ ?
  We construct a family X of k-subsets of $[n]$ such that $|X| = O(n)$ and such that it satisfies the low acceptance agreement theorem. Namely,
  $Agr (\{f_s\}) &gt; \epsilon \; \; \longrightarrow$ there is a function $G:[n]\to\Sigma$ such that $\Pr_s[f_s\overset{0.99}{\approx} G|_s]\geq poly(\epsilon)$.
  A key idea is to replace the well-studied LSV complexes by symplectic high dimensional expanders (HDXs). The family X is just the k-faces of the new symplectic HDXs. The later serve our needs better since their fundamental group satisfies the congruence subgroup property, which implies that they lack small covers. We also give a polynomial-time algorithm to construct this family of symplectic HDXs.</description>

      <title>The Expressive Power of Transformers with Chain of Thought</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.07923</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.07923v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recent theoretical work has identified surprisingly simple reasoning problems, such as checking if two nodes in a graph are connected or simulating finite-state machines, that are provably unsolvable by standard transformers that answer immediately after reading their input. However, in practice, transformers' reasoning can be improved by allowing them to use a "chain of thought" or "scratchpad", i.e., generate and condition on a sequence of intermediate tokens before answering. Motivated by this, we ask: Does such intermediate generation fundamentally extend the computational power of a decoder-only transformer? We show that the answer is yes, but the amount of increase depends crucially on the amount of intermediate generation. For instance, we find that transformer decoders with a logarithmic number of decoding steps (w.r.t. the input length) push the limits of standard transformers only slightly, while a linear number of decoding steps, assuming projected pre-norm (a slight generalization of standard pre-norm), adds a clear new ability (under standard complexity conjectures): recognizing all regular languages. Our results also imply that linear steps keep transformer decoders within context-sensitive languages, and polynomial steps with generalized pre-norm make them recognize exactly the class of polynomial-time solvable problems -- the first exact characterization of a type of transformers in terms of standard complexity classes. Together, this provides a nuanced framework for understanding how the length of a transformer's chain of thought or scratchpad impacts its reasoning power.</description>

      <title>Pseudoentanglement Ain't Cheap</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.00126v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We show that any pseudoentangled state ensemble with a gap of $t$ bits of entropy requires $\Omega(t)$ non-Clifford gates to prepare. This bound is tight up to polylogarithmic factors if linear-time quantum-secure pseudorandom functions exist. Our result follows from a polynomial-time algorithm to estimate the entanglement entropy of a quantum state across any cut of qubits. When run on an $n$-qubit state that is stabilized by at least $2^{n-t}$ Pauli operators, our algorithm produces an estimate that is within an additive factor of $\frac{t}{2}$ bits of the true entanglement entropy.</description>
