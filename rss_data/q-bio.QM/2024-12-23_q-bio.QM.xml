      <title>GraphSeqLM: A Unified Graph Language Framework for Omic Graph Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.15790</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.15790v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The integration of multi-omic data is pivotal for understanding complex diseases, but its high dimensionality and noise present significant challenges. Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) offer a robust framework for analyzing large-scale signaling pathways and protein-protein interaction networks, yet they face limitations in expressivity when capturing intricate biological relationships. To address this, we propose Graph Sequence Language Model (GraphSeqLM), a framework that enhances GNNs with biological sequence embeddings generated by Large Language Models (LLMs). These embeddings encode structural and biological properties of DNA, RNA, and proteins, augmenting GNNs with enriched features for analyzing sample-specific multi-omic data. By integrating topological, sequence-derived, and biological information, GraphSeqLM demonstrates superior predictive accuracy and outperforms existing methods, paving the way for more effective multi-omic data integration in precision medicine.</description>

      <title>Mamba-based Deep Learning Approaches for Sleep Staging on a Wireless Multimodal Wearable System without Electroencephalography</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.15947</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.15947v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Study Objectives: We investigate using Mamba-based deep learning approaches for sleep staging on signals from ANNE One (Sibel Health, Evanston, IL), a minimally intrusive dual-sensor wireless wearable system measuring chest electrocardiography (ECG), triaxial accelerometry, and temperature, as well as finger photoplethysmography (PPG) and temperature.
  Methods: We obtained wearable sensor recordings from 360 adults undergoing concurrent clinical polysomnography (PSG) at a tertiary care sleep lab. PSG recordings were scored according to AASM criteria. PSG and wearable sensor data were automatically aligned using their ECG channels with manual confirmation by visual inspection. We trained Mamba-based models with both convolutional-recurrent neural network (CRNN) and the recurrent neural network (RNN) architectures on these recordings. Ensembling of model variants with similar architectures was performed.
  Results: Our best approach, after ensembling, attains a 3-class (wake, NREM, REM) balanced accuracy of 83.50%, F1 score of 84.16%, Cohen's $\kappa$ of 72.68%, and a MCC score of 72.84%; a 4-class (wake, N1/N2, N3, REM) balanced accuracy of 74.64%, F1 score of 74.56%, Cohen's $\kappa$ of 61.63%, and MCC score of 62.04%; a 5-class (wake, N1, N2, N3, REM) balanced accuracy of 64.30%, F1 score of 66.97%, Cohen's $\kappa$ of 53.23%, MCC score of 54.38%.
  Conclusions: Deep learning models can infer major sleep stages from a wearable system without electroencephalography (EEG) and can be successfully applied to data from adults attending a tertiary care sleep clinic.</description>

      <title>actifpTM: a refined confidence metric of AlphaFold2 predictions involving flexible regions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.15970</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.15970v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: One of the main advantages of deep learning models of protein structure, such as Alphafold2, is their ability to accurately estimate the confidence of a generated structural model, which allows us to focus on highly confident predictions.The ipTM score provides a confidence estimate of interchain contacts in protein-protein interactions. However, interactions, in particular motif-mediated interactions, often also contain regions that remain flexible upon binding. These non-interacting flanking regions are assigned low confidence values and will affect iPTM, as it considers all interchain residue pairs, and two models of the same motif-domain interaction, but differing in the length of their flanking regions, would be assigned very different values. Here we propose actifpTM (actual interface pTM), a modified ipTM measure, that focuses on the confident region of an interaction, resulting in a more robust measure of interaction confidence, even when not the full interaction is structured. actifpTM has been incorporated into ColabFold.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.15806v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Summary: Mass spectrometry coupled to liquid chromatography (LC-MS/MS) is a powerful technique for the charac-terisation of proteomes. However, the diverse software platforms available for processing the raw proteomics data, each produce their own output format, making the extraction of meaningful and interpretable results a difficult task. We present TraianProt, a web-based, user-friendly proteomics data analysis platform, that enables the analysis of both label-free and labeled data from Data-Dependent or Data-Independent Acquisition mass spectrometry mode support-ing different computational platforms such as MaxQuant, MSFragger, DIA-NN, ProteoScape and Proteome Discoverer output formats. TraianProt provides a dynamic framework that includes several processing modules allowing the user to perform a complete downstream analysis covering the stages of data pre-processing, differential expression analy-sis, functional analysis and protein-protein interaction analysis. Data output includes a wide range of high-quality, cus-tomisable graphs such as heatmap, volcano plot, boxplot and barplot. This allows users to extract biological insights from proteomic data without any programming skills. Availability and implementation: TraianProt is implemented in R. Its code and documentation are available on GitHub at https://github.com/SamueldelaCamaraFuentes/TraianProt along with a step-by-step tutorial incorporated in the repository. Contact: sdelacam@ucm.es Supplementary information: Supplementary data are available at Bioinformatics online</description>

      <title>mRNA2vec: mRNA Embedding with Language Model in the 5'UTR-CDS for mRNA Design</title>

Abstract: Messenger RNA (mRNA)-based vaccines are accelerating the discovery of new drugs and revolutionizing the pharmaceutical industry. However, selecting particular mRNA sequences for vaccines and therapeutics from extensive mRNA libraries is costly. Effective mRNA therapeutics require carefully designed sequences with optimized expression levels and stability. This paper proposes a novel contextual language model (LM)-based embedding method: mRNA2vec. In contrast to existing mRNA embedding approaches, our method is based on the self-supervised teacher-student learning framework of data2vec. We jointly use the 5' untranslated region (UTR) and coding sequence (CDS) region as the input sequences. We adapt our LM-based approach specifically to mRNA by 1) considering the importance of location on the mRNA sequence with probabilistic masking, 2) using Minimum Free Energy (MFE) prediction and Secondary Structure (SS) classification as additional pretext tasks. mRNA2vec demonstrates significant improvements in translation efficiency (TE) and expression level (EL) prediction tasks in UTR compared to SOTA methods such as UTR-LM. It also gives a competitive performance in mRNA stability and protein production level tasks in CDS such as CodonBERT.</description>

      <title>Employing observability rank conditions for taking into account experimental information a priori</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.06984</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.06984v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The concept of identifiability describes the possibility of inferring the parameters of a dynamic model by observing its output. It is common and useful to distinguish between structural and practical identifiability. The former property is fully determined by the model equations, while the latter is also influenced by the characteristics of the available experimental data. Structural identifiability can be determined by means of symbolic computations, which may be performed before collecting experimental data, and are hence sometimes called a priori analyses. Practical identifiability is typically assessed numerically, with methods that require simulations - and often also optimization - and are applied a posteriori. An approach to study structural local identifiability is to consider it as a particular case of observability, which is the possibility of inferring the internal state of a system from its output. Thus, both properties can be analysed jointly, by building a generalized observability matrix and computing its rank. The aim of this paper is to investigate to which extent such observability-based methods can also inform about practical aspects related with the experimental setup, which are usually not approached in this way. To this end, we explore a number of possible extensions of the rank tests, and discuss the purposes for which they can be informative as well as others for which they cannot.</description>

      <title>A Deep Learning-Based Fully Automated Pipeline for Regurgitant Mitral Valve Anatomy Analysis From 3D Echocardiography</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2302.10634</link>
      <description>arXiv:2302.10634v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Three-dimensional transesophageal echocardiography (3DTEE) is the recommended imaging technique for the assessment of mitral valve (MV) morphology and lesions in case of mitral regurgitation (MR) requiring surgical or transcatheter repair. Such assessment is key to thorough intervention planning and to intraprocedural guidance. However, it requires segmentation from 3DTEE images, which is timeconsuming, operator-dependent, and often merely qualitative. In the present work, a novel workflow to quantify the patient-specific MV geometry from 3DTEE is proposed. The developed approach relies on a 3D multi-decoder residual convolutional neural network (CNN) with a U-Net architecture for multi-class segmentation of MV annulus and leaflets. The CNN was trained and tested on a dataset comprising 55 3DTEE examinations of MR-affected patients. After training, the CNN is embedded into a fully automatic, and hence fully repeatable, pipeline that refines the predicted segmentation, detects MV anatomical landmarks and quantifies MV morphology. The trained 3D CNN achieves an average Dice score of $0.82 \pm 0.06$, mean surface distance of $0.43 \pm 0.14$ mm and 95% Hausdorff Distance (HD) of $3.57 \pm 1.56$ mm before segmentation refinement, outperforming a state-of-the-art baseline residual U-Net architecture, and provides an unprecedented multi-class segmentation of the annulus, anterior and posterior leaflet. The automatic 3D linear morphological measurements of the annulus and leaflets, specifically diameters and lengths, exhibit differences of less than 1.45 mm when compared to ground truth values. These measurements also demonstrate strong overall agreement with analyses conducted by semi-automated commercial software. The whole process requires minimal user interaction and requires approximately 15 seconds</description>
