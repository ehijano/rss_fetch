      <title>Steering cooperation: Adversarial attacks on prisoner's dilemma in complex networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.19692</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.19692v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study examines the application of adversarial attack concepts to control the evolution of cooperation in the prisoner's dilemma game in complex networks. Specifically, it proposes a simple adversarial attack method that drives players' strategies towards a target state by adding small perturbations to social networks. The proposed method is evaluated on both model and real-world networks. Numerical simulations demonstrate that the proposed method can effectively promote cooperation with significantly smaller perturbations compared to other techniques. Additionally, this study shows that adversarial attacks can also be useful in inhibiting cooperation (promoting defection). The findings reveal that adversarial attacks on social networks can be potent tools for both promoting and inhibiting cooperation, opening new possibilities for controlling cooperative behavior in social systems while also highlighting potential risks.</description>

      <title>Uncovering the hidden core-periphery structure in hyperbolic networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.19953</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.19953v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The hyperbolic network models exhibit very fundamental and essential features, like small-worldness, scale-freeness, high-clustering coefficient, and community structure. In this paper, we comprehensively explore the presence of an important feature, the core-periphery structure, in the hyperbolic network models, which is often exhibited by real-world networks. We focused on well-known hyperbolic models such as popularity-similarity optimization model (PSO) and S1/H2 models and studied core-periphery structures using a well-established method that is based on standard random walk Markov chain model. The observed core-periphery centralization values indicate that the core-periphery structure can be very pronounced under certain conditions. We also validate our findings by statistically testing for the significance of the observed core-periphery structure in the network geometry. This study extends network science and reveals core-periphery insights applicable to various domains, enhancing network performance and resiliency in transportation and information systems.</description>

      <title>A Network-Based Measure of Cosponsorship Influence on Bill Passing in the United States House of Representatives</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.19554</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.19554v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Each year, the United States Congress considers {thousands of legislative proposals to select bills} to present to the US President to sign into law. Naturally, the decision processes of members of Congress are subject to peer influence. In this paper, we examine the effect on bill passage of accrued influence between US Congress members in the US House of Representatives. We explore how the influence of a bill's cosponsors affects the bill's outcome (specifically, whether or not it passes in the House). We define a notion of influence by analyzing the structure of a network that we construct {using} cosponsorship dynamics. We award `influence' between a pair of Congress members when they cosponsor a bill that achieves some amount of legislative success. We find that properties of the bill cosponsorship network can be a useful signal to examine influence in Congress; they help explain why some bills pass and others fail. We compare our measure of influence to off-the-shelf centrality measures and conclude that our influence measure is more indicative of bill passage.</description>

      <title>Statistical Analysis on Scale and Regional Distribution of Undergraduate Physics Programs in Korean Universities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.19679</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.19679v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We report on the temporal changes in undergraduate-level physics programs at Korean universities from 1915 to 2023 by analyzing data on physics-related departments and their students using basic statistics and the scaling theory of statistical physics. Our analysis reveals that the number of departments peaked around the turn of the 21st century, and it has been steadily decreasing ever since, with particularly severe declines in private universities located outside the capital region. Besides the change in the overall numbers, we also show the change in the self-identity of physics-related departments reflected in department names, which reveals a recent trend of emphasizing more application-side such as semiconductors and data. As a sophisticated measure to quantify regional imbalances relative to the population eligible for higher education, we present scaling exponents from the scaling theory, which shows a shift from sublinear to linear for departments and a shift from linear to superlinear for students. The result indicates the exacerbation of the regional imbalance of university-level physics education in Korea.</description>

      <title>A political radicalization framework based on Moral Foundations Theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.19878</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.19878v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Moral Foundations Theory proposes that individuals with conflicting political views base their behavior on different principles chosen from a small group of universal moral foundations. This study proposes using a set of widely accepted moral foundations (Fairness, Ingroup loyalty, Authority, and Purity) as proxies to determine the degree of radicalization of online communities. The fifth principle, Care, is generally surpassed by others, which are higher in the radicalized groups' moral hierarchy. Moreover, the presented data-driven methodological framework proposes an alternative way to measure whether a community complies with some moral principle or foundation: not evaluating its speech, but its behavior through interactions of its individuals, establishing a bridge between structural features of the interaction network and the intensity of communities' radicalization regarding the considered moral foundations. Two foundations may be assessed using the network's structural characteristics: Ingroup loyalty measured by group-level modularity, and Authority evaluated using group domination for detecting potential hierarchical substructures within the network. By analyzing the set of Pareto-optimal groups regarding a multidimensional moral relevance scale, the most radicalized communities are identified among those considered extreme in some of their attitudes or views. The application of the proposed framework is illustrated using real-world datasets. The radicalized communities' behavior exhibits increasing isolation, and its authorities and leaders show growing domination over their audience. There were also detected differences between users' behavior and speech, showing that individuals tend to share more 'extreme' ingroup content than that they publish: extreme views get more likes on social media.</description>

      <title>Attraction by pairwise coherence explains the emergence of ideological sorting</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.12559</link>
      <description>arXiv:2304.12559v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Political polarization has become a growing concern in democratic societies, as it drives tribal alignments and erodes civic deliberation among citizens. Given its prevalence across different countries, previous research has sought to understand under which conditions people tend to endorse extreme opinions. However, in polarized contexts, citizens not only adopt more extreme views but also become correlated across issues that are, a priori, seemingly unrelated. This phenomenon, known as "ideological sorting", has been receiving greater attention in recent years but the micro-level mechanisms underlying its emergence remain poorly understood. Here, we study the conditions under which a social dynamic system is expected to become ideologically sorted as a function of the mechanisms of interaction between its individuals. To this end, we developed and analyzed a multidimensional agent-based model that incorporates two mechanisms: homophily (where people tend to interact with those holding similar opinions) and pairwise-coherence favoritism (where people tend to interact with ingroups holding politically coherent opinions). We numerically integrated the model's master equations that perfectly describe the system's dynamics and found that ideological sorting only emerges in models that include pairwise-coherence favoritism. We then compared the model's outcomes with empirical data from 24,035 opinions across 67 topics and found that pairwise-coherence favoritism is significantly present in datasets that measure political attitudes but absent across topics not considered related to politics. Overall, this work combines theoretical approaches from system dynamics with model-based analyses of empirical data to uncover a potential mechanism underlying the pervasiveness of ideological sorting.</description>

      <title>The evolution of pluralistic ignorance</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.00195</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.00195v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Pluralistic ignorance is a social-psychological phenomenon that occurs when individuals privately hold beliefs that differ from perceived group norms. Traditional models, based on opinion dynamics with private and public states, fail to account for a key aspect: when nonexpression aligns with normative behavior, initial social pressure can induce pluralistic ignorance. We show that pluralistic ignorance persists under infrequent imitation and strong initial minority influence. Although individuals can overcome this ignorance by the end of interactions, it reemerges in subsequent meetings. However, excessive imitation erases pluralistic ignorance, leading to a uniform state in which internal and external states align. Furthermore, incorporating memory into the internalization process shows that pluralistic ignorance peaks at moderate imitation levels.</description>

      <title>Socioeconomic agents as active matter in nonequilibrium Sakoda-Schelling models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.14270</link>
      <description>arXiv:2307.14270v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: How robust are socioeconomic agent-based models with respect to the details of the agents' decision rule? We tackle this question by considering an occupation model in the spirit of the Sakoda-Schelling model, historically introduced to shed light on segregation dynamics among human groups. For a large class of utility functions and decision rules, we pinpoint the nonequilibrium nature of the agent dynamics, while recovering the equilibrium-like phase separation phenomenology. Within the mean field approximation we show how the model can be mapped, to some extent, onto an active matter field description. Finally, we consider non-reciprocal interactions between two populations, and show how they can lead to non-steady macroscopic behavior. We believe our approach provides a unifying framework to further study geography-dependent agent-based models, notably paving the way for joint consideration of population and price dynamics within a field theoretic approach.</description>

      <title>The Persistence of Contrarianism on Twitter: Mapping users' sharing habits for the Ukraine war, COVID-19 vaccination, and the 2022 Midterm Elections</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.16175</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.16175v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Empirical studies of online disinformation emphasize matters of public concern such as the COVID-19 pandemic, foreign election interference, and the Russo-Ukraine war, largely in studies that treat the topics separately. Comparatively fewer studies attempt to relate such disparate topics and address the extent to which they share behaviors. In this study, we compare three samples of Twitter data on COVID-19 vaccination, the Ukraine war and the 2022 midterm elections, to ascertain how distinct ideological stances of users across the three samples might be related. Our results indicate the emergence of a broad contrarian stance that is defined by its opposition to public health narratives/policies along with the Biden administration's foreign policy stances. Sharing activity within the contrarian position falls on a spectrum with outright conspiratorial content on one end. We confirm the existence of ideologically coherent cross-subject stances among Twitter users, but in a manner not squarely aligned with right-left political orientations.</description>
