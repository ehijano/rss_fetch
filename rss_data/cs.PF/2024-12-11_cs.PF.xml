      <title>Accurate Performance Modeling And Uncertainty Analysis of Lossy Compression in Scientific Applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.07015</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.07015v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Scientific applications typically generate large volumes of floating-point data, making lossy compression one of the most effective methods for data reduction, thereby lowering storage requirements and improving performance in large-scale applications. However, variations in compression time can significantly impact overall performance improvement, due to inaccurate scheduling, workload imbalances, etc. Existing approaches rely on empirical methods to predict the compression performance, which often lack interpretability and suffer from limitations in accuracy and generalizability. In this paper, we propose surrogate models for predicting the compression time of prediction-based lossy compression and provide a detailed analysis of the factors influencing time variability with uncertainty analysis. Our evaluation shows that our solution can accuratly predict the compression time with 5% average error across six scientific datasets. It also provides accurate 95% confidence interval, which is essential for time-sensitive scheduling and applications.</description>

      <title>A Robust Sustainability Assessment Methodology for Aircraft Parts: Application to a Fuselage Panel</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.07421</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.07421v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The paper presents a cradle-to-gate sustainability assessment methodology specifically designed to evaluate aircraft components in a robust and systematic manner. This methodology integrates multi-criteria decision-making (MCDM) analysis across ten criteria, categorized under environmental impact, cost, and performance. Environmental impact is analyzed through life cycle assessment and cost through life cycle costing, with both analyses facilitated by SimaPro software. Performance is measured in terms of component mass and specific stiffness. The robustness of this methodology is tested through various MCDM techniques, normalization approaches, and objective weighting methods. To demonstrate the methodology, the paper assesses the sustainability of a fuselage panel, comparing nine variants that differ in materials, joining techniques, and part thicknesses. All approaches consistently identify thermoplastic CFRP panels as the most sustainable option, with the geometric mean aggregation of weights providing balanced criteria consideration across environmental, cost, and performance aspects. The adaptability of this proposed methodology is illustrated, showing its applicability to any aircraft component with the requisite data. This structured approach offers critical insights to support sustainable decision-making in aircraft component design and procurement.</description>

      <title>A clustering aggregation algorithm on neutral-atoms and annealing quantum processors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.07558</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.07558v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This work presents a hybrid quantum-classical algorithm to perform clustering aggregation, designed for neutral-atoms quantum computers and quantum annealers. Clustering aggregation is a technique that mitigates the weaknesses of clustering algorithms, an important class of data science methods for partitioning datasets, and is widely employed in many real-world applications. By expressing the clustering aggregation problem instances as a Maximum Independent Set (MIS) problem and as a Quadratic Unconstrained Binary Optimization (QUBO) problem, it was possible to solve them by leveraging the potential of Pasqal's Fresnel (neutral-atoms processor) and D-Wave's Advantage QPU (quantum annealer). Additionally, the designed clustering aggregation algorithm was first validated on a Fresnel emulator based on QuTiP and later on an emulator of the same machine based on tensor networks, provided by Pasqal. The results revealed technical limitations, such as the difficulty of adding additional constraints on the employed neutral-atoms platform and the need for better metrics to measure the quality of the produced clusterings. However, this work represents a step towards a benchmark to compare two different machines: a quantum annealer and a neutral-atom quantum computer. Moreover, findings suggest promising potential for future advancements in hybrid quantum-classical pipelines, although further improvements are needed in both quantum and classical components.</description>
