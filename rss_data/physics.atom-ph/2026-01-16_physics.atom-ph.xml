      <title>Electro-optic frequency comb Doppler thermometry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.10575</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.10575v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We demonstrate a Doppler thermometer based on direct optical frequency comb spectroscopy of an $^{85}$Rb vapor with a chirped electro-optic frequency comb (EOFC). The direct EOFC Doppler thermometer is accurate to within its approximately 1 K statistical uncertainty. We experimentally compare direct EOFC spectroscopy with conventional Doppler spectroscopy using a single-frequency, step-scanned laser probe. Our results show that direct EOFC spectroscopy mitigates transit-induced optical pumping distortion of the atomic lineshape, which is the dominant systematic temperature shift in alkali atom Doppler thermometry. Optical Bloch equation simulations of conventional and direct EOFC Doppler spectroscopy confirm that EOFC spectroscopy can use higher optical power to reduce statistical noise without optical pumping distortion. Our results indicate that EOFC Doppler thermometry is a promising approach to realizing a primary thermometer with size and measurement rate sufficient for applications including pharmaceutical manufacturing and nuclear waste monitoring.</description>

      <title>Enhanced multi-parameter metrology in dissipative Rydberg atom time crystals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.10347</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.10347v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The pursuit of unprecedented sensitivity in quantum enhanced metrology has spurred interest in non-equilibrium quantum phases of matter and their symmetry breaking. In particular, criticality-enhanced metrology through time-translation symmetry breaking in many-body systems, a distinct paradigm compared to spatial symmetry breaking, is a field still in its infancy. Here, we have investigated the enhanced sensing at the boundary of a continuous time-crystal (CTC) phase in a driven Rydberg atomic gas. By mapping the full phase diagram, we identify the parameter-dependent phase boundary where the time-translation symmetry is broken. This allows us to use a single setup for measuring multiple parameters, in particular frequency and amplitude of a microwave field. By increasing the microwave field amplitude, we first observe a phase transition from a thermal phase to a CTC phase, followed by a second transition into a distinct CTC state, characterized by a different oscillation frequency. Furthermore, we reveal the precise relationship between the CTC phase boundary and the scanning rate, displaying enhanced precision beyond the Standard Quantum Limit. This work not only provides a promising paradigm rooted in the critical properties of time crystals, but also advances a method for multi-parameter sensing in non-equilibrium quantum phases.</description>

      <title>Cloud parameter estimation for interacting BEC after time-of-flight</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.10415</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.10415v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Experiments on Bose-Einstein condensates at finite temperature typically extract the system parameters, such as temperature, atom number, and condensed fraction from time-of-flight images taken after a free expansion time. This paper systematically examines the effect of repulsive interactions between the condensed and thermal atoms in partially condensed clouds on the expansion profile of the thermal cloud. An analytical expression for the expansion can be obtained only if the interactions between the Bose-Einstein condensate and thermal atoms are neglected, resulting in a Bose-enhanced distribution for the thermal component. Here, the deformation of the cloud due to interactions and the effects on estimated parameters are investigated by simulating the expansion using a ballistic approximation. By fitting the simulated expansion profiles with a Bose-enhanced distribution, the errors of using such a fit are estimated, and the results are explained phenomenologically. The simulation was also used as a fitting function for experimental data, showing better agreement of the extracted condensed fraction with the semi-ideal model than results from a Bose-enhanced fit.</description>

      <title>Counterdiabatic driving for random-gap Landau-Zener transitions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.10659</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.10659v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Landau--Zener (LZ) model describes a two-level quantum system that undergoes an avoided crossing. In the adiabatic limit, the transition probability vanishes. An auxiliary control field $H_\text{CD}$ can be reverse-engineered so that the full Hamiltonian $H_0 + H_\text{CD}$ reproduces adiabaticity for all parameter values. Our aim is to construct a single control field $H_1$ that drives an ensemble of LZ-type Hamiltonians with a distribution of energy gaps. $H_1$ works best statistically, minimizing the average transition probability. We restrict our attention to a special class of $H_1$ controls, motivated by $H_\text{CD}$. We found a systematic trade-off between instantaneous adiabaticity and the final transition probability. Certain limiting cases with a linear sweep can be treated analytically; one of them being the LZ system with Dirac $\delta(t)$ function. Comprehensive and systematic numerical simulations support and extend the analytic results.</description>

Abstract: Cryogenic buffer gas sources are ubiquitous for producing cold, collimated molecular beams for quantum science, chemistry, and precision measurements. The molecules are typically produced by laser ablating a metal target in the presence of a donor gas. The radical of interest emerges due to a barrier-free reaction or under thermal or optical excitation. High-barrier reactions, such as between Ca and H$_2$, should be precluded. We study chemical reactions between Ca and three hydrogen isotopologues H$_2$, D$_2$, and HD in a cryogenic cell with helium buffer gas. We observe that H$_2$ can serve as both a reactant and a buffer gas, outperforming D$_2$ and HD. We use a reaction network model to describe the chemical dynamics and find that the enhanced molecular yield can be attributed to rapid vibrational excitations of the reactant gas. Our results demonstrate a robust method for generating bright cold beams of alkaline-earth-metal hydrides for laser cooling and trapping.</description>

      <title>Single-photon loading of polar molecules into an optical trap</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.17521</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.17521v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We propose a scheme to transfer molecules from a slow beam into an optical trap using only a single photon absorption and emission cycle. The efficiency of such a scheme is numerically explored for BaF using realistic experimental parameters. The technique makes use of the state-dependent potential in an external electric field to trap molecules from an initial velocity of order 10 m/s. A rapid optical transition at the point where the molecules come to a standstill in the electric field potential irreversibly transfers them into a ~7 mk optical lattice trap. For a pulsed Stark decelerated beam, we estimated the per-shot efficiency to be ~0.52% or up to ~10$^4$ molecules, with a potential factor 2 improvement when the fields are synchronously modulated with the arriving velocity components. The irreversibility of the scheme allows for larger numbers to be built up over time. Since this scheme does not rely on a closed cycling transition for laser cooling, it broadens the range of molecules that can be used for research on cold molecular chemistry, quantum information, and fundamental interactions in optical traps.</description>

      <title>All-Order Wichmann and Kroll Contribution in Heavy Electronic and Exotic Atoms</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.08763v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present a theoretical study of the Wichmann and Kroll correction to the one-loop vacuum polarization (VP) to all-orders in $\alpha Z$. We consider electronic, muonic, and antiprotonic atoms for a wide range of nuclear charge numbers and explicitly investigate the influence of finite nuclear size effects and different nuclear models. Moreover, we place special emphasis on circular Rydberg states in the exotic atoms as they have recently attracted interest as a tool to perform isolated tests of strong-field QED. We find that the higher-order vacuum polarization is strongly enhanced in exotic atoms and remains large enough in highly excited Rydberg states that an accurate treatment is crucial for the analysis of upcoming spectroscopy experiments like PAX. Moreover, our calculations show that the VP contribution to the Lamb shift in these exotic Rydberg states has almost no dependence on the structure of the nucleus.</description>

      <title>Electronic phase-locking for three-color, two-pathway coherent control</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.08205</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.08205v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We report a new method of two-pathway coherent control using three narrow-band cw laser sources, phase locked in an optical phase-lock loop, to maintain the high degree of optical coherence required for the coherent control process. In addition, we derive expressions for two-photon transition amplitudes and demonstrate their dependence on the polarization of the field components. This phase-locking technique expands the set of interactions to which coherent control techniques may be applied. It also allows for a constant low-frequency offset between the optical interactions, producing a continuous and constant phase ramp between the interactions, facilitating phase-sensitive detection of the modulating atomic signal. We illustrate this technique with two-photon vs.~one-photon excitation of a $\Delta F = 1$ component, and alternatively a $\Delta F = 0$ component, of the $6s \: ^2S_{1/2} \rightarrow 7s \: ^2S_{1/2}$ transition of atomic cesium.</description>

      <title>Unravelling inter-channel quantum interference in below-threshold nonsequential double ionization with statistical measures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.16135</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.16135v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present a systematic study of interchannel quantum interference in laser-induced nonsequential double ionization (NSDI) within the strong-field approximation. Focusing on the below-threshold intensity regime where the recollision-excitation with subsequent ionization (RESI) pathway dominates, we derive analytical phase conditions governing interference between distinct excitation channels for arbitrary driving fields. To quantify the interplay between channels resulting from a vast number of interfering processes, we introduce statistical metrics based on the Earth Mover's Distance, allowing us to assess the relative weight of each channel's contribution to the two-electron photoelectron momentum distributions (PMDs). We identify key factors that determine whether interchannel interference is appreciable such as comparable channel intensities, strong spatial overlap between the excited-state wavefunctions and the energy difference between contributing channels. We demonstrate that for linearly polarized few-cycle pulses, the typical intrachannel interference features associated with exchange, temporal shifts and combined exchange-temporal interference are retained with interchannel interference. Our findings establish a hierarchy of interference mechanisms in RESI and may provide practical guidelines for enhancing or suppressing interference in different regions of the momentum plane. The toolkit presented in this work is transferable to a wide range of interferometric schemes involving different excitation channels.</description>

      <title>The 1/3 Geometric Constant: Scale Invariance and the Origin of "Missing Energy" in 3D Quantum Fragmentation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.08255</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.08255v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We report a fundamental geometric constraint on the detection of kinetic energy release (KER) in three-dimensional quantum fragmentation. By investigating the sudden dissociation of Slater-type orbitals, physically motivated basis for localized states, we demonstrate that the ratio of the peak detected energy to the integrated mean, $R_E = E_{\text{peak}}/\langle E \rangle$, is strictly bounded below $0.5$ for all physical parameter spaces. We systematically map the behavior of $R_E$ across the orbital localization ($\zeta$) and effective repulsive charge ($Q$) landscape. Our results show that while $R_E$ exhibits sensitivity to the force-field geometry at atomic scales, it converges to a remarkably stable, scale-invariant constant of $\approx 0.33$ in the high-localization limit ($M \propto \zeta$) characteristic of subatomic ground states ($n=1$,$Q=1$). This $1/3$ geometric constant provides a provocative first-principles interpretation of the historical ``missing energy'' problem in nuclear physics. We suggest that the $1/3$ average energy ratio observed in Beta decay spectra may be a topological artifact of the $4\pi r^2$ volume weighting inherent to 3D wavefunctions, rather than exclusively a signature of undetected mass. This work establishes $R_E &lt; 0.5$ as a universal geometric baseline for quantum simulations and offers a new framework for reconstructing the true energy budget in subatomic calorimetry by correcting for the intrinsic masking effects of 3D radial geometry.</description>

      <title>Constraining axion-like dark matter with a radio-frequency atomic magnetometer</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.09638</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.09638v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We report on a broadband search for axion-like-particle (ALP) interactions using a radio-frequency-operated $^{87}\mathrm{Rb}$ atomic magnetometer. The instrument provides wide spectral coverage and sensitivity to an oscillating pseudomagnetic field that may be generated by the gradient coupling of the ALP field to the constituent fermions of atoms. We search for an ALP-gradient signature in the mass range $2.40\times10^{-10}\,\mathrm{eV}/c^{2}$--$2.11\times10^{-9}\,\mathrm{eV}/c^{2}$. No statistically significant signatures of an oscillating magnetic field are observed, and we derive upper limits on the corresponding ALP-proton, -neutron and -electron couplings, $g_{\alpha pp}$, $g_{\alpha nn}$ and $g_{\alpha ee}$, respectively. The result on $g_{\alpha pp}$ improves over previous laboratory searches, while the limits on $g_{\alpha nn}$ and $g_{\alpha ee}$ complement earlier laboratory searches and astrophysical bounds. The work extends searches for ALP-fermion interactions into a mass region largely unexplored in a dark-matter context, demonstrating the potential of our method for broadband axion-like particle searches targeting the Galactic dark-matter halo.</description>

      <title>Rotational state changes in collisions of diatomic molecular ions with atomic ions</title>

      <description>arXiv:1905.02130v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate rotational state changes in a single collision of diatomic molecular ions, polar or apolar, with an atomic ion. Rotational state changes may occur since the angular degree of freedom of the molecular ions interacts with the electric field due to the atomic ion. Thanks to the very different time and energy scales of translational and rotational motion, we may treat the collision classically and describe only the rotations quantum mechanically. We first investigate a number of example systems numerically and then derive closed-form approximations for the rotational excitation per collision, depending on the scattering energy and the molecular parameters. These findings provide the basis for estimating the accumulated rotational excitation in sympathetic cooling of molecular ions by laser-cooled atomic ions [arXiv:2410.22458 ] which involves many single collisions.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.22458v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Sympathetic cooling of molecular ions through the Coulomb interaction with laser-cooled atomic ions is an efficient tool to prepare translationally cold molecules without, ideally, affecting the internal state of the molecular ions. However, the electric field due to the Coulomb interaction may induce rotational transitions that change the purity of initially quantum state prepared molecules. Here, we use estimates of rotational state changes in single collisions of diatomic ions with atomic ions [arXiv:1905.02130] to determine the overall rotational excitation accumulated over the sympathetic cooling. Considering two different experimental scenarios, that of a molecular ion co-trapped with a single atomic ion and a molecular ion immersed in a Coulomb crystal of atomic ions, we also estimate the cooling time.</description>
