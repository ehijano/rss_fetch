      <title>Stripped-envelope supernova light curves argue for central engine activity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.10846</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.10846v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The luminosity of ``stripped-envelope supernovae'', a common type of stellar explosions, has been generally thought to be driven by the radioactive decay of the nickel synthesized in the explosion and carried in its ejecta. Additional possible energy sources have been previously suggested, but these claims have been statistically inconclusive or model-dependent. Here, we analyse the energy budget of a sample of 54 well-observed stripped-envelope supernovae of all sub-types, and present statistically significant, largely model-independent, observational evidence for a non-radioactive power source in most of them (and possibly in all). We consider various energy sources, or alternatively, plausible systematic errors, that could drive this result, and conclude that the most likely option is the existence of a ``central engine'', such as a magnetar (a highly magnetic neutron star) or an accreting neutron star or black hole, operating over hours to days after the explosion. We infer from the observations constraints on the engines, finding that if these are magnetars, then their initial magnetic fields are about $10^{15}\,$G and their initial rotation period is 1--100 ms, implying that stripped-envelope supernovae could be the formative events of magnetars.</description>

      <title>The Effect of Pulsar Geometry on the Observed Gamma-ray Spectrum of Millisecond Pulsars</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.10872</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.10872v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We analyse 13 yrs of $\textit{Fermi}$-LAT PASS 8 events from 127 gamma-ray emitting millisecond pulsars (MSPs) in the energy range 0.1$-$100 GeV and significantly detect 118 MSPs. We fit the stacked emission with a log parabola (LP) spectral model which we show is preferred to two previously published models. We consider the influence of pulsar properties and observer geometric effects on spectral features by defining energy flux colours for both the individual MSPs, and our stacked model as a baseline. There is no correlation of colours with pulsar luminosity, $\dot{E}$, surface magnetic field or magnetic impact angle. We also find that pulsar geometry has little effect on the observed gamma-ray spectrum which is in tension with previous modelling of gamma-ray emission with respect to pulsar geometry. Our LP MSP model is applicable to problems where an ensemble of gamma-ray MSPs is considered, such as that of the Galactic centre excess or in the case of emission from globular clusters.</description>

      <title>The Relationship Between Simulated Sub-Millimeter and Near-Infrared Images of Sagittarius A* from a Magnetically Arrested Black Hole Accretion Flow</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.10982</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.10982v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Sagittarius A* (Sgr A*), the supermassive black hole at the center of the Milky Way, undergoes large-amplitude near-infrared (NIR) flares that can coincide with the continuous rotation of the NIR emission region. One promising explanation for this observed NIR behavior is a magnetic flux eruption, which occurs in three-dimensional General Relativistic Magneto-Hydrodynamic (3D GRMHD) simulations of magnetically arrested accretion flows. After running two-temperature 3D GRMHD simulations, where the electron temperature is evolved self-consistently along with the gas temperature, it is possible to calculate ray-traced images of the synchotron emission from thermal electrons in the accretion flow. Changes in the gas dominated ($\sigma=b^2/2\rho&lt;1$) regions of the accretion flow during a magnetic flux eruption reproduce the NIR flaring and NIR emission region rotation of Sgr A* with durations consistent with observation. In this paper, we demonstrate that these models also predict that large (1.5x - 2x) size increases of the sub-millimeter (sub-mm) and millimeter (mm) emission region follow most NIR flares by 20 - 50 minutes. These size increases occur across a wide parameter space of black hole spin ($a=0.3,0.5,-0.5,0.9375$) and initial tilt angle between the accretion flow and black hole spin axes $\theta_0$ ($\theta_0=0^{\circ}$, $16^{\circ}$, $30^{\circ}$). We also calculate the sub-mm polarization angle rotation and the shift of the sub-mm spectral index from zero to -0.8 during a prominent NIR flare in our high spin ($a=0.9375$) simulation. We show that, during a magnetic flux eruption, a large ($\sim10r_g$), magnetically dominated $(\sigma&gt;1)$, low density, and high temperature ``bubble'' forms in the accretion flow. The drop in density inside the bubble and additional electron heating in accretion flow between 15$r_g$ - 25$r_g$ leads to a sub-mm size increase in corresponding images.</description>

      <title>Search for synchrotron emission from secondary electrons of proton-proton interaction in Galactic PeVatron candidate HESS J1641$-$463</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.11012</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.11012v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: HESS J1641-463 is an unidentified gamma-ray source with a hard TeV gamma-ray spectrum, and thus it has been proposed to be a possible candidate for cosmic ray (CR) accelerators up to PeV energies (a PeVatron candidate). The source spatially coincides with the radio supernova remnant (SNR) G338.5+0.1, but has not yet been fully explored in the X-ray band. We analyzed newly taken NuSTAR data, pointing at HESS J1641-463, with 82 ks effective exposure time. There is no apparent X-ray counterpart of HESS J1641-463, while nearby stellar cluster, Mercer 81, and stray-light X-rays are detected. Combined with the archival Chandra data, partially covering the source, we derived an upper limit of $\sim 6\times 10^{-13}$ erg cm$^{-2}$ s$^{-1}$ in 2-10 keV ($\sim 3\times 10^{-13}$ erg cm$^{-2}$ s$^{-1}$ in 10-20 keV). If the gamma-ray emission is originated from decay of $\pi^0$ mesons produced in interactions between CR protons and ambient materials, secondary electrons in the proton-proton interactions can potentially emit synchrotron photons in the X-ray band, which can be tested by our X-ray observations. Although the obtained X-ray upper limits cannot place a constraint on the primary proton spectrum, it will be possible with a future hard X-ray mission.</description>

      <title>Exploring Supermassive Compact Dark Matter with the Millilensing Effect of Gamma-Ray Bursts</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.11053</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.11053v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Gravitational lensing effect is one of most significant observational probes to investigate compact dark matter/objects over a wide mass range. In this work, we first propose to derive the population information and the abundance of supermassive compact dark matter in the mass range $\sim10^5-10^7~M_{\odot}$ from 6 millilensed gamma-ray burst (GRB) candidates in 3000 Fermi GRB events using the hierarchical Bayesian inference method. We obtain that, for the mass range $\sim10^5-10^7~M_{\odot}$, the abundance of supermassive compact dark matter is $f_{\rm CO}=10^{-1.60}$ in the log-normal mass distribution scenario. This result is in obvious tension with some other observational constraints, e.g. ultra-faint dwarfs and dynamical friction. However, it also was argued that there is only one system in these 6 candidates has been identified as lensed GRB event with fairly high confidence. In this case, the tension would be significantly alleviated. Therefore, it would be an interesting clue for both the millilensed GRB identification and the formation mechanism of supermassive compact dark matter.</description>

      <title>The puzzling orbital residuals of XTE J1710-281: is a Jovian planet orbiting around the binary system?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.11203</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.11203v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: XTE J1710-281 is a transient eclipsing binary system with a period close to 3.28 hours, hosting a neutron star. The average eclipse duration is 420 seconds, and eclipse arrival times reported in the literature span from 1999 to 2017. A previous analysis of the eclipse arrival times using the eclipse timing technique revealed a complex pattern of delays, indicating the presence of three orbital glitches. These glitches correspond to sudden variations in the orbital period, allowing for the identification of four distinct epochs. We have re-analyzed the 78 eclipse arrival times spanning 18 years utilizing the eclipse timing technique to derive the corresponding delays as a function of time. We find that the observed delays align well with a fitting model employing an eccentric sine function characterized by an amplitude of $6.1 \pm 0.5$ s, eccentricity of $0.38 \pm 0.17$, and a period of $17.1 \pm 1.5$ years. Additionally, we identified the orbital period as 3.28106345(13) hours, with a reference epoch of $T_0=54112.83200(2)$ Modified Julian Date (MJD). We obtained an upper limit of the orbital period derivative of $3.6 \times 10^{-13}$ s~s$^{-1}$. From the average value of the eclipse duration, we estimate that the companion star has a mass of 0.22~\Msun for a neutron star mass of 1.4~\Msun, and the inclination of the source is $78.1^{+1.5}_{-1.2}$ degrees. The companion star is in thermal equilibrium. The orbital period derivative is consistent with a conservative mass transfer scenario, where the angular momentum loss due to magnetic braking dominates over gravitational radiation angular momentum loss if the former is present. The eccentric modulation can be explained by a third body with a mass of 2.7 Jovian masses, orbiting with a revolution period close to 17 years and an eccentricity of 0.38.

      <title>Sky localization of Massive Black Hole Binaries in the foreground of Galactic white dwarf binaries</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.11505</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.11505v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quickly sky localizing of massive black hole binaries (MBHBs) from the foreground of double white dwarf (DWD) is essential for space-based gravitational wave (GW) detection. In an orbit period of the space crafts, there is an optimal orbital position of the GW detectors to observe GW sources, where the signal intensity is at its peak. From the model Q3-d, five MBHB sources are selected based on the optimal observation orbital positions of the GW detectors, which are associated with the orientation of the MBHB perpendicular to the detection arms. For two MBHB sources of lower intensity, luminosity distance uncertainties, $\Delta D_L$/$D_L$ at the 95$\%$ confidence level from the overlapping GW signals of MBHB and DWD sources, when employing wavelet decomposition and reconstruction methods, are improved by $\sim$ 2 times and $\sim$ 10 times. Besides, the angular resolutions $\Delta \Omega_s$ are also improved by a factor of $\sim$ 35 and $\sim$ 8. These results imply that we can obtain relatively high accuracy of quickly localizing MBHB from the overlapped GW signals with DWDs at the best observation orbit position. The luminosity distance uncertainties at the 95$\%$ confidence level for MBHB sources with the higher sign-noise ratio, have constraints on the precision of the Hubble constant.</description>

      <title>Physics of nova outbursts: Theoretical models of classical nova outbursts with optically thick winds on $1.2~M_\odot$ and $1.3~M_\odot$ white dwarfs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.11237</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.11237v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present time-dependent nova outburst models with optically thick winds for a 1.2 and 1.35 $M_\odot$ white dwarfs (WDs) with a mass accretion rate of $5 \times 10^{-9}~M_\odot$ yr$^{-1}$ and for a 1.3 $M_\odot$ WD with $2 \times 10^{-9}~M_\odot$ yr$^{-1}$. The X-ray flash occurs 11 days before the optical peak of the 1.2 $M_\odot$ WD and 2.5 days before the peak of the 1.3 $M_\odot$ WD. The wind mass loss rate of the 1.2 $M_\odot$ WD (1.3 $M_\odot$ WD) reaches a peak of $6.4 \times 10^{-5}~M_\odot$ yr$^{-1}$ ($7.4 \times 10^{-5}~M_\odot$ yr$^{-1}$) at the epoch of the maximum photospheric expansion with the lowest photospheric temperature of $\log T_{\rm ph}$ (K)=4.33 (4.35). The nuclear energy generated during the outburst is lost in a form of radiation (61% for the 1.2 $M_\odot$ WD; 47% for the 1.3 $M_\odot$ WD), gravitational energy of ejecta (39%; 52%), and kinetic energy of the wind (0.28%; 0.29%). We found an empirical relation for fast novae between the time to optical maximum from the outburst $t_{\rm peak}$ and the expansion timescale $\tau_{\rm exp}$ at $t=0$. With this relation, we are able to predict the time to optical maximum $t_{\rm peak}$ from the ignition model (at $t=0$) without following a time-consuming nova wind evolution.</description>

      <title>Robust parameter estimation within minutes on gravitational wave signals from binary neutron star inspirals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.11397</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.11397v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The gravitational waves emitted by binary neutron star inspirals contain information on nuclear matter above saturation density. However, extracting this information and conducting parameter estimation remains a computationally challenging and expensive task. Wong et al. introduced Jim arXiv:2302.05333, a parameter estimation pipeline that combines relative binning and jax features such as hardware acceleration and automatic differentiation into a normalizing flow-enhanced sampler for gravitational waves from binary black hole (BBH) mergers. In this work, we extend the Jim framework to analyze gravitational wave signals from binary neutron stars (BNS) mergers with tidal effects included. We demonstrate that Jim can be used for full Bayesian parameter estimation of gravitational waves from BNS mergers within a few tens of minutes, which includes the training of the normalizing flow and computing the reference parameters for relative binning. For instance, Jim can analyze GW170817 in 26 minutes (33 minutes) of total wall time using the TaylorF2 (IMRPhenomD_NRTidalv2) waveform, and GW190425 in around 21 minutes for both waveforms. We highlight the importance of such an efficient parameter estimation pipeline for several science cases as well as its ecologically friendly implementation of gravitational wave parameter estimation.</description>

      <title>Quasinormal Modes in Modified Gravity using Physics-Informed Neural Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.11583</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.11583v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we apply a novel approach based on physics-informed neural networks to the computation of quasinormal modes of black hole solutions in modified gravity. In particular, we focus on the case of Einstein-scalar-Gauss-Bonnet theory, with several choices of the coupling function between the scalar field and the Gauss-Bonnet invariant. This type of calculation introduces a number of challenges with respect to the case of General Relativity, mainly due to the extra complexity of the perturbation equations and to the fact that the background solution is known only numerically. The solution of these perturbation equations typically requires sophisticated numerical techniques that are not easy to develop in computational codes. We show that physics-informed neural networks have an accuracy which is comparable to traditional numerical methods in the case of numerical backgrounds, while being very simple to implement. Additionally, the use of GPU parallelization is straightforward thanks to the use of standard machine learning environments.</description>

      <title>Ring momentum distributions as a general feature of Vlasov dynamics in the synchrotron dominated regime</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.11586</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.11586v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study how radiation reaction leads plasmas initially in kinetic equilibrium to develop features in momentum space, such as anisotropies and population inversion, resulting in a ring-shaped momentum distribution that can drive kinetic instabilities. We employ the Landau-Lifshiftz radiation reaction model for a plasma in a strong magnetic field, and we obtain the necessary condition for the development of population inversion, we show that isotropic Maxwellian and Maxwell-J\"uttner plasmas, with thermal temperature $T&gt;m_e c^2/\sqrt{3}$, will develop a ring-like momentum distribution. The timescales and features for forming ring-shaped momentum distributions, the effect of collisions and non-uniform magnetic fields are disscussed, and compared with typical astrophysical and laboratory plasmas parameters. Our results show the pervasiveness of ring-like momentum distribution functions in synchrotron dominated plasma conditions.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.11601v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Gravitational waves from inspiraling sub-solar mass compact objects would provide almost definitive evidence for the existence of primordial black holes. In this chapter, we explain why these exotic objects are interesting candidates for current and future gravitational-wave observatories, and provide detailed explanations of how they are searched for. We describe one method, matched filtering, to search for binaries with masses between $[0.01,1]M_\odot$. Furthermore, since signals from inspiraling planetary- and asteroid-mass mass compact binaries ($[10^{-9},10^{-2}]M_\odot$) would spend hours to years in the detector frequency band, we explain the novel pattern recognition techniques that have been developed to search for them. Finally, we describe extreme mass ratio inspiral (EMRI) systems, and how these will be searched for in future space-based detectors. For all mass regimes, we comment on the prospects for detection.</description>

      <title>Orbital Polarimetric Tomography of a Flare Near the Sagittarius A* Supermassive Black Hole</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.07687</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.07687v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The interaction between the supermassive black hole at the center of the Milky Way, Sagittarius A*, and its accretion disk occasionally produces high-energy flares seen in X-ray, infrared, and radio. One proposed mechanism that produces flares is the formation of compact, bright regions that appear within the accretion disk and close to the event horizon. Understanding these flares provides a window into accretion processes. Although sophisticated simulations predict the formation of these flares, their structure has yet to be recovered by observations. Here we show the first three-dimensional (3D) reconstruction of an emission flare recovered from ALMA light curves observed on April 11, 2017. Our recovery shows compact, bright regions at a distance of roughly six times the event horizon. Moreover, it suggests a clockwise rotation in a low-inclination orbital plane, consistent with prior studies by GRAVITY and EHT. To recover this emission structure, we solve an ill-posed tomography problem by integrating a neural 3D representation with a gravitational model for black holes. Although the recovery is subject to, and sometimes sensitive to, the model assumptions, under physically motivated choices, our results are stable, and our approach is successful on simulated data.</description>

The 4-150 keV wide-field trigger camera ECLAIRs to fly on board the Space-based multi-band Variable Object Monitor (SVOM) mission, dedicated to studying the high-energy transient sky in synergy with multi-messenger follow-up instruments, has been adapted to detect high-redshift (high-z) GRBs.

Investigating the detection capabilities of ECLAIRs for high-z GRBs and estimating the impacts of instrumental biases in reconstructing some of the source measured properties, focusing on GRB duration biases as a function of redshift. Methods. We simulated realistic detection scenarios for a sample of 162 already observed GRBs with known redshift values as they would have been seen by ECLAIRs. We simulated them at redshift values equal and higher than their measured value. Then, we assessed whether they would be detected with a trigger algorithm resembling that on board of ECLAIRs, and derived quantities such as T90, for those that would have been detected. Results. We find that ECLAIRs would be capable of detecting GRBs up to very high redshift values (e.g. 20 GRBs in our sample are detectable within more than 0.4 of the ECLAIRs field of view for z &gt; 12). The ECLAIRs low-energy threshold of 4 keV, contributes to this great detection capability, as it may enhance it at high redshift (z &gt; 10) by over 10% compared to a 15 keV low-energy threshold. We also show that the detection of GRBs at high-z values may imprint tip-of-the-iceberg biases on the GRB duration measurements, which can affect the reconstruction of other source properties.</description>

      <title>Dual Role of Accretion Disk Winds as X-ray Obscurers and UV Line Absorbers in AGN</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.07086</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.07086v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: X-ray obscuration of active galactic nuclei (AGNs) is considered in the context of ionized winds of stratified structure launched from accretion disks. We argue that a Compton-thick layer of a large-scale disk wind can obscure continuum X-rays and also lead to broad UV absorption such as in the blue wing of Civ; the former originates from the inner wind while the latter from the outer wind as a dual role. Motivated by a number of observational evidence showing strong AGN obscuration phenomena in Seyfert 1 AGNs such as NGC 5548, we demonstrate in this work, by utilizing a physically-motivated wind model coupled to post-process radiative transfer calculations, that an extended disk wind under certain physical conditions (e.g. morphology and density) could naturally cause a sufficient obscuration qualitatively consistent with UV/X-ray observations. Predicted UV/X-ray correlation is also presented as a consequence of variable spatial size of the wind in this scenario.</description>

      <title>Constraining Axion-Like Particles Dark Matter in Coma Berenices with FAST</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.04881</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.04881v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Axions and axion-like particles (ALPs) appear in many extensions of the Standard Model and are being investigated as promising dark matter (DM) candidates. One viable methodology for their detection involves the investigation of the line-like radio emissions from the dwarf spheroidal galaxy, potentially originating from the radiative decay of ALPs or the conversion of ALPs in the magnetic field. In this work, we constrain the properties of ALPs using the 2-hour radio observation of Coma Berenices through the Five-hundred-meter Aperture Spherical radio Telescope (FAST). The $\rm 95\%$ upper limits of the ALP-photon coupling are calculated for the ALP decay and conversion scenarios, respectively. Note that the sensitive ALP masses for FAST range from $\sim \mu \rm eV$ to tens of $\mu \rm eV$, where ALP can explain the DM abundance naturally. However, our limits are weaker than those of the CAST helioscope, which can provide an independent and complementary check on the ALP non-detection for ground experiments. Furthermore, we evaluate the expected sensitivity on the ALP of FAST with its full designed bandwidth (70 $\rm MHz$ - 3 $\rm GHz$) for 100 hours of observation time. Our results indicate that, even with the exceptional sensitivity of the FAST, it is challenging to surpass the existing experimental constraints on ALP DM using radio observation of dSphs, unless the possible enhancements of ALP signals by compact stars in dSphs are considered.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.10542v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This study presents a comprehensive analysis of the spectral properties of 886 pulsars across a wide frequency range from 20MHz to 343.5GHz, including a total of 86 millisecond pulsars. The majority of the pulsars exhibit power-law behavior in their spectra, although some exceptions are observed. Five different spectral models, namely simple power-law, broken power-law, low-frequency turn-over, high-frequency cut-off, and double turn-over, were employed to explore the spectral behaviors. The average spectral index for pulsars modeled with a simple power-law is found to be -1.64 +/-0.80, consistent with previous studies. Additionally, significant correlations between the spectral index and characteristic parameters are observed particularly in millisecond pulsars, while no strong correlation is observed in normal pulsars. Different models show variations in the most influential characteristic parameters associated with the spectral index, indicating diverse dominant radiation mechanisms in millisecond pulsars.Finally, this study identifies 22 pulsars of the Gigahertz-peaked Spectra (GPS) type for the first time based on the Akaike information criterion.</description>

      <title>Insights into neutron star equation of state by machine learning</title>

      <description>arXiv:2309.11227v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Due to its powerful capability and high efficiency in big data analysis, machine learning has been applied in various fields. We construct a neural network platform to constrain the behaviors of the equation of state of nuclear matter with respect to the properties of nuclear matter at saturation density and the properties of neutron stars. It is found that the neural network is able to give reasonable predictions of parameter space and provide new hints into the constraints of hadron interactions. As a specific example, we take the relativistic mean field approximation in a widely accepted Walecka-type model to illustrate the feasibility and efficiency of the platform. The results show that the neural network can indeed estimate the parameters of the model at a certain precision such that both the properties of nuclear matter around saturation density and global properties of neutron stars can be saturated. The optimization of the present modularly designed neural network and extension to other effective models are straightforward.</description>

      <title>Baryon density dependence of viscosities of the quark-gluon plasma at hadronization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.17444</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.17444v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The $\phi$ meson and $\Omega$ baryon provide unique probes of the properties of the quark-gluon plasma (QGP) at hadronization in relativistic heavy-ion collisions. Using the quark recombination model with the quark phase-space information parameterized in a viscous blastwave, we perform Bayesian inference of the shear and bulk viscosities of the QGP at hadronization with a temperature of $T\sim 160$ MeV by analyzing the $\phi$ and $\Omega$ data in Au+Au collisions at $\sqrt{s_{\rm NN}}=$ 19.6-200 GeV and Pb+Pb collisions at $\sqrt{s_{\rm NN}}=$ 2.76 TeV, corresponding to a baryon chemical potential variation from $\mu_B\approx 0$ (at $\sqrt{s_{\rm NN}}= 2.76$ TeV) to $200$ MeV (at $\sqrt{s_{\rm NN}}= 19.6$ GeV). We find that the shear viscosity to enthalpy ratio $\eta T/(\epsilon +P)$ of the QGP at hadronization decreases as $\mu_B$ increases, with $\eta T/(\epsilon +P)\approx 0.18$ at $\mu_B=0$ and $\eta T/(\epsilon +P)\approx 0.08$ at $\mu_B=200$ MeV, while the corresponding specific bulk viscosity is essentially constant with $\zeta T/(\epsilon + P)=0.02\sim 0.04$ for $\mu_B&lt;200$ MeV. Our results suggest that the QGP at hadronization ($T\sim 160$ MeV) with finite baryon density is more close to perfect fluid than that with zero baryon density.</description>

      <title>Bounds on tidal charges from gravitational-wave ringdown observations</title>

      <description>arXiv:2311.03556v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Black hole solutions in the braneworld scenario are predicted to possess a tidal charge parameter, leaving imprints in the quasinormal spectrum. We conduct an extensive computation of such spectrum, and use it to construct a waveform model for the ringdown relaxation regime of binary black hole mergers observed by LIGO and Virgo. Applying a Bayesian time-domain analysis formalism, we analyse a selected dataset from the GWTC-3 LIGO-Virgo-Kagra catalog of binary coalescences, bounding the value of the tidal charge. With our analysis we obtain the first robust constraints on such charges, highlighting the importance of accounting for the previously ignored correlations with the other black hole intrinsic parameters.</description>

      <title>Constraints on Brans-Dicke gravity from neutron star-black hole merger events using higher harmonics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.07017</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.07017v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The Brans-Dicke (BD) theory is one of the simplest scalar-tensor theories, which has potential relations with dark matter, dark energy, inflation, and primordial nucleosynthesis. The strongest constraint on the BD coupling constant is provided by the Shapiro time delay measurement in the solar system by Cassini. Constraints from gravitational wave (GW) events are subject to asymmetric binaries. The third Gravitational-Wave Transient Catalog (GWTC) reports a neutron star-black hole (NSBH) merger event, GW200115, making it possible to constrain BD by GW. With the aid of this source and Bayesian Markov-chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) analyses, we derive the 90\% credible lower bound on the modified parameter of scalar-tensor theories as $\varphi_{-2}&gt;-7.94\times10^{-4}$ by using dominant mode correction. Specific to BD, we have the constraint $\omega_{\rm BD}&gt;4.75$. Usually, asymmetric binary systems have a significant mass ratio; in such cases, higher harmonic modes cannot be neglected. Our work considers higher harmonic corrections from scalar-tensor and provides a tighter constraint of $\varphi_{-2}&gt;-7.59\times10^{-4}$. Transitioning to the BD theory, the constraint result is $\omega_{\rm BD}&gt;5.06$, with a 6.5\% improvement. We also consider a plausible NSBH event, GW190814, which is a highly unequal mass ratio source and exhibits strong evidence for higher-order multipoles. We obtain poor converged results when using the dominant mode while getting a constraint of $\varphi_{-2}&gt;-6.60\times10^{-4}$ on scalar-tensor theories when including the higher harmonic modes. This suggests that the difference between the dominant mode and higher modes has a significant impact on our analysis. Furthermore, treating this suspected event as an NSBH event, we find $\omega_{\rm BD}&gt;6.12$ when including the higher harmonic modes.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2401.09925v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this lecture we discuss the properties of dense hadronic matter inside neutron stars. In particular, we pay attention to the role of strangeness in the core of neutron stars, by analysing the presence of baryons and mesons with strangeness. We consider two interesting possible scenarios in their interior, that is, the existence of hyperons leading to the so-called hyperon puzzle and the presence of a kaon condensed phase inside neutron stars.</description>

      <title>Multifrequency Very Long Baseline Interferometry Imaging of the Subparsec-scale Jet in the Sombrero Galaxy (M104)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.04215</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.04215v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We report multi-frequency and multi-epoch VLBI studies of the sub-parsec jet in Sombrero galaxy (M 104, NGC 4594). Using Very Long Baseline Array data at 12, 22, 44, and 88 GHz, we study the kinematics of the jet and the properties of the compact core. The sub-parsec jet is clearly detected at 12 and 22 GHz, and the inner jet base is resolved down to $\sim70$ Schwarzschild radii ($R_{\rm s}$) at 44 GHz. The proper motions of the jet are measured with apparent sub-relativistic speeds of $0.20\pm0.08 c$ and $0.05\pm0.02 c$ for the approaching and the receding jet, respectively. Based on the apparent speed and jet-to-counter-jet brightness ratio, we estimate the jet viewing angle to be larger than $\sim37^{\circ}$, and the intrinsic speed to be between $\sim0.10 c$ and $0.40 c$. Their joint probability distribution suggests the most probable values of the viewing angle and intrinsic speed to be ${66^{\circ}}^{+4^\circ}_{-6^\circ}$ and $0.19\pm0.04 c$, respectively. We also find that the measured brightness temperatures of the core at 12, 22 and 44 GHz are close to the equipartition brightness temperature, indicating that the energy density of the radiating particles is comparable to the energy density of the magnetic field in the sub-parsec jet region. Interestingly, the measured core size at 88 GHz ($\sim25\pm5 R_{s}$) deviates from the expected frequency dependence seen at lower frequencies. This may indicate a different origin for the millimeter emission, which can explained by an Advection Dominated Accretion Flow (ADAF) model. This model further predicts that at 230 and 340 GHz, the ADAF may dominate the radio emission over the jet.</description>
