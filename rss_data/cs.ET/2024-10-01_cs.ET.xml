      <title>Building a simple oscillator based Ising machine for research and education</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.00523</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.00523v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Oscillator based Ising machines are non-von-Neumann machines ideally suited for solving combinatorial problems otherwise intractable on classic stored-program digital computers due to their run-time complexity. Possible future applications are manifold ranging from quantum simulations to protein folding and are of high academic and commercial interest as well. Described in the following is a very simple such machine aimed at educational and research applications.</description>

      <title>Social Conjuring: Multi-User Runtime Collaboration with AI in Building Virtual 3D Worlds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.00274</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.00274v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Generative artificial intelligence has shown promise in prompting virtual worlds into existence, yet little attention has been given to understanding how this process unfolds as social interaction. We present Social Conjurer, a framework for AI-augmented dynamic 3D scene co-creation, where multiple users collaboratively build and modify virtual worlds in real-time. Through an expanded set of interactions, including social and tool-based engagements as well as spatial reasoning, our framework facilitates the creation of rich, diverse virtual environments. Findings from a preliminary user study (N=12) provide insight into the user experience of this approach, how social contexts shape the prompting of spatial environments, and perspective on social applications of prompt-based 3D co-creation. In addition to highlighting the potential of AI-supported multi-user world creation and offering new pathways for AI-augmented creative processes in VR, this article presents a set of implications for designing human-centered interfaces that incorporate AI models into 3D content generation.</description>

      <title>A Digital Twin Framework for Physical-Virtual Integration in V2X-Enabled Connected Vehicle Corridors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.00356</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.00356v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Transportation Cyber-Physical Systems (T-CPS) are critical in improving traffic safety, reliability, and sustainability by integrating computing, communication, and control in transportation systems. The connected vehicle corridor is at the forefront of this transformation, where Cellular Vehicle-to-Everything (C-V2X) technology facilitates real-time data exchange between infrastructure, vehicles, and road users. However, challenges remain in processing and synchronizing the vast V2X data from vehicles and roadside units, particularly when ensuring scalability, data integrity, and operational resilience. This paper presents a digital twin framework for T-CPS, developed from a real-world connected vehicle corridor to address these challenges. By leveraging C-V2X technology and real-time data from infrastructure, vehicles, and road users, the digital twin accurately replicates vehicle behaviors, signal phases, and traffic patterns within the CARLA simulation environment. This framework demonstrates high fidelity between physical and digital systems and ensures robust synchronization of vehicle trajectories and signal phases through extensive experiments. Moreover, the digital twin's scalable and redundant architecture enhances data integrity, making it capable of supporting future large-scale C-V2X deployments. The digital twin is a vital tool in T-CPS, enabling real-time traffic monitoring, prediction, and optimization to enhance the reliability and safety of transportation systems.</description>

      <title>Developing a BLAS library for the AMD AI Engine</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.00825</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.00825v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Spatial (dataflow) computer architectures can mitigate the control and performance overhead of classical von Neumann architectures such as traditional CPUs. Driven by the popularity of Machine Learning (ML) workloads, spatial devices are being marketed as ML inference accelerators. Despite providing a rich software ecosystem for ML practitioners, their adoption in other scientific domains is hindered by the steep learning curve and lack of reusable software, which makes them inaccessible to non-experts. We present our ongoing project AIEBLAS, an open-source, expandable implementation of Basic Linear Algebra Routines (BLAS) for the AMD AI Engine. Numerical routines are designed to be easily reusable, customized, and composed in dataflow programs, leveraging the characteristics of the targeted device without requiring the user to deeply understand the underlying hardware and programming model.</description>

      <title>Exploring Utility in a Real-World Warehouse Optimization Problem: Formulation Based on Quantum Annealers and Preliminary Results</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.09706</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.09706v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In the current NISQ-era, one of the major challenges faced by researchers and practitioners lies in figuring out how to combine quantum and classical computing in the most efficient and innovative way. In this paper, we present a mechanism coined as Quantum Initialization for Warehouse Optimization Problem that resorts to D-Wave's Quantum Annealer. The module has been specifically designed to be embedded into already existing classical software dedicated to the optimization of a real-world industrial problem. We preliminary tested the implemented mechanism through a two-phase experiment against the classical version of the software.</description>

      <title>Routing and Spectrum Allocation in Broadband Quantum Entanglement Distribution</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.08744</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.08744v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate resource allocation for quantum entanglement distribution over an optical network. We characterize and model a network architecture that employs a single quasi-deterministic time-frequency heralded Einstein-Podolsky-Rosen (EPR) pair source, and develop a routing scheme for distributing entangled photon pairs over such a network. We focus on max-min fairness in entanglement distribution and compare the performance of various spectrum allocation schemes by examining the max-min and median number of EPR-pairs assigned by them, and the Jain index associated with this assignment. Since this presents an NP-hard problem, we identify two approximation algorithms that outperform others in minimum and mean EPR-pair rate distribution and are comparable to others in the Jain index. We also analyze how the network size and connectivity affect these metrics using Watts-Strogatz random graphs. We find that a spectrum allocation approach that achieves high minimum EPR-pair rate can perform significantly worse when the median EPR-pair rate, Jain index, and runtimes are considered.</description>
