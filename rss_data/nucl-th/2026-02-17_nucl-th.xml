      <title>Nuclear Fragmentation at Intermediate Energies in the DCM-QGSM-SMM Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.13360</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.13360v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The development of nucleus-nucleus interaction models is a rapidly developing area of heavy-ion physics. Recently, a new model DCM-QGSM-SMM, developed at JINR and oriented toward use within the NICA project at energies of several GeV/nucleon, became available. However, the mechanisms of nuclear interactions used in this model can potentially operate effectively at lower energies. In this paper, the model predictions are compared with the FRAGM and FIRST/GSI experimental data in the energy range of nucleus-nucleus interactions starting from 300 MeV/nucleon, as well as with the predictions of other models used in this energy range.</description>

      <title>Neural-network quantum states for the nuclear many-body problem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.13826</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.13826v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A long-standing goal of nuclear theory is to explain how the structure and dynamics of atomic nuclei and neutron-star matter emerge from the underlying interactions among protons and neutrons. Achieving this goal requires solving the nuclear quantum many-body problem with high accuracy across a wide range of length scales and density regimes. In this review, we discuss how artificial neural network representations of the nuclear many-body wave function have significantly extended the capabilities of continuum quantum Monte Carlo methods. In particular, neural network quantum states enable calculations of larger systems than were previously accessible and provide a flexible framework for capturing phenomena that challenge conventional approaches, including the emergence of nuclear clusters and superfluid phases in dense matter. We highlight recent applications to finite nuclei, infinite nuclear and neutron matter, and dynamical processes relevant to lepton-nucleus and nucleus-nucleus scattering. We also discuss conceptual and methodological connections with condensed matter physics, emphasizing developments in neural network quantum states that bridge strongly correlated systems across disciplines. Together, these developments demonstrate how neural-network methods open new avenues toward unified and accurate descriptions of nuclear structure, matter, and reactions.</description>

      <title>Bayesian Analyses of Proton Multiple Flow Components in Intermediate Heavy Ion Collisions with Momentum-Dependent Interactions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.13991</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.13991v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We perform a comprehensive Bayesian analyses of Au + Au collision data at 1.23 GeV/nucleon using an isospin-dependent Boltzmann-Uehling-Uhlenbeck transport model that incorporates a momentum-dependent mean field and medium-modified baryon-baryon cross sections. The model parameters are calibrated to empirical properties of nuclear matter at saturation density, with particular attention to variations in the incompressibility $K_0$. Within a Bayesian statistical framework and using a Gaussian Process emulator, we simultaneously extract constraints on the incompressibility $K_0$ and the in-medium baryon-baryon scattering modification factor $X$ by systematically comparing model predictions with HADES measurements of proton collective flow, including the slopes ($F_1$ and $F_3$) of directed and triangular flow, as well as elliptic ($v_2$) and quadrupole ($v_4$) flow observables. We find that the extracted incompressibility favors relatively small values, indicating a soft nuclear equation of state, while the inferred average $X$ values fall at $0.9$-$1.0$, suggesting mild suppression of baryon-baryon cross sections in the medium. Furthermore, we demonstrate that transport models employing momentum-independent mean fields require stiffer equations of state and stronger in-medium corrections to reproduce the same observables. These results highlight the critical role of momentum dependence in the mean field and its interplay with in-medium scattering in constraining the properties of dense nuclear matter from heavy-ion collisions.</description>

      <title>Quarkyonic matter and hadron-quark crossover from an ultracold atom perspective</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.14113</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.14113v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The dense matter equation of state is of great interest due to the recent development of astrophysical observations for neutron stars. A rapid increase in pressure indicates a continuous crossover from a hadron phase to a quark phase without any phase transitions, yet its microscopic mechanism remains elusive. Recently, a peak in the speed of sound and a baryon momentum-shell structure, which are predicted from a quarkyonic matter picture, have been regarded as key features of the hadron-quark crossover. In this work, we explore a field-theoretical framework to describe the hadron-quark crossover, drawing an analogy with the Bose-Einstein condensate to Bardeen-Cooper-Schrieffer (BEC-BCS) crossover established in ultracold atomic experiments. Strikingly, a peak in the speed of sound and the baryon momentum-shell structure can simultaneously be explained by the tripling fluctuation effect arising from a different context of quantum many-body physics. We demonstrate these properties in a simplified model and provide a microscopic derivation of the quarkyonic matter model within our field-theoretical framework.</description>

      <title>Probing Rotational Dynamics of Quark Gluon Plasma via Global Vorticity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.13618</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.13618v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The findings on the spin polarization of $\Lambda$, $\Xi$, and $\Omega$ hyperons and spin alignment of $K^{*0}$, $\phi$, and $D^{*+}$ mesons in relativistic heavy-ion collision experiments at the RHIC and LHC facilities propose the emergence of a strong vorticity field produced in these collisions. Contemplating the potential impact of vorticity on the space-time evolution of deconfined QCD matter and its freeze-out properties, we aim to investigate its characteristics within the medium. We introduce a complementary and data-driven approach to quantify the global vorticity field by extracting it directly from the transverse momentum spectra of produced hadrons. Employing the experimental data for $\Lambda$, $\Xi$, $\Omega$, $K^{*0}$, $K^{*\pm}$, $\phi$, $\rho$, and $D^{*+}$ at mid-rapidity in Au+Au and Pb+Pb collisions over a wide range of beam energies, $\sqrt{s_{\rm NN}}=7.7$ GeV-5.02 TeV, and centrality classes, we systematically examine spin-vorticity coupling in the medium. Our finding on the magnitude of the extracted vorticity is consistent with values deduced from $\Lambda$ and $\bar{\Lambda}$ polarization measurements using statistical thermal models under the non-relativistic limit. Notably, we observe a prominent particle-species dependence of the vorticity, as well as a non-trivial variation with collision centrality and beam energy. These results indicate that vorticity-driven spin phenomena are sensitive to hadron structure and freeze-out dynamics, providing new constraints on the rotational properties of the QCD matter.</description>

      <title>Non-Hermitian Quantum Mechanics of Open Quantum Systems: Revisiting The One-Body Problem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.14105</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.14105v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We review analyses of open quantum systems. We show how non-Hermiticity arises in an open quantum system with an infinite environment, focusing on the one-body problem. One of the reasons for taking the present approach is that we can solve the problem completely, making it easier to see the structures of problems involving open quantum systems. We show that this results in the discovery of a new complete set, which is one of the main topics of the present article. Another reason for focusing on the one-body problem is that the theory permits the strong coupling between the system and the environment. In the current research landscape, it is valuable to revisit the one-body problem for open quantum systems, which can be solved accurately for arbitrary strengths of the system-environment couplings. A rigorous understanding of the problem structures in the present approach will be helpful when we tackle problems with many-body interactions. First, we consider potential scattering and directly define the resonant state as an eigenstate of the Schr\"{o}dinger equation under the Siegert outgoing boundary condition. We show that the resonant eigenstate can have a complex energy eigenvalue, even though the Hamiltonian is seemingly Hermitian. Second, we introduce the Feshbach formalism, which eliminates the infinite degrees of freedom of the environment and represents its effect as a complex potential. The resulting effective Hamiltonian is explicitly non-Hermitian. By unifying these two ways of defining resonant states, we obtain a new complete set of bases for the scattering problem that contains all discrete eigenstates, including resonant states. We finally mention the non-Markovian dynamics of open quantum systems. We emphasize the time-reversal symmetry of the dynamics that continuously connects the past and the future. We can capture it using the new complete set that we develop here.</description>

      <title>Approximating the $S$ matrix for solving the Marchenko equation: the case of channels with different thresholds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.14150</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.14150v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This work extends previous results on the inverse scattering problem within the framework of Marchenko theory (fixed-$l$ inversion). In particular, I approximate an $n$-channel $S$-matrix as a function of the first-channel momentum $q$ by a sum of a rational term and a truncated sinc series for each matrix element. Relativistic kinematics are taken into account through the correct momentum-energy relation, and the necessary minor generalization of Marchenko theory is given.
  For energies where only a subset of scattering channels is open, the analytic structure of the $S$-matrix is analyzed. I demonstrate that the submatrix corresponding to closed channels, particularly near their thresholds, can be reconstructed from the experimentally accessible submatrix of open channels.The convergence of the proposed method is verified by applying it to data generated from a direct solution of the scattering problem for a known potential, and comparing the reconstructed potential with the original one. Finally, the method is applied to the analysis of $S_{31}$ $\pi N$ scattering data.</description>

      <title>Estimation of neutron star mass and radius of FRB 20240114A by identification of crustal oscillations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.14353</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.14353v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: By identifying quasi-periodic oscillations (QPOs) reported in FRB 20240114A (from the Five-hundred-meter Aperture Spherical Telescope) with neutron star crustal torsional oscillations, together with experimental constraints on the incompressibility $K_0$ of symmetric nuclear matter at saturation density, we constrain the mass and radius of an extragalactic neutron star at redshift $z\approx0.13$. Identifying the low-order QPO frequencies as fundamental oscillations, and frequencies of $567.7\,\mathrm{Hz}$ or $655.5\,\mathrm{Hz}$ (rest frame) as first overtone candidates, implies neutron star mass ranges of $1.00$--$1.55\,M_\odot$ or $1.17$--$1.76\,M_\odot$, respectively. The radius is also constrained, with a self-consistent value around $13$~km, further supported by the calculation of the NS structure within the low-mass/low-central density regime. Simultaneously, we also constrain another nuclear saturation parameter, namely the density dependence of the nuclear symmetry energy at saturation density (i.e., the slope parameter), $L$, and determine it to be $L=59.5-96.8$ MeV with $\sim 10\%$ systematic uncertainty, which is broadly consistent with previous constraints on $L$ obtained from experiments and astronomical observations. Thus, a mapping of FRB QPOs to crustal torsional modes seems reasonable. This can be confirmed with upcoming FRB surveys over a broad range of redshifts and more elaborate data analyses.</description>

Abstract: In this work, we study the effect of the symmetry slope on the observables of weakly and strongly magnetized neutron stars within the chaotic magnetic field approximation. We investigate the impact of the symmetry energy slope in the equation of state, as well as on the observables of neutron stars, by calculating their masses, radii, redshifts, tidal deformabilities, and fundamental-mode gravitational-wave frequencies.</description>

      <title>The initial data of effective field theories of relativistic viscous fluids and gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.14541</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.14541v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: There has been recent progress in developing well-posed theories of relativistic viscous hydrodynamics and of gravitational effective field theories. These have in common the feature that they introduce unphysical degrees of freedom. We address the problem of how these should be treated. We propose a ''reduction of order'' approach which is applied not at the level of equations of motion but only to initial data. This specifies uniquely the data for the unphysical modes in terms of the data for the physical modes. We argue that the apparent breaking of Lorentz invariance associated with this approach is not a problem provided one restricts to Lorentz frames for which the assumptions of effective field theory are manifestly valid.</description>

Abstract: We use the Born--Oppenheimer effective field theory factorization to compute the inclusive production cross sections of the $\chi_{c1}(3872)$ and its partner in the bottomonium sector. In the same framework, we compute the production cross sections of the pentaquark states $P_{c\bar{c}}(4312)^+$, $P_{c\bar{c}}(4457)^+$, $P_{c\bar{c}}(4380)^+$ and $P_{c\bar{c}}(4440)^+$ within two possible scenarios for the Born--Oppenheimer potentials. Also for pentaquarks, we extend the results to the bottomonium sector. All our results are genuine predictions that do not involve fits to prompt hadroproduction data.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2504.10301v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A brief excursion into the three-body problem in quantum mechanics is presented for graduate students or researchers in nuclear physics. Starting from single-particle coordinates, the three-body Schr\"{o}dinger equation is systematically transformed into a representation in Jacobi coordinates. Gradient, Laplacian, and kinetic energy operators are explicitly derived using the multivariable chain rule. Faddeev equations are reformulated in hyperspherical coordinates. In all transformations (from single-particle coordinates to Jacobi coordinates, rotation between Jacobi coordinates and from Jacobi coordinates to hyperspherical coordinates) the determinant of the Jacobian matrix is computed to ensure correct transformation of volume elements. The Faddeev equations in hyperspherical coordinates are projected onto a hyperspherical harmonics basis, leading to the coupled hyperradial equations that define the hyperspherical harmonics method.</description>

      <title>On non-flow suppression in an MLE-based flow analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.11113</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.11113v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We show that the maximum likelihood estimator (MLE) is an effective tool for mitigating non-flow effects in flow analysis. To this end, one constructs two toy models that simulate non-flow contributions corresponding to particle decay and momentum conservation, respectively. The performance of MLE is analyzed by comparing it against standard approaches such as particle correlation and event plane methods. For both cases, MLE is observed to provide a reasonable estimate of the underlying flow harmonics, and in particular, its performance can be further improved when the specific form of the likelihood in the presence of non-flow can be assessed. The dependencies of extracted flow harmonics on the multiplicity of individual events and the total number of events are analyzed. Additionally, it is shown that the proposed approach performs efficiently in addressing deficiencies in detector acceptance. These findings suggest MLE as a compelling alternative to standard methods for flow analysis.</description>

Abstract: Muon-catalyzed fusion has recently regained significant attention due to experimental and theoretical developments being performed. The present authors [Phys. Rev. C {\bf 109} 054625 (2024)] proposed the tractable $T$-matrix model based on the Lippmann-Schwinger equation to approximate the elaborate two- and three-body coupled-channel (CC) calculations [Kamimura, Kino, and Yamashita, Phys. Rev. C {\bf 107}, 034607 (2023)] for the nuclear reaction processes in the muonic molecule $dt\mu$, $(dt\mu)_{J=0} \to\!^4{\rm He} + n + \mu + 17.6 \, {\rm MeV}$. % or $(^4{\rm He}\mu)_{nl} + n + 17.6 \,{\rm MeV}$. The $T$-matrix model well reproduced almost all of the results generated by the CC work. In the present paper, we apply this model to the nuclear reaction processes in the $dd\mu$ molecule, $(dd\mu)_{J=1} \to\!^3{\rm He} + n + \mu +3.27 \,$ MeV or $t + p + \mu + 4.03 \,$ MeV, in which the fusion takes place via the $p$-wave $d$-$d$ relative motion. Recently, significantly different $p$-wave astrophysical $S(E)$ factors of the reaction $d + d \to\!^3{\rm He} + n$ or $t + p$ at $E \! \simeq \! 1$ keV to 1 MeV have been reported experimentally and theoretically by five groups. Employing many sets of nuclear interactions that can reproduce those five cases of $p$-wave $S(E)$ factors, we calculate the fusion rate of the $(dd\mu)_{J=1}$ molecule using three kinds of methods where results are consistent with each other. We also derive the $^3{\rm He}$-$\mu$ sticking probability and the absolute values of the energy and momentum spectra of the emitted muon. The violation of charge symmetry in the $p$-wave $d$-$d$ reaction and the $dd\mu$ fusion reaction is discussed. Information on the emitted 2.45-MeV neutrons and \mbox{1 keV-dominant} muons should be useful for the application of $dd\mu$ fusion.</description>

      <title>Transport-based initial conditions for heavy-ion collisions at finite densities</title>

      <description>arXiv:2510.06996v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We employ the SMASH transport model to provide event-by-event initial conditions for the energy-momentum tensor and conserved charge currents in hydrodynamic simulations of relativistic heavy-ion collisions. We study the fluctuations and dynamical evolution of three conserved charge currents (net baryon, net electric charges, and net strangeness) with a 4D lattice-QCD-based equation of state, NEOS-4D, in the hydrodynamic phase. Out-of-equilibrium corrections at the particlization are generalized to finite densities to ensure the conservation of energy, momentum, and the three types of charges. These theoretical developments are integrated within the X-SCAPE code as a unified framework for studying the nuclear matter properties in the Beam Energy Scan program.</description>

      <title>Computing nuclear response functions with time-dependent coupled-cluster theory</title>

      <description>arXiv:2510.19940v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We compute nuclear response functions by solving the time-dependent A-body Schr\"odinger equation, recording the time-dependent transition moment and extracting spectral information via Fourier transforms. The solution of the time-dependent many-body problem accounts for correlations on top of the mean field by taking advantage of a time-dependent formulation of coupled-cluster theory. As a validation, we focus on electric dipole transitions in $^4$He and $^{16}$O and compare moments of the response function distribution to the results of an equivalent static framework, finding negligible discrepancies. We investigate how proton and neutron densities evolve in time, and we see the traditional picture of soft and giant dipole resonances as collective oscillations of protons and neutrons emerging from our calculations in $^{16}$O and $^{24}$O. This method also allows us to investigate the behavior of the nucleus in the presence of a strong electric field. In that regime, the behavior of the system becomes chaotic. Qualitatively, the spectral information obtained in this limit is in line with previous time-dependent mean-field results.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2510.24325v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Entanglement is a fundamental resource in quantum information science, with profound implications for computing, communication, and metrology. Nuclear scattering processes, dominated by rich spin-dependent interactions, offer a natural platform for generating complex spin entanglement. Here, using proton-proton scattering as a quantum laboratory, we report the emergence of a near-pure Bell-triplet state at a laboratory energy of 151 MeV and a center-of-mass scattering angle of 90 degrees, with the spin amplitude a transition operator connecting two different Bell states. In contrast to the low-energy singlet state governed by the Pauli principle and the S-wave dominance, this second maximally entangled state is directly shaped by tensor forces beyond leading-order chiral effective field theory, providing a distinct quantum-information signature for realistic nuclear forces. These findings, invisible to traditional scattering observables, establish proton-proton scattering as a robust source of triplet entanglement and pave the way for next-generation nuclear Bell tests.</description>

      <title>Basis truncation, statistical errors, and systematic uncertainties in relativistic approaches to nuclear response</title>

      <description>arXiv:2512.23125v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Although there exists a clear and, in principle, exact theoretical formulation for the equation of motion for the response of a correlated fermionic system, its numerical implementations for atomic nuclei require feasible approximations. One of the widely accepted approximations is a truncated harmonic oscillator (HO) basis, whose wave functions are used to expand the solutions obtained with realistic interactions. In this work, we extend previously employed HO basis truncated at $N_F$ = 20 fermionic shells to $N_F$ = 50 and perform a systematic study of the effects of such basis increase on nuclear resonances. The relativistic random phase approximation (RRPA) and its extension by the particle-vibration coupling dubbed as relativistic time-blocking approximation (RTBA) are applied to the description of the monopole, dipole, quadrupole, and octupole resonances in $^{48}$Ca, $^{78}$Ni, and $^{132}$Sn, and the RRPA studies are extended to $^{70}$Ca and $^{208}$Pb. A considerable sensitivity of the strength distributions to the HO basis size is found, especially for low-spin resonances in the light neutron-rich nuclei. The effects of the HO basis extension to $N_F$ = 50 are analyzed and linked to the involvement of proton and neutron continuum states and proton quasi-bound states in the strength formation. The obtained results point to the importance of the HO basis completeness and continuum effects in the nuclear response calculations and evaluation of the associated parameters of the nuclear equation of state. Statistical errors and systematic uncertainties in the RRPA strength functions are analyzed. They are found to be substantial for the monopole response, but significantly smaller for the dipole, quadrupole, and octupole ones. Neither of them shows a pronounced mass dependence, and statistical errors are generally smaller than systematic uncertainties.</description>

      <title>Dipole response in deformed halo nuclei $^{42}\mathrm{Mg}$ and $^{44}\mathrm{Mg}$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.08438</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.08438v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The quasiparticle finite amplitude method based on the deformed relativistic Hartree-Bogoliubov theory in continuum has been developed for the noncharge-exchange multipole response. Taking neutron-rich magnesium isotopes as examples, the isovector electric dipole response, especially in the low-lying region, is studied. It is found that the low-energy dipole strength increases with neutron number and becomes notably enhanced in the predicted deformed halo nuclei $^{42}\mathrm{Mg}$ and $^{44}\mathrm{Mg}$. In these isotopes, the $K^\pi=1^-$ states below 3 MeV are dominated by transitions from the ``halo" part of the single-neutron orbitals. Their transition densities reveal a low-frequency, out-of-phase oscillation between the neutron halo and the core. These results provide a microscopic picture for the soft dipole resonance in $^{42}\mathrm{Mg}$ and $^{44}\mathrm{Mg}$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2602.02429v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Using the nuclear DFT approach with symmetry breaking and restoration, we investigate the electromagnetic properties of the ground and isomeric states in $^{229}$Th. We determine the magnetic dipole transition strength B(M1:$3/2^+_1\rightarrow 5/2^+_1)$ between these two states and discuss the effects of parity breaking, configuration mixing, and time-odd core polarization. We also determine the corresponding spectroscopic magnetic dipole and electric quadrupole moments. Because the octupole deformability of the Skyrme functionals used here is not described in sufficient detail, we analyze the results using a set of Skyrme functionals, with regression aligned with the measured octupole moments of neighboring even-even nuclei. Without parameter adjustment, the results compare favorably with the experimental data but also indicate the need to systematically adjust the octupole degrees of freedom in future functional parametrizations.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2309.07890v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Spin-1 particles, is a fundamental bound state for the two quarks, and play a crucial role in elucidating the electromagnetic properties within the realm of hadronic physics. Their intrinsic relativistic nature mandates a quantum field theory (QFT) framework for a comprehensive analysis. In this investigation, we employ both the instant form of QFT and light-front quantum field theory (LFQFT) as our theoretical tools. While conventional LFQFT approaches predominantly focus on the plus component of the electromagnetic current to extract the properties of spin-1 vector particles, our study extends this analysis by systematically incorporating the minus component as well. Our findings demonstrate that achieving a rigorous equivalence between these distinct current components necessitates the inclusion of nonvalence terms within the electromagnetic current operator. This crucial inclusion serves to restore manifest covariance and ensures a robust consistency with the results independently

      <title>Complex-valued in-medium potential between heavy impurities in ultracold atoms</title>

      <description>arXiv:2312.08241v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We formulate the induced potential in a finite temperature cold atomic medium between two heavy impurities, or polarons, which is shown to be \textit{complex-valued} in general. The imaginary part of the complex-valued potential describes a decoherence effect, and thus, the resulting Schr\"odinger equation for the two polarons acquires a non-Hermitian term. We apply the developed formulation to two representative cases of polarons interacting with medium particles through the $s$-wave contact interaction: (i) the normal phase of single-component (i.e., spin-polarized) fermions using the fermionic field theory, and (ii) a superfluid phase using the superfluid effective field theory, which is valid either for a Bose-Einstein condensate (BEC) of a single-component Bose gas or for the BEC-BCS crossover in two-component fermions at a low-energy regime. Computing the leading-order term, the imaginary part of the potential in both cases is found to show a universal $r^{-2}$ behavior at long distance. We propose three experimental ways to observe the effects of the universal imaginary potential in cold atoms.</description>

      <title>Semi-Classical Spin Hydrodynamics in Flat and Curved Spacetime: Covariance, Linear Waves, and Bjorken Background</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.19854</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.19854v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We explore various aspects of semi-classical spin hydrodynamics, where hydrodynamic currents are derived from an expansion in the reduced Planck constant $\hbar$, incorporating both flat and curved spacetimes. After establishing covariant definitions for angular momentum currents, we demonstrate that the conservation of the energy-momentum tensor requires modifications involving the Riemann curvature and the spin tensors. We also revise pseudo-gauge transformations to ensure their applicability in curved spacetimes. Key assumptions for semi-classical spin hydrodynamics are introduced, enabling studies without explicitly invoking quantum kinetic theory. We derive and analyze the linearized semi-classical spin hydrodynamic equations, proving that spin and fluid modes decouple in the linear regime. As a concrete example, we study the ideal-spin approximation in a dissipative fluid with shear viscosity. This analysis confirms our general result: the damping of spin waves is governed solely by spin relaxation time coefficients, independent of linear fluid perturbations. We also examine the Gibbs stability criterion and reveal its limitations at first order in $\hbar$, signaling the inherent anisotropy of the equilibrium state, which remains unaddressed in current semi-classical spin hydrodynamics formulations. Finally, within a conformal Bjorken flow background and using the slow-roll approximation attractor for the fluid sector, we show that the relaxation of the spin potential is governed by spin relaxation time coefficients, mirroring the damping behavior of spin waves in the linear regime.</description>

Abstract: We compute photon emission rate enhancement near the QCD critical point using an effective theory of dynamic critical phenomena and derive a universal photon spectrum. The emission rate scales similarly to conductivity, increasing with the correlation length ($\xi$), diverging at the critical point. The spectrum exhibits $\omega dN_{\gamma}/d^3k \propto \omega^{-1/2}$ in the scaling regime, with the transition occurring at a frequency comparable to shear damping rate $\omega \sim \gamma_{\eta}/\xi^2$, reflecting the nonequilibrium properties of the near-critical liquid.</description>

Abstract: We employ Born-Oppenheimer approximation to the $T_{c\bar s0}^a(2900)^0$ and $T_{c\bar s0}^a(2900)^{++}$ states observed by the LHCb Collaboration and study mass spectrum and root-mean-square radius values. For this purpose, we use dynamical diquark model. We assume that strange quark is a heavy for the usage of Born-Oppenheimer approximation. Our results strongly indicate that the $T_{c\overline{s}0}^{a}(2900)$ states are best described as composed of axial-vector (spin-1) diquark pairs. Furthermore, the calculated root-mean-square radius, $\langle r^{2}\rangle^{1/2} \approx 0.70-0.80$ fm, which is significantly less than 1 fm, provides compelling evidence that these are compact tetraquarks rather than loosely bound hadronic molecules.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2512.24508v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We describe in detail the implementation of the relativistic three-neutron finite-volume quantization condition derived in Ref. [1]. In particular, we show how the complications due to Wigner rotations acting on spins are included, and present concrete formulas for the case when the angular momenta within pairs is restricted to be less than 2. We describe the symmetries of the matrices appearing in the quantization condition, and decompose solutions into irreducible representations of the appropriate doubled finite-volume symmetry groups. We present an implementation of the three-particle K matrix, keeping the two lowest-order terms in the threshold expansion. We provide numerical predictions for the finite-volume spectrum for a setup with nearly physical parameters, including two-particle interactions that are based on experimental results. This exploratory study shows the how lattice QCD calculations of the three-neutron spectrum with sufficient precision can provide detailed information on both two- and three-particle interactions.</description>
