      <title>Gold nanocone array with wide angles and high absorptivity for light absorber</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.09758</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.09758v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The gold nanocone array, fabricated with the ion track method, exhibits exceptionally high light absorptivity, making it a wide angle light absorber. The finite difference time domain (FDTD) method was employed to study the influence of the geometric parameters on total absorptivity and promote strategies to enhance the absorptivity of the gold nanocone array. Experimental measurements were concluded to assess the total absorption and bidirectional reflection distribution function (BRDF) properties of the gold nanocone array. The absorptivity measurement results demonstrate that the gold nanocone array exhibits a wide angle (5-75{\deg}) of incidence and high absorptivity properties, achieving an absorptivity over 0.98. The BRDF results show that the reflection of the gold nanocone array is predominantly attributed to non-specular reflections, and exhibits excellent Lambert properties. This study reveals the influence of structural parameters and light incidence angle on the absorptivity of the gold nanocone array, which plays an important role in further understanding the light absorption/reflection mechanism and enhancing the absorptivity.</description>

      <title>Ultra-rapid broadband mid-infrared spectral tuning and sensing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.09945</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.09945v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Tunable mid-infrared lasers are essential for optical sensing and imaging. Existing technologies, however, face challenges in simultaneously achieving broadband spectral tunability and ultra-rapid scan rates, limiting their utility in dynamic scenarios such as real-time characterization of multiple molecular absorption bands. Here, we present a high-speed approach for broadband wavelength sweeping in the mid-infrared region, leveraging spectral focusing via difference frequency generation between a chirped fiber laser and an asynchronous, frequency-modulated electro-optic comb. This method enables pulse-to-pulse spectral tuning at a speed of 5.6 THz/us with 380 elements. Applied to spectroscopic sensing, our technique achieves broad spectral coverage (2600-3780 cm-1) with moderate spectral resolution (8 cm-1) and rapid acquisition times (6.3 us). Notably, the controllable electro-optic comb facilitates high scan rates of up to 2 Mscans/s across the full spectral range (corresponding to a speed of 60 THz/us), with trade-offs in number of elements (~30) and spectral point spacing or resolution (33 cm-1). Nevertheless, these capabilities make our platform highly promising for applications such as flow cytometry, chemical reaction monitoring, and mid-IR ranging and imaging.</description>

      <title>Observation of single-photon azimuthal backflow with weak measurement</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.09952</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.09952v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum backflow, a counterintuitive interference phenomenon where particles with positive momentum can propagate backward, is important in applications involving light-matter interactions. To date, experimental demonstrations of backflow have been restricted to classical optical systems, where momentum is measured using the slit scanning technique or the Shack-Hartmann wavefront sensor technique. However, these techniques have low spatial resolution due to limitations in slit width and Fourier transform lenslet array density. Here, by adopting the technique of weak measurement, we report an observation of azimuthal backflow both theoretically and experimentally. Our results show that a heralded single photon, prepared in specific superposition states with solely negative orbital angular momentum (OAM), exhibits positive OAM. The effects of mode ratio, propagation distance and OAM index on the azimuthal backflow are systematically investigated. Our method avoids using slits and lenslet arrays, allowing for the accurate extraction of photon momentum at each pixel. This work provides new insights and techniques for observing and manipulating backflow in quantum systems.</description>

      <title>Temporal refraction and reflection in modulated mechanical metabeams: theory and physical observation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.09989</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.09989v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Wave reflection and refraction at a time interface follow different conservation laws compared to conventional scattering at a spatial interface. This study presents the experimental demonstration of refraction and reflection of flexural waves across a temporal boundary in a continuum based mechanical metabeam, and unveils opportunities that emerge by tailoring temporal scattering phenomena for phononic applications. We observe these phenomena in an elastic beam attached to an array of piezoelectric patches that can vary in time the effective elastic properties of the beam. Frequency conversion and phase conjugation are observed upon a single temporal interface. These results are consistent with the temporal Snell law and Fresnel equations for temporal interfaces. Further, we illustrate the manipulation of amplitude and frequency spectra of flexural wave temporal refraction and reflection through multi stepped temporal interfaces. Finally, by implementing a smooth time variation of wave impedance, we numerically and experimentally demonstrate the capabilities of the temporal metabeam to realize waveform morphing and information coding. Our findings lay the foundation for developing time mechanical metamaterials and time phononic crystals, offering new avenues for advanced phonon manipulation in both wave amplitude and frequency</description>

      <title>Cepstrum-based interferometric microscopy (CIM) for quantitative phase imaging</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.10022</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.10022v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A universal methodology for coding-decoding the complex amplitude field of an imaged sample in coherent microscopy is presented, where no restrictions on any of the two interferometric beams are required. Thus, the imaging beam can be overlapped with, in general, any other complex amplitude distribution and, in particular, with a coherent and shifted version of itself considering two orthogonal directions. The complex field values are retrieved by a novel Cepstrum-based algorithm, named as Spatial-Shifting Cepstrum (SSC), based on a weighted subtraction of the Cepstrum transform in the cross-correlation term of the object field spectrum in addition with the generation of a complex pupil from the combination of the information retrieved from different holographic recordings (one in horizontal and one in vertical direction) where one of the interferometric beams is shifted 1 pixel. As a result, the field of view is tripled since the complex amplitudes of the three interferometric fields involved in the process are retrieved. Proof-of-concept validation of this methodology, named as Cepstrum-based Interferometric Microscopy (CIM), is provided considering an off-axis holographic configuration for retrieving the cross-correlation of the two interferometric complex amplitude fields in a compact quasi-common path Michelson interferometric configuration. Experimental results for different types of phase samples (resolution test targets for step-by-step calibration and demonstration as well as fixed biosamples) are included.</description>

      <title>Spatially Multiplexed Interferometric Microscopy with one-dimensional diffraction grating</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.10023</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.10023v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Digital holographic microscopy (DHM) applied to quantitative phase imaging (QPI) has been successfully demonstrated as a powerful label-free method to analyse the optical properties of cells. Spatially multiplexed interferometric microscopy (SMIM) is a DHM technique that implements a common-path interferometric layout in the embodiment of a standard microscope to achieve QPI. More concretely, SMIM introduces three minimal modifications: 1) replaces the broadband illumination of the microscope by a coherent or partially coherent light source, 2) divides the input plane into two or three regions for transmission in parallel of both imaging and reference beams, and 3) includes a one-dimensional diffraction grating or a beam splitter cube for holographic recording. Hence, SMIM is a cost-effective, extremely simple, and highly stable manner of converting a standard bright field microscope into a holographic one. The goal of this contribution is to provide a review of the SMIM approaches implemented using a one-dimensional (1D) diffraction grating, and highlight vast range of capabilities including super-resolved, reflective, transflective, noise-reduced and single-shot slightly off-axis amplitude and phase imaging.</description>

      <title>Yellow stimulated emission from Dy$^{3+}$-doped silica glass microspheres</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.10029</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.10029v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Dy$^{3+}$-doped silica glass whispering gallery mode microspheres are fabricated by fiber fusion splicing. They present an almost ideal spherical morphology with a radius ranging from 60 to 67 ${\mu}$m as determined by confocal laser microscopy. The host composition of the microsphere is close to that of the fiber core. The dopant Dy$^{3+}$ ions are uniformly distributed across the microsphere as evidenced by ${\mu}$-luminescence studies and present a luminescence lifetime. The Dy$^{3+}$-doped glass microspheres were excited via evanescent field coupling using a half-tapered fiber and a blue 450-nm GaN laser diode (direct pumping scheme). The yellow fluorescence of Dy$^{3+}$ ions is filtered by the whispering gallery modes (free spectral range: 0.5 nm for 67-${\mu}$m radius microsphere). The onset of stimulated emission is further observed highlighting the potential of such microresonators for narrow-linewidth light sources directly emitting visible light.</description>

      <title>Approaching the quantum-limited precision in frequency-comb-based spectral interferometry for length measurements</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.10044</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.10044v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Over the last two decades, frequency combs have brought breakthroughs in length metrology with traceability to length standards. In particular, frequency-comb-based spectral interferometry is regarded as a promising technology for next-generation length standards. However, to achieve this, the nanometer-level precision inherent in laser interferometer is required. Here, we report distance measurements by a frequency-comb-based spectral interferometry with sub-nm precision close to a standard quantum limit. The measurement precision was confirmed as 0.67 nm at an averaging time of 25 us. The measurement sensitivity was found to be 4.5 10-12m/Hz1/2, close to the quantum-limit. As a practical example of observing precise physical phenomena, we demonstrated measurements of acoustic-wave-induced vibration and laser eavesdropping. Our study will be an important step toward the practical realization of upcoming length standards.</description>

      <title>Controllable perfect spatiotemporal optical vortices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.10055</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.10055v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Spatiotemporal optical vortices (STOVs), as a kind of structured light pulses carrying transverse orbital angular momentum (OAM), have recently attracted significant research interest due to their unique photonic properties. However, general STOV pulses typically exhibit an annular intensity profile in the spatiotemporal plane, with a radius that scales with the topological charge, limiting their potential in many applications. Here, to address this limitation, we introduce the concept of perfect spatiotemporal optical vortices (PSTOVs). Unlike STOV pulses, the intensity distribution of PSTOV wavepackets is nearly independent of the topological charge. We show that such wavepackets can be generated by applying the spatiotemporal Fourier transform to a Bessel-Gaussian mode in the spatiotemporal frequency domain. More importantly, the mode distribution of PSTOV wavepackets can be freely controlled by introducing azimuthal-dependent phase modulation, enabling conversion from a standard annular profile to arbitrary polygonal shapes. Finally, experimental results confirm the successful generation of these wavepackets. Our findings will expand the study of STOV pulses and explore their potential applications in optical communications, information processing, topological photonics, and ultrafast control of light-matter interactions.</description>

      <title>Time-Resolved Measurements of Cumulative Effects in Gas Dynamics Induced by High-Repetition-Rate Femtosecond Laser Filamentation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.10198</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.10198v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The advent of high-average-power, ultrafast ytterbium-based lasers allows us to generate laser filaments at repetition rates ranging from 10s of kHz up to 100s of kHz. At such high repetition rates, the inter-pulse time lies below the time required for the total diffusion of the deposited heat by each laser pulse, leading to cumulative hydrodynamic effects that have so far been rarely studied. Here, we present, to the best of our knowledge, the first experimental time-resolved measurements of these dynamics in air for laser repetition rates between 1 kHz and 100 kHz. We measure the change in the air refractive index caused by the localized heat deposition and the length of the filament-generated plasma channel, with which we can infer the corresponding change in air density. We observe that at repetition rates above 10 kHz, stationary density depletions with vanishing dynamics emerge. Our findings are of wide relevance for the fields of high-repetition-rate laser filamentation and its applications, as well as THz generation from laser-induced plasma sources.</description>

      <title>Temporal characterization of femtosecond electron pulses inside ultrafast scanning electron microscope</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.10250</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.10250v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, we present the implementation of all-optical method for directly measuring electron pulse duration in an ultrafast scanning electron microscope. Our approach is based on the interaction of electrons with the ponderomotive potential of an optical standing wave and provides a precise in situ technique to characterize femtosecond electron pulses across a wide range of electron energies (1-30 keV). By using single-photon photoemission of electrons by ultraviolet femtosecond laser pulses from a Schottky emitter we achieve electron pulse durations ranging from 0.5 ps at 30 keV to 2.7 ps at 5.5 keV under optimal conditions where Coulomb interactions are negligible. Additionally, we demonstrate that reducing the photon energy of the femtosecond pulses used for photoemission from 4.8 eV (257.5 nm) to 2.4 eV (515 nm) decreases the initial energy spread of emitted electrons, leading to significantly shorter pulse durations, particularly at lower electron energies.</description>

      <title>Monolithically 3D nano-printed mm-scale lens actuator for dynamic focus control in optical systems</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.10254v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Three-dimensional (3D) nano-printing via two-photon polymerization offers unparalleled design flexibility and precision, thereby enabling rapid prototyping of advanced micro-optical elements and systems, including hybrid achromats, diffractive and flat optics, millimeter-sized lenses, fiber-optic sensor heads, and photonic waveguides. These elements have found important applications in endomicroscopy and biomedical imaging. The potential of this versatile tool for monolithic manufacturing of dynamic micro-opto-electro-mechanical systems (MOEMS), however, has not yet been sufficiently explored. This work introduces a 3D nano-printed lens actuator with a large optical aperture, optimized for remote focusing in miniaturized imaging systems. The device integrates ortho-planar linear motion springs, a self-aligned sintered micro-magnet, and a monolithic lens, actuated by dual micro-coils for uniaxial motion. The use of 3D nano-printing allows complete design freedom for the integrated optical lens, while the monolithic fabrication ensures inherent alignment of the lens with the mechanical elements. With a lens diameter of 1.4 mm and a compact footprint of 5.74 mm, it achieves high mechanical robustness at resonant frequencies exceeding 300 Hz while still providing large a displacement range of 200 um (+- 100 um). A comprehensive analysis of optical and mechanical performance, including the effects of coil temperature and polymer viscoelasticity, demonstrates its advantages over conventional MEMS actuators, showcasing its potential for next-generation imaging applications.</description>

      <title>Diffraction of Light from Optical Fourier Surfaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.10340</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.10340v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Diffractive surfaces shape optical wavefronts for applications in spectroscopy, high-speed communication, and imaging. The performance of these structures is primarily determined by how precisely they can be patterned. Fabrication constraints commonly lead to square-shaped, "binary" profiles that contain unwanted spatial frequencies that contaminate the diffraction. Recently, "wavy" surfaces (known as optical Fourier surfaces, OFSs) have been introduced that include only the desired spatial frequencies. However, the optical performance and reliability of these structures have not yet been experimentally tested with respect to models and simulations. Such a quantitative investigation could also provide previously unobtainable information about the diffraction process from the most fundamental diffractive surfaces$\unicode{x2014}$sinusoidally pure profiles. Here, we produce and study two classes of reflective OFSs: (i) single-sinusoidal profiles of varying depth and (ii) double-sinusoidal profiles with varying relative phase. After refining our fabrication procedure to obtain larger and deeper OFSs at higher yields, we find that the measured optical responses from our OFSs agree quantitatively with full electrodynamic simulations. In contrast, our measurements diverge from analytical scalar diffraction models routinely used by researchers to describe diffraction. Overall, our results confirm that OFSs provide a precise and powerful platform for Fourier-spectrum engineering, satisfying the growing demand for intricately patterned interfaces for applications in holography, augmented reality, and optical computing.</description>

      <title>Fundamental mode power estimation through a $M^2$-measurement</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.10345</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.10345v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Beam quality is a crucial metric for evaluating light source performance, with the $M^2$ beam quality parameter serving as the standard since the 1990s. Applications typically demand a mode profile resembling a fundamental Gaussian mode, characterized by an $M^2$ value near 1. However, direct quantification of the fundamental mode's contribution has remained challenging. We establish a relation between $M^2$ measurements and the fundamental mode power, in its most general form: $P_{00}\geq 2 - M_x^2/2 - M_y^2/2$. This enables more accurate beam quality assessments, critical for a majority of light source applications.</description>

      <title>Purcell-Enhanced, Directional Light-Matter Interaction in a Waveguide-Coupled Nanocavity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.10351</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.10351v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We demonstrate electrically tunable, spin-dependent, directional coupling of single photons by embedding quantum dots (QDs) in a waveguide-coupled nanocavity. The directional behavior arises from direction-dependent interference between two cavity modes when coupled to the device waveguides. The small mode volume cavity enables simultaneous Purcell enhancement (${10.8\pm0.7}$) and peak directional contrast (${88\pm1\%}$), exceeding current state-of-the-art waveguide-only systems. We also present a scattering matrix model for the transmission through this structure, alongside a quantum trajectory-based model for predicting the system's directionality, which we use to explain the observed asymmetry in directional contrast seen in QD devices. Furthermore, the nanocavity enables wide-range electrical tuning of the emitter's directional contrast. We present results showing precise tuning of a QD emission line from a directional contrast of ${2\%}$ to ${96\%}$. In combination, these characteristics make this cavity-waveguide approach promising for use as a building block in directional nanophotonic circuits.</description>

      <title>An Overview of CV-MDI-QKD</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.09818</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.09818v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: As quantum key distribution (QKD) emerges as a robust defense against quantum computer threats, significant advancements have been realized by researchers. A pivotal focus has been the development of protocols that not only simplify hardware implementation like the use of continuous-variable (CV) systems, but also negate the necessity for trusted nodes, as seen with the measurement-device independent (MDI) approach. This paper delves into the integration of these methodologies in the CV-MDI-QKD protocol, offering an in-depth exploration of its evolution, primary characteristics, and the latest advancements in both theory and experiment.</description>

      <title>Topological-to-Topological Transition Induced by On-Site Nonlinearity in a One-Dimensional Topological Insulator</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.10087</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.10087v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recent studies have extended the notion of band topology to nonlinear systems by defining nonlinear counterparts of eigenvalue problems. They have found the nonlinearity-induced topological transition, while it has required complicated nonlinearity such as off-diagonal one. Thus, the existence of nonlinearity-induced transitions has been unclear under homogeneous on-site nonlinearity, which is ubiquitously found in nature. We here reveal that such on-site nonlinearity can induce transitions of topological modes, where topological modes converging to zero begin to converge to nonzero values. Since such nonlinearity-induced transition remains the bulk band topology unchanged, we can regard it as a transition from a conventional topological mode to one unique to nonlinear systems. We analyze a nonlinear eigenvalue problem by rewriting it to a dynamical system in the spatial direction and clarify that the nonlinearity-induced transition is a result of the bifurcation in the spatial dynamics. We also propose a possible setup to observe the nonlinearity-induced transition that uses a gradual amplification of nonlinear waves. These results provide a general designing principle of topological insulators controlled by nonlinearity.</description>

      <title>Electroluminescence in n-type GaAs unipolar nanoLEDs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.10142</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.10142v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this Letter, we report the observation of electroluminescence (EL) at around 866 nm from n-i-n unipolar (electron-transporting) III-V GaAs nanoLEDs. The devices consist of nanopillars with top diameter of 166 nm, arranged in a 10x10 pillar array. Hole generation through impact ionization and Zener tunnelling is achieved by incorporating an AlAs/GaAs/AlAs double-barrier quantum well within the epilayer structure of the n-i-n diode. Time-resolved EL measurements reveal decay lifetimes larger than 300 ps, allowing us to estimate an internal quantum efficiency (IQE) higher than 2 per cent at sub-mA current injection. These results demonstrate the potential for a new class of n-type nanoscale light-emitting devices.</description>

      <title>Finite-size security of continuous-variable quantum key distribution with imperfect heterodyne measurement</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.10278</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.10278v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Continuous-variable quantum key distribution (CVQKD) using coherent states and heterodyne detection enables secure quantum communication based on technology that has large similarities to coherent optical telecommunication. Yet, practical implementations of coherent receivers used in both technologies encounter device imperfections, which for CVQKD are often not addressed in security proofs. Here, we present a theoretical framework that rigorously accounts for imperfect heterodyne measurements arising from phase imbalances in the coherent (heterodyne) receiver. Focusing on collective attacks, we establish a finite-size security proof that reveals how measurement imperfections limit the distance over which a positive key rate is achievable. To mitigate these effects, we propose a local transformation during classical post-processing. We validate our approach experimentally on a CVQKD system with an imperfect coherent receiver, underscoring its potential for scalable, cost-effective CVQKD with photonic integrated receivers in which phase-imbalances naturally appear through manufacturing tolerances.</description>

      <title>Intense Laser-Driven Phenomena In Weyl Semimetals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.10293</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.10293v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Condensed-matter provides attractive platforms to realize exotic particles, originally proposed in high-energy physics. Weyl semimetal (WSM) is a material in which low-energy collective excitations are governed by massless Weyl fermions, which appear in pairs of opposite chirality and are topologically protected. Thus, the discovery of topological materials such as WSM has heralded a new era in contemporary physics. Moreover, these materials offer exciting opportunities in next-generation signal processing and optoelectronics. This thesis explores different facets of the intense laser-driven phenomena in WSM for applications in emerging lightwave-driven Petahertz electronics and quantum technologies.</description>

      <title>Experimental Demonstration of Efficient and Polarization-Diversity Fiber-Chip Coupling by 2D Grating Couplers with 193-nm DUV Lithography</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.14432</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.14432v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Two-dimensional (2D) diffraction gratings offer a polarization-independent coupling solution between the planar photonic chips and optical fibers, with advantages including placement flexibility, ease of fabrication, and tolerance to alignment errors. In this work, we first proposed and experimentally demonstrated a highly efficient 2D grating coupler enabled by exciting multipolar resonances through bi-level dielectric structures. A 70-nm shallow-etched hole array and a 160-nm-thick deposited polycrystalline silicon tooth array are employed in our proposed 2D grating coupler. Strong optical field confinement and enhanced radiation directionality can thus be attained through the use of 193-nm deep-ultraviolet (DUV) lithography, which is readily accessible from commercial silicon photonics foundries. The measured experimental peak coupling efficiency is -2.54 dB with a minimum feature size of 180 nm. Our design exhibits a 3-dB bandwidth of around 23.4 nm with good positioning tolerance for optical fibers. Due to the benefits of perfectly vertical coupling, the measured polarization-dependent loss in our experiments is below 0.3 dB within the 3-dB working bandwidth. Our proposed 2D grating structure and design method can also be applied to other integrated optics platforms, enabling an efficient and polarization-diversity coupling between optical fibers and photonic chips while reducing requirements on feature size.</description>

      <title>A tuneable frequency comb via dual-beam laser-solid harmonic generation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.03599</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.03599v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A high-power laser pulse at normal incidence onto a plane solid target will generate odd harmonics of its frequency. However, the spacing of the harmonic lines in this configuration is fixed. Here, we study harmonic generation using two laser beams incident on a plane target at small, opposite angles to the target normal, via particle-in-cell simulations. When looking at the harmonic radiation in a specific direction via a narrow slit or pinhole, we select an angle-dependent subset of the harmonic spectrum. This way, we obtain a harmonic frequency comb that we control via the observation angle and the input laser frequency. The spectra for s- and p-polarised harmonics are studied separately, as they offer different frequency combs. The divergence of the harmonic radiation will be reduced by using wider laser spots, thus increasing the efficacy of the scheme. We will discuss extensions to this scheme, such as using beams with unequal frequencies, a slight tilt of the target, or employing more than two beams.</description>

      <title>The Spatial Complexity of Optical Computing and How to Reduce It</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.10435</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.10435v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Similar to algorithms, which consume time and memory to run, hardware requires resources to function. For devices processing physical waves, implementing operations needs sufficient "space," as dictated by wave physics. How much space is needed to perform a certain function is a fundamental question in optics, with recent research addressing it for given mathematical operations, but not for more general computing tasks, e.g., classification. Inspired by computational complexity theory, we study the "spatial complexity" of optical computing systems in terms of scaling laws - specifically, how their physical dimensions must scale as the dimension of the mathematical operation increases - and propose a new paradigm for designing optical computing systems: space-efficient neuromorphic optics, based on structural sparsity constraints and neural pruning methods motivated by wave physics (notably, the concept of "overlapping nonlocality"). On two mainstream platforms, free-space optics and on-chip integrated photonics, our methods demonstrate substantial size reductions (to 1%-10% the size of conventional designs) with minimal compromise on performance. Our theoretical and computational results reveal a trend of diminishing returns on accuracy as structure dimensions increase, providing a new perspective for interpreting and approaching the ultimate limits of optical computing - a balanced trade-off between device size and accuracy.</description>

      <title>Sensitivity adjustable in-line high-temperature sensor based on metal microwire optical Fabry-Perot interferometer</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.09895</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.09895v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The optical fiber Fabry-Perot interferometer (FPI) has been widely investigated as a potential temperature sensor. To function as a temperature sensor, the cavity of the FPI is typically constructed from either silica fibers or polymers. The silica cavity FPIs can function at temperatures exceeding 1000{\deg}C. However, its temperature sensitivity is constrained by its relatively low thermal optical coefficient and thermal expansion of silica materials. Although the polymer cavity FPI exhibits a high temperature sensitivity, its cavity is susceptible to deterioration in high-temperature environments. Here, to overcome this challenge and achieve high-sensitivity temperature sensing in a high-temperature environment, we propose a new type of temperature FPI sensor by inserting and sealing a section of Cr20Ni80 metal microwire inside a section of silica hollow core fiber (HCF) spliced to standard single-mode fiber (SMF). The FPIs exhibit a high degree of temperature sensitivity due to the high thermal expansion of the Cr20Ni80 metal microwire. Since the Cr20Ni80 metal has a high melting temperature of 1400{\deg}C, such FPIs can function in high-temperature environments. Moreover, the temperature sensitivity of this FPI can be modified without affecting its reflection spectrum by changing the length of the metallic microwire situated within the hollow core fiber. The experimental results indicate that the proposed FPIs exhibit a temperature sensitivity greater than -0.35nm/{\deg}C within the temperature range of 50{\deg}C to 440{\deg}C. Our proposed metal microwire-based FPIs are economical, robust, simple to fabricate, and capable of functioning in high-temperature environments, rendering them appealing options for practical applications</description>

      <title>Stochastic resonance in vibrational polariton chemistry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.07616</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.07616v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this work, we systematically investigate the impact of ambient noise intensity on the rate modifications of ground-state chemical reactions in an optical cavity under vibrational strong-coupling conditions. To achieve this, we utilize a numerically exact open quantum system approach--the hierarchical equations of motion in twin space, combined with a flexible tree tensor network state solver. Our findings reveal a stochastic resonance phenomenon in cavity-modified chemical reactivities: an optimal reaction rate enhancement occurs at an intermediate noise level. In other words, this enhancement diminishes if ambient noise, sensed by the cavity-molecule system through cavity leakage, is either too weak or excessively strong. In the collective coupling regime, when the cavity is weakly damped, rate enhancement strengthens as more molecules couple to the cavity. In contrast, under strong cavity damping, reaction rates decline as the number of molecules grows.</description>
