      <title>Implementation of an ITER-relevant QP-based Current Limit Avoidance algorithm in the TCV tokamak</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.04338</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.04338v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The problem of avoiding saturation of the coil currents is critical in large tokamaks with superconducting coils like ITER. Indeed, if the current limits are reached, a loss of control of the plasma may lead to a major disruption. Therefore, a Current Limit Avoidance (CLA) system is essential to operate safely. This paper provides the first experimental evidence that the online solution of a constrained quadratic optimization problem can offer a valid methodology to implement a CLA. Experiments are carried out on the Tokamak \`a Configuration Variable (TCV) at the Swiss Plasma Center, showing the effectiveness of the proposed approach and its suitability for real-time application in view of future reactors such as ITER.</description>

      <title>The Numerics of VMEC++</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.04374</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.04374v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: VMEC++ is a Python-friendly, from-scratch reimplementation in C++ of the Variational Moments Equilibrium Code (VMEC), a fixed- and free-boundary ideal-MHD equilibrium solver for stellarators and tokamaks. The first VMEC implementation was written by Steven P. Hirshman and colleagues in the 1980s and 1990s and its latest Fortran incarnation (PARVMEC, https://github.com/ORNL-Fusion/PARVMEC) is widely used in stellarator optimization systems. Our work improves on previous implementations with regard to various critical aspects: special care has been put in providing an idiomatic Python experience, from installation to actual usage; VMEC++ has a zero-crash policy; it supports inputs in the classic INDATA format as well as friendlier JSON files. VMEC++ execution times are typically less than or equal to previous implementations, and time to convergence can be decreased dramatically by leveraging its hot-restart feature: by providing the output of a VMEC++ run as initial state for a subsequent one, VMEC++ is initialized using the previously converged equilibrium. This can dramatically decrease runtimes when running on many similar magnetic configurations as it typically happens in stellarator optimization pipelines. On the flip side, some features of the original Fortran VMEC implementation are not yet available in VMEC++, such as support for non-stellarator-symmetric configurations. This contribution presents the internal numerics of the open-source VMEC++ package publicly for the first time.</description>

      <title>Spatiotemporal dynamics of nanosecond pulsed discharge in the form of a fast ionization wave: self-consistent two-dimensional modeling and comparison with experiments under negative and positive polarity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.04453</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.04453v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Nanosecond discharges are characterized by a shift in energy branching toward the excitation of electronic levels and dissociation, making them particularly attractive for plasma chemistry. Understanding the spatiotemporal structure of these discharges is especially important. This paper presents a detailed 2D-axisymmetric numerical analysis of a nanosecond discharge propagating in a long tube and in pure nitrogen. The modeling is conducted using a self-consistent plasma fluid solver under the local mean energy approximation (LMEA), including photoionization. The discharge develops at moderate pressures, 1 - 10 Torr, in the form of a fast ionization wave (FIW). Simulations are performed for both negative and positive polarities of the voltage pulse applied to the high-voltage electrode. The computational results are validated against available experimental data, including FIW velocity within the studied pressure range, electron density, longitudinal electric field, and the radial distribution of N2(C) emission on a nanosecond timescale.</description>

      <title>Turbulence-Generated Stepped Safety Factor Profiles in Tokamaks with Low Magnetic Shear</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.04459</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.04459v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Nonlinear local and global gyrokinetic simulations of tokamak plasmas demonstrate that turbulence-generated currents flatten the safety factor profile near low-order rational surfaces when magnetic shear is low, even when the plasma $\beta$ is small. A large set of flux tube simulations with different safety factor profiles (e.g. linear and non-linear safety factor profiles) and global simulations with reversed magnetic shear profiles show that such stepped safety factor profiles dramatically reduce the heat transport and are a robust phenomenon. This mechanism may play a key role in the triggering of internal transport barriers (ITBs) and more generally reveal novel strategies for improving confinement in devices with low magnetic shear.</description>

      <title>Intermittent, Reflection-Driven, Strong Imbalanced MHD Turbulence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.04585</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.04585v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We develop a phenomenological model of strong imbalanced magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) turbulence that accounts for intermittency and the reflection of Alfven waves by spatial variations in the Alfven speed. Our model predicts the slopes of the inertial-range Elsasser power spectra, the scaling exponents of the higher-order Elsasser structure functions, and the way in which the parallel (to the magnetic field) length scale of the fluctuations varies with the perpendicular length scale. These predictions agree reasonably well with measurements of solar-wind turbulence from the Parker Solar Probe (PSP). In contrast to previous models of intermittency in balanced MHD turbulence, we find that intermittency in reflection-driven MHD turbulence increases the parallel wave numbers of the energetically dominant fluctuations at small perpendicular length scales. This, like the PSP measurements with which our model agrees, suggests that turbulence in the solar wind and solar corona may lead to more ion cyclotron heating than previously realized.</description>

      <title>Overview of EXL-50 Research Progress and Future Plan</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.04745</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.04745v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: XuanLong-50 (EXL-50) is the first medium-size spherical torus (ST) in China, with the toroidal field at major radius at 50 cm around 0.5T. CS-free and non-inductive current drive via electron cyclotron resonance heating (ECRH) was the main physics research issue for EXL-50. Discharges with plasma currents of 50 kA - 180 kA were routinely obtained in EXL-50, with the current flattop sustained for up to or beyond 2 s. The current drive effectiveness on EXL-50 was as high as 1 A/W for low-density discharges using 28GHz ECRH alone for heating power less than 200 kW. The plasma current reached Ip&gt;80 kA for high-density (5*10e18m-2) discharges with 150 kW 28GHz ECRH. Higher performance discharge (Ip of about 120 kA and core density of about 1*10e19m-3) was achieved with 150 kW 50GHz ECRH. The plasma current in EXL-50 was mainly carried by the energetic electrons.Multi-fluid equilibrium model has been successfully applied to reconstruct the magnetic flux surface and the measured plasma parameters of the EXL-50 equilibrium. The physics mechanisms for the solenoid-free ECRH current drive and the energetic electrons has also been investigated. Preliminary experimental results show that 100 kW of lower hybrid current drive (LHCD) waves can drive 20 kA of plasma current. Several boron injection systems were installed and tested in EXL-50, including B2H6 gas puffing, boron powder injection, boron pellet injection. The research plan of EXL-50U, which is the upgrade machine of EXL-50, is also presented.</description>

      <title>Tracking electron capture processes in classical molecular dynamics simulations for spectral line broadening in plasmas</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.04808</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.04808v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Plasma spectroscopy is a fundamental tool for diagnosing laboratory and astrophysical plasmas. Accurate interpretation of spectra depends upon precise modeling and comprehension of Stark-broadening and other mechanisms affecting spectral lines. In this context, computer simulations have emerged as invaluable tools, offering \textit{idealized experiments} with well-defined conditions. Molecular dynamics simulations, in particular, excel at replicating the particle interactions within the plasma and their impact on the state of a radiating atom or ion. However, these simulations present challenges in tracking electron capture processes, since setting an unambiguous criterion to distinguish between bound and free electrons is not trivial. In this paper we introduce a new algorithm that, within a classical framework, precisely identifies the scenario in which an electron is captured by an ion and then follows a stable orbit around it. The algorithm's applicability extends to emitters with charges Z &gt;= 1. Importantly, the procedure enables the correct identification of valid time-histories of the electric microfield perturbing the emitting ion, which will be used for subsequent line shape calculations. As a result, our simulations naturally and accurately incorporate the effects of both strong collisions and electron capture phenomena on spectral line broadening.</description>

      <title>Influence of gas flow rate on modes of reactive oxygen and nitrogen species in a grid-type surface dielectric barrier discharge</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.04851</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.04851v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The presented work investigates a surface dielectric barrier discharge (SDBD) operated dry synthetic air as the working gas using a combination of experimental measurements and simulations. The primary objective is to characterize the production and consumption dynamics of reactive oxygen and nitrogen species to enhance the understanding of their formation and facilitate control of the discharge for applications. Densities of O3, NO2, and N2O5 are measured under varying gas flow rates, utilizing optical absorption spectroscopy as the diagnostic method. A semi-empirical chemical kinetics model is developed based on a compilation of reactions from previous studies on similar types of discharges. The results reveal two previously known and distinct operating modes, with a mode transition occurring between the modes as the flow rate is varied. The results indicate the dependency of the mode transition on the density of sufficiently vibrationally excited nitrogen molecules, which is represented in the model by an increased vibrational temperature at lower gas flow rates. Furthermore, key reactions responsible for the production and consumption of ozone and nitrogen oxides are identified, providing insight into the importance of macroscopic parameters, such as gas temperatures and different time constants, that influence the nonlinear balance of these reactions.</description>

      <title>Applying the Liouville-Lanczos Method of Time-Dependent Density-Functional Theory to Warm Dense Matter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.04921</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.04921v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Ab initio modeling of dynamic structure factors (DSF) and related density response properties in the warm dense matter (WDM) regime is a challenging computational task. The DSF, convolved with a probing X-ray beam and instrument function, is measured in X-ray Thomson scattering (XRTS) experiments, which allows for the study of electronic structure properties at the microscopic level. Among the various ab initio methods, linear response time-dependent density functional theory (LR-TDDFT) is a key framework for simulating the DSF. The standard approach in LR-TDDFT for computing the DSF relies on the orbital representation. A significant drawback of this method is the unfavorable scaling of the number of required empty bands as the wavenumber increases, making LR-TDDFT impractical for modeling XRTS measurements over large energy scales, such as in backward scattering geometry. We consider and test an alternative approach that employs the Liouville-Lanczos (LL) method for simulating the DSF. This approach does not require empty states and allows the DSF at large momentum transfer values and over a broad frequency range to be accessed. We compare the results obtained from the LL method with those from the standard LR-TDDFT within the projector augmented-wave formalism for isochorically heated aluminum and warm dense hydrogen. Additionally, we utilize exact path integral Monte Carlo (PIMC) results for the imaginary-time density-density correlation function (ITCF) of warm dense hydrogen to rigorously benchmark the LL approach. We discuss the application of the LL method for calculating DSFs and ITCFs at different wavenumbers, the effects of pseudopotentials, and the role of Lorentzian smearing. The successful validation of the LL method under WDM conditions makes it a valuable addition to the ab initio simulation landscape, supporting experimental efforts and advancing WDM theory.</description>

      <title>Transport Characteristics and Modelling of ST40 Hot Ion Plasmas</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.04993</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.04993v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, the turbulent transport properties of ST40 hot ion plasmas are examined and fully predictive time evolving modelling of a hot ion plasma pulse was performed. Understanding turbulent transport on spherical tokamaks (STs) is challenging due to their unique geometry characteristics. ST40 hot ion plasmas are typically unstable to ion scale Trapped Electron Modes (TEMs) and Ubiquitous Modes (UMs), driven from the kinetic response of trapped particles and passing ions, and electron scale Electron Temperature Gradient Modes (ETGs) at the edge of the plasma. A comparison between the linear unstable modes of the gyro-kinetic code GS2 and the gyro-fluid code TGLF showed that both models agree to a satisfactory level. However, some discrepancy was observed at the core of the plasma where a large fraction of beams ions exists, and electromagnetic effects are potentially important. Turbulent fluxes were also observed to be somewhat overpredicted with TGLF. The core heat ion transport is observed to be close to neoclassical levels due to turbulence suppression from high rotation and fast ion stabilisation, while the edge region is dominated by anomalous transport in both ions and electrons. As a result, enhanced energy confinement is observed in those plasmas driven by the reduced turbulent core region and the confined beam ions. Fully predictive simulations using the ASTRA transport solver coupled with SPIDER, NUBEAM, NCLASS and TGLF together with a novel reduced scrape of layer (SOL) model for the simulation of the last closed flux surface (LCFS) boundary conditions was attempted. Agreement in global quantities but also kinetic profiles between the predictive and interpretative modelling as well as experimental measurements was observed.</description>

      <title>Hydrogen electron cyclotron resonance ion sources plasma characterization based on simple optical emission spectroscopy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.05080</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.05080v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Hydrogen electron cyclotron resonance ion sources plasma measurements based on simple optical emission spectroscopy on a new compact low current ion source designed and built by the authors is presented. By observing the plasma luminescence both directly and through a low-cost transmission diffraction grating, basic characterization of the Hydrogen plasma obtainable in the ion source is carried out. Through simple processing of CCD captures of these images, optimal values for the ion source relevant operation parameters, including RF power and frequency, and Hydrogen mass flow are easily obtained. Despite the simplicity of the method and its limited accuracy as compared to the use of a full standard optical spectrometric set-up, it is shown that the presented approach can cope with basic plasma diagnostic tasks as far as the successful operation of the ion source is concerned.</description>

      <title>Observations of Transition from Imbalanced to Balanced Kinetic Alfv\'enic Turbulence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.04764</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.04764v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We report observations of solar wind turbulence derived from measurements by the Parker Solar Probe. Our findings reveal the emergence of finite magnetic helicity within the transition range of the turbulence, aligning with signatures of kinetic Alfv\'en waves (KAWs). Notably, as the wave scale transitions from super-ion to sub-ion scales, the ratio of KAWs with opposing signs of magnetic helicity initially increases from approximately 1 to 6 before returning to 1. This observation provides, for the first time, compelling evidence for the transition from imbalanced kinetic Alfv\'enic turbulence to balanced kinetic Alfv\'enic turbulence.</description>

      <title>Short note on spin magnetization in QGP</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.05052</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.05052v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We outline the theory of spin QGP (quark-gluon plasma) magnetization. We explore the primordial epoch shortly after the Big-Bang within temperatures of 150 MeV to 500 MeV, also of interest to laboratory experiments. The ferro-magnetized fermion gas we consider consists of (light) quarks in laboratory QGP, and also leptons (electrons) for the case of the primordial Universe. We show that a fully spin-polarized up-quark gas could generate cosmic magnetic fields in excess of $10^{15}$ Tesla. We suggest that even a weakly spin-polarized gas would have a profound impact on properties of the primordial Universe which can be explored in laboratory QGP experiments. We present details of how the magnetization is obtained using a grand partition function approach. This requires evaluating slowly convergent magnetized Fermi-Dirac integrals.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2209.12748v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The topological properties of a magnetized cold gaseous plasma have recently been explored and the existence of topologically protected edge states has been established. These studies are limited to a magnetized plasma, where ions are infinitely massive and provide a neutralizing background. When ion motion is included, a new class of low-frequency unidirectional topological waves (TSPWs) emerges in the dispersion relation. The group velocity of these waves is in the opposite direction of high-frequency topological electron waves for a given magnetic field direction. The Berry curvature and Chern numbers are calculated to establish nontrivial topological phase. Additionally, we demonstrate a unique characteristic of ion dominated TSPW propagating above the ion cyclotron frequency: their collisionless damping via coupling to the continuum of lower-hybrid resonant modes localized inside a smooth plasma-vacuum interface. These finding broadens the possible applications and observations of these exotic excitations in space and laboratory plasmas.</description>

      <title>Generalized Fluid Models of the Braginskii Type. Part 2. The Boltzmann Operator</title>

Abstract: In our previous paper (Hunana et al. 2022) we have employed the Landau collisional operator together with the moment method of Grad and considered various generalizations of the Braginskii model, such as a multi-fluid formulation of the 21- and 22-moment models valid for general masses and temperatures, where all of the considered moments are described by their evolution equations (with fully non-linear left-hand-sides). Here we consider the same models, however, we employ the Boltzmann operator and calculate the collisional contributions via expressing them through the Chapman-Cowling collisional integrals. These ``integrals'' just represent a useful mathematical technique/notation introduced roughly 100 years ago, which (in the usual semi-linear approximation) allows one to postpone specifying the particular collisional process and finish all of the calculations with the Boltzmann operator. We thus consider multi-fluid 21- and 22-moment models which are valid for a large class of elastic collisional processes describable by the Boltzmann operator. Reduction into the 13-moment approximation recovers the models of Schunk and Burgers. We only focus on the particular cases of hard spheres, Coulomb collisions, purely repulsive inverse power force $|K|/r^\nu$ and attractive force $-|K|/r^\nu$ with repulsive rigid core (or potential $V(r)=\delta(r)- |c|/r^n$, so that the particles bounce from each other when they meet), but other cases can be found in the literature. In the Appendix, we introduce the Boltzmann operator in a way suitable for newcomers and we discuss a surprisingly simple recipe how to calculate the collisional contributions with analytic software.</description>

      <title>Response of liquid metal in a fusion reactor blanket to rapid variation of magnetic field during a transient plasma event</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.02699</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.02699v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Transient plasma events, such as plasma disruptions, are anticipated in the future magnetic-confinement nuclear fusion reactors. The events are accompanied by a rapid change in the magnetic field generated by the plasma current and, accordingly, induction of strong eddy currents and Lorentz forces within the reactor structure. This work targets processes within liquid-metal components of the reactor's breeding blankets. Order-of-magnitude analysis and numerical simulations are performed to understand the response of liquid metal to a rapidly changing magnetic field and to evaluate the accuracy of commonly used simplifying model assumptions. The response is found to consist of two stages: an initial brief stage ($\sim 1$ ms) characterized by a rapid increase in the induced currents, forces, and fluid velocity; and a subsequent stage, which is triggered by the growing velocity of the metal and marked by reversals of Lorentz force, and oscillations and decreases in the amplitude of the induced fields. The transition to the second stage sets the upper limit of the velocity ($\sim 0.5$ m/s in our tests), to which an initially quiescent metal can be accelerated during the event. The simulations indicate that many widely used model assumptions, such as the negligible role of Joule dissipation in the heat balance and the constancy of physical property coefficients, remain valid during the response. However, the assumption of liquid metal incompressibility is found to be questionable due to the potential significant effects of pressure waves.</description>
