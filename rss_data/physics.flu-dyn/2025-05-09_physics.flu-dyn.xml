      <title>Reinforcement Learning-Based Closed-Loop Airfoil Flow Control</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.04818</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.04818v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We systematically investigated a reinforcement learning (RL)-based closed-loop active flow control strategy to enhance the lift-to-drag ratio of a wing section with an NLF(1)-0115 airfoil at an angle of attack 5 degree. The effects of key control parameters, including actuation location, observed state, reward function, and control update interval, are evaluated at a chord-based Reynolds number of Re=20,000. Results show that all parameters significantly influence control performance, with the update interval playing a particularly critical role. Properly chosen update intervals introduce a broader spectrum of actuation frequencies, enabling more effective interactions with a wider range of flow structures and contributing to improved control effectiveness. The optimally trained RL controller is further evaluated in a three-dimensional numerical setup at the same Reynolds number. Actuation is applied using both spanwise-uniform and spanwise-varying control profiles. The results demonstrate that the pretrained controller, combined with a physics-informed spanwise distribution, achieves substantial performance gains. These findings extend the feasibility and scalability of a pretrained RL-based control strategy to more complex airfoil flows.</description>

      <title>Surface bubble lifetime in the presence of a turbulent air flow, and the effect of surface layer renewal</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.04819</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.04819v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Surface bubbles in the ocean are critical in moderating several fluxes between the atmosphere and the ocean. In this paper, we experimentally investigate the drainage and lifetime of surface bubbles in solutions containing surfactants and salts, subjected to turbulence in the air surrounding them modelling the wind in the ocean. We carefully construct a setup allowing us to repeatably measure the mean lifetime of a series of surface bubbles, while varying the solution and the wind speed or humidity of the air. To that end, we show that renewing the surface layer is critical to avoid a change of the physical properties of the interface. We show that the drainage of the bubbles is well modeled by taking into account the outwards viscous flow and convective evaporation. The lifetime of surface bubbles in solutions containing no salt is given by the time when evaporation becomes the main draining mechanism and independent on surfactant concentration. When salt is added, the same scaling is valid only at high surfactant concentrations. At low concentrations, the lifetime is always smaller and independent of wind speed, owing to the presence of impurities triggering a thick bursting event.</description>

      <title>Adjoint-Assisted Topology-Optimization-Inspired Analysis of Pseudo-Porous Flow Fields: Application to a Flettner Rotor</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.04833</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.04833v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper presents an adjoint-assisted, topology-optimization-inspired approach for analyzing topological sensitivities in fluid domains based on porous media formulations -- without directly utilizing the porosity field as a design variable. Instead, the method evaluates the sensitivity with respect to the porosity parameter via an indirect, adjoint formulation, enabling intuitive visualization of cost-functional improving or deteriorating regions. These sensitivity fields are not used in a classical optimization loop but rather to qualitatively assess spatial areas that indicate potential for flow improvement. A key benefit of the proposed approach is its non-intrusive nature: no modifications to existing adjoint solvers, e.g., for shape optimization purposes, are required. As such, the method can be interpreted as an alternative post-processing step that supports early-stage design insights. The approach is demonstrated on a Flettner rotor operating in atmospheric wind at a diameter-based Reynolds number and spinning ratio of ReD=2E+06 as well as k=3 to highlight its practical relevance and interpretability. Placing a container stack in cost-functional improving or deteriorating areas validates the method's prediction quality of topological flow sensitivities.</description>

      <title>Pseudo-turbulence models for compressible flow through random particle suspensions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.05013</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.05013v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A model for the pseudo-turbulent Reynolds stress tensor in compressible flows through monodisperse particle clouds is developed based on data from particle resolved numerical simulations. This model extends previous models for the incompressible regime to subsonic bulk Mach numbers. A Lagrangian model for the local pseudo-turbulent Reynolds stress around a particle, based on the correlation of a local estimate of the Reynolds stress and the drag force on the particle, is also presented. This model can be employed in Euler-Lagrange type simulations. Additionally, corresponding models for the pseudo-turbulent transport of turbulence kinetic energy, the velocity triple-correlation in the volume averaged total energy equation, is also introduced as a first effort aimed at closing the energy equation.</description>

      <title>Self-Replication of Turbulent Puffs: On the edge between chaotic saddles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.05075</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.05075v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Pipe flow is a canonical example of a subcritical flow, the transition to turbulence requiring a finite perturbation. The Reynolds number ($Re$) serves as the control parameter for this transition, going from the ordered (laminar) to the chaotic (turbulent) phase with increasing $Re$. Just above the critical $Re$, where turbulence can be sustained indefinitely, turbulence spreads via the self-replication of localized turbulent structures called puffs. To reveal the workings behind this process, we consider transitions between one and two-puff states, which dynamically are transitions between two distinct chaotic saddles. We use direct numerical simulations to explore the phase space boundary between these saddles, adapting a bisection algorithm to identify an attracting state on the boundary, termed an edge state. At $Re = 2200$, we also examine spontaneous transitions between the two saddles, demonstrating the relevance of the found edge state to puff self-replication. Our analysis reveals that the process of self-replication follows a previously proposed splitting mechanism, with the found edge state as its tipping point. Additionally, we report results for lower values of $Re$, where the bisection algorithm yields a different type of edge state. As we cannot directly observe splits at this $Re$, the self-replication mechanism here remains an open question. Our analysis suggests how this question could be addressed in future studies, and paves the way to probing the turbulence proliferation mechanism in other subcritical flows.</description>

      <title>A new paradigm for computing hydrodynamic forces on particles in Euler-Lagrange point-particle simulations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.05255</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.05255v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Accurate prediction of the hydrodynamic forces on particles is central to the fidelity of Euler-Lagrange (EL) simulations of particle-laden flows. Traditional EL methods typically rely on determining the hydrodynamic forces at the positions of the individual particles from the interpolated fluid velocity field, and feed these hydrodynamic forces back to the location of the particles. This approach can introduce significant errors in two-way coupled simulations, especially when the particle diameter is not much smaller than the computational grid spacing. In this study, we propose a novel force correlation framework that circumvents the need for undisturbed velocity estimation by leveraging volume-filtered quantities available directly from EL simulations. Through a rigorous analytical derivation in the Stokes regime and extensive particle-resolved direct numerical simulations (PR-DNS) at finite Reynolds numbers, we formulate force correlations that depend solely on the volume-filtered fluid velocity and local volume fraction, parametrized by the filter width. These correlations are shown to recover known drag laws in the appropriate asymptotic limits and exhibit a good agreement with analytical and high-fidelity numerical benchmarks for single particle cases, and, compared to existing correlations, an improved agreement for the drag force on particles in particle assemblies. The proposed framework significantly enhances the accuracy of hydrodynamic force predictions for both isolated particles and dense suspensions, without incurring the prohibitive computational costs associated with reconstructing undisturbed flow fields. This advancement lays the foundation for robust, scalable, and high-fidelity EL simulations of complex particulate flows across a wide range of industrial and environmental applications.</description>

      <title>Information-theoretic characterization of turbulence intermittency</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.05304</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.05304v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a new characterization of small-scale intermittency of turbulence based on an information-theoretic measure, that inherently segregates turbulence intermittency from kinematic intermittency. Instead of the commonly studied higher-order moments, Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence is used to quantify the deviation of turbulence pseudodissipation rate (or dissipation rate/enstrophy) from that of a Gaussian random velocity field as an accurate measure of the small-scale intermittency arising from turbulence dynamics. In addition, Shannon entropy is used to assess the uncertainty of these turbulence small-scale quantities. Analysis of direct numerical simulation data of forced homogeneous isotropic turbulent flow reveals the existence of two critical Taylor Reynolds numbers where the variation of uncertainty changes. The KL-divergence measure reveals two striking results about intermittency: (i) intermittency grows logarithmically with Reynolds number and (ii) dissipation rate and enstrophy are equally intermittent in a turbulent flow of any Reynolds number, if one considers only the intermittency arising from turbulence dynamics.</description>

      <title>Efficient Numerical Quantification of Flettner Rotor Installations</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.05401v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper introduces an inviscid Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) approach for the rapid aerodynamic assessment of Flettner rotor systems on ships. The method relies on the Eulerian flow equations, approximated utilizing a state-of-the-art Finite Volume Method with a dynamic momentum source term to enforce rotor circulation. The method offers substantial computational savings by avoiding near-wall refinement and easing time step constraints, making it ideal for early design phases such as design space exploration. Validation against potential flow theory and viscous reference simulations confirms that the method reliably predicts lift-induced forces despite its limitations in capturing parasitic drag. Three-dimensional simulations, including idealized wind tunnel setups and full-scale ship applications at high Reynolds numbers (up to ReL=1E08), demonstrate that results based on low-order convection featuring a solid numerical viscosity yield deviations with respect to viscous reference data of around O(10%). Accepting this reasonable loss of predictive accuracy provides a simulation framework with response times in the order of minutes compared to hours or even days.</description>

      <title>Dynamic injection of a compressible gas into a confined porous layer</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.05412</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.05412v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Subsurface gas storage is a critical technology in global efforts to mitigate climate change. In particular, underground hydrogen storage offers a promising solution for integrating large-scale renewable energy into the power grid. When injected into the subsurface, hydrogen's low viscosity compared to the resident brine causes it to spread rapidly, forming a thin gas layer above the brine, complicating recovery. In long aquifers, the large viscous pressure drop between the source and the outlet induces significant pressure variations, which may lead to substantial density changes in the injected gas. To examine the role of gas compressibility in the spreading dynamics, we use long-wave theory to derive coupled nonlinear evolution equations for the gas pressure and liquid/gas interface height, focusing on the limit of long domains, weak gas compressibility and low liquid/gas mobility ratio. Simulations using these equations are supplemented with a comprehensive asymptotic analysis of parameter regimes. Unlike the near-incompressible limit, in which gas spreading rates are dictated by the source strength and mobility ratio, and any compressive effects are transient, we show how, in general, compression of the main gas bubble can generate dynamic pressure changes that are coupled to those in the thin gas layer that spreads over the liquid, with compressive effects having a sustained influence along the layer. This allows compressibility to reduce spreading rates and lower gas pressures. We characterise this behaviour via a set of low-order models that reveal dominant scalings, highlighting the role of compressibility in mediating the evolution of the gas layer.</description>

      <title>Bulldozing an immersed granular material in a confined channel</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.05129v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The motion of an immersed granular material in a channel is characterised by complex interactions among the grains, between the grains and the permeating liquid, and between the grains and the channel walls. Here, we develop a reduced-order continuum model for the bulldozing of an immersed, sedimented granular material by a piston in a channel. In our continuum approach, the granular pile and the overlying fluid layer evolve as a system of coupled thin films. We model the granular phase as a dense, porous, visco-plastic material that experiences Coulomb-like friction with the walls. Conservation of mass and momentum under a thin-film approximation leads to an elliptic equation for the velocity of the grains that is coupled with an evolution equation for the height of the granular pile. We solve our model numerically for a variety of different scenarios to explore the interactions between wall friction, internal viscous-like stresses, and fluid flow above and through the pile. We complement our numerical results with a series of experiments that provide insight into the validity and limitations of the model.</description>

      <title>Implementation of Asymptotic Preserving Discrete Velocity Methods into the Simulation Code PICLas</title>

Abstract: The Bhatnagar-Gross-Krook (BGK) model of the Boltzmann equation allows for efficient flow simulations, especially in the transition regime between continuum and high rarefaction. However, ensuring efficient performances for multiscale flows, in which the Knudsen number varies by several orders of magnitude, is never straightforward. Discrete velocity methods as well as particle-based solvers can each reveal advantageous in different conditions, but not without compromises in specific regimes. This article presents a second-order asymptotic preserving discrete velocity method to solve the BGK equation, with the particularity of maintaining positivity when operations are conducted with the cell-local distribution function. With this procedure based on exponential differencing, it is therefore also possible to construct an adapted version of this second-order method using the stochastic particle approach, as previously presented. The deterministic variant and its implementation are detailed here and its performances are evaluated on several test cases. Combined to the probabilistic solver and with the possibility of a future coupling, our exponential differencing discrete velocity method provides a robust toolbox, useful for efficiently simulating multiscale gas phenomena.</description>

      <title>Mori-Zwanzig mode decomposition: Comparison with time-delay embeddings</title>

Abstract: We introduce the Mori-Zwanzig Mode Decomposition (MZMD), a novel data-driven technique for efficient modal analysis of and reduced-order modeling of large-scale spatio-temporal dynamical systems. MZMD represents an extension of Dynamic Mode Decomposition (DMD) by providing an approximate closure term with MZ memory kernels accounting for how the unresolved modes of DMD interact with the resolved modes, thus addressing limitations when the state-space observables do not form a Koopman-invariant subspace. Leveraging the Mori-Zwanzig (MZ) formalism, MZMD identifies the modes and spectrum of the discrete-time Generalized Langevin Equation (GLE); an integro-differential equation that governs the dynamics of selected observables and their memory-dependent coupling with the unresolved degrees of freedom. This feature fundamentally distinguishes MZMD from time-delay embedding methods, such as Higher-Order DMD (HODMD). In this work, we derive and analyze MZMD and compare it with DMD and HODMD, using two exemplary Direct Numerical Simulation (DNS) datasets: a 2D flow over a cylinder (as validation) and laminar-turbulent boundary-layer transition over a flared cone at Mach 6. We demonstrate that MZMD, via the addition of MZ memory terms, improves the resolution of spatio-temporal structures within the transitional/turbulent regime by the introduction of transient and periodic modes (not captured by DMD), which contain features that arise due to nonlinear mechanisms, such as the generation of the so-called hot streaks on the surface of the flared cone. Our results demonstrate that MZMD serves as an efficient generalization of DMD (reducing to DMD in the absence of memory), improves stability, and exhibits greater robustness and resistance to overfitting compared to HODMD.</description>

      <title>Preventing sinking of a disk by leveraging the boundary jump phenomenon</title>

      <description>arXiv:2312.13099v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Although it is commonly expected that a metal disk placed on the surface of water will sink, our investigation has revealed a surprising phenomenon: a vertical jet directed onto the disk from above can allow it to remain afloat. This result defies intuition, as one would assume that the force of the jet's impact would cause the disk to sink. We have discovered that this phenomenon occurs as a result of water displacement from the top of the disk caused by the impacting jet, operating through a mechanism similar to the hydraulic jump. This displacement increases the effective immersed volume, resulting in an increased buoyant force that balances gravity. In contrast to the classical case, here the jump radius is fixed by the geometric parameters of a disk, a phenomenon we refer to as the boundary jump. To further explore this effect, we have presented a theoretical model based on scaling laws, which provides the conditions required for the disk to float. The prefactor was determined through an independent experiment. Finally, we conducted experiments on the disk's floating and sinking, which showed a good match with the proposed theory.</description>

      <title>Bubble breakup probability in turbulent flows</title>

Abstract: Bubbles drive gas and chemical transfers in various industrial and geophysical contexts, in which flows are typically turbulent. As gas and chemical transfers are bubble size dependent, their quantification requires a prediction of bubble breakup. The most common idea, introduced by Kolmogorov and Hinze, is to consider a sharp limit between breaking and non breaking bubbles, given by $\mathrm{We}_c\approx 1$, where the Weber number $\mathrm{We}$ is the ratio between inertial and capillary forces at the bubble scale. Yet, due to the inherent stochasticity of the flow every bubble might in reality break. In this work, we use a stochastic linear model previously developed to infer the breakup probability of bubbles in turbulence as function of both We and the residence time. This allows us to introduce a definition of the critical Weber number accounting for the time spent by bubbles within a turbulent region. We show that bubble breakup is a memoryless process, whose breakup rate varies exponentially with $\mathrm{We}^{-1}$. The linear model successfully reproduces experimental breakup rates from the literature. We show that the stochastic nature of bubble breakup is central when the residence time of bubbles is smaller than ten correlation times of turbulence at the bubble scale: the transition between breaking and non breaking bubbles is smooth and most bubbles can break. For large residence times, the original vision of Kolmogorov and Hinze is recovered.</description>

Abstract: We study the self-organization of turbulence in a geophysically motivated two-dimensional fluid with local interactions. Using simulations and theory, we show that the out-of-equilibrium flux to small scales imposes a constraint on the large-scale emergent flow. Consequently, a rich phase diagram of large-scale configurations emerges, replacing the unique state found in flows with energy injection below the interaction scale. We explain what sets the boundaries between the different phases, and the occurrence of spontaneous symmetry breaking. Our work demonstrates that the selection mechanism of large-scale structures in quasi-geostrophic flows can be dramatically altered by forcing above the interaction scale.</description>

      <title>Interface instability of two-phase flow in a three-dimensional porous medium</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.10127</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.10127v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present an experimental study of immiscible, two-phase fluid flow through a three-dimensional porous medium consisting of randomly-packed, monodisperse glass spheres. Our experiments combine refractive-index matching and laser-induced fluorescence imaging to resolve the morphology and stability of the moving interface resulting from the injection of one fluid into another. The imposed injection rate sets a balance between gravitational and viscous forces, producing interface morphologies which range from unstable collections of tangled fingers at low rates to stable sheets at high rates. The image data are complemented by time-resolved pressure measurements. We develop a stability criterion for the fluid interface based on the analysis of the 3D images and the pressure data. This criterion involves the Darcy permeability in each of the two phases and the time derivative of the pressure drop across the medium. We observe that the relative permeability encountered by the invading fluid is modified by the imposed flow rate in our experiment, which impacts the two-phase flow dynamics. We show that, in addition to the balance between the relevant forces driving the dynamics, local regions of crystalline order in the beadpack (crystallites) affect the stability of the invading front. This work provides insights into how disorder on multiple length scales in porous media can interact with viscous, capillary, and gravitational forces to determine the stability and dynamics of immiscible fluid interfaces.</description>

      <title>Transient growth and nonlinear breakdown of wavelet-based resolvent modes in turbulent channel flow</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.08670</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.08670v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the effectiveness of the time-localised principal resolvent forcing mode at actuating the near wall cycle of turbulence. The mode is restricted to a wavelet pulse and computed from an SVD of the windowed wavelet-based resolvent operator so that it produces the largest amplification via the linearised Navier-Stokes equations. We then inject this time-localised mode into the turbulent minimal flow unit at different intensities, and measure the instantaneous deviation of the system's response from the optimal resolvent response mode. This is possible under the new formulation, which enables the modes to represent transient trajectories. For the most energetic spatial wave numbers in the minimal flow unit -- constant in the streamwise direction and once-periodic in the spanwise direction -- the forcing mode takes the shape of streamwise rolls and produces a response mode in the form of streamwise streaks that transiently grow and decay. For initial times and close to the wall, the DNS response matches the principal response mode well, but due to nonlinearities, the response across all forcing intensities decays prematurely, and a higher forcing intensity leads to faster energy decay. The principal forcing mode still leads to significant energy amplification and is more effective than a randomly-generated forcing structure and the second suboptimal resolvent forcing mode at amplifying the near-wall streaks. We compute the nonlinear energy transfer to secondary modes and observe that the breakdown of the actuated mode proceeds similarly across all forcing intensities: in the near-wall region, the induced streak forks into a structure twice periodic in the spanwise direction; in the outer region, the streak breaks up into a structure that is once periodic in the streamwise direction. In both regions, spanwise gradients account for the dominant share of nonlinear energy transfer.</description>

      <title>Effects of conjugate heat transfer on large-scale flow structures in convection</title>

Abstract: The constant temperature and constant heat flux thermal boundary conditions, both developing distinct flow patterns, represent limiting cases of ideally conducting and insulating plates in Rayleigh-B\'enard convection (RBC) flows, respectively. This study bridges the gap in between, using a conjugate heat transfer (CHT) set-up and studying finite thermal diffusivity ratios $\kapparatioIL$ to better represent real-life conditions in experiments. A three-dimensional RBC configuration including two fluid-confining plates is studied via direct numerical simulations given a Prandtl number $\Pr=1$. The fluid layer of height $H$ and horizontal extension $L$ obeys no-slip boundary conditions at the two solid-fluid interfaces and an aspect ratio of $\Gamma=L/H=30$ while the relative thickness of each plate is $\Gs=H_s/H=15$. The entire domain is laterally periodic. Here, different $\kapparatioIL$ are investigated for moderate Rayleigh numbers $\Ra=\left\{ 10^4, 10^5 \right\}$. We observe a gradual shift of the size of the characteristic flow patterns and their induced heat and mass transfer as $\kapparatioIL$ is varied, suggesting a relation between the recently studied turbulent superstructures and supergranules for constant temperature and constant heat flux boundary conditions, respectively. Performing a linear stability analysis for this CHT configuration confirms these observations theoretically while extending previous studies by investigating the impact of a varying solid plate thickness $\Gs$. Moreover, we study the impact of $\kapparatioIL$ on both the thermal and viscous boundary layers. Given the prevalence of finite $\kapparatioIL$ in nature, this work is a starting point to extend our understanding of pattern formation in geo- and astrophysical convection flows.</description>

      <title>Scatterless interferences: Delay of laminar-to-turbulent flow transition by a lattice of subsurface phonons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.18835</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.18835v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Turbulent boundary-layer flows generate significantly higher surface-friction drag than flows that remain laminar. Avoidance or delay of laminar-to-turbulent transition is therefore critical for the efficient operation of air and water vehicles. However, control of the flow perturbations that trigger this transition is difficult due to their unstable and persistent nature. Here we present a passive, phonons-based approach that targets these perturbations through engineered interactions at the flow-surface interface. This intervention is achieved via a tailored frequency- and wavevector-dependent coupling between the flow and a smooth, homogeneous surface, beneath which a functional material architecture is entirely embedded. The subsurface consists of a wall-parallel lattice of wall-normal phononic structural units. Each discrete phononic subsurface (PSub) unit is designed to respond to local flow disturbances in an out-of-phase manner, effectively suppressing the perturbations at the point of interaction. Collectively, the lattice induces interference effects that cause the kinetic energy of the flow instabilities to decay downstream of the intervention region, and thereby delaying the transition. To guide the design of the subsurface lattice, a Bloch-wave analysis is developed for the flow perturbations within a representative unit cell interfaced with a PSub unit. This is followed by direct numerical simulations to validate the concept. This approach represents a paradigm shift in the design philosophy for aircraft, ship, and submarine surfaces$-$moving beyond streamlined shaping to leveraging subsurface phonon engineering for the reduction of drag and enhancement of overall performance.</description>
