      <title>Transformer neural networks and quantum simulators: a hybrid approach for simulating strongly correlated systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.00091</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.00091v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Owing to their great expressivity and versatility, neural networks have gained attention for simulating large two-dimensional quantum many-body systems. However, their expressivity comes with the cost of a challenging optimization due to the in general rugged and complicated loss landscape. Here, we present a hybrid optimization scheme for neural quantum states (NQS) that involves a data-driven pretraining with numerical or experimental data and a second, Hamiltonian-driven optimization stage. By using both projective measurements from the computational basis as well as expectation values from other measurement configurations such as spin-spin correlations, our pretraining gives access to the sign structure of the state, yielding improved and faster convergence that is robust w.r.t. experimental imperfections and limited datasets. We apply the hybrid scheme to the ground state search for the 2D transverse field Ising model and the 2D dipolar XY model on $6\times 6$ and $10\times 10$ square lattices with a patched transformer wave function, using numerical and experimental data from a programmable Rydberg quantum simulator [Chen et al., Nature 616 (2023)], with snapshots of the quantum system obtained from the different measurement configurations, and show that the information from the second basis highly improves the performance. Our work paves the way for a reliable and efficient optimization of neural quantum states.</description>

      <title>Towards a theory of how the structure of language is acquired by deep neural networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.00048</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.00048v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: How much data is required to learn the structure of a language via next-token prediction? We study this question for synthetic datasets generated via a Probabilistic Context-Free Grammar (PCFG) -- a hierarchical generative model that captures the tree-like structure of natural languages. We determine token-token correlations analytically in our model and show that they can be used to build a representation of the grammar's hidden variables, the longer the range the deeper the variable. In addition, a finite training set limits the resolution of correlations to an effective range, whose size grows with that of the training set. As a result, a Language Model trained with increasingly many examples can build a deeper representation of the grammar's structure, thus reaching good performance despite the high dimensionality of the problem. We conjecture that the relationship between training set size and effective range of correlations holds beyond our synthetic datasets. In particular, our conjecture predicts how the scaling law for the test loss behaviour with training set size depends on the length of the context window, which we confirm empirically for a collection of lines from Shakespeare's plays.</description>

      <title>Quantum Equilibrium Propagation: Gradient-Descent Training of Quantum Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.00879</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.00879v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Equilibrium propagation (EP) is a training framework for energy-based systems, i.e. systems whose physics minimizes an energy function. EP has been explored in various classical physical systems such as resistor networks, elastic networks, the classical Ising model and coupled phase oscillators. A key advantage of EP is that it achieves gradient descent on a cost function using the physics of the system to extract the weight gradients, making it a candidate for the development of energy-efficient processors for machine learning. We extend EP to quantum systems, where the energy function that is minimized is the mean energy functional (expectation value of the Hamiltonian), whose minimum is the ground state of the Hamiltonian. As examples, we study the settings of the transverse-field Ising model and the quantum harmonic oscillator network -- quantum analogues of the Ising model and elastic network.</description>

      <title>Automatic Input Feature Relevance via Spectral Neural Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.01183</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.01183v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Working with high-dimensional data is a common practice, in the field of machine learning. Identifying relevant input features is thus crucial, so as to obtain compact dataset more prone for effective numerical handling. Further, by isolating pivotal elements that form the basis of decision making, one can contribute to elaborate on - ex post - models' interpretability, so far rather elusive. Here, we propose a novel method to estimate the relative importance of the input components for a Deep Neural Network. This is achieved by leveraging on a spectral re-parametrization of the optimization process. Eigenvalues associated to input nodes provide in fact a robust proxy to gauge the relevance of the supplied entry features. Unlike existing techniques, the spectral features ranking is carried out automatically, as a byproduct of the network training. The technique is successfully challenged against both synthetic and real data.</description>

      <title>Efficient Computation Using Spatial-Photonic Ising Machines: Utilizing Low-Rank and Circulant Matrix Constraints</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.01400</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.01400v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We explore the potential of spatial-photonic Ising machines (SPIMs) to address computationally intensive Ising problems that employ low-rank and circulant coupling matrices. Our results indicate that the performance of SPIMs is critically affected by the rank and precision of the coupling matrices. By developing and assessing advanced decomposition techniques, we expand the range of problems SPIMs can solve, overcoming the limitations of traditional Mattis-type matrices. Our approach accommodates a diverse array of coupling matrices, including those with inherently low ranks, applicable to complex NP-complete problems. We explore the practical benefits of low-rank approximation in optimization tasks, particularly in financial optimization, to demonstrate the real-world applications of SPIMs. Finally, we evaluate the computational limitations imposed by SPIM hardware precision and suggest strategies to optimize the performance of these systems within these constraints.</description>

      <title>Enhanced quantum metric due to vacancies in graphene</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.01408</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.01408v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Random vacancies in a graphene monolayer induce defect states that are known to form a narrow impurity band centered around zero energy at half-filling. We use a space-resolved formulation of the quantum metric and establish a strong enhancement of the electronic correlations in this impurity band. The enhancement is primarily due to strong correlations between pairs of vacancies situated on different sublattices at anomalously large spatial distances. We trace the strong enhancement to both the multifractal vacancy wave functions, which ties the system exactly at the Anderson insulator transition for all defect concentrations, and preserving the chiral symmetry.</description>

      <title>Tessellated phase diagram and extended criticality in driven quasicrystals and quantum Hall matter</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.01445v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The well-known mapping between 1D quasiperiodic systems and 2D integer quantum Hall matter can also be applied in the presence of driving. Here we explore the effect of time-varying electric fields on the transport properties and phase diagram of Harper-Hofstadter materials. We consider light of arbitrary polarization illuminating a 2D electron gas at high magnetic field; this system maps to a 1D quasicrystal subjected to simultaneous phasonic and dipolar driving. We show that this generalized driving generates a tessellated phase diagram featuring a nested duality-protected pattern of metal-insulator transitions. Circularly or elliptically polarized light can create an extended critical phase, opening up a new route to achieving wavefunction multifractality without fine-tuning to a critical point, as well as induce Floquet topological insulators. We describe in detail a path to experimental realization of these phenomena using lattice-trapped ultracold atoms.</description>

      <title>Tilting the Odds at the Lottery: the Interplay of Overparameterisation and Curricula in Neural Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.01589</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.01589v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A wide range of empirical and theoretical works have shown that overparameterisation can amplify the performance of neural networks. According to the lottery ticket hypothesis, overparameterised networks have an increased chance of containing a sub-network that is well-initialised to solve the task at hand. A more parsimonious approach, inspired by animal learning, consists in guiding the learner towards solving the task by curating the order of the examples, i.e. providing a curriculum. However, this learning strategy seems to be hardly beneficial in deep learning applications. In this work, we undertake an analytical study that connects curriculum learning and overparameterisation. In particular, we investigate their interplay in the online learning setting for a 2-layer network in the XOR-like Gaussian Mixture problem. Our results show that a high degree of overparameterisation -- while simplifying the problem -- can limit the benefit from curricula, providing a theoretical account of the ineffectiveness of curricula in deep learning.</description>

Abstract: In this theoretical study, we explore F\"orster resonant energy transfer of a single exciton within a two-dimensional array of self-assembled quantum dots arranged randomly on a circular mesa. Employing the stochastic simulation method, we solve the equation of motion for the density matrix, considering a specified decay rate. Our analysis quantifies diffusion through the mean-square displacement from the initially excited quantum dot, revealing distinct temporal stages: ballistic, normal diffusion, and saturation. Furthermore, we observe power-law localization of the exciton. Complementing our numerical investigations, we develop approximate analytical expressions that closely align with the numerical findings.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2309.03127v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The quest to identify and observe Majorana fermions in physics and condensed-matter systems remains an important challenge. Here, we introduce a qubit (spin-$1/2$) from the occurrence of two delocalized zero-energy Majorana fermions in a model of two spins-$1/2$ on the Bloch sphere within the fractional one-half topological state. We address specific protocols in time with circularly polarized light and the protection of this delocalized spin-$1/2$ state related to quantum information protocols. We also show how disorder can play a positive and important role allowing singlet-triplet transitions and resulting in an additional elongated region for the fractional phase, demonstrating the potential of this platform related to applications in topologically protected quantum information. We generalize our approach with an array and Majorana fermions at the edges in a ring geometry.</description>

      <title>Scalable molecular simulation of electrolyte solutions with quantum chemical accuracy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.12535</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.12535v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Unleashing the predictive power of molecular dynamics (MD), Neural Network Potentials (NNPs) trained on Density Functional Theory (DFT) calculations are revolutionizing our ability to simulate chemical systems with unprecedented accuracy and efficiency. Electrolyte solutions are a natural initial system to apply this tool to because they are critically important for a wide range of applications and their properties cannot currently be predicted. Unfortunately, however most DFT approximations are not sufficiently accurate to predict many practically relevant properties of electrolytes. Additionally, tracking the position of every atom in a system during molecular simulations is inherently limited, even with NNP-MD. Here, we use a state-of-the-art DFT approximation to demonstrate highly accurate all-atom NNPs with minimal training data. We demonstrate that NNPs can reliably be recursively trained on a subset of their own output to enable coarse-grained continuum solvent molecular simulations that can access much longer timescales. We apply our technique to simulate lithium chloride, potassium chloride, and lithium bromide in water. We reproduce key structural, thermodynamic, and kinetic properties of these solutions in agreement with experimental data. The formation of a previously unknown Li cation dimer is observed, along with identical anion-anion interactions of chloride and bromide. Finally, the coarse-grained model is capable of reproducing crystal phase behavior and infinite dilution pairing free energies despite being trained solely on moderate concentration solutions, disproving the notion that NNPs are only useful for interpolation. This approach should be scalable to determine the properties of electrolyte solutions over a much wider range of conditions and compositions than is possible experimentally.</description>

      <title>Spiking mode-based neural networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.14621</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.14621v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Spiking neural networks play an important role in brain-like neuromorphic computations and in studying working mechanisms of neural circuits. One drawback of training a large scale spiking neural network is that updating all weights is quite expensive. Furthermore, after training, all information related to the computational task is hidden into the weight matrix, prohibiting us from a transparent understanding of circuit mechanisms. Therefore, in this work, we address these challenges by proposing a spiking mode-based training protocol, where the recurrent weight matrix is explained as a Hopfield-like multiplication of three matrices: input, output modes and a score matrix. The first advantage is that the weight is interpreted by input and output modes and their associated scores characterizing the importance of each decomposition term. The number of modes is thus adjustable, allowing more degrees of freedom for modeling the experimental data. This significantly reduces the training cost because of significantly reduced space complexity for learning. Training spiking networks is thus carried out in the mode-score space. The second advantage is that one can project the high dimensional neural activity (filtered spike train) in the state space onto the mode space which is typically of a low dimension, e.g., a few modes are sufficient to capture the shape of the underlying neural manifolds. We successfully apply our framework in two computational tasks -- digit classification and selective sensory integration tasks. Our method accelerate the training of spiking neural networks by a Hopfield-like decomposition, and moreover this training leads to low-dimensional attractor structures of high-dimensional neural dynamics.</description>

      <title>Universal hard-edge statistics of non-Hermitian random matrices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.05044</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.05044v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Random matrix theory is a powerful tool for understanding spectral correlations inherent in quantum chaotic systems. Despite diverse applications of non-Hermitian random matrix theory, the role of symmetry remains to be fully established. Here, we comprehensively investigate the impact of symmetry on the level statistics around the spectral origin -- hard-edge statistics -- and expand the classification of spectral statistics to encompass all the 38 symmetry classes of non-Hermitian random matrices. Within this classification, we discern 28 symmetry classes characterized by distinct hard-edge statistics from the level statistics in the bulk of spectra, which are further categorized into two groups, namely the Altland-Zirnbauer$_0$ classification and beyond. We introduce and elucidate quantitative measures capturing the universal hard-edge statistics for all the symmetry classes. Furthermore, through extensive numerical calculations, we study various open quantum systems in different symmetry classes, including quadratic and many-body Lindbladians, as well as non-Hermitian Hamiltonians. We show that these systems manifest the same hard-edge statistics as random matrices and that their ensemble-average spectral distributions around the origin exhibit emergent symmetry conforming to the random-matrix behavior. Our results establish a comprehensive understanding of non-Hermitian random matrix theory and are useful in detecting quantum chaos or its absence in open quantum systems.</description>

      <title>Measurement-only dynamical phase transition of topological and boundary order in toric code and gauge-Higgs models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.13435</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.13435v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We extensively study long-time dynamics and fate of topologically-ordered state in toric code model evolving through projective measurement-only circuit. The circuit is composed of several measurement operators corresponding to each term of toric code Hamiltonian with magnetic-field perturbations, which is a gauge-fixed version of a (2+1)-dimensional gauge-Higgs model. We employ a cylinder geometry with distinct upper and lower boundaries to classify stationary states after long-time measurement dynamics. The appearing stationary states depend on measurement probabilities for each measurement operator. The Higgs, confined and deconfined phases emerge in the time evolution by the circuit. We find that both Higgs and confined phases are separated from the deconfined phase by topological entanglement entropy. We numerically clarify that both Higgs and confined phases are characterized by a long-range order on the boundaries accompanying edge modes, and they shift with each other by a crossover reflecting properties in the bulk phase diagram.</description>
