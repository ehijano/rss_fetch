      <title>Spectral Theory for Borel PMP Graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.05185</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.05185v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We initiate a systematic study of spectral theory for bounded-degree Borel pmp graphs. Specifically, we study spectral properties of the associated adjacency and Laplacian operators. We start with proving a spectral characterization of approximate measurable bipartiteness. Next, we adapt classical theorems of Wilf and Hoffman to give novel upper and lower bounds on the approximate measurable chromatic number. Using similar techniques, we then show that the approximate measurable chromatic number of a pmp graph generated by $n$ bounded-to-one functions is at most $2n + 1$. Next, concerning matchings, we introduce a measurable version of Tutte's condition and show that a spectral assumption analogous to the one from a classical theorem of Brouwer and Haemers implies this measurable Tutte condition. Finally, we show that the spectrum is continuous under local-global convergence.</description>

      <title>The uncountability of the reals and the Axiom of Choice</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.05558</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.05558v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The uncountability of the reals was first established by Cantor in what was later heralded as the first paper on set theory. Since the latter constitutes the official foundations of mathematics, the logical study of the uncountability of the reals is a worthy endeavour for historical, foundational, and conceptual reasons. In this paper, we shall study the following principle:
  $\textsf{NIN}_{[0,1]}$: there is no injection from the unit interval to the natural numbers.
  We show that relatively strong logical systems cannot prove $\textsf{NIN}_{[0,1]}$. In particular, the former system implies second-order arithmetic and fragments of the Axiom of Choice, including dependent choice. We also study the latter choice fragments in Kohlenbach's higher-order Reverse Mathematics.</description>

      <title>On the computational properties of ambivalent sets and functions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.05620</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.05620v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Examples of discontinuous functions already appear in the work of Euler, Abel, Dirichlet, Fourier, and Bolzano. A ground-breaking discovery due to Baire was that many discontinuous functions are well-behaved in that they are the pointwise limit of a sequence of continuous functions; the latter form a class nowadays simply called `Baire 1'. We shall study a class strictly between the semi-continuous and Baire 1 functions, called the ambivalent fuctions. In particular, we investigate the computational properties of the class of ambivalent functions and sets, denoted $\bf \Delta$, working with Kleene's S1-S9 schemes. Computational equivalences for various standard operations (supremum, Baire 1 representation, \dots) on $\bf \Delta$ are established, including the structure functional $\Omega_{\bf \Delta}$ that decides if a given ambivalent set is non-empty. A selector is shown to be computable relative to $\Omega_{\bf \Delta}$ and Kleene's quantifier $\exists^{2}$.</description>

      <title>Remarks on relative categoricity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.05866</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.05866v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We make some elementary observations about relative categoricity and the Gaifman property. T will be a complete theory in a countable language L with a distinguished unary predicate P. We will assume L is relational and T has quantifier elimination. For M a model of of T, M^P is the substructure of M with universe P(M), and T^P is the common L-theory of these M^P. T is said to be relatively categorical if for any models M_1, M_2 of T any isomorphism between M_1^P and M_2^P lifts to an isomorphism between M_1 and M_2. T has the Gaifman property (or P-existence) if every model of T^P is of the form M^P for a model M of T. It was conjectured that if T is relatively categorical then T has the Gaifman property. T is said to be relatively (omega, omega) categorical if relative categoricity holds when restricted to countable models of T. We observe that (i) if T is relatively (omega, omega) categorical then any model of T^P of cardinality at most aleph_1 is of the form M^P for M a model of T, and (ii) if in addition every model M of T is in the algebraic closure of P(M) together with a (finite) subset of M, then T is relatively categorical and has the Gaifman property.</description>

      <title>An arithmetic algebraic regularity lemma</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.11206</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.11206v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We give an 'arithmetic regularity lemma' for groups definable in finite fields, analogous to Tao's 'algebraic regularity lemma' for graphs definable in finite fields. More specifically, we show that, for any $M&gt;0$, any finite field $\mathbf{F}$, and any definable group $(G,\cdot)$ in $\mathbf{F}$ and definable subset $D\subseteq G$, each of complexity at most $M$, there is a normal definable subgroup $H\leqslant G$, of index and complexity $O_M(1)$, such that the following holds: for any cosets $V,W$ of $H$, the bipartite graph $(V,W,xy^{-1}\in D)$ is $O_M(|\mathbf{F}|^{-1/2})$-quasirandom. Various analogous regularity conditions follow; for example, for any $g\in G$, the Fourier coefficient $||\widehat{1}_{H\cap Dg}(\pi)||_{\mathrm{op}}$ is $O_M(|\mathbf{F}|^{-1/8})$ for every non-trivial irreducible representation $\pi$ of $H$.</description>

      <title>Representability for distributive quasi relation algebras via nested sums</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.06657</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.06657v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We extend the work of Galatos (2004) on nested sums, originally called generalised ordinal sums, of residuated lattices. We show that the nested sum of an odd quasi relation algebra (qRA) satisfying certain conditions and an arbitrary qRA is again a qRA. In a recent paper by Craig and Robinson (2025) the notion of representability for distributive quasi relation algebras (DqRAs) was developed. For certain pairs of representable DqRAs, we prove that their nested sum is again representable. An important consequence of this result is that finite Sugihara chains are finitely representable.</description>

      <title>On the Rudin-Blass Ordering of Measures</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.14678v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the Rudin-Blass (and the Rudin-Keisler) ordering on the finite additive measures on $\omega$. We propose a generalization of the notion of Q-point and selective ultrafilter to measures: Q-measures and selective measures. We show some symmetries between Q-points and Q-measures but also we show where those symmetries break up. In particular we present an example of a measure which is minimal in the sense of Rudin-Blass but which is not a Q-measure.</description>

      <title>Proof-Theoretic Relations between Higman's and Kruskal's theorem, and Independence Results for Tree-like Structures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.11297</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.11297v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Higman's lemma and Kruskal's theorem are two of the most celebrated results in the theory of well quasi-orders. In his seminal paper G. Higman obtained what is known as Higman's lemma as a corollary of a more general theorem, dubbed here Higman's theorem. While the lemma deals with finite sequences over a well quasi-order, the theorem is about abstract operations of arbitrary high arity.
  J.B. Kruskal was fully aware of this broader framework: in his seminal paper, he not only applied Higman's lemma at crucial points of his proof but also followed Higman's proof schema. At the conclusion of the paper, Kruskal noted that Higman's theorem is a special case, restricted to trees of finite degree, of his own tree theorem. Although he provided no formal reduction, he included a glossary translating concepts between the tree and algebraic settings. The equivalence between these versions was later clarified by D. Schmidt and M. Pouzet. In this work, we revisit that equivalence to illuminate the proof-theoretical relationships between the two theorems within the base system $RCA_0$, of reverse mathematics.
  Moreover, some independence results over first- and second-orders are treated. In particular, tree-like structures, involving either Ackermannian terms or exponential expressions, are studied unveiling well-foundedness properties that are independent from Peano arithmetic and relevant fragments of second-order arithmetic.</description>

      <title>Morita Rigidity for Kleene Algebras</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.24993</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.24993v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We introduce Morita equivalence to the study of Kleene algebras and modules. Classical characterizations of Morita-equivalent semirings such as having equivalent categories of modules and one semiring being a full matrix algebra over the other carry over. We also observe that Morita equivalence can be applied to extending and restricting scalars in Lindenbaum Tarski algebras of propositional dynamic logics. But the signature result which we obtain is a form of rigidity for Kleene algebras, which states that if the semiring reducts of two Kleene algebras are Morita-equivalent, then the Morita equivalence is in fact witnessed by Kleene bimodules.</description>

      <title>Cut-free Deductive System for Continuous Intuitionistic Logic</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.26849</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.26849v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We introduce and develop propositional continuous intuitionistic logic and propositional continuous affine logic via complete algebraic semantics. Our approach centres on AC-algebras, which are algebras $USC(\mathcal{L})$ of sup-preserving functions from $[0,1]$ to an integral commutative residuated complete lattice $\mathcal{L}$ (in the intuitionistic case, $\mathcal{L}$ is a locale). We give an algebraic axiomatisation of AC-algebras in the language of continuous logic and prove, using the Macneille completion, that every Archimedean model embeds into some AC-algebra. We also show that (i) $USC(\mathcal{L})$ satisfies $v \dot + v = 2v$ exactly when $\mathcal{L}$ is a locale, (ii) involutiveness of negation in $USC(\mathcal{L})$ corresponds to that in $\mathcal{L} $, and that (iii) adding those conditions recovers classical continuous logic. For each variant -affine, intuitionistic, involutive, classical -we provide a sequent style deductive system and prove completeness and cut admissibility. This yields the first sequent style formulation of classical continuous logic enjoying cut admissibility.</description>
