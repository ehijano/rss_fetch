      <title>ReCorD: Reasoning and Correcting Diffusion for HOI Generation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.17911</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.17911v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Diffusion models revolutionize image generation by leveraging natural language to guide the creation of multimedia content. Despite significant advancements in such generative models, challenges persist in depicting detailed human-object interactions, especially regarding pose and object placement accuracy. We introduce a training-free method named Reasoning and Correcting Diffusion (ReCorD) to address these challenges. Our model couples Latent Diffusion Models with Visual Language Models to refine the generation process, ensuring precise depictions of HOIs. We propose an interaction-aware reasoning module to improve the interpretation of the interaction, along with an interaction correcting module to refine the output image for more precise HOI generation delicately. Through a meticulous process of pose selection and object positioning, ReCorD achieves superior fidelity in generated images while efficiently reducing computational requirements. We conduct comprehensive experiments on three benchmarks to demonstrate the significant progress in solving text-to-image generation tasks, showcasing ReCorD's ability to render complex interactions accurately by outperforming existing methods in HOI classification score, as well as FID and Verb CLIP-Score.

      <title>AMEX: Android Multi-annotation Expo Dataset for Mobile GUI Agents</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.17490</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.17490v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: AI agents have drawn increasing attention mostly on their ability to perceive environments, understand tasks, and autonomously achieve goals. To advance research on AI agents in mobile scenarios, we introduce the Android Multi-annotation EXpo (AMEX), a comprehensive, large-scale dataset designed for generalist mobile GUI-control agents. Their capabilities of completing complex tasks by directly interacting with the graphical user interface (GUI) on mobile devices are trained and evaluated with the proposed dataset. AMEX comprises over 104K high-resolution screenshots from 110 popular mobile applications, which are annotated at multiple levels. Unlike existing mobile device-control datasets, e.g., MoTIF, AitW, etc., AMEX includes three levels of annotations: GUI interactive element grounding, GUI screen and element functionality descriptions, and complex natural language instructions, each averaging 13 steps with stepwise GUI-action chains. We develop this dataset from a more instructive and detailed perspective, complementing the general settings of existing datasets. Additionally, we develop a baseline model SPHINX Agent and compare its performance across state-of-the-art agents trained on other datasets. To facilitate further research, we open-source our dataset, models, and relevant evaluation tools. The project is available at https://yuxiangchai.github.io/AMEX/</description>

      <title>Improved symbolic drum style classification with grammar-based hierarchical representations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.17536</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.17536v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Deep learning models have become a critical tool for analysis and classification of musical data. These models operate either on the audio signal, e.g. waveform or spectrogram, or on a symbolic representation, such as MIDI. In the latter, musical information is often reduced to basic features, i.e. durations, pitches and velocities. Most existing works then rely on generic tokenization strategies from classical natural language processing, or matrix representations, e.g. piano roll. In this work, we evaluate how enriched representations of symbolic data can impact deep models, i.e. Transformers and RNN, for music style classification. In particular, we examine representations that explicitly incorporate musical information implicitly present in MIDI-like encodings, such as rhythmic organization, and show that they outperform generic tokenization strategies. We introduce a new tree-based representation of MIDI data built upon a context-free musical grammar. We show that this grammar representation accurately encodes high-level rhythmic information and outperforms existing encodings on the GrooveMIDI Dataset for drumming style classification, while being more compact and parameter-efficient.</description>

      <title>Shapley Value-based Contrastive Alignment for Multimodal Information Extraction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.17854</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.17854v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The rise of social media and the exponential growth of multimodal communication necessitates advanced techniques for Multimodal Information Extraction (MIE). However, existing methodologies primarily rely on direct Image-Text interactions, a paradigm that often faces significant challenges due to semantic and modality gaps between images and text. In this paper, we introduce a new paradigm of Image-Context-Text interaction, where large multimodal models (LMMs) are utilized to generate descriptive textual context to bridge these gaps. In line with this paradigm, we propose a novel Shapley Value-based Contrastive Alignment (Shap-CA) method, which aligns both context-text and context-image pairs. Shap-CA initially applies the Shapley value concept from cooperative game theory to assess the individual contribution of each element in the set of contexts, texts and images towards total semantic and modality overlaps. Following this quantitative evaluation, a contrastive learning strategy is employed to enhance the interactive contribution within context-text/image pairs, while minimizing the influence across these pairs. Furthermore, we design an adaptive fusion module for selective cross-modal fusion. Extensive experiments across four MIE datasets demonstrate that our method significantly outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods.</description>

      <title>Continual Panoptic Perception: Towards Multi-modal Incremental Interpretation of Remote Sensing Images</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.14242</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.14242v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Continual learning (CL) breaks off the one-way training manner and enables a model to adapt to new data, semantics and tasks continuously. However, current CL methods mainly focus on single tasks. Besides, CL models are plagued by catastrophic forgetting and semantic drift since the lack of old data, which often occurs in remote-sensing interpretation due to the intricate fine-grained semantics. In this paper, we propose Continual Panoptic Perception (CPP), a unified continual learning model that leverages multi-task joint learning covering pixel-level classification, instance-level segmentation and image-level perception for universal interpretation in remote sensing images. Concretely, we propose a collaborative cross-modal encoder (CCE) to extract the input image features, which supports pixel classification and caption generation synchronously. To inherit the knowledge from the old model without exemplar memory, we propose a task-interactive knowledge distillation (TKD) method, which leverages cross-modal optimization and task-asymmetric pseudo-labeling (TPL) to alleviate catastrophic forgetting. Furthermore, we also propose a joint optimization mechanism to achieve end-to-end multi-modal panoptic perception. Experimental results on the fine-grained panoptic perception dataset validate the effectiveness of the proposed model, and also prove that joint optimization can boost sub-task CL efficiency with over 13\% relative improvement on panoptic quality.</description>

      <title>Enhancing Environmental Monitoring through Multispectral Imaging: The WasteMS Dataset for Semantic Segmentation of Lakeside Waste</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.17028</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.17028v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Environmental monitoring of lakeside green areas is crucial for environmental protection. Compared to manual inspections, computer vision technologies offer a more efficient solution when deployed on-site. Multispectral imaging provides diverse information about objects under different spectrums, aiding in the differentiation between waste and lakeside lawn environments. This study introduces WasteMS, the first multispectral dataset established for the semantic segmentation of lakeside waste. WasteMS includes a diverse range of waste types in lawn environments, captured under various lighting conditions. We implemented a rigorous annotation process to label waste in images. Representative semantic segmentation frameworks were used to evaluate segmentation accuracy using WasteMS. Challenges encountered when using WasteMS for segmenting waste on lakeside lawns were discussed. The WasteMS dataset is available at https://github.com/zhuqinfeng1999/WasteMS.</description>
