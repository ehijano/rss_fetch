      <title>Unveiling the atmosphere of the super-Jupiter HAT-P-14 b with JWST NIRISS and NIRSpec</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.08903</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.08903v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We report the combined JWST NIRSpec/G395H and NIRISS/SOSS transmission spectrum of the transiting super-Jupiter HAT-P-14 b, from 0.60 $\mu m$ to 5.14 $\mu m$. Initial analysis of these data reported a near-featureless spectrum at NIRSpec wavelengths range (2.87 $\mu m$ to 5.14 $\mu m$) consistent with the small atmospheric scale height of the planet and unexplained bumps and wiggles at NIRISS wavelengths range (0.6 $\mu m$ to 2.8 $\mu m$). Here, we produce a self-consistent spectrum of HAT-P-14 b's atmosphere with an up-to-date reduction. We detect H$_2$O (3.09 $\sigma$) both across NIRISS/SOSS wavelengths range and at the bluest end of NIRSpc/G395H as well as a gray cloud deck (1.90 $\sigma$). We constrain the atmospheric metallicity of HAT-P-14 b to be roughly Solar, with [Fe/H] $= -0.08^{+0.89}_{-0.98}$, consistent with the planet mass-metallicity relationship. The differences compared to previous works are likely due to the improved STScI jwst pipeline, which highlights the need to reanalyze the early NIRISS/SOSS transiting exoplanet targets with the latest methods. As HAT-P-14 b is placed as the 805th best target for transmission spectroscopy according to Transmission Spectroscopy Metrics (TSM), our results showcase JWST's unparalleled photometric precision which can easily characterize a thousand exoplanets' atmospheres through transmission spectroscopy.</description>

      <title>Precise radial velocities of giant stars -- XVII. Distinguishing planets from intrinsically induced radial velocity signals in evolved stars</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.09087</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.09087v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: From a long-term Doppler monitoring campaign of 373 giant stars, we have identified ten giants with periodic radial velocity variations that are challenging to associate with planets. Similar cases in the literature are attributed to poorly understood intrinsic processes. Our goal is to confirm or refute the presence of planets around these ten evolved stars. Additionally, we evaluate the reliability and sensitivity of planet-confirmation metrics when applied to giant stars and present cases of intrinsically induced radial velocity variations, aiming to enhance the physical understanding of the phenomenon. We combined 25 years of radial velocity data from the Hamilton/Lick, SONG, and CARMENES spectrographs. To assess consistency with Keplerian models, we examined the residuals and tracked changes in statistical significance as new data were incorporated. Additionally, we compared radial velocity amplitudes across optical and infrared wavelengths, searched for periodic variations of activity indicators, and examined their correlations with radial velocities. Seven of the ten giants exhibit intrinsically induced radial velocity variations. The strongest arguments against planets orbiting the giants are guided by long-term radial velocity monitoring that detects changing periodicity on long timescales or detects systematics close to the original period in the radial velocity residuals. While activity indicators offer some support, their signals are generally weak. Comparing optical and infrared radial velocity amplitudes also proves insufficient for confirming or refuting planets. We find HIP 64823 remains a promising candidate for hosting a giant exoplanet with orbital period $P\sim$ 7.75 yr. For two stars, the evidence remains inconclusive. Long-term radial velocity monitoring is essential for distinguishing planetary companions from intrinsic variations in evolved stars.</description>

      <title>Thermally driven spontaneous dust accumulation in the inner regions of protoplanetary disks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.09166</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.09166v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In protoplanetary disks, the formation of planetesimals via streaming and/or gravitational instabilities requires regions with a locally enhanced dust-to-gas mass ratio. Conventionally, gas pressure maxima sustained by gas surface density maxima have been considered as the primary cause of such dust accumulation. However, the disk's pressure structure depends not only on gas density but also on the temperature structure, which itself is influenced by the distribution of dust. In this study, we propose a novel mechanism for dust accumulation, which is driven by the coevolution of dust and disk temperature. In the inner disk region where the midplane temperature is primarily determined by the balance between viscous heating and radiative cooling, a perturbation in dust surface density distribution may affect radiative cooling efficiency, potentially producing a local maximum in the temperature and pressure profiles. To test this hypothesis, we perform coupled calculations of dust and disk temperature evolution, incorporating the advection, diffusion, coagulation, and fragmentation of dust particles along with viscous heating, radiative cooling, and radial thermal diffusion. Our results demonstrate that a pressure maximum formed by a perturbation in the dust surface density can spontaneously induce dust accumulation, even in the absence of a gas surface density maximum, under conditions where dust drift is significantly faster than diffusion and the thermal evolution occurs faster than the inward migration of dust. This mechanism requires viscous heating to dominate disk heating, and typically occurs interior to the snow line. In this spontaneous dust trap, the dust-to-gas density ratio at the midplane can exceed unity, suggesting the potential for rocky planetesimal formation via streaming and gravitational instabilities.</description>

      <title>Numerical simulations of the interaction between the stellar magnetic field and a planet</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.09390</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.09390v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Kepler and TESS observations led to the discovery of many close-in super Earths, including some with ultra-short orbital periods ($\lesssim 1$ day). During and shortly after their multi-Myr formation epoch, their GKM host stars generally have kilogauss magnetic fields which can exert torques on the orbits of nearby super- Earths. In this work, we examine one aspect of this interaction: the magnetic torque resulting from Alfv\'en-wing drag on non-corotating, non-magnetized planets engulfed by the host stars' stellar wind. We compute the magnitude of this torque for a range of stellar magnetic field strengths, and planetary orbital velocities. We also model the planets' orbital evolution, taking into account for stellar spin down and magnetic field decay, and derive the boundaries within which ultra-short-period super-Earths can survive.</description>

      <title>Deciphering Sub-Neptune Atmospheres: New Insights from Geochemical Models of TOI-270 d</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.09752</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.09752v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The nature of sub-Neptunes is one of the hottest topics in exoplanetary science. Temperate sub-Neptunes are of special interest because some could be habitable. Here, we consider whether these planets might instead be rocky worlds with thick, hot atmospheres. Can recent JWST observations of TOI-270 d be understood in terms of such a model? We perform thermochemical equilibrium calculations to infer conditions of quenching of C-H-O-N species. Our results indicate apparent CO$_2$-CH$_4$ equilibrium between ~900 and ~1100 K. The CO abundance should be quenched higher in the atmosphere where the equilibrium CO/CO$_2$ ratio is lower, potentially explaining a lack of CO. N$_2$ is predicted to dominate the nitrogen budget. We confirm that the atmosphere of TOI-270 d is strongly enriched in both C and O$_g$$_a$$_s$ relative to protosolar H, whereas N is likely to be less enriched or even depleted. We attempt to reproduce these enrichments by modeling the atmosphere as nebular gas that extracted heavy elements from accreted solids. This type of model can explain the C/H and O$_g$$_a$$_s$/H ratios, but despite supersolar C/N ratios provided by solids, the NH$_3$ abundance will probably be too high unless there is a nitrogen sink in addition to N$_2$. A magma ocean may be implied, and indeed the oxygen fugacity of the deep atmosphere seems sufficiently low to support the sequestration of reduced N in silicate melt. The evaluation presented here demonstrates that exoplanetary geochemistry now approaches a level of sophistication comparable to that achieved within our own solar system.</description>

      <title>The Tropical Atmosphere of Jupiter - Shallow Weather, Deep Plumes, and Vortices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.09943</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.09943v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Towering storms, swirling clouds, and vortices are the cloud tops manifestation of complex weather systems shaping the atmosphere of Jupiter. We use observations from Juno's MicroWave Radiometer (MWR), the Very Large Array (VLA) and the Hubble Space Telescope (HST) to probe for the first time the depth and impact of weather on Jupiter. We use ammonia, the main source of opacity at radio wavelengths on Jupiter, as the tracer for the weather by fitting ammonia anomalies to the MWR brightness temperature variations. We show that the majority of the weather on Jupiter is confined to regions where the clouds are forming. Both the South Equatorial Belt and the Equatorial Zone have surprisingly shallow weather systems (P &lt; 2 bar), and even in the North Equatorial Belt most of the ammonia variations is above the water condensation level (P ~ 6 bar). This confirms that the water condensation layer plays a crucial role in controlling the dynamics and the weather on Jupiter. However, the shallow nature of the weather cannot explain the deep-seated depletion down to 30 bar that the Juno mission has revealed. We do find three features, however, that extend below the water condensation layer: a vortex in the northern hemisphere reaching down to 30 bar, an ammonia plume down to 20-30 bars, and the signature of precipitation down to 20 bar. This work highlights the interplay of large-scale processes (vortices, plumes) and small-scale processes (storms) are responsible for shaping the atmospheric makeup of Jupiter.</description>

      <title>Polarimetry of exoplanet-exomoon systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.10126</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.10126v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigated the potential of polarimetric observations in the optical wavelength range for the detection of exomoons and the characterization of exoplanet-exomoon systems. Using the three-dimensional Monte Carlo radiative transfer code POLARIS, we calculated flux and polarization phase curves of Earth-like exoplanets with a satellite similar to Earth's moon. Of particular interest are mutual events, when one of the two bodies casts a shadow on the other or transits in front of it. We find that the signatures of mutual events in the polarization phase curve show significant variations depending on the inclination of the lunar orbit. If the planet-satellite pair is spatially resolved from the star but the satellite is spatially unresolved, the increase in the degree of polarization during a transit of the exomoon in front of the center of the exoplanet reaches $2.7\%$ in our model system near quadrature. However, the change is less than $0.5\%$ if the orbit of the exomoon is inclined such that it transits the planet noncentrally at the same phase angles. The influence of an exomoon on the polarization phase curve of an exoplanet-exomoon system is dependent on the lunar polarization phase curve. Observations of full eclipses and occultations of the exomoon allow the determination of separate polarization phase curves for the two bodies. Information about the lunar orbital inclination can be obtained with polarimetric observations of shadows or transits. Measuring the influence of large satellites not only on the total flux, but also on the polarization of the reflected stellar radiation during mutual events thus facilitates the prediction of future mutual events and the verification of exomoon candidates.</description>

      <title>Modeling the Thermal Structure of a Protoplanetary Disk Using Multiband Flux-Limited Diffusion Approximation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.10220</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.10220v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This work continues the analysis of the model for calculating the thermal structure of an axisymmetric protoplanetary disk, initiated in the paper by Pavlyuchenkov (2024). The model is based on the well-known Flux-Limited Diffusion (FLD) approximation with separate calculation of heating by direct stellar radiation (hereinafter referred to as the FLD$^{\rm s}$ method). In addition to the previously described FLD$^{\rm s}$ model with wavelength-averaged opacities, we present a multiband model mFLD$^{\rm s}$, where the spectrum of thermal radiation is divided into several frequency bands. The model is based on an implicit finite-difference scheme for the equations of thermal radiation diffusion, which reduces to a system of linear algebraic equations written in hypermatrix form. A modified Gauss method for inverting the sparse hypermatrix of the original system of linear equations is proposed. The simulation results described in the article show that the midplane radial temperature profile obtained with the mFLD$^{\rm s}$ method has a variable slope in accordance with the reference Monte Carlo radiative transfer simulations. The mFLD$^{\rm s}$ model also qualitatively reproduces the non-isothermality of the temperature distribution along the angular coordinate near the midplane, which is not provided by the FLD$^{\rm s}$ method. However, quantitative differences remain between the reference temperature values and the results of mFLD$^{\rm s}$. These differences are likely due to the diffusive nature of the FLD approximation. It is also shown that the characteristic times for the disk to reach thermal equilibrium within the mFLD$^{\rm s}$ model can be significantly shorter than in FLD$^{\rm s}$. This property should be taken into account when modeling non-stationary processes in protoplanetary disks within FLD-based models.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2504.10279v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Modeling the internal structure of self-gravitating solid and liquid bodies presents a challenge, as existing approaches are often limited to either overly simplistic constant-density approximations or more complex numerical equations of state. We present a detailed analysis of a tractable and physically motivated model for perfectly elastic, spherically symmetric self-gravitating bodies in hydrostatic equilibrium. The model employs a logarithmic equation of state (logotropic EOS) with a non-zero initial density and constant bulk modulus. Importantly, scaling properties of the model allow all solutions to be derived from a single, universal solution of an ordinary differential equation, resembling the Lane-Emden and Chandrasekhar models. The model provides new insights into stability issues and reveals oscillatory asymptotic behavior in the mass-radius relation, including the existence of both a maximum mass and a maximum radius. We derive useful, simple analytical approximations for key properties, such as central overdensity, moment of inertia, binding energy, and gravitational potential, applicable to small, metallic bodies like asteroids and moons. These new approximations could aid future research, including space mining and the scientific characterization of small Solar System bodies.</description>

      <title>An Informational-Entropic Approach to Exoplanet Characterization</title>

      <description>arXiv:2206.13344v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In the past, measures of ``Earth-likeness'' of exoplanets have been qualitative, considered an abiotic Earth, or required discretionary choices of what parameters make a planet Earth-like. With the advent of high-resolution exoplanet spectroscopy, there is a growing need for a method of quantifying the Earth-likeness of a planet that addresses these issues while making use of the data available from modern telescope missions. In this work, we introduce an informational-entropic metric that makes use of the spectrum of an exoplanet to directly quantify how Earth-like the planet is. To illustrate our method, we generate simulated transmission spectra of a series of Earth-like and super-Earth exoplanets, as well as an exoJupiter and several gas giant exoplanets. As a proof of concept, we demonstrate the ability of the information metric to evaluate how similar a planet is to Earth, making it a powerful tool in the search for a candidate Earth 2.0.</description>

Abstract: Millimeter-waveband spectra of Venus from both the James Clerk Maxwell Telescope (JCMT) and the Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array (ALMA) seem to indicate there may be evidence (signal-to-noise ratio of about $15\sigma$) of a phosphine absorption-line profile against the thermal background from deeper, hotter layers of the atmosphere. Phosphine is an important biomarker; e.g., the trace of phosphine in the Earth's atmosphere is unequivocally associated with anthropogenic activity and microbial life (which produces this highly reducing gas even in an overall oxidizing environment). Motivated by the JCMT and ALMA tantalizing observations we reexamine whether Venus could accommodate Earthly life. More concretely, we hypothesize that the microorganisms populating the venusian atmosphere are not free floating but confined to the liquid environment inside cloud aerosols or droplets. Armed with this hypothesis, we generalize a study of airborne germ transmission to constrain the maximum size of droplets that could be floating in the venusian atmosphere by demanding that their Stokes fallout times to reach moderately high temperatures are pronouncedly larger than the microbe's replication time. We also comment on the effect of cosmic ray showers on the evolution of aerial microbial life.</description>

      <title>Sculpting of Exoplanetary Systems Driven by a Misaligned Disk and Stellar Oblateness: Origin of Perpendicular Orbits in HD 3167</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.00506</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.00506v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A significant proportion of exoplanets have been detected with highly tilted or even polar orbits relative to their host stars' equatorial planes. These unusual orbital configurations are often linked to post-disk secular interactions among multiple bodies. However, many aspects remain elusive. In this study, we investigate the role of disk-induced spin-orbit misalignments in shaping architecture of multi-planet systems, taking into account the combined effect of the host star's oblateness and the full-space disk potential. We demonstrate that large mutual planetary inclinations can arise from a saddle-center bifurcation occurring during the photoevaporation of the disk. This bifurcation triggers an instant, non-adiabatic transition in the planet's libration. Following this process, the orbital evolution diverges into several distinct patterns. Notably, in scenarios involving a near-polar primordial misalignment, the orbit, consistently librating about a coplanar equilibrium axis, can be captured by an orthogonal equilibrium during the decay of the stellar oblateness. However, the orbit will be eventually recaptured by the coplanar equilibrium, aligned or anti-aligned with the orientation of the outer orbit, resulting in either a prograde or retrograde inner-outer orbit configuration. Additionally, general relativity contributes to maintaining eccentricity stability within these dynamic scenarios. Through the proposed mechanism, we can provide a plausible explanation for the unique, near-perpendicular and likely retrograde orbit architecture observed in the HD 3167 system, enhancing our understanding of exoplanetary system dynamics.</description>

      <title>Differentiable Modeling of Planet and Substellar Atmosphere: High-Resolution Emission, Transmission, and Reflection Spectroscopy with ExoJAX2</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.06900</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.06900v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Modeling based on differentiable programming holds great promise for astronomy, enabling advanced techniques such as gradient-based posterior sampling and optimization. This paradigm motivated us to develop ExoJAX (Kawahara et al. 2022), the first auto-differentiable spectrum model of exoplanets and brown dwarfs. ExoJAX directly calculates cross-sections as functions of temperature and pressure to minimize interpolation errors in high-dispersion spectra, although initial work focused on narrowband emission spectroscopy. Here, we introduce a fast, memory-efficient opacity algorithm and differentiable radiative transfer for emission, transmission, and reflection spectroscopy. In the era of data-rich JWST observations, retrieval analyses are often forced to bin high-resolution spectra due to computational bottlenecks. The new algorithm efficiently handles native-resolution data, preserving the full information content and dynamic range. The advances proposed in this paper enable broader applications, demonstrated by retrievals of GL229 B's high-dispersion emission, WASP-39 b's JWST mid-resolution transmission at original resolution (R $\sim$ 2,700), and Jupiter's reflection spectrum. We derive a C/O ratio for GL229 B consistent with its host star, constrain WASP-39 b's radial velocity from molecular line structures, and infer Jupiter's metallicity in line with previous estimates.</description>

      <title>Keck and Gemini characterization of $Hayabusa2\#$ rendezvous target 1998 KY$_{26}$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.17156</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.17156v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Near-earth object (NEO) 1998 KY$_{26}$ is a target of the $Hayabusa2\#$ spacecraft, which it will rendezvous with in July 2031. The asteroid is a rapid rotator and has a large out-of-plane nongravitational acceleration. We present deep $g$ and $R$ band imaging obtained with the Keck I/Low Resolution Imaging Spectrometer and visible spectroscopy from Gemini North/Gemini Multi-Object Spectrograph taken of 1998 KY$_{26}$ on 2024 June 8-9 when the asteroid was $\sim$0.037 au from the Earth. The asteroid lacks evidence of a dust coma in the deep images and its spectrum most closely resembles Xe-type asteroids, possessing a spectral slope of 6.71$\pm$0.43 $\%$ 100 nm$^{-1}$, and colors $g$-$r$ = 0.63$\pm$0.03, $r$-$i$ = 0.15$\pm$0.03, $i$-$z$ = 0.05$\pm$0.04, and implies a diameter of $\sim$10 m. From our images, we compute a 3$\sigma$ upper limit on the dust production of 1998 KY$_{26}$ of $&lt;$10$^{-5}$ kg s$^{-1}$, $&lt;$10$^{-2}$ kg s$^{-1}$, and $&lt;$10$^{-1}$ kg s$^{-1}$ assuming $\mathrm{\mu}$m, mm, and cm size dust particles. Additionally, we compare the orbit of 1998 KY$_{26}$ and large nongravitational parameters asteroids to NEO population models and find that the majority, including 1998 KY$_{26}$, likely originated from the inner Main Belt, while the second most numerous group originates from the outer Main Belt, followed by a third group originating from the Jupiter Family Comet population. Given its inner Main Belt origin, its Xe-type spectrum, and rapid rotation, we hypothesize that the nongravitational acceleration of 1998 KY$_{26}$ may be caused by the shedding of large dust grains from its surface due to its rotation rather than H$_2$O vapor outgassing.</description>

      <title>On the road to the radius valley: distinguishing between gas dwarfs and water worlds with young transiting exoplanets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.17364</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.17364v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The detection of young transiting exoplanets represents a new frontier in our understanding of planet formation and evolution. For the population of observed close-in sub-Neptunes, two proposed formation pathways can reproduce their observed masses and radii at $\sim$Gyr ages: the "gas dwarf" hypothesis and the "water world" hypothesis. We show that a sub-Neptune's size at early ages $\lesssim 100$ Myrs is strongly dependent on the bulk mean molecular weight within its envelope. As a result, gas dwarfs and water worlds should diverge in size at early ages since the mean molecular weight of gas dwarf envelopes is predicted to be smaller than that of water worlds. We construct population models under both scenarios that reproduce Kepler demographics in the age range $\sim1-10$ Gyrs. We find tentative evidence that the gas dwarf model is more consistent with the small population of young exoplanets $&lt; 40$ Myrs from TESS. We show that planet radius is relatively insensitive to planet mass for young, puffy sub-Neptunes, meaning that well-characterised masses are not necessarily required to exploit the effects of mean molecular weight at the population level. We confirm the predicted difference in planet size between the models is also true under mixed-envelope scenarios, in which envelopes consist of mixtures of hydrogen and steam. We highlight that transit surveys of young exoplanets should target the youngest observable stellar clusters to exploit the effects of mean molecular weight.</description>

      <title>Astrometric Parallax Measurements with JWST for Localization of Near-Earth Objects</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.04003</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.04003v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We propose the use of the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) in simultaneous observations with an Earth-based telescope for parallax measurements to tightly constrain the orbital trajectory of hazardous near-Earth objects (NEOs). We demonstrate the significant reduction in localization error with varying epochs of observation at the potential time-of-impact via a Monte Carlo simulated case study of 2024 YR4, an Apollo-type near-Earth asteroid. By leveraging the L2-Earth baseline and the considerable parallax angles formed, we highlight the unexplored potential for improved localization of NEOs through parallax observations with JWST.</description>
