      <title>Smoothly slice links in $S^2 \times S^2$ or $\mathbb{CP}^2 \# \overline{\mathbb{CP}^2}$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.00057</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.00057v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: For $X = S^2 \times S^2$ and $\mathbb{CP}^2 \# \overline{\mathbb{CP}^2}$, we show that there exists a link with 2 components which is not smoothly slice in $X$. By contrast, it is well-known that every knot (i.e., link with 1 component) is smoothly slice in both $S^2 \times S^2$ and $\mathbb{CP}^2 \# \overline{\mathbb{CP}^2}$. Our proof uses classical topological and smooth obstructions, as well as constructive arguments to exploit the symmetries of the problem. As a side note, we also show that for every compact 4-manifold there exists a link that is not slice in it (either smoothly or topologically).</description>

      <title>Splitting links by integer homology spheres</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.00064</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.00064v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: For every $n \ge 3$, we construct 2-component links in $S^{n+1}$ that are a split by an integer homology $n$-sphere, but not by $S^n$. In the special case $n=3$, i.e. that of 2-links in $S^4$, we produce an infinite family of links $L_\ell$ and of integer homology spheres $Y_\ell$ such that the link $L_\ell$ is (topologically or smoothly) split by $Y_\ell$ and by no other integer homology sphere in the family.</description>

      <title>New invariants of involutions from Seiberg-Witten Floer theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.00203</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.00203v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study equivariant Seiberg-Witten Floer theory of rational homology $3$-spheres in the special case where the group action is given by an involution. The case of involutions deserves special attention because we can couple the involution to the charge conjugation symmetry of Seiberg-Witten theory. This leads to new Floer-theoretic invariants which we study and apply in a variety of applications. In particular, we construct a series of delta-invariants $\delta^E_*, \delta^R_*, \delta^S_*$ which are the equivariant equivalents of the Ozsv\'ath-Szab\'o $d$-invariant. The delta-invariants come in three types: equivariant, Real and spin depending on the type of the spin$^c$-structure involved. The delta-invariants satisfy many useful properties, including a Froyshov-type inequality for equivariant cobordisms. We compute the delta-invariants in a wide range of examples including: equivariant plumbings, branched double covers of knots and equivariant Dehn surgery. We also consider various applications including obstructions to extending involutions over bounding $4$-manifolds, non-smoothable involutions on $4$-manifolds with boundary, equivariant embeddings of $3$-manifolds in $4$-manifolds and non-orientable surfaces bounding knots.</description>

      <title>Closed geodesics on hyperbolic surfaces with few intersections</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.00243v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We prove that, if a closed geodesic $\Gamma$ on a complete finite type hyperbolic surface has at least 2 self-intersections, then the length of $\Gamma$ has an lower bound $2\log(5+2\sqrt6)$, and the lower bound is sharp, attained on a corkscrew geodesic on a thrice punctured sphere.</description>

      <title>On coincidences of singular loci of types $\Sigma^{1_r}$ and $\Sigma^r$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.00332</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.00332v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: It is well-known that the Thom polynomial in Stiefel--Whitney classes expressing the cohomology class dual to the locus of the cusp singularity for codimension-$k$ maps $\Sigma^{1_2}(k)$ and that of the corank-$2$ singularity for codimension-$(k-1)$ maps $\Sigma^2(k-1)$ coincide: both are $w_{k+1}^2 + w_k w_{k+2}$. The aim of the present paper is to find out whether there is any geometric explanation to this seemingly mysterious coincidence. We thank L\'aszl\'o Feh\'er for posing us this interesting question that we answer here to the positive, and motivated by it we search for further similar coincidences of the loci of $\Sigma^{1_r}$-type and $\Sigma^r$-type singular points for a general $r$, but found such ones only for special classes of maps. Finally we compute the cohomology classes dual to the singularity strata for any Morin map. (This result--for holomorphic maps--was presented by Kazarian but the proof was left unpublished.)</description>

      <title>Extensions of braid group representations to the monoid of singular braids</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.00516</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.00516v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Given a representation $\varphi \colon B_n \to G_n$ of the braid group $B_n$, $n \geq 2$ into a group $G_n$, we are considering the problem of whether it is possible to extend this representation to a representation $\Phi \colon SM_n \to A_n$, where $SM_n$ is the singular braid monoid and $A_n$ is an associative algebra, in which the group of units contains $G_n$. We also investigate the possibility of extending the representation $\Phi \colon SM_n \to A_n$ to a representation $\widetilde{\Phi} \colon SB_n \to A_n$ of the singular braid group $SB_n$. On the other hand, given two linear representations $\varphi_1, \varphi_2 \colon H \to GL_m(\Bbbk)$ of a group $H$ into a general linear group over a field $\Bbbk$, we define the defect of one of these representations with respect to the other. Furthermore, we construct a linear representation of $SB_n$ which is an extension of the Lawrence-Krammer-Bigelow representation (LKBR) and compute the defect of this extension with respect to the exterior product of two extensions of the Burau representation. Finally, we discuss how to derive an invariant of classical links from the Lawrence-Krammer-Bigelow representation.</description>

      <title>Irrational rotations and 2-filling rays</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.00097</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.00097v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study a skew product transformation associated to an irrational rotation of the circle [0,1]/~. This skew product keeps track of the number of times an orbit of the rotation lands in the two complementary intervals of {0,1/2} in the circle. We show that under certain conditions on the continued fraction expansion of the irrational number defining the rotation, the skew product transformation has certain dense orbits. This is in spite of the presence of numerous non-dense orbits. We use this to construct laminations on infinite type surfaces with exotic properties. In particular, we show that for every infinite type surface with an isolated planar end, there is an infinite clique of 2-filling rays based at that end. These 2-filling rays are relevant to Bavard--Walker's loop graphs.</description>

      <title>Manifolds realized as orbit spaces of non-free $\mathbb Z_2^k$-actions on real moment-angle manifolds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.00492</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.00492v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider (non-necessarily free) actions of subgroups $H\subset \mathbb Z_2^m$ on the real moment-angle manifold $\mathbb R\mathcal{Z}_P$ corresponding to a simple convex $n$ polytope $P$ with $m$ facets. The criterion when the orbit space $\mathbb R\mathcal{Z}_P/H$ is a topological manifold (perhaps with a boundary) can be extracted from results by M.A. Mikhailova and C. Lange. For any dimension $n$ we construct series of manifolds $\mathbb R\mathcal{Z}_P/H$ homeomorphic to $S^n$ and series of manifolds $M^n=\mathbb R\mathcal{Z}_P/H$ admitting a hyperelliptic involution $\tau\in\mathbb Z_2^m/H$, that is an involution $\tau$ such that $M^n/\langle\tau\rangle$ is homeomorphic to $S^n$. For any $3$-polytope $P$ we classify all subgroups $H\subset\mathbb Z_2^m$ such that $\mathbb R\mathcal{Z}_P/H$ is a $3$-sphere or a rational homology $3$-sphere. For any $3$-polytope $P$ and any subgroup $H\subset\mathbb Z_2^m$ we classify all hyperelliptic involutions $\tau\in\mathbb Z_2^m/H$ acting on $\mathbb R\mathcal{Z}_P/H$. As a corollary we obtain that a $3$-dimensional small cover has $3$ hyperelliptic involutions in $\mathbb Z_2^3$ if and only if it is a rational homology $3$-sphere and if and only if it correspond to a triple of Hamiltonian cycles such that each edge of the polytope belongs to exactly two of them.</description>

      <title>Connected Domination in Plane Triangulations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.00595</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.00595v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A set of vertices of a graph $G$ such that each vertex of $G$ is either in the set or is adjacent to a vertex in the set is called a dominating set of $G$. If additionally, the set of vertices induces a connected subgraph of $G$ then the set is a connected dominating set of $G$. The domination number $\gamma(G)$ of $G$ is the smallest number of vertices in a dominating set of $G$, and the connected domination number $\gamma_c(G)$ of $G$ is the smallest number of vertices in a connected dominating set of $G$. We find the connected domination numbers for all triangulations of up to thirteen vertices. For $n\ge 15$, $n\equiv 0$ (mod 3), we find graphs of order $n$ and $\gamma_c=\frac{n}{3}$. We also show that the difference $\gamma_c(G)-\gamma(G)$ can be arbitrarily large.</description>

      <title>Finite Type Invariants of w-Knotted Objects II: Tangles, Foams and the Kashiwara-Vergne Problem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/1405.1955</link>
      <description>arXiv:1405.1955v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This is the second in a series of papers dedicated to studying w-knots, and more generally, w-knotted objects (w-braids, w-tangles, etc.). These are classes of knotted objects that are wider but weaker than their "usual" counterparts. To get (say) w-knots from usual knots (or u-knots), one has to allow non-planar "virtual" knot diagrams, hence enlarging the the base set of knots. But then one imposes a new relation beyond the ordinary collection of Reidemeister moves, called the "overcrossings commute" relation, making w-knotted objects a bit weaker once again. Satoh studied several classes of w-knotted objects (under the name "weakly-virtual") and has shown them to be closely related to certain classes of knotted surfaces in R4.
  In this article we study finite type invariants of w-tangles and w-trivalent graphs (also referred to as w-tangled foams). Much as the spaces A of chord diagrams for ordinary knotted objects are related to metrized Lie algebras, the spaces Aw of "arrow diagrams" for w-knotted objects are related to not-necessarily-metrized Lie algebras. Many questions concerning w-knotted objects turn out to be equivalent to questions about Lie algebras. Most notably we find that a homomorphic universal finite type invariant of w-foams is essentially the same as a solution of the Kashiwara-Vergne conjecture and much of the Alekseev-Torossian work on Drinfel'd associators and Kashiwara-Vergne can be re-interpreted as a study of w-foams.</description>

      <title>Equivariant Principal Bundles over the 2-Sphere</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/1902.06293</link>
      <description>arXiv:1902.06293v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we introduce the classification of equivariant principal bundles over the 2-sphere. Isotropy representations provide tools for understanding the classification of equivariant principal bundles. We consider a $\Gamma$-equivariant principal $G$-bundle over $S^2$ with structural group $G$ a compact connected Lie group, and $\Gamma \subset SO(3)$ a finite group acting linearly on $S^2.$ We prove that the equivariant 1-skeleton $X \subset S^2$ over the singular set can be classified by means of representations of their isotropy representations. Then, we show that equivariant principal G-bundles over the $S^2 $ can be classified by a $\Gamma$-fixed set of homotopy classes of maps, and the underlying $G$-bundle $\xi$ over $S^2$ can be determined by first Chern class.</description>

Abstract: We present two constructions, both inspired by ideas from graph theory, of sequences random surfaces of growing area, whose systoles grow logarithmically as a function of their area. This also allows us to prove a new lower bound on the maximal systole of a closed orientable hyperbolic surface of a given genus.</description>
