      <description>arXiv:2510.27129v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Coulomb gas models an interacting system of $N$ negatively charged particles. We give a new proof that, at sufficiently low temperature, smooth linear statistics $\sum_j \varphi(x_j)$ are bounded by $C N^{1-2/d}$.</description>

      <title>Fusion approach for quantum integrable system associated with the $\mathfrak{gl}(1|1)$ Lie superalgebra</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.27312</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.27312v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work we obtain the exact solution of quantum integrable system associated with the Lie superalgebra $\mathfrak{gl}(1|1)$, both for periodic and for generic open boundary conditions. By means of the fusion technique we derive a closed set of operator identities among the fused transfer matrices. These identities allow us to determine the complete energy spectrum and the corresponding Bethe ansatz equations of the model. Our approach furnishes a systematic framework for studying the spectra of quantum integrable models based on Lie superalgebras, in particular when the $U(1)$ symmetry is broken.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2510.27495v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The aim of this paper is two-fold. First, we prove the existence of Lieb-Robinson bounds for classical particle systems describing harmonic oscillators interacting with arbitrarily many neighbors, both on lattices and on more general structures. Second, we prove the existence of a global dynamical system on the commutative resolvent algebra, a C*-algebra of bounded continuous functions on an infinite dimensional vector space, which serves as the classical analog of the Buchholz--Grundling resolvent algebra.</description>

      <title>Dynamics of stochastic oscillator chains with harmonic and FPUT potentials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.26820</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.26820v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Inspired by recent studies on deterministic oscillator models, we introduce a stochastic one-dimensional model for a chain of interacting particles. The model consists of $N$ oscillators performing continuous-time random walks on the integer lattice $\mathbb{Z}$ with exponentially distributed waiting times. The oscillators are bound by confining forces to two particles that do not move, placed at positions $x_0$ and $x_{N+1}$, respectively, and they feel the presence of baths with given inverse temperatures: $\beta_L$ to the left, $\beta_B$ in the middle, and $\beta_R$ to the right. Each particle has an index and interacts with its nearest neighbors in index space through either a quadratic potential or a Fermi-Pasta-Ulam-Tsingou type coupling. This local interaction in index space can give rise to effective long-range interactions on the spatial lattice, depending on the instantaneous configuration. Particle hopping rates are governed either by the Metropolis rule or by a modified version that breaks detailed balance at the interfaces between regions with different baths.</description>

      <title>Gravitational waveforms from restriction theory and rapid-decay homology</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.26874</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.26874v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a systematic framework for computing frequency-domain gravitational waveforms from relativistic binary scattering in different asymptotic regimes. The method yields a controlled series expansion that can in principle be extended to arbitrary order in the relevant kinematic parameter. By combining differential-equation techniques with restriction theory and algebraic-geometry methods for impact-parameter-space Fourier integrals, we derive recursion relations that generate the leading-order (tree-level) waveform in both the soft-emission and post-Newtonian regimes, establishing a proof of principle for extending the approach to higher-loop computations. Finally, following constraints from rapid-decay homology, we show that the Fourier integrals underlying the waveform satisfy epsilon-form differential equations mixing Bessel- and exponential-type kernels, marking a first step toward uncovering the analytic structure of the exact solution.</description>

      <title>Free energy fluctuations in SK and related spin glass models: A literature survey</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.26960</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.26960v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Over the past 50 years, spin glass models have generated a broad range of literature in mathematics, physics, and computer science. There has been much progress in characterizing and proving the limiting free energy of various models, stemming from the original formulas of Parisi. Comparatively less is known about the more detailed topic of free energy fluctuations. This paper concerns a family of models in which there has been considerable progress on fluctuations, namely the Sherrington-Kirkpatrick (SK) and spherical Sherrington-Kirkpatrick (SSK) models, along with their multi-species analogs. We present a survey of the literature on free energy fluctuations in these 2-spin models, discussing results from different temperature regimes, with and without an external field, including results on phase transitions.</description>

      <title>Non-stationary difference equation and affine Laumon space III : Generalization to $\widehat{\mathfrak{gl}}_N$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.27142</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.27142v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In a series of papers we have considered a non-stationary difference equation which was originally discovered for the deformed Virasoro conformal block. The equation involves mass parameters and, when they are tuned appropriately, the equation is regarded as a quantum KZ equation for $U_q(A_{1}^{(1)})$. We introduce a $\widehat{\mathfrak{gl}}_N$ generalization of the non-stationary difference equation. The Hamiltonian is expressed in terms of $q$-commuting variables and allows both factorized forms and a normal ordered form. By specializing the mass parameters appropriately, the Hamiltonian can be identified with the $R$-matrix of the symmetric tensor representation of $U_q(A_{N-1}^{(1)})$, which in turn comes from the 3D (tetrahedron) $R$-matrix. We conjecture that the affine Laumon partition function of type $A_{N-1}^{(1)}$ gives a solution to our $\widehat{\mathfrak{gl}}_N$ non-stationary difference equation. As a check of our conjecture, we work out the four dimensional limit and find that the non-stationary difference equation reduces to the Fuji-Suzuki-Tsuda system.</description>

      <title>Differential Models for Anderson Dual to Twisted $\mathrm{Spin}^c$-Bordism and Twisted Anomaly Map</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.27286</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.27286v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We construct differential models for twisted $\mathrm{Spin}^c$-bordism and for its Anderson dual, and employ the latter to define a twisted anomaly map whose source is the differential twisted $K$-theory. Our differential model for the twisted Anderson dual follows the formalism developed in [YY23]. To connect these constructions with the geometric framework of the Atiyah-Singer index theory, we further present a gerbe-theoretic formulation of our models in terms of bundle gerbes and gerbe modules [Mur96] [BCMMS02].
  Within this geometric setting, we define the twisted anomaly map \[ \widehat{\Phi}_{\widehat{\mathcal{G}}}\colon
  \widehat{K}^{0}(X,\widehat{\mathcal{G}}^{-1})
  \longrightarrow
  \bigl(\widehat{I\Omega^{\mathrm{Spin}^c}_{\mathrm{dR}}}\bigr)^{n}(X,\widehat{\mathcal{G}}), \] whose construction naturally involves the reduced eta-invariant of Dirac operators acting on Clifford modules determined by the twisted data. Conceptually, this map is expected to encode the anomalies of twisted $1|1$-dimensional supersymmetric field theories, in accordance with the perspectives developed in [ST11] and [FH21].</description>

      <title>The max-type quasimetrics on probability simplices</title>

      <description>arXiv:2510.27368v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Quasimetric spaces form a natural framework to study distance problems with an inherent directional asymmetry. We introduce a simple novel class of quasimetrics on probability simplices, inspired by the Chebyshev distance. It is shown that such quasimetrics have expedient geometric properties -- they induce the Euclidean topology and a Finslerian infinitesimal structure, with which the probability simplices become geodesic spaces. Moreover, we prove that the broad family of the proposed quasimetrics are monotone under bistochastic maps.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2510.27402v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we establishes a connection between noncommutative Laurent biorthogonal polynomials (bi-OPs) and matrix discrete Painlev\'e (dP) equations. We first apply nonisospectral deformations to noncommutative Laurent bi-OPs to obtain the noncommutative nonisospectral mixed relativistic Toda lattice and its Lax pair. Then, we perform a stationary reduction on this Lax pair to obtain a matrix dP-type equation. The validity of this reduction is demonstrated through a specific choice of weight function and the application of quasideterminant properties. In the scalar case, our matrix dP equation reduces to the known alternate dP II equation.</description>

      <title>Boundary Integrability from the Fuzzy Three Sphere</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.27463</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.27463v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider $\mathfrak{so}_4$ invariant matrix product states (MPS) in the $\mathfrak{so}_6$ symmetric integrable spin chain and prove their integrability. These MPS appear as fuzzy three-sphere solutions of matrix models with Yang-Mills-type interactions, and in particular they correspond to scalar defect sectors of $N=4$ SYM. We find that the algebra formed by the fuzzy three-sphere generators naturally leads to a boundary reflection algebra and hence a solution to the boundary Yang-Baxter equation for every representation of the fuzzy three-sphere. This allows us to find closed formula for the overlaps of Bethe states of $\mathfrak{so}_6$ symmetric chains with the fuzzy three-sphere MPS for arbitrary bond dimensions.</description>

      <title>Ground State Excitations and Energy Fluctuations in Short-Range Spin Glasses</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.27507</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.27507v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the stability of ground states in the Edwards-Anderson Ising spin glass in dimensions two and higher against perturbations of a single coupling. After reviewing the concepts of critical droplets, flexibilities and metastates, we show that, in any dimension, a certain kind of critical droplet with space-filling (i.e., positive spatial density) boundary does not exist in ground states generated by coupling-independent boundary conditions. Using this we show that if incongruent ground states exist in any dimension, the variance of their energy difference restricted to finite volumes scales proportionally to the volume. This in turn is used to prove that a metastate generated by (e.g.) periodic boundary conditions is unique and supported on a single pair of spin-reversed ground states in two dimensions. We further show that a type of excitation above a ground state, whose interface with the ground state is space-filling and whose energy remains O(1) independent of the volume, as predicted by replica symmetry breaking, cannot exist in any dimension.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.27687</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.27687v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose a framework for quantum residual management, in which states discarded after a resource distillation process are repurposed as inputs for subsequent quantum information tasks. This approach extends conventional quantum resource theories by incorporating secondary resource extraction from residual states, thereby enhancing overall resource utility. As a concrete example, we investigate the distillation of private randomness from the residual states remaining after quantum key distribution (QKD). More specifically, we quantitatively show that after performing a well-known coherent Devetak-Winter protocol one can locally extract private randomness from its residual. We further consider the Gottesman-Lo QKD protocol, and provide the achievable rate of private randomness from the discarded states that are left after its performance. We also provide a formal framework that highlights a general principle for improving quantum resource utilization across sequential information processing tasks.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2506.02440v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The one-dimensional Fr\"ohlich model describing the motion of a single electron interacting with optical phonons is a paradigmatic model of quantum many-body physics. We predict the existence of an arbitrarily large number of bound excited states in the strong coupling limit and calculate their excitation energies. Numerical simulations of a discretized model demonstrate the complete amelioration of the projector Monte Carlo sign problem by walker annihilation in an infinite Hilbert space. They reveal the threshold for the occurrence of the first bound excited states at a value of $\alpha \approx 1.73$ for the dimensionless coupling constant. This puts the threshold into the regime of intermediate interaction strength. We find a significant spectral weight and increased phonon number of the bound excited state at threshold.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2506.04270v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We show the strong graded locality of all unitary minimal W-algebras, so that they give rise to irreducible graded-local conformal nets. Among these unitary vertex superalgebras, up to taking tensor products with free fermion vertex superalgebras, there are the unitary Virasoro vertex algebras (N=0) and the unitary N=1,2,3,4 super-Virasoro vertex superalgebras. Accordingly, we have a uniform construction that gives, besides the already known N=0,1,2 super-Virasoro nets, also the new N=3,4 super-Virasoro nets. All strongly rational unitary minimal W-algebras give rise to previously known completely rational graded-local conformal nets and we conjecture that the converse is also true. We prove this conjecture for all unitary W-algebras corresponding to the N=0,1,2,3,4 super-Virasoro vertex superalgebras.</description>

      <title>Finite $N$ precursors of the free cumulants</title>

      <description>arXiv:2508.21483v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study $\mathrm{U}(N)$ invariant polynomials on the space of $N\times N$ matrices first introduced by Capitaine and Casalis, that are precursors of free cumulants in various respects. First, they are polynomials of deterministic matrices, that are not yet evaluated over some probability law, contrary to what is usually meant by cumulants. Secondly, they converge towards the algebraic expression of free cumulants in terms of moments as $N\to \infty$, with $1/N^2$ corrections expressed in terms of monotone Hurwitz numbers. Their most crucial property is their additivity with respect to averaging over sums of $\mathrm{U}(N)$ conjugacy orbits, providing a finite $N$ version of the well-known additivity of free cumulants in free probability. Finally, they extend several properties of free cumulants at finite $N$, including a Wick rule for their average over a Gaussian weight and their appearance in various matrix integrals. Building on the additivity property of these precursors, we also define and compute a coproduct describing the behaviour of general invariant polynomials with respect to the addition of $\mathrm{U}(N)$ conjugacy orbits, as well as their expectation values on sums of $\mathrm{U}(N)$-invariant random matrices. In our construction, a central role is played by the so-called HCIZ integral, both for the definition of the precursors and for the derivation of their properties.</description>

      <title>Arm exponent for the Gaussian free field on metric graphs in intermediate dimensions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.10030</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.10030v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate the bond percolation model on transient weighted graphs ${G}$ induced by the excursion sets of the Gaussian free field on the corresponding metric graph. We assume that balls in ${G}$ have polynomial volume growth with growth exponent $\alpha $ and that the Green's function for the random on ${G}$ exhibits a power law decay with exponent $\nu $, in the regime $1\leq \nu \leq \frac{\alpha}{2}$. In particular, this includes the cases of ${G}=\mathbb{Z}^{3}$ for which $\nu =1$, and ${G}= \mathbb{Z}^{4}$ for which $\nu =\frac{\alpha}{2}=2$. For all such graphs, we determine the leading-order asymptotic behavior for the critical one-arm probability, which we prove decays with distance $R$, like $R^{-\frac{\nu}{2}+o(1)}$. Our results are, in fact, more precise and yield logarithmic corrections when $\nu &gt;1$ as well as corrections of order $\log \log R$ when $\nu =1$. We further obtain very sharp upper bounds on truncated two-point functions close to criticality, which are new when $\nu &gt;1$ and essentially optimal when $\nu =1$. This extends previous results from arXiv:2101.05801 and arXiv:1807.11117.</description>

      <title>Non-Heisenbergian quantum mechanics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.11350</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.11350v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Relaxing the postulates of an axiomatic theory is a natural way to find more general theories, and historically, the discovery of non-Euclidean geometry is a famous example of this procedure. Here, we use this way to extend quantum mechanics by ignoring the heart of Heisenberg's quantum mechanics -- We do not assume the existence of a position operator that satisfies the Heisenberg commutation relation, $[\hat x,\hat p]=i\hbar$. The remaining axioms of quantum theory, besides Galilean symmetry, lead to a more general quantum theory with a free parameter $l_0$ of length dimension, such that as $l_0 \to 0$ the theory reduces to standard quantum theory. Perhaps surprisingly, this non-Heisenberg quantum theory, without a priori assumption of the non-commutation relation, leads to a modified Heisenberg uncertainty relation, $\Delta x \Delta p\geq \sqrt{\hbar^2/4+l_0^2(\Delta p)^2}$, which ensures the existence of a minimal position uncertainty, $l_0$, as expected from various quantum gravity studies. By comparing the results of this framework with some observed data, which includes the first longitudinal normal modes of the bar gravitational wave detector AURIGA and the $1S-2S$ transition in the hydrogen atom, we obtain upper bounds on the $l_0$.</description>

      <title>Geometric Zabrodin-Wiegmann conjecture for integer Quantum Hall states</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.10530</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.10530v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The purpose of this article is to show a geometric version of Zabrodin-Wiegmann conjecture for an integer Quantum Hall state. Given an effective reduced divisor on a compact connected Riemann surface, using the canonical holomorphic section of the associated canonical line bundle as well as certain initial data and local normalisation data, we construct a canonical non-zero element in the determinant line of the cohomology of the $p$-tensor power of the line bundle.
  When endowed with proper metric data, the square of the $ L^{2} $-norm of our canonical element is the partition function associated to an integer Quantum Hall state. We establish an asymptotic expansion for the logarithm of the partition function when $ p\to +\infty$. The constant term of this expansion includes the holomorphic analytic torsion and matches a geometric version of Zabrodin-Wiegmann's prediction.
  Our proof relies on Bismut-Lebeau's embedding formula for the Quillen metrics, Bismut-Vasserot and Finski's asymptotic expansion for the analytic torsion associated to the higher tensor product of a positive Hermitian holomorphic line bundle.</description>

      <title>Counterdiabatic Driving with Performance Guarantees</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.01958v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Counterdiabatic (CD) driving has the potential to speed up adiabatic quantum state preparation by suppressing unwanted excitations. However, existing approaches either require intractable classical computations or are based on approximations which do not have performance guarantees. We propose and analyze a non-variational, system-agnostic CD expansion method and analytically show that it converges exponentially quickly in the expansion order. In finite systems, the required resources scale inversely with the spectral gap, which we argue is asymptotically optimal. To extend our method to the thermodynamic limit and suppress errors stemming from high-frequency transitions, we leverage finite-time adiabatic protocols. In particular, we show that a time determined by the quantum speed limit is sufficient to prepare the desired ground state, without the need to optimize the adiabatic trajectory. Numerical tests of our method on the quantum Ising chain show that our method can outperform state-of-the-art variational CD approaches.</description>

      <title>Phase transitions for interacting particle systems on random graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.02721</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.02721v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we study weakly interacting diffusion processes on random graphs. Our main focus is on the properties of the mean-field limit and, in particular, on the nonuniqueness and bifurcation structure of stationary states. By extending classical bifurcation analysis to include multichromatic interaction potentials and random graph structures, we explicitly identify bifurcation points and relate them to the spectral properties of the graphon integral operator. In addition, we develop a self-consistency formulation of stationary states that recovers the primary critical threshold and reveals secondary bifurcations along non-uniform branches. Furthermore, we characterize the resulting McKean-Vlasov PDE as a gradient flow with respect to a suitable metric. In addition, we provide strong evidence that (minus) the interaction energy of the interacting particle system serves as a natural order parameter. In particular, beyond the transition point and for multichromatic interactions, we observe an energy cascade that is strongly linked to dynamical metastability.</description>

      <title>Quantum Phase Sensitivity with Generalized Coherent States Based on Deformed su(1,1) and Heisenberg Algebras</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.21779</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.21779v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate the phase sensitivity of a Mach-Zehnder interferometer using a special class of generalized coherent states constructed from generalized Heisenberg and deformed $su(1,1)$ algebras. These states, derived from a perturbed harmonic oscillator with a four parameter deformed spectrum, provide enhanced tunability and nonclassical features. The quantum Fisher information and its associated quantum Cramer-Rao bound are computed to define the fundamental precision limits in phase estimation. We analyze the phase sensitivity under three realistic detection methods: difference intensity detection, single mode intensity detection, and balanced homodyne detection. The performance of each method is compared with the quantum Cramer Rao bound to evaluate their optimality. Our results demonstrate that, for suitable parameter regimes, these generalized coherent states enable phase sensitivities approaching the quantum limit. This offers a flexible framework for precision quantum metrology and potential applications in quantum enhanced sensing.</description>

      <title>Universality of Ising spin correlations on critical doubly-periodic graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.25019</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.25019v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We establish conformal invariance of Ising spin correlations on critical doubly periodic graphs, showing that their scaling limit coincides with that of the critical square lattice, as originally proved by Chelkak, Hongler and Izyurov. To overcome the absence of integrability and quantitative full plane constructions in the periodic setting, we combine discrete analytic tools with random cluster methods. This result completes the universality picture for periodic lattices, whose criticality condition was identified by Cimasoni and Duminil-Copin and whose conformal structure and interface convergence were obtained by Chelkak.</description>

      <title>The Semi-Classical Limit of Quantum Gravity on Corners</title>

      <description>arXiv:2510.25843v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study quantum and classical systems defined by the quantum corner symmetry group $QCS = \widetilde{SL}(2,\mathbb{R}) \ltimes H_3$, which arises in the context of quantum gravity. In particular, we relate the quantum observables, defined by representation-theoretic data, to their classical counterparts through generalized Perelomov coherent states and the framework of Berezin quantization. The resulting procedure provides a mathematically well-defined notion of the semi-classical limit of quantum gravity, viewed as the representation theory of the corner symmetry group.</description>
