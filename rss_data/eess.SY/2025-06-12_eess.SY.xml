      <title>Optimal Task Offloading with Firm Deadlines for Mobile Edge Computing Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.09180</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.09180v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Under a dramatic increase in mobile data traffic, a promising solution for edge computing systems to maintain their local service is the task migration that may be implemented by means of Autonomous mobile agents (AMA). In designing an optimal scheme for task offloading to AMA, we define a system cost as a minimization objective function that comprises two parts. First, an offloading cost which can be interpreted as the cost of using computational resources from the AMA. Second, a penalty cost due to potential task expiration. To minimize the expected (timeaverage) cost over a given time horizon, we formulate a Dynamic programming (DP). However, the DP Equation suffers from the well-known curse of dimensionality, which makes computations intractable, especially for infinite system state space. To reduce the computational burden, we identify three important properties of the optimal policy and show that it suffices to evaluate the DP Equation on a finite subset of the state space only. We then prove that the optimal task offloading decision at a state can be inferred from that at its adjacent states, further reducing the computational load. We present simulations to verify the theoretical results and to provide insights into the considered system.</description>

      <title>A Data-driven Predictive Control Architecture for Train Thermal Energy Management</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.09187</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.09187v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We aim to improve the energy efficiency of train climate control architectures, with a focus on a specific class of regional trains operating throughout Switzerland, especially in Zurich and Geneva. Heating, Ventilation, and Air Conditioning (HVAC) systems represent the second largest energy consumer in these trains after traction. The current architecture comprises a high-level rule-based controller and a low-level tracking controller. To improve train energy efficiency, we propose adding a middle data-driven predictive control layer aimed at minimizing HVAC energy consumption while maintaining passenger comfort. The scheme incorporates a multistep prediction model developed using real-world data collected from a limited number of train coaches. To validate the effectiveness of the proposed architecture, we conduct multiple experiments on a separate set of train coaches; our results suggest energy savings between 10% and 35% with respect to the current architecture.</description>

      <title>Data-Driven Nonlinear Regulation: Gaussian Process Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.09273</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.09273v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This article addresses the output regulation problem for a class of nonlinear systems using a data-driven approach. An output feedback controller is proposed that integrates a traditional control component with a data-driven learning algorithm based on Gaussian Process (GP) regression to learn the nonlinear internal model. Specifically, a data-driven technique is employed to directly approximate the unknown internal model steady-state map from observed input-output data online. Our method does not rely on model-based observers utilized in previous studies, making it robust and suitable for systems with modelling errors and model uncertainties. Finally, we demonstrate through numerical examples and detailed stability analysis that, under suitable conditions, the closed-loop system remains bounded and converges to a compact set, with the size of this set decreasing as the accuracy of the data-driven model improves over time.</description>

      <title>Integer-Clustering Optimization of Hydrogen and Battery EV Fleets Considering DERs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.09388</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.09388v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Electrified transportation leads to a tighter integration between transportation and energy distribution systems. In this work, we develop scalable optimization models to co-design hydrogen and battery electric vehicle (EV) fleets, distributed energy resources, and fast-charging and hydrogen-fueling infrastructure to efficiently meet transportation demands. A novel integer-clustering formulation is used for optimizing fleet-level EV operation while maintaining accurate individual vehicle dispatch, which significantly improves the computation efficiency with guaranteed performance. We apply the optimization model to Boston's public transit bus network using real geospatial data and cost parameters. Realistic insights are provided into the future evolution of coupled electricity-transportation-hydrogen systems, including the effects of electricity price structure, hydrogen fuel cost, carbon emission constraint, temperature effects on EV range, and distribution system upgrade cost.</description>

      <title>Voltage-Controlled Oscillator and Memristor-Based Analog Computing for Solving Systems of Linear Equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.09392</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.09392v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Matrix computations have become increasingly significant in many data-driven applications. However, Moores law for digital computers has been gradually approaching its limit in recent years. Moreover, digital computers encounter substantial complexity when performing matrix computations and need a long time to finish the computations, and existing analog matrix computation schemes require a large chip area and power consumption. This paper proposes a linear algebra system of equations based on integrators, which features low power consumption, compact area, and fast computation time. Due to the simple structure of the ring oscillator, the ring oscillator-based integrator exhibits a compact area and low power consumption. Therefore, ring oscillator-based integrators are introduced into the linear algebra system of equations, and this system can be used to compute the linear algebra equations of the matrix with either positive or negative values. This paper provides a detailed analysis and verification of the proposed circuit structure. Compared to similar circuits, this work has significant advantages in terms of area, power consumption, and computation speed.</description>

      <title>Large-scale LH2 pipeline infrastructure concept for airports</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.09410</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.09410v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Infrastructure and processes for handling of liquid hydrogen (LH2) is needed to enable large-scale decarbonization of aviation with hydrogen aircraft. At large airports, pipeline and hydrant systems will be important for a mature hydrogen-powered air travel market. As the vaporization of LH2 is a challenge in fuel handling, the pipeline infrastructure must be designed and operated such that the fuel is subcooled. Through modelling and simulation of aircraft tanks refuelling by a pipeline infrastructure concept, it is found that continuous recycling of LH2 within the system is needed to maintain subcooling, and the pump operation is important for preventing flashing. With the proposed concept, some hydrogen vapor is formed in the aircraft tank, but the vapor can be utilised by hydrogen-powered ground support equipment.</description>

      <title>A Survey on the Role of Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning in 6G-V2X Applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.09512</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.09512v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The rapid advancement of Vehicle-to-Everything (V2X) communication is transforming Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITS), with 6G networks expected to provide ultra-reliable, low-latency, and high-capacity connectivity for Connected and Autonomous Vehicles (CAVs). Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Machine Learning (ML) have emerged as key enablers in optimizing V2X communication by enhancing network management, predictive analytics, security, and cooperative driving due to their outstanding performance across various domains, such as natural language processing and computer vision. This survey comprehensively reviews recent advances in AI and ML models applied to 6G-V2X communication. It focuses on state-of-the-art techniques, including Deep Learning (DL), Reinforcement Learning (RL), Generative Learning (GL), and Federated Learning (FL), with particular emphasis on developments from the past two years. Notably, AI, especially GL, has shown remarkable progress and emerging potential in enhancing the performance, adaptability, and intelligence of 6G-V2X systems. Despite these advances, a systematic summary of recent research efforts in this area remains lacking, which this survey aims to address. We analyze their roles in 6G-V2X applications, such as intelligent resource allocation, beamforming, intelligent traffic management, and security management. Furthermore, we explore the technical challenges, including computational complexity, data privacy, and real-time decision-making constraints, while identifying future research directions for AI-driven 6G-V2X development. This study aims to provide valuable insights for researchers, engineers, and policymakers working towards realizing intelligent, AI-powered V2X ecosystems in 6G communication.</description>

      <title>Adaptive event-triggered robust tracking control of soft robots</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.09523</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.09523v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Soft robots manufactured with flexible materials can be highly compliant and adaptive to their surroundings, which facilitates their application in areas such as dexterous manipulation and environmental exploration. This paper aims at investigating the tracking control problem for soft robots under uncertainty such as unmodeled dynamics and external disturbance. First, we establish a novel switching function and design the compensated tracking error dynamics by virtue of the command filter. Then, based on the backstepping methodology, the virtual controllers and the adaptive logic estimating the supremum of uncertainty impacts are developed for synthesizing an event-triggered control strategy. In addition, the uniformed finite-time stability certification is derived for different scenarios of the switching function. Finally, we perform a case study of a soft robot to illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed control algorithm.</description>

      <title>Probability-One Optimization of Generalized Rayleigh Quotient Sum For Multi-Source Generalized Total Least-Squares</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.09573</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.09573v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper addresses the global optimization of the sum of the Rayleigh quotient and the generalized Rayleigh quotient on the unit sphere. While various methods have been proposed for this problem, they do not guarantee convergence to the global maximizer. To overcome this limitation, we introduce a probability-one homotopy optimization method that, under certain conditions, guarantees convergence to the global maximizer. The proposed method is analyzed alongside state-of-the-art approaches through numerical experiments, evaluating their performance in terms of convergence speed and ability to reach the global maximizer. Furthermore, we demonstrate how this ties in with the multi-source Bayesian Generalized Total Least-Squares (B-GTLS) problem, illustrating its applicability.</description>

      <title>Bridging Continuous-time LQR and Reinforcement Learning via Gradient Flow of the Bellman Error</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.09685</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.09685v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we present a novel method for computing the optimal feedback gain of the infinite-horizon Linear Quadratic Regulator (LQR) problem via an ordinary differential equation. We introduce a novel continuous-time Bellman error, derived from the Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman (HJB) equation, which quantifies the suboptimality of stabilizing policies and is parametrized in terms of the feedback gain. We analyze its properties, including its effective domain, smoothness, coerciveness and show the existence of a unique stationary point within the stability region. Furthermore, we derive a closed-form gradient expression of the Bellman error that induces a gradient flow. This converges to the optimal feedback and generates a unique trajectory which exclusively comprises stabilizing feedback policies. Additionally, this work advances interesting connections between LQR theory and Reinforcement Learning (RL) by redefining suboptimality of the Algebraic Riccati Equation (ARE) as a Bellman error, adapting a state-independent formulation, and leveraging Lyapunov equations to overcome the infinite-horizon challenge. We validate our method in a simulation and compare it to the state of the art.</description>

      <title>Enhanced V2X Communication Using Game-Theory Based Adaptive MAC Protocols</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.09817</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.09817v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper presents an enhanced Vehicle-to-Everything (V2X) communication system featuring adaptive Medium Access Control (MAC) using game theory. Our approach integrates dynamic transmission power control, dynamic beacon rates, contention window adaptation, and implicit acknowledgment mechanisms within a Manhattan-like grid-based mobility scenario. Simulations are conducted in a circular coverage area, incorporating refined signal propagation models and probabilistic vehicle mobility with boundary reflection. The results demonstrate effective beacon delivery with average delays under 0.35 s and packet loss rates less than 1% in high-density conditions specifically, with up to 80 vehicles operating within a 250 m radius. Key innovations include game theory-based environment-aware transmission parameter adaptation and a scalable design suited for interference-prone V2X deployments.</description>

      <title>On Polynomial Stochastic Barrier Functions: Bernstein Versus Sum-of-Squares</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.09164</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.09164v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Stochastic Barrier Functions (SBFs) certify the safety of stochastic systems by formulating a functional optimization problem, which state-of-the-art methods solve using Sum-of-Squares (SoS) polynomials. This work focuses on polynomial SBFs and introduces a new formulation based on Bernstein polynomials and provides a comparative analysis of its theoretical and empirical performance against SoS methods. We show that the Bernstein formulation leads to a linear program (LP), in contrast to the semi-definite program (SDP) required for SoS, and that its relaxations exhibit favorable theoretical convergence properties. However, our empirical results reveal that the Bernstein approach struggles to match SoS in practical performance, exposing an intriguing gap between theoretical advantages and real-world feasibility.</description>

      <title>Bipedal Balance Control with Whole-body Musculoskeletal Standing and Falling Simulations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.09383</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.09383v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Balance control is important for human and bipedal robotic systems. While dynamic balance during locomotion has received considerable attention, quantitative understanding of static balance and falling remains limited. This work presents a hierarchical control pipeline for simulating human balance via a comprehensive whole-body musculoskeletal system. We identified spatiotemporal dynamics of balancing during stable standing, revealed the impact of muscle injury on balancing behavior, and generated fall contact patterns that aligned with clinical data. Furthermore, our simulated hip exoskeleton assistance demonstrated improvement in balance maintenance and reduced muscle effort under perturbation. This work offers unique muscle-level insights into human balance dynamics that are challenging to capture experimentally. It could provide a foundation for developing targeted interventions for individuals with balance impairments and support the advancement of humanoid robotic systems.</description>

      <title>Vulnerability-Based Optimal Grid Defense Strategies for Enhancing Cyber-Physical Energy System Resilience</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.09766</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.09766v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: An approach is proposed to identify optimal asset protection strategies based on vulnerability assessment outcomes. Traditional bilevel attacker-defender models emphasize worstcase scenarios but offer limited defensive guidance. In contrast, trilevel models introduce high computational complexity and rely on fixed network configurations. The proposed critical-components method leverages vulnerability assessment results to determine protection strategies, effectively outsourcing the upper-level defense decision. This enables adaptability to diverse network topologies, assessment techniques, and cyber-physical energy systems without the overhead of multi-level optimization. Case studies demonstrate the potential for improved system resilience across varying operational conditions.</description>

Adopting a robust data-driven approach, we formulate the problem as a saddle-point optimization. Our primary contribution is a general first-order algorithm that solves this reformulation by leveraging a linear minimization oracle (LMO). We further develop semi-closed form solutions (up to a scalar) for three specific LMOs, corresponding to the Frobenius norm, Kullback-Leibler divergence, and Gelbrich (aka Wasserstein) distance. The analysis includes explicit quantification of these LMOs' regularity conditions, notably the Lipschitz constants of the dual function, whthich govern the algorithm's convergence performance. Numerical experiments confirm our meod's effectiveness in high-dimensional settings, outperforming standard off-the-shelf optimization solvers.</description>

      <title>Aucamp: An Underwater Camera-Based Multi-Robot Platform with Low-Cost, Distributed, and Robust Localization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.09876</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.09876v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper introduces an underwater multi-robot platform, named Aucamp, characterized by cost-effective monocular-camera-based sensing, distributed protocol and robust orientation control for localization. We utilize the clarity feature to measure the distance, present the monocular imaging model, and estimate the position of the target object. We achieve global positioning in our platform by designing a distributed update protocol. The distributed algorithm enables the perception process to simultaneously cover a broader range, and greatly improves the accuracy and robustness of the positioning. Moreover, the explicit dynamics model of the robot in our platform is obtained, based on which, we propose a robust orientation control framework. The control system ensures that the platform maintains a balanced posture for each robot, thereby ensuring the stability of the localization system. The platform can swiftly recover from an forced unstable state to a stable horizontal posture. Additionally, we conduct extensive experiments and application scenarios to evaluate the performance of our platform. The proposed new platform may provide support for extensive marine exploration by underwater sensor networks.</description>

      <title>On Embedding B-Splines in Recursive State Estimation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.00637</link>
      <description>arXiv:2307.00637v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present a principled study on establishing a recursive Bayesian estimation scheme using B-splines in Euclidean spaces. The use of recurrent control points as the state vector is first conceptualized in a recursive setting. This enables the embedding of B-splines into the state-space model as a continuous-time intermediate, bridging discrete-time state transition with asynchronous multisensor observations. Building on this spline-state-space model, we propose the spline-embedded recursive estimation scheme for general multisensor state estimation tasks. Extensive evaluations are conducted on motion tracking in sensor networks with time-difference-of-arrival and time-of-arrival-inertial settings using real-world and real-world-based synthetic datasets, respectively. Numerical results evidently demonstrate several advantages of spline embedding in recursive state estimation over classical discrete-time filtering approaches in terms of tracking accuracy, robustness, and memory efficiency.</description>

      <title>PRoTECT: Parallelized Construction of Safety Barrier Certificates for Nonlinear Polynomial Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.14804</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.14804v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We develop an open-source software tool, called PRoTECT, for the parallelized construction of safety barrier certificates (BCs) for nonlinear polynomial systems. This tool employs sum-of-squares (SOS) optimization programs to systematically search for polynomial-type BCs, while aiming to verify safety properties over four classes of dynamical systems: (i) discrete-time stochastic systems, (ii) discrete-time deterministic systems, (iii) continuous-time stochastic systems, and (iv) continuous-time deterministic systems. PRoTECT is implemented in Python as an application programming interface (API), offering users the flexibility to interact either through its user-friendly graphic user interface (GUI) or via function calls from other Python programs. PRoTECT leverages parallelism across different barrier degrees to efficiently search for a feasible BC.</description>

      <title>TERIME: An improved RIME algorithm with enhanced exploration and exploitation for robust parameter extraction of photovoltaic models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.18986</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.18986v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Parameter extraction of photovoltaic (PV) models is crucial for the planning, optimization, and control of PV systems. Although some methods using meta-heuristic algorithms have been proposed to determine these parameters, the robustness of solutions obtained by these methods faces great challenges when the complexity of the PV model increases. The unstable results will affect the reliable operation and maintenance strategies of PV systems. In response to this challenge, an improved rime optimization algorithm with enhanced exploration and exploitation, termed TERIME, is proposed for robust and accurate parameter identification for various PV models. Specifically, the differential evolution mutation operator is integrated in the exploration phase to enhance the population diversity. Meanwhile, a new exploitation strategy incorporating randomization and neighborhood strategies simultaneously is developed to maintain the balance of exploitation width and depth. The TERIME algorithm is applied to estimate the optimal parameters of the single diode model, double diode model, and triple diode model combined with the Lambert-W function for three PV cell and module types including RTC France, Photo Watt-PWP 201 and S75. According to the statistical analysis in 100 runs, the proposed algorithm achieves more accurate and robust parameter estimations than other techniques to various PV models in varying environmental conditions.

      <title>Meta-Learning for Adaptive Control with Automated Mirror Descent</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.20165v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Adaptive control achieves concurrent parameter learning and stable control under uncertainties that are linearly parameterized with known nonlinear features. Nonetheless, it is often difficult to obtain such nonlinear features. To address this difficulty, recent progress has been made in integrating meta-learning with adaptive control to learn such nonlinear features from data. However, these meta-learning-based control methods rely on classical adaptation laws using gradient descent, which is confined to the Euclidean geometry. In this paper, we propose a novel method that combines meta-learning and adaptation laws based on mirror descent, a popular generalization of gradient descent, which takes advantage of the potentially non-Euclidean geometry of the parameter space. In our approach, meta-learning not only learns the nonlinear features but also searches for a suitable mirror-descent potential function that optimizes control performance. Through numerical simulations, we demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method in learning efficient representations and real-time tracking control performance under uncertain dynamics.</description>

      <title>System Identification Under Bounded Noise: Optimal Rates Beyond Least Squares</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.16817</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.16817v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: System identification is a fundamental problem in control and learning, particularly in high-stakes applications where data efficiency is critical. Classical approaches, such as the ordinary least squares estimator (OLS), achieve an $O(1/\sqrt{T})$ convergence rate under Gaussian noise assumptions, where $T$ is the number of samples. This rate has been shown to match the lower bound. However, in many practical scenarios, noise is known to be bounded, opening the possibility of improving sample complexity. In this work, we establish the minimax lower bound for system identification under bounded noise, proving that the $O(1/T)$ convergence rate is indeed optimal. We further demonstrate that OLS remains limited to an $\Omega(1/\sqrt{T})$ convergence rate, making it fundamentally suboptimal in the presence of bounded noise. Finally, we instantiate two natural variations of OLS that obtain the optimal sample complexity.</description>

      <title>Occlusion-Aware Ground Target Tracking by a Dubins Vehicle using Visibility Volumes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.03400</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.03400v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper considers the problem of tracking a point of interest (POI) moving along a known trajectory on the ground with an uncrewed aerial vehicle (UAV) modeled as a Dubins vehicle using a line-of-sight (LOS) sensor through an urban environment that may occlude the POI. A visibility volume (VV) encodes a time-varying, three-dimensional representation of the sensing constraints for a particular POI position. A constant-altitude, translating, and radially time-varying circular standoff orbit is then inscribed within the dynamically changing VV centered at the POI position. The time-varying VV is approximated by placing static VVs along the POI's trajectory using an adaptive metric that restricts the volume change of consecutive VVs to below a specified rate. The time-varying circular standoff orbit is proven to be feasible for a Dubins vehicle and approximated with a piecewise set of linearly interpolated circular orbits inside the static VVs. A steering controller is derived that drives the UAV to the time-varying standoff orbit. Numerical simulations and a flight test illustrate the proposed approach.</description>

      <title>Feasibility Study of CNNs and MLPs for Radiation Heat Transfer in 2-D Furnaces with Spectrally Participative Gases</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.08033</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.08033v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Aiming to reduce the computational cost of numerical simulations, a convolutional neural network (CNN) and a multi-layer perceptron (MLP) are introduced to build a surrogate model to approximate radiative heat transfer solutions in a 2-D walled domain with participative gases. The originality of this work lays in the adaptation of the inputs of the problem (gas and wall properties) in order to fit with the CNN architecture, more commonly used for image processing. Two precision datasets have been created with the classical solver, ICARUS2D, that uses the discrete transfer radiation method with the statistical narrow bands model. The performance of the CNN architecture is compared to a more classical MLP architecture in terms of speed and accuracy. Thanks to Optuna, all results are obtained using the optimized hyper parameters networks. The results show a significant speedup with industrially acceptable relative errors compared to the classical solver for both architectures. Additionally, the CNN outperforms the MLP in terms of precision and is more robust and stable to changes in hyper-parameters. A performance analysis on the dataset size of the samples have also been carried out to gain a deeper understanding of the model behavior.</description>

      <title>Toward Low-Altitude Airspace Management and UAV Operations: Requirements, Architecture and Enabling Technologies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.08579</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.08579v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The low-altitude economy (LAE) is rapidly advancing toward intelligence, connectivity, and coordination, bringing new challenges in dynamic airspace management, unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) operation, and security management. Existing systems remain fragmented and lack effective coordination. To bridge these gaps, we propose UTICN (Ubiquitous and Trusted Intelligent Cellular-native Network) for LAE, a unified cellular-native architecture that integrates multi-domain sensing, high-precision positioning, intelligent aircraft-to-everything communication, dynamic airspace management, and UAV operational services. UTICN introduces key technologies such as integrated sensing and communication (ISAC), passive and active positioning, intelligent machine communication, swarm coordination, and control-data decoupled management frameworks. We demonstrate UTICN's feasibility through two use cases, i.e., a city-level LAE management platform and a multi-frequency collaborative ISAC system. This work provides a fundamental reference for building a unified operational foundation and airspace management architecture for the LAE.</description>

      <title>Efficient Uncertainty Propagation with Guarantees in Wasserstein Distance</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.08689</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.08689v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we consider the problem of propagating an uncertain distribution by a possibly non-linear function and quantifying the resulting uncertainty. We measure the uncertainty using the Wasserstein distance, and for a given input set of distributions close in the Wasserstein distance, we compute a set of distributions centered at a discrete distribution that is guaranteed to contain the pushforward of any distribution in the input set. Our approach is based on approximating a nominal distribution from the input set to a discrete support distribution for which the exact computation of the pushforward distribution is tractable, thus guaranteeing computational efficiency to our approach. Then, we rely on results from semi-discrete optimal transport and distributional robust optimization to show that for any $\epsilon &gt; 0$ the error introduced by our approach can be made smaller than $\epsilon$. Critically, in the context of dynamical systems, we show how our results allow one to efficiently approximate the distribution of a stochastic dynamical system with a discrete support distribution for a possibly infinite horizon while bounding the resulting approximation error. We empirically investigate the effectiveness of our framework on various benchmarks, including a 10-D non-linear system, showing the effectiveness of our approach in quantifying uncertainty in linear and non-linear stochastic systems.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2506.08720v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper addresses the problem of identifying linear systems from noisy input-output trajectories. We introduce Thresholded Ho-Kalman, an algorithm that leverages a rank-adaptive procedure to estimate a Hankel-like matrix associated with the system. This approach optimally balances the trade-off between accurately inferring key singular values and minimizing approximation errors for the rest. We establish finite-sample Frobenius norm error bounds for the estimated Hankel matrix. Our algorithm further recovers both the system order and its Markov parameters, and we provide upper bounds for the sample complexity required to identify the system order and finite-time error bounds for estimating the Markov parameters. Interestingly, these bounds match those achieved by state-of-the-art algorithms that assume prior knowledge of the system order.</description>

      <title>Byzantine-Resilient Decentralized Multi-Armed Bandits</title>

      <description>arXiv:2310.07320v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In decentralized cooperative multi-armed bandits (MAB), each agent observes a distinct stream of rewards, and seeks to exchange information with others to select a sequence of arms so as to minimize its regret. Agents in the cooperative setting can outperform a single agent running a MAB method such as Upper-Confidence Bound (UCB) independently. In this work, we study how to recover such salient behavior when an unknown fraction of the agents can be Byzantine, that is, communicate arbitrarily wrong information in the form of reward mean-estimates or confidence sets. This framework can be used to model attackers in computer networks, instigators of offensive content into recommender systems, or manipulators of financial markets. Our key contribution is the development of a fully decentralized resilient upper confidence bound (UCB) algorithm that fuses an information mixing step among agents with a truncation of inconsistent and extreme values. This truncation step enables us to establish that the performance of each normal agent is no worse than the classic single-agent UCB1 algorithm in terms of regret, and more importantly, the cumulative regret of all normal agents is strictly better than the non-cooperative case, provided that each agent has at least 3f+1 neighbors where f is the maximum possible Byzantine agents in each agent's neighborhood. Extensions to time-varying neighbor graphs, and minimax lower bounds are further established on the achievable regret. Experiments corroborate the merits of this framework in practice.</description>

      <title>Incentive-based Platoon Formation: Optimizing the Personal Benefit for Drivers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.00570</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.00570v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Platooning or cooperative adaptive cruise control (CACC) has been investigated for decades, but debate about its lasting impact is still ongoing. While the benefits of platooning and the formation of platoons are well understood for trucks, they are less clear for passenger cars, which have a higher heterogeneity in trips and drivers' preferences. Most importantly, it remains unclear how to form platoons of passenger cars in order to optimize the personal benefit for the individual driver. To this end, in this paper, we propose a novel platoon formation algorithm that optimizes the personal benefit for drivers of individual passenger cars. For computing vehicle-to-platoon assignments, the algorithm utilizes a new metric that we propose to evaluate the personal benefits of various driving systems, including platooning. By combining fuel and travel time costs into a single monetary value, drivers can estimate overall trip costs according to a personal monetary value for time spent. This provides an intuitive way for drivers to understand and compare the benefits of driving systems like human driving, adaptive cruise control (ACC), and, of course, platooning. Unlike previous similarity-based methods, our proposed algorithm forms platoons only when beneficial for the driver, rather than solely for platooning. We demonstrate the new metric for the total trip cost in a numerical analysis and explain its interpretation. Results of a large-scale simulation study demonstrate that our proposed platoon formation algorithm outperforms normal ACC as well as previous similarity-based platooning approaches by balancing fuel savings and travel time, independent of traffic and drivers' time cost.</description>

      <title>SACA: A Scenario-Aware Collision Avoidance Framework for Autonomous Vehicles Integrating LLMs-Driven Reasoning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.00115</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.00115v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Reliable collision avoidance under extreme situations remains a critical challenge for autonomous vehicles. While large language models (LLMs) offer promising reasoning capabilities, their application in safety-critical evasive maneuvers is limited by latency and robustness issues. Even so, LLMs stand out for their ability to weigh emotional, legal, and ethical factors, enabling socially responsible and context-aware collision avoidance. This paper proposes a scenario-aware collision avoidance (SACA) framework for extreme situations by integrating predictive scenario evaluation, data-driven reasoning, and scenario-preview-based deployment to improve collision avoidance decision-making. SACA consists of three key components. First, a predictive scenario analysis module utilizes obstacle reachability analysis and motion intention prediction to construct a comprehensive situational prompt. Second, an online reasoning module refines decision-making by leveraging prior collision avoidance knowledge and fine-tuning with scenario data. Third, an offline evaluation module assesses performance and stores scenarios in a memory bank. Additionally, A precomputed policy method improves deployability by previewing scenarios and retrieving or reasoning policies based on similarity and confidence levels. Real-vehicle tests show that, compared with baseline methods, SACA effectively reduces collision losses in extreme high-risk scenarios and lowers false triggering under complex conditions.

Abstract: Collision avoidance capability is an essential component in an autonomous vessel navigation system. To this end, an accurate prediction of dynamic obstacle trajectories is vital. Traditional approaches to trajectory prediction face limitations in generalizability and often fail to account for the intentions of other vessels. While recent research has considered incorporating the intentions of dynamic obstacles, these efforts are typically based on the own-ship's interpretation of the situation. The current state-of-the-art in this area is a Dynamic Bayesian Network (DBN) model, which infers target vessel intentions by considering multiple underlying causes and allowing for different interpretations of the situation by different vessels. However, since its inception, there have not been any significant structural improvements to this model. In this paper, we propose enhancing the DBN model by incorporating considerations for grounding hazards and vessel waypoint information. The proposed model is validated using real vessel encounters extracted from historical Automatic Identification System (AIS) data.</description>

      <title>Versatile Loco-Manipulation through Flexible Interlimb Coordination</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.07876</link>

Abstract: The ability to flexibly leverage limbs for loco-manipulation is essential for enabling autonomous robots to operate in unstructured environments. Yet, prior work on loco-manipulation is often constrained to specific tasks or predetermined limb configurations. In this work, we present Reinforcement Learning for Interlimb Coordination (ReLIC), an approach that enables versatile loco-manipulation through flexible interlimb coordination. The key to our approach is an adaptive controller that seamlessly bridges the execution of manipulation motions and the generation of stable gaits based on task demands. Through the interplay between two controller modules, ReLIC dynamically assigns each limb for manipulation or locomotion and robustly coordinates them to achieve the task success. Using efficient reinforcement learning in simulation, ReLIC learns to perform stable gaits in accordance with the manipulation goals in the real world. To solve diverse and complex tasks, we further propose to interface the learned controller with different types of task specifications, including target trajectories, contact points, and natural language instructions. Evaluated on 12 real-world tasks that require diverse and complex coordination patterns, ReLIC demonstrates its versatility and robustness by achieving a success rate of 78.9% on average.
