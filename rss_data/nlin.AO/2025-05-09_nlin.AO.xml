      <title>Effect of Levy noise on the network of coupled Chialvo neurons: Impact of topology</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.05394</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.05394v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This research investigates the complex spatiotemporal behaviors of Chialvo neuron maps under the influence of Levy noise on three different network topologies that is a ring network, a two dimensional lattice affected by electromagnetic flux, and a delayed coupled lattice. On the ring structure, we show that adding non uniform Levy noise induces the formation of new collective dynamics like standing and traveling waves. The frequency and type of these emergent patterns depend sensitively on the intrinsic excitability parameter and the noise intensity, revealing new pathways to control synchronization behavior through noise modulation. In the 2D lattice network, we show that electromagnetic flux and noise together induce a diverse range of behaviors, from synchronized waves to desynchronized states. Most strikingly, spiral wave chimeras emerge under moderate noise, with coherent and incoherent regions coexisting, highlighting the fine balance between external forcing and stochastic perturbations. Finally, upon introducing delay in the lattice structure, the system displays a rich variety of dynamical regimes such as labyrinth patterns, rotating spirals, and target waves whose stability and transitions are greatly affected by both delay and coupling strength.</description>

      <title>Robustly optimal dynamics for active matter reservoir computing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.05420</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.05420v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the information processing abilities of active matter in the reservoir computing (RC) paradigm, using a model that is externally driven to infer the future state of a chaotic signal. The simulated system closely follows a previously reported model. We uncover an exceptional dynamical regime of agent dynamics that has been overlooked heretofore. It appears robustly optimal across varying physical parameters and inference tasks, thus providing valuable insights into computation and inference with physical systems more generally. The ability to form effective mechanisms for information processing are primarily determined by the system's own intrinsic relaxation abilities. These are identifiable when probing the system without a specific inference goal and manifest when testing minimalistic single-particle reservoirs. The regime that achieves optimal computation is situated just below the critical damping threshold, involving a microscopic dynamical relaxation with multiple stages. The optimal system is adaptable under chaotic external driving, due to a diversity in response mechanisms that emerge like rapid alternations between quasi-stationary and highly nonlinear dynamical states. Both coherent and incoherent dynamics contribute to their operation, partly at dissimilar scales of space and delay time. Correlations on agent dynamics can indicate the best-performing regimes and onsets of tight relationships between the responding system and the fluctuating driver. As this model of computation is interpretable in physical terms, it facilitates re-framing inquiries regarding learning and unconventional computing with a fresh rationale for many-body physics out of equilibrium.</description>

      <title>Frequency Synchronization Induced by Frequency Detuning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.04714</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.04714v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: It is widely held that identical systems tend to behave similarly under comparable conditions. Yet, for systems that interact through a network, symmetry breaking can lead to scenarios in which this expectation does not hold. Prominent examples are chimera states in multistable phase-oscillator networks. Here, we show that for a broad class of such networks, asynchronous states can be converted into frequency-synchronized states when identical oscillators are detuned to have different intrinsic frequencies. Importantly, we show that frequency synchronization is achieved over a range of intrinsic frequency detuning and is thus a robust effect. These results, which are supported by theory, simulations, and electrochemical oscillator experiments, reveal a counterintuitive opportunity to use parameter heterogeneity to promote synchronization.</description>

      <title>Emergent Complexity in a Light-Driven Self-Oscillatory Crystal: A Molecular Perspective on Autonomous Behavior and Stimulus-Modulated Motion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2301.09873</link>
      <description>arXiv:2301.09873v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Living organisms are molecular systems with self-sustained dynamics via energy conversion through molecular cooperation, resulting in highly complex macroscopic behaviors. Construction of such autonomous macroscopic dynamics at a molecular system level remains one of the central challenges in the field of chemistry. Looking further ahead, constructing motile systems that can receive external information and adapt their autonomous behavior represents the next frontier towards newly functional molecular devices such as microrobots. In this study, we focused on a light-driven self-oscillatory crystal that exhibits continuous flipping motion under constant light irradiation. We experimentally evaluated the oscillation frequency of the crystal under polarized light and confirmed the validity of our previously proposed mechanism, and clarified the requirements for self-oscillation. Based on this mechanism, we constructed a mathematical model that demonstrates the motion of the crystal itself. The model revealed that diverse oscillatory behaviors at the macroscopic level can emerge due to small differences in conditions even when the underlying molecular-level processes are identical. Furthermore, we found that the oscillatory behavior depended on the state generated by the previously applied light. This suggests that a memory effect contributes to the complex motion of the crystal.</description>

      <title>Torus bifurcation of a dissipative time crystal</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.00155</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.00155v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Using a quantum gas setup consisting of a Bose-Einstein condensate strongly coupled to a high-finesse optical cavity by a transverse pump laser, we experimentally observe an instability of a dissipative continuous time crystal (CTC) towards a time crystalline state exhibiting two prominent oscillation frequencies. Applying a mean-field approximation model and a Floquet analysis, we theoretically confirm that this transition is a manifestation in a many-body system of a torus bifurcation between a limit cycle (LC) and a limit torus (LT). We theoretically illustrate the LC and LT attractors using the minimal model and experimentally reconstruct them using Takens' embedding theorem applied to the non-destructively measured intracavity photon dynamics.</description>
