      <title>Spin angular momentum transfer in the Einstein-de Haas effect</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.20946</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.20946v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate spin angular momentum transfer in the Einstein-de Haas effect within prototypical magnetic crystals, focusing on its partition between phonons and rigid-body rotation. Using the Eckart frame to decouple local vibrations (phonons) from rigid-body rotation, we demonstrate that spin angular momentum is simultaneously transferred into both phonons and rigid-body rotation in an asymmetric way: rigid-body rotation acquires the dominant share of angular momentum, while phonons absorb most of the resulting kinetic energy. This divergent transfer of angular momentum and energy identifies phonons as direct and indispensable participants in the Einstein-de Haas dynamics. Furthermore, we find that pseudo-dipolar anisotropy and Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interaction exert distinct control over the angular momentum transfer. Stronger pseudo-dipolar anisotropy increases the total amount of transferred angular momentum, whereas stronger Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interaction accelerates the transfer rate and increases the proportion of phonon angular momentum. Our work clarifies the microscopic picture of the Einstein-de Haas effect and enables targeted angular-momentum control in magneto-mechanical devices.</description>

      <title>Topological Acoustic Diode</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.20951</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.20951v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We show that certain three-dimensional topological phases can act as acoustic diodes realizing nonlinear odd acoustoelastic effects. Beyond uncovering topologically-induced anomalous acoustic second-harmonic generation and rectification, we demonstrate how such nonlinear responses are uniquely captured by the momentum-space nonmetricity tensor in the quantum state Hilbert-space geometry. In addition to completing the classification of quantum geometric observables in the quadratic response regime, our findings reveal unexplored avenues for experimental realizations of acoustic diodes using effective $\theta$ vacua of axion insulators adaptable for topological engineering applications.</description>

      <title>Rocket-like dynamics of ferrimagnetic domain walls in graded materials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.21068</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.21068v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Domain wall motion underpins emerging spintronic technologies, such as high-speed racetrack devices and THz logic. Spatially non-uniform magnetic exchange and anisotropy in ferromagnets can pin or accelerate domain walls. In ferrimagnets, where Walker breakdown is suppressed, walls can approach the magnon speed. Here, we show that in non-uniform ferrimagnets such gradients not only exert a net force on the wall, but also modify its effective mass, enabling an entirely new acceleration mechanism. As a wall traverses regions of varying exchange or anisotropy, it can shed or gain mass leading to a "rocket effect" as in variable-mass systems. This phenomenon becomes increasingly pronounced as the wall approaches the magnon velocity, providing a natural route to ultrafast domain wall propulsion. The findings establish variable-mass domain walls as a new paradigm for efficient, high-velocity spintronics and THz-frequency magnetic technologies.</description>

      <title>Tunneling probe-based identification of the sp${}^3$ dangling bond on the H-C(100):$2\times1$ surface</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.21154</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.21154v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The sp${}^3$ dangling bond on the diamond surface plays a critical role in the performance and fabrication of diamond quantum technologies. For the former, the magnetic and electric properties of this defect can impede the performance of quantum sensors and computers. For the latter, the chemical properties of the dangling bond are integral to proposed methods for bottom-up fabrication of scalable diamond quantum devices. In pursuit of high performance and scalable diamond quantum technology, tunneling probe-based techniques offers the ability to create and modify the sp${}^3$ dangling bond with atomic-scale precision. However, these capabilities cannot be realised either deterministically or at scale without a means for identifying the sp${}^3$ dangling bond amidst the myriad of other defects on the diamond surface. Consequently, in this work we provide a comprehensive experimental and theoretical framework for STS-based characterisation of the sp${}^3$ defect on the H-terminated (100) diamond surface. This capability provides the foundation for future tunneling probe studies in the modification of dangling bonds.</description>

      <title>One-Dimensional Electronic States in a Moir\'e Superlattice of Twisted Bilayer WTe2</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.21228</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.21228v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: One-dimensional (1D) moir\'e superlattices provide a new route to engineering reduced-dimensional electronic states in van der Waals materials, yet their electronic structure and microscopic origin remain largely unexplored. Here, we investigate the structural relaxation and electronic properties of a 1D moir\'e superlattice formed in twisted bilayer 1T$'$-WTe$_2$ using density functional theory calculations, complemented by high-angle annular dark-field scanning transmission electron microscopy. We show that lattice relaxation strongly reconstructs the moir\'e stripes, leading to stacking-dependent stripe widths that are in excellent agreement with experimental observations. The relaxed structure hosts quasi-one-dimensional electronic bands near the Fermi level, characterized by strong dispersion along the stripe direction and nearly flat dispersion in the perpendicular direction. By comparing the full bilayer with isolated relaxed layers, we establish that these 1D electronic states are governed predominantly by an intralayer moir\'e potential induced by in-plane lattice relaxation, rather than by interlayer hybridization. We extract this position-dependent moir\'e potential directly from DFT calculations and construct an effective tight-binding model that reproduces both the band dispersion and the real-space localization of the electronic wave functions. Our results identify lattice relaxation as the key mechanism underlying 1D electronic states in 1D moir\'e superlattices. %and establish twisted bilayer WTe$_2$ as a promising platform for exploring emergent one-dimensional moir\'e physics. The framework developed here provides a unified theoretical basis for realizing and exploring one-dimensional moir\'e physics in a broad class of anisotropic two-dimensional materials.</description>

      <title>Stimulated Magnonic Frequency Combs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.21370</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.21370v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Magnonic frequency combs, characterized by a series of discrete frequency lines, have emerged as a promising frontier in magnon spintronics, with potential applications in advanced information processing and sensing technologies. Although the three-magnon scattering process is widely recognized as a fundamental mechanism for generating these combs, its experimental realization has remained challenging due to the high threshold power and strict conservation of momentum and energy. In this work, we propose a novel mechanism for the stimulated generation of magnonic frequency combs that overcomes these limitations. Our approach offers precise and efficient control over key comb properties, including spacing between spectral lines and the number of lines, marking a significant advancement in the field. We substantiate this mechanism through a robust combination of theoretical modeling, micromagnetic simulations, and experimental validation. This study not only demonstrates the feasibility of our method but also opens new pathways for integrating magnonic frequency combs into practical spintronic devices.</description>

      <title>Quantum Otto cycle in the Anderson impurity model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.21546</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.21546v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the thermodynamic performance of a periodic quantum Otto cycle operating on the single-impurity Anderson model. Using a decomposition of the time-evolution generator based on the principle of minimal dissipation, combined with the numerically exact hierarchical equations of motion (HEOM) method, we analyze the operating regimes of the quantum thermal machine and investigate effects of Coulomb interactions, strong system-reservoir coupling, and energy level alignments. Our results show that Coulomb interaction can change the operating regimes and may lead to an enhancement of the efficiency.</description>

      <title>Deeply nonlinear magnon-photon hybrid excitation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.21549</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.21549v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the microwave-power dependence of magnon-photon coupling in a yttrium iron garnet-sphere/split-ring-resonator hybrid system at room temperature and demonstrate that nonlinear spin-wave interactions suppress the coupling through power-induced dissipation of magnetostatic modes. At low microwave power, the modes exhibit pronounced level repulsion, evidencing strong coupling to the microwave field. As the power increases, however, magnon linewidth broadening progressively weakens the coupling and ultimately suppresses it entirely below a threshold external magnetic field. We show that this behavior originates from Suhl's first-order instability: magnetostatic modes, which couple to the resonator, parametrically excites two counter-propagating magnons at half its frequency, causing modes below the threshold external magnetic field to vanish. In contrast, magnon modes above the threshold field remain robust even at high power, as the instability criterion is not satisfied in that regime. These results reveal a well-defined nonlinear boundary for magnon-photon coupled systems and highlight a favorable regime for exploiting nonlinear magnonics for frequency conversion, switching, and other functional magnonic devices.</description>

      <title>Intrinsic Nonlinear Gyrotropic Magnetic Effect Governed by Spin-Rotation Quantum Geometry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.22019</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.22019v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Nonlinear magnetic response driven by time-periodic magnetic fields offers a distinct route to probe spin-resolved quantum geometry beyond conventional electric-field-driven nonlinear effects. While linear magnetic responses depend on the Zeeman quantum geometric tensor, the influence of generalized spin-rotation quantum geometries on nonlinear responses has not been established. Here, we develop a microscopic quantum-kinetic framework to elucidate how the Zeeman and spin-rotation quantum geometric tensors govern nonlinear gyrotropic magnetic transport in two-dimensional systems. We derive second-order gyrotropic magnetic currents and reveal a distinct geometric separation: the off-diagonal sector is controlled by the Zeeman symplectic and metric connections, whereas the diagonal sector is dictated by the spin-rotation quantum metric and Berry curvature. This identifies the spin-rotation quantum geometric tensor as a fundamental geometric quantity unique to the nonlinear regime. Applying our theory to massless Dirac fermions, hexagonally warped topological insulator surface states, tilted massive Dirac fermions, and parity-time symmetric CuMnAs, we demonstrate how specific symmetries selectively activate conduction and displacement channels. Our findings link spin-resolved quantum geometry to nonlinear magnetic transport, offering design principles for engineering tailored nonlinear magnetic responses in optoelectronic and spintronic devices.</description>

      <title>Magnetic texture modulated superconductivity in superconductor/ferromagnet shells of semiconductor nanowires</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.22051</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.22051v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In a one-dimensional ferromagnet-superconductor nanowire, magnetism can suppress superconductivity except where the Zeeman field is suppressed, for example domain wall superconductivity (DWS) near magnetic domain walls or multi-domain-averaged superconductivity (MDAS) in multi-domain states where the net magnetization over the coherence length averages to nearly zero. Here we study full-shell InAs/EuS/Al nanowires using scanning SQUID magnetometry and transport, and find superconductivity in the Al shell only when the EuS is in a multi-domain state, consistent with both DWS and MDAS, and absent in the saturated single-domain state. Scanning SQUID magnetometry further shows that the EuS magnetic texture is position dependent and reconfigurable by small changes in external magnetic field, including moving a well-defined domain wall at $\approx$5.5 $\mu$m/mT with sub-mT fields, implying that any associated localized superconducting region would likewise be movable. Such magnetic texture controlled superconductivity along a nanowire may be useful for topological qubits, Andreev spin qubits, superconducting logic, and memory devices.</description>

      <title>Hidden localization transitions in generalized Aubry-Andr\'e models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.20931</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.20931v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Anderson localization is a phase transition between a metallic phase, where wavefunctions are extended and delocalized in space, and an insulating phase, where wavefunctions are completely localized. These transitions are driven by uncorrelated disorder or quasiperiodic disorder, e.g., in the case of the Aubry-Andr\'e model. Here, I consider a family of Hamiltonians that generalizes the Aubry-Andr\'e model obtained when position and momentum operators are replaced by an arbitrary couple of canonically conjugate operators. In these models, a hidden localization transition occurs between metallic/insulating phases with wavefunctions delocalized/localized with respect to one of the two canonically conjugate operators. If the canonically conjugate operators coincide with a linear combination of position and momentum, the phase transition is signaled by a zero in the normalized participation ratio in the usual position space. Surprisingly, I found that at the phase transition, this model Hamiltonian coincides with the lattice Hamiltonian of a massless Dirac fermion in a curved spacetime background, indicating an unexpected relation between many-body localization and analog gravity.</description>

      <title>Interacting type-II semi-Dirac quasiparticles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.21098</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.21098v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Type-II semi-Dirac fermions in two dimensions have been proposed to describe topologically nontrivial low energy excitations in titanium/vanadium oxide heterostructures. These quasiparticles appear at the merger of three Dirac cones, resulting in a non-zero Berry phase. We find, by employing Hartree-Fock, renormalization group and RPA techniques, that the spectrum is very sensitive to long-range electron-electron interactions and can undergo a profound transformation. Specifically the quasiparticle spectrum evolves, driven by interactions, from anisotropic Dirac dispersion at the lowest energies, towards the characteristic type-II semi-Dirac boomerang shape as the energy increases. The corresponding density of states varies between linear and power one third ($\rho(\varepsilon) \sim |\varepsilon| \rightarrow |\varepsilon|^{1/3}$). The crossover scale is controlled by the interaction strength $\alpha = e^2/(\hbar v)$, and the specifics of the effective interacting Hamiltonian. Our results imply that various physical characteristics exhibit critical behavior with continuously varying 'critical exponents'; for example Landau levels in a magnetic field vary with the energy scale: $|\varepsilon_n(B)|\sim (nB)^{1/2} \rightarrow (nB)^{3/4}, n=0,1,2,...$, and similarly for other observables.</description>

      <title>Metal Halide Perovskites for Violet and Ultraviolet Light Emission</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.21270</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.21270v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Emissive metal halide perovskites (MHPs) have emerged as excellent candidates for next-generation optoelectronics due to their sharp color purity, inexpensive processing, and bandgap tunability. However, the development of violet and ultraviolet light-emitting MHPs has lagged behind due to challenges related to material and device stability, charge carrier transport, tunability into the ultraviolet spectrum, toxicity, and scalability. Here, we review the progress of both violet and ultraviolet MHP nanomaterials and light-emitting diodes, including materials synthesis and device fabrication across various crystal structures and dimensions (e.g., bulk thin films, 2D thin films, nanoplatelets, colloidal nanocrystals, and more) as well as lead-free platforms (e.g., rare-earth metal halide perovskites). By highlighting several pathways to continue the development of violet and ultraviolet light-emitting MHPs while also proposing tactics to overcome their outstanding challenges, we demonstrate the potential of state-of-the-art violet and ultraviolet MHP materials and devices for important applications in public health, 3D printing, nanofabrication, and more.</description>

      <title>Vanishing of power-law corrections to Kubo's formula for the Hall current at incommensurate magnetic fields</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.21417</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.21417v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider a non-interacting electron gas confined to a two-dimensional crystal by the action of a perpendicular magnetic field; in the one-particle approximation, the dynamics of the system is modelled by a spectrally gapped Bloch-Landau Hamiltonian. No commensurability condition is assumed between the magnetic flux per unit cell and the quantum of magnetic flux. We construct a non-equilibrium almost-stationary state (NEASS) which "dresses" the equilibrium Fermi projection on states below the spectral gap, and models the state of the system after the addition of a weak external electric field of strength $\varepsilon \ll 1$. Having in mind applications to the integer quantum Hall effect, we probe the response of a current operator in the direction transverse to that of the applied electric field, and show that the resulting current density in the NEASS is linear in $\varepsilon$, with no power-law corrections. The linear response coefficient, namely the Hall conductivity, is computed in terms of the equilibrium Fermi projection via the double-commutator formula, in accordance with the prediction from Kubo's linear response theory.
  Our results generalize the methods and findings of [Lett. Math. Phys. 112 (2022), 91] to the setting of uniform magnetic fields with incommensurate magnetic flux per unit cell, and to lattice-periodic perturbation of such magnetic fields.</description>

      <title>Optically reconfigurable canalization of exciton-polaritons in a non-hyperbolic perovskite</title>

      <description>arXiv:2601.21443v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The ability to steer polariton flow on-demand holds significant promise towards nanophotonic applications and photonic circuitry. Polariton canalization, exhibiting intrinsic collimation and diffractionless transport, emerges as a promising solution without guiding structures. However, earlier demonstrations have been restricted to certain crystal surfaces with intrinsic hyperbolic responses and operated in the linear regime. Here, we experimentally demonstrate canalization of nonlinear exciton polariton condensates with optical reconfigurability in a birefringent CsPbBr3 perovskite crystal without intrinsic hyperbolic response. By embedding the birefringent perovskite crystal into a planar microcavity, the interplay between cavity transverse-electric-transverse-magnetic splitting and crystalline birefringence produces an anisotropic band geometry with a hyperbolic-flat-parabolic evolution of polaritonic isofrequency contours (IFCs). Nonresonant pumping drives exciton polariton condensation onto flat far-field contours with nonlinear emission amplification, leading to coherent canalized flows with over twentyfold collimation with respect to arc-shaped contours. Reconfiguring the optical pumping-spot size allows switching the nonlinear polariton condensates into hyperbolic and parabolic IFC regimes, leading to divergent propagation behaviour with collimating reconfiguration. Our study reveals a distinct canalization framework for shaping the nonlinear exciton-polariton condensate flows, opening opportunities for all-optical polaritonic logic circuits based on stabilized nonlinear quantum interconnects.</description>

      <title>Non-secular polariton leakage and dark-state protection in hybrid plasmonic cavities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.21597</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.21597v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A major issue in exploiting plasmonic cavities as key components in nanotechnology is the effect of radiative and absorption losses on their electrodynamic behavior. Treating them as open-systems, we derive a time-local, completely positive master equation that retains non-secular interference between decay pathways and reduces to the standard secular description when the environment resolves polariton splitting. When it does not, the theory predicts order-one deviations from secular leakage dynamics, including bath-induced coherences and stabilization of dark polaritons, and provides a simple design criterion based on the ratio of polariton splitting to reservoir linewidth. A time-resolved leakage measurement, such as transmission, reflectivity, or photoluminescence, can be used to observe these effects.</description>

      <title>Rapid high-temperature initialisation and readout of spins in silicon with 10 THz photons</title>

      <description>arXiv:2601.21880v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Each cycle of a quantum computation requires a quantum state initialisation. For semiconductor-based quantum platforms, initialisation is typically performed via slow microwave processes and usually requires cooling to temperatures where only the lowest quantum level is occupied. In silicon, boron atoms are the most common impurities. They bind holes in orbitals including an effective spin-3/2 ground state as well as excited states analogous to the Rydberg series for hydrogen. Here we show that initialisation temperature demands may be relaxed and speeds increased over a thousand-fold by importing, from atomic physics, the procedure of optical pumping via excited orbital states to preferentially occupy a target ground state spin. Spin relaxation within the orbital ground state of unstrained silicon is too fast to measure for conventional pulsed microwave technology, except at temperatures below 2 K, implying a need not only for fast state preparation but also fast state readout. Circularly polarised ~10 THz photon pulses from a free electron laser meet both needs at temperatures above 3 K: a 9 ps pulse enhances the population of one spin eigenstate for the "1s"-like ground state orbital, and the second interrogates this imbalance in spin population. Using parameters given by our data, we calculate that it should be possible to initialise 99% of spins for boron in strained silicon within 250 ps at 3 K. The speedup of both state preparation and measurement gained for THz rather than microwave photons should be explored for the many other solid state quantum systems hosting THz excitations potentially useful as intermediate states.</description>

      <title>Superconducting properties of transition metal dichalcogenides in proximity to a conventional superconductor</title>

      <description>arXiv:2601.21994v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDs) hold relevance for spin-triplet superconducting phases due to their inherent Ising spin-orbit coupling, but the majority of studies have so far focused on oversimplified models. In this work, we consider a TMD monolayer using a three-orbital model with anisotropic couplings and investigate the emergent superconducting properties when it is placed in proximity to a conventional spin-singlet $s$-wave superconductor. We find that the multiorbital nature of the TMDs lead to superconducting gaps not only at zero energy, but also at higher energies, so-called hybridization gaps, which exhibit a complex structure due to the anisotropic couplings, challenging their spectral measurement. Moreover, we find that the inherent Ising spin-orbit coupling induces a spin splitting and a spin polarization along the $z$-direction, which correlates with the emergence of mixed spin-triplet superconducting pairs. These spin-triplet pair correlations appear in the monolayer as a proximity-induced effect due to the impact of the Ising spin-orbit field on conventional spin-singlet $s$-wave superconductivity. Taking realistic parameters for a $\text{MoS}_2$ monolayer, we show that the Ising field is strong enough to induce spin-triplet pair correlations of the same magnitude as their spin-singlet counterparts. We also include Rashba spin-orbit coupling, naturally emerging in a heterostructure and find that it induces equal spin-triplet superconducting pairs that compete with the mixed spin-triplet pairs induced by the Ising spin-orbit coupling. Our findings help understand the superconducting properties of TMDs in proximity to conventional superconductors.</description>

      <title>Revealing Higher-Order Topological Bulk-boundary Correspondence in Bismuth Crystal with Spin-helical Hinge State Loop and Proximity Superconductivity</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.07533v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Topological materials are typically characterized by gapless boundary states originated from nontrivial bulk band topology, known as topological bulk-boundary correspondence. Recently, this fundamental concept has been generalized in higher-order topological insulators (HOTIs). E.g., a second-order three-dimensional (3D) TI hosts one-dimensional (1D) topological hinge states winding around the crystal. However, a complete verification of higher-order topology is still lacking as it requires probing all the crystal boundaries. Here we studied a promising candidate of second-order TI, bismuth (Bi), in the form of mesoscopic crystals grown on superconducting V3Si. Using low-temperature scanning tunneling microscopy, we directly observed dispersive 1D states on various hinges of the crystal. Upon introducing magnetic scatterers, new scattering channels emerged selectively on certain hinges, revealing their spin-helical nature. Combining first-principle calculation and global symmetry analysis, we find these hinge states are topological and formed a closed loop encircling the crystal. This provides direct evidence on the higher-order topology in Bi. Moreover, proximity superconductivity is observed in the topological hinge states, enabling HOTI as a promising platform for realizing topological superconductivity and Majorana quasiparticles.</description>

      <title>Observation of dislocation bound states and skin effects in non-Hermitian Chern insulators</title>

Abstract: The confluence of non-Hermitian (NH) topology and crystal defects has culminated significant interest, yet its experimental exploration has been limited due to the challenges involved in design and measurements. Here, we showcase experimental observation of NH dislocation bound states (NHDS) and the dislocation-induced NH skin effect in two-dimensional acoustic NH Chern lattices. By embedding an edge dislocations-antidislocation pair in such acoustic lattices and implementing precision-controlled hopping and onsite gain/loss via active meta-atoms, we reveal robust defect-bound states localized at dislocation cores within the line gap of the complex energy spectrum. We experimentally identify the emergence of bulk exceptional points (EPs) via spectral coalescence and phase rigidity analysis. We demonstrate that the NHDS survive against moderate NH perturbations but gradually delocalize and merge with the bulk (skin) states driven by these EPs under periodic (open) boundary conditions. Furthermore, our experiments demonstrate that the dislocation core can feature weak NH skin effects when its direction is perpendicular to the Burgers vector in periodic systems. Our findings, therefore, pave an experimental pathway for probing NH topology via lattice defects and open new avenues for defect-engineered topological devices.</description>

      <title>Soft-X-ray momentum microscopy of nonlinear magnon interactions below 100-nm wavelength</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.20958v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Magnons are quantised collective excitations of long-range ordered spins. At nanometre wavelengths, exchange interactions increasingly govern their dynamics, giving rise to a largely unexplored regime of couplings between magnons and other quasiparticles. Yet, detecting such short-wavelength spin waves has remained a key experimental challenge. Here, we introduce Magnon Momentum Microscopy (MMM) -- a quasi-elastic, resonant magnetic soft-X-ray scattering technique that directly images magnon populations across two-dimensional momentum space. Owing to its remarkable sensitivity, MMM can capture nonlinear magnon--magnon interactions over large regions of the dispersion plane. Applying MMM to the prototypical magnonic material yttrium iron garnet (YIG), we uncover a rich variety of previously unobserved nonlinear magnon interactions. With its element specificity, bulk sensitivity, as well as intrinsic access to nanometre-scale wavelengths without frequency limitation, soft-X-ray MMM establishes a powerful and versatile platform for exploring short-wavelength and nonlinear magnonics.</description>

      <title>A Unified Framework for the Non-Hermitian Localization: Boundary-Insensitive Modes and Electric-Magnetic Analogy</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.10252v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The non-Hermitian skin effect is fundamentally characterized by its sensitivity to boundary conditions, reflected in changes to the energy spectrum and boundary-localized eigenstates. Here, we demonstrate that a spatially inhomogeneous imaginary scalar potential field induces a skin effect that is insensitive to boundary conditions. Both the spectrum and eigenstate distribution remain invariant, a behavior not captured by existing theories. We attribute this anomaly to translational symmetry breaking induced by spatially varying imaginary potentials in finite systems. We further formulate a theory that universally predicts localization in single-particle non-Hermitian systems. This framework classifies skin effects into two fundamental types: electric, driven by imaginary scalar potentials, and magnetic, driven by imaginary vector potentials, and reveals a phase transition between them, where eigenstates become fully delocalized. Our work provides a unified theory for non-Hermitian localization, allowing full control over skin modes via potential engineering in various platforms like photonic crystals and cold-atom systems.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2506.04466v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We introduce a second-quantized field theory for Chern insulators in which the Hamiltonian features a static vector potential that has the periodicity of the crystal's lattice and spontaneously breaks time-reversal symmetry in the system's ground state. Such a vector potential generates a magnetic field at the microscopic level that may be thought of as arising from local moments associated with one or more magnetic ions in each unit cell. Considering spinor electrons, we study the Chern invariants characterizing the topology of the occupied valence bands of Chern insulators in both two and three dimensions - the Chern number and the Chern vector, respectively - and we derive novel expressions for these topological invariants that are globally defined across the Brillouin zone and involve the full band structure of the system. We also study the long-wavelength response of a Chern insulator to electromagnetic fields at finite frequency, generalizing the quantum anomalous Hall effect in the static limit to the optical regime.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2506.15502v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study a novel type of solitonic Andreev bound state (ABS) in a Corbino-geometry Josephson junction created on a 2DEG. The Josephson junction is subjected to a weak magnetic flux that induces a fluxoid mismatch between the inner disk and outer ring superconductors. The mismatch produces a Josephson vortex (phase soliton) that binds unconventional spinful but chargeless ABSs, analogous to Jackiw-Rebbi solitonic states. The position around the Josephson junction of the trapped ABSs can be controlled externally by a junction phase bias. As the solitonic ABSs are shuttled around the Josephson junction, the 2DEG spin-orbit coupling induces a geometric precession of their spin. We argue that these solitonic ABSs constitute a natural candidate for a novel type of superconducting Andreev spin qubit, dubbed solitonic Andreev spin qubit (SASQ), that combines features of Andreev spin qubits and geometric spin qubits. Holonomic single-qubit SASQ operations are induced through soliton shuttling, with the resulting SU(2) trajectories densely covering the qubit Bloch sphere. Effects of disorder, non-holonomic SASQ dynamics and other aspects of qubit operation are also analyzed.</description>

      <title>Radial Rashba spin-orbit fields in commensurate twisted transition-metal dichalcogenide bilayers</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.10068v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In commensurate twisted homobilayers, purely radial Rashba spin-orbit fields can emerge. We employ first-principles calculations to investigate the band structures and the spin-orbit fields close to the high-symmetry points $K$ and $\Gamma$ of several commensurate twisted transition-metal dichalcogenide homobilayers: WSe$_2$, NbSe$_2$, and WTe$_2$. The observed in-plane spin textures are mostly radial, and the main features are successfully reproduced using a model Hamiltonian based on two effective mass models including spin-orbit coupling, and a general (spin-conserving) interlayer coupling. Extracting the model Hamiltonian parameters through fitting of several twisted supercells, we find a twist angle dependency of the magnitude of the radial Rashba field, which is symmetric not only around the untwisted cases ($\Theta=0^\circ$ and $\Theta=60^\circ$), but also around $\Theta=30^\circ$. Furthermore, we observe that the interlayer coupling between the $K/K'$-points of the two layers decreases with the increase of the size of the commensurate supercells. Hence, peaks of high interlayer coupling can occur only for twist angles, where small commensurate supercells are possible. Exploring different lateral displacements between the layers, we confirm that the relevant symmetry protecting the radial Rashba is an in-plane 180$^\circ$ rotation axis. We additionally investigate the effects of atomic relaxation and modulation of the interlayer distance. Our calculations on WTe$_2$ bilayers show that their lack of $C_3$ symmetry results in spin textures that are neither radial nor tangential. Our results offer fundamental microscopic insights that are particularly relevant to engineering spin-charge conversion schemes based on twisted layered materials.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2510.24294v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Motivated by the emerging control of Berry-curvature textures in altermagnets, we explore a two-terminal configuration where a topological-insulator film is interfaced with two altermagnetic electrodes whose crystalline phases can be rotated independently. The proximity coupling imprints each momentum-dependent of the altermagnet spin texture onto the Dirac surface states, giving rise to an angular mass whose sign follows the lattice orientation. Adjusting the phase of one electrode redefines this mass pattern, thereby tuning the number and spatial distribution of chiral edge channels. This results in discrete conductance steps and a reversible inversion of the thermoelectric coefficient-achieved without external magnetic fields or net magnetization. A compact Dirac model captures both the quantized switching and its resilience to moderate disorder. Overall, this symmetry-driven mechanism provides a practical and low-dissipation route to programmable topological transport via lattice rotation.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2511.12933v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Transport properties of single- and two-site mesoscopic quantum Hall (QH) circuits at high transparencies can be described in terms of the lowest-order backscattering processes, enabling a mapping to the boundary sine-Gordon model. We show that this description breaks down in circuits with four or more sites, where higher-order backscattering processes become relevant and qualitatively modify the low-energy physics, while remaining exactly marginal in three-site geometries. Focusing on the four-site circuit, we derive an effective low-energy theory that captures the resulting interaction-driven physics and reveal the emergence of unique quantum-critical points. In the vicinity of these critical points, we obtain universal conductance and scaling behavior and establish the robustness of the associated non-Fermi liquid physics. We further introduce tunneling in multichannel multi-site QH circuits and propose a promising route for realizing diverse quantum-critical phenomena. We show that a boundary sine-Gordon description can be restored in multichannel multi-site QH circuits by appropriately looping selected edge channels, a procedure that is experimentally feasible. Finally, we analyze the non-equilibrium heating effects relevant to transport measurements in QH circuits. Altogether, our results establish multi-site QH circuits as a versatile and highly controllable platform for simulating interaction-driven quantum critical phenomena.</description>

      <title>Impurity screening by defects in (1+1)$d$ quantum critical systems</title>

Abstract: We propose a novel mechanism of impurity screening in (1+1)$d$ quantum critical states described by conformal field theories (CFTs). An impurity can be screened if it has the same quantum numbers as some gapless degrees of freedom of the CFT. The common source of these degrees of freedom is the chiral primary fields of the CFT, but we uncover that topological defect lines of the CFT may also take this role. Theoretical analysis relies on the insight that the impurities can be interpreted as edge modes of certain symmetry-protected topological (SPT) states. By stacking a SPT state with a CFT, one or two interfaces on which the SPT edge modes reside are created. If screening occurs due to topological defect lines, a symmetry-enriched CFT with exotic boundary states are obtained. The boundary conditions that appear in these cases are difficult to achieve using previously known methods. As a concrete example, we consider a spin-1 chain whose bulk is described by the SU(3)$_{1}$ CFT and edges are coupled to spin-1/2 impurities. We demonstrate that both the low-energy eigenstates and the extracted Affleck-Ludwig entropy are in excellent agreement with our theoretical predictions.</description>

      <title>Non-Abelian fractional quantum Hall states at filling factor 3/4</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.16275</link>

Abstract: Fractional quantum Hall states have been observed at filling factor $\nu=3/4$ in GaAs hole system and bilayer graphene. In theoretical bootstrap analysis, it was revealed that non-Abelian topological orders with Ising anyons can be realized at $\nu=3/4$, which exhibit $12$ fold ground state degeneracy on the torus. The properties of $\nu=3/4$ states can be analyzed using two complementary approaches. In the first one, they are treated as particle-hole conjugate of $\nu=1/4$ Moore-Read types states. In the second one, they are mapped to composite fermions with reverse flux attachment at effective filling factor $3/2$, whose integral part realizes an integer quantum Hall state and the fractional part realizes $\nu=1/2$ Moore-Read type states. For bilayer graphene with appropriate Landau level mixing, numerical calculations found $12$ quasi-degenerate ground states on the torus at $\nu=3/4$. Chiral graviton spectral functions of these states have one low energy peak with negative chirality and one high energy peak with positive chirality. This points to a specific member of the Moore-Read type states and agrees with the deduction based on daughter states.</description>

      <title>Real-Space Switching of Local Moments Driven by Quantum Geometry in Correlated Graphene Heterostructures</title>

Abstract: Graphene-based multilayer systems serve as versatile platforms for exploring the interplay between electron correlation and topology, thanks to distinctive low-energy bands marked by significant quantum metric and Berry curvature from graphene's Dirac bands. Here, we investigate Mott physics and local spin moments in Dirac bands hybridized with a flat band of localized orbitals in functionalized graphene. Via hybridization control, a topological transition is realized between two symmetry-distinct site-selective Mott states featuring local moments in different Wyckoff positions, with a geometrically enforced metallic state emerging in between. We find that this geometrically controlled real-space switching of local moments and associated metal-insulator physics may be realized through proximity coupling of epitaxial graphene on SiC(0001) with group IV intercalants, where the Mott state faces geometrical obstruction in the large-hybridization limit. Our work shows that chemically functionalized graphene provides a correlated electron platform, very similar to the topological heavy fermions in graphene moir\'e systems but at significantly enhanced characteristic energy scales.</description>

      <title>Gaplessness from disorder and quantum geometry in gapped superconductors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.15891</link>

Abstract: It is well known that disorder can induce low-energy Andreev bound states in a sign-changing, but fully gapped, superconductor at $\pi-$junctions. Generically, these excitations are localized. Starting from a superconductor with a sign-changing and nodeless order parameter in the clean limit, here we demonstrate a mechanism for increasing the localization length associated with the low-energy Andreev bound states at a fixed disorder strength. We find that the Fubini-Study metric associated with the electronic Bloch wavefunctions controls the localization length and the hybridization between bound states localized at distinct $\pi-$junctions. We present results for the inverse participation ratio, superfluid stiffness, site-resolved and disorder-averaged spectral functions as a function of increasing Fubini-Study metric, which indicate an increased tendency towards delocalization. The low-energy properties resemble those of a dirty nodal superconductor with gapless Bogoliubov excitations. We place these results in the context of recent experiments in moire graphene superconductors.</description>

      <title>Noncommuting zero-noise and zero-frequency limits in particle-hole symmetric fluids</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.02475</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.02475v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In charged fluids obeying particle-hole symmetry, such as the Dirac fluid in graphene, charge transport is diffusive despite the presence of ballistically propagating sound waves: sound waves "hydrodynamically decouple" from the slower charge fluctuations. For quasi-one-dimensional fluids, we show that this symmetry-protected charge diffusion is not smoothly connected to the normal diffusion that arises when momentum conservation is broken by noise (or static impurities). Instead, the charge diffusion constant is a discontinuous function of noise, which (in the weak-noise limit) depends only on the ratio of momentum and energy relaxation rates. In the special limit of momentum-conserving noise (e.g., spatially uniform fluctuations of the Hamiltonian), the diffusion constant diverges in the presence of noise. We describe the resulting superdiffusion in terms of coupled Burgers equations. We present a general mechanism--hydrodynamic recoupling--by which weak noise can induce singular changes in transport coefficients. Our results highlight the limits of zero-noise extrapolation for predicting dynamical quantities like diffusion constants.</description>
