      <title>Statistical Design and Rationale of the Biomarkers for Evaluating Spine Treatments (BEST) Trial</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.19127</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.19127v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Chronic low back pain (cLBP) is a prevalent condition with profound impacts on functioning and quality of life. While multiple evidence-based treatments exist, they all have modest average treatment effects$\unicode{x2013}$potentially due to individual variation in treatment response and the diverse etiologies of cLBP. This multi-site sequential, multiple-assignment randomized trial (SMART) investigated four treatment modalities with two stages of randomization and aimed to enroll 630 protocol completers. The primary objective was to develop a precision medicine approach by estimating optimal treatment or treatment combinations based on patient characteristics and initial treatment response. The analysis strategy focuses on estimating interpretable dynamic treatment regimes and identifying subgroups most responsive to specific interventions. Broad eligibility criteria were implemented to enhance generalizability and recruitment, most notably that participants could be eligible to enroll even if they could not be assigned to one (but no more) of the study interventions. Enrolling participants with restrictions on the treatment they could be assigned necessitated modifications to standard minimization methods for balancing covariates. The BEST trial represents one of the largest SMARTs focused on clinical decision-making to date and the largest in cLBP. By collecting an extensive array of biomarker and phenotypic measures, this trial may identify potential treatment mechanisms and establish a more evidence-based approach to individualizing cLBP treatment in clinical practice.</description>

      <title>A novel forecasting framework combining virtual samples and enhanced Transformer models for tourism demand forecasting</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.19423</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.19423v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Accurate tourism demand forecasting is hindered by limited historical data and complex spatiotemporal dependencies among tourist origins. A novel forecasting framework integrating virtual sample generation and a novel Transformer predictor addresses constraints arising from restricted data availability. A spatiotemporal GAN produces realistic virtual samples by dynamically modeling spatial correlations through a graph convolutional network, and an enhanced Transformer captures local patterns with causal convolutions and long-term dependencies with self-attention,eliminating autoregressive decoding. A joint training strategy refines virtual sample generation based on predictor feedback to maintain robust performance under data-scarce conditions. Experimental evaluations on real-world daily and monthly tourism demand datasets indicate a reduction in average MASE by 18.37% compared to conventional Transformer-based models, demonstrating improved forecasting accuracy. The integration of adaptive spatiotemporal sample augmentation with a specialized Transformer can effectively address limited-data forecasting scenarios in tourism management.</description>

      <title>Combining predictive distributions for time-to-event outcomes in meteorology</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.19534</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.19534v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Combining forecasts from multiple numerical weather prediction (NWP) models have shown substantial benefit over the use of individual forecast products. Although combination, in a broad sense, is widely used in meteorological forecasting, systematic studies of combination methodology in meteorology are scarce. In this article, we study several combination methods, both state-of-the-art and of our own making, with a particular emphasis on situations where one seeks to predict when a particular event of interest will occur. Such time-to-event forecasts require particular methodology and care. We conduct a careful comparison of the different combination methods through an extensive simulation study, where we investigate the conditions under which the combined forecast will outperform the individual forecasting products. Further, we investigate the performance of the methods in a case-study modelling the time to first hard freeze in Norway and parts of Fennoscandia.</description>

      <title>Stochastic ecohydrological perspective on semi-distributed rainfall-runoff dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.19220</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.19220v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Quantifying watershed process variability consistently with climate change and ecohydrological dynamics remains a central challenge in hydrology. Stochastic ecohydrology characterizes hydrologic variability through probability distributions that link climate, hydrology, and ecology. However, these approaches are often limited to small spatial scales (e.g., point or plot level) or focus on specific fluxes (e.g., streamflow), without accounting for the entire water balance at the basin scale. While semi-distributed models account for spatial heterogeneity and upscaled hydrologic fluxes, they lack the analytical simplicity of stochastic ecohydrology or the SCS-CN method and, perhaps more importantly, do not integrate the effects of past random variability in hydroclimatic conditions. This hinders an efficient characterization of hydrological statistics at the watershed scale. To overcome these limitations, we merge stochastic ecohydrology, the spatial upscaling of semi-distributed modeling, and the SCS-CN rainfall-runoff partitioning. The resulting unified model analytically characterizes watershed ecohydrological and hydrological statistics using probability density functions (PDFs) that are functions of climate and watershed attributes -- something unattainable with the Monte Carlo methods of traditional stochastic hydrology. Calibrated across 81 watersheds in Florida and southern Louisiana, the model PDFs precisely capture the long-term average water balance and runoff variance, as well as the runoff quantiles with a median normalized Nash-Sutcliffe (NNSE) efficiency of 0.95. These results also advance the SCS-CN method by providing an analytical PDF for the Curve Number (CN), explicitly linked to climate variables, baseflow, and the long-term water balance partitioning described by the Budyko curve.</description>

      <title>Causal Panel Analysis under Parallel Trends: Lessons from A Large Reanalysis Study</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.15983</link>
      <description>arXiv:2309.15983v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Two-way fixed effects (TWFE) models are widely used in political science to establish causality, but recent methodological discussions highlight their limitations under heterogeneous treatment effects (HTE) and violations of the parallel trends (PT) assumption. This growing literature has introduced numerous new estimators and procedures, causing confusion among researchers about the reliability of existing results and best practices. To address these concerns, we replicated and reanalyzed 49 studies from leading journals using TWFE models for observational panel data with binary treatments. Using six HTE-robust estimators, diagnostic tests, and sensitivity analyses, we find: (i) HTE-robust estimators yield qualitatively similar but highly variable results; (ii) while a few studies show clear signs of PT violations, many lack evidence to support this assumption; and (iii) many studies are underpowered when accounting for HTE and potential PT violations. We emphasize the importance of strong research designs and rigorous validation of key identifying assumptions.</description>

      <title>Generalization Issues in Conjoint Experiment: Attention and Salience</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.06779</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.06779v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Can the causal effects estimated in an experiment be generalized to real-world scenarios? This question lies at the heart of social science studies. External validity primarily assesses whether experimental effects persist across different settings, implicitly presuming the consistency of experimental effects with their real-life counterparts. However, we argue that this presumed consistency may not always hold, especially in experiments involving multi-dimensional decision processes, such as conjoint experiments. We introduce a formal model to elucidate how attention and salience effects lead to three types of inconsistencies between experimental findings and real-world phenomena: amplified effect magnitude, effect sign reversal, and effect importance reversal. We derive testable hypotheses from each theoretical outcome and test these hypotheses using data from various existing conjoint experiments and our own experiments. Drawing on our theoretical framework, we propose several recommendations for experimental design aimed at enhancing the generalizability of survey experiment findings.</description>
