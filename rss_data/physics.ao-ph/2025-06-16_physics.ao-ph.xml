      <title>Realistic ENSO Dynamics Requires a Damped Nonlinear Recharge Oscillator</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.11206</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.11206v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The dynamics of the El Ni\~no Southern Oscillation (ENSO) are succinctly captured by the Recharge Oscillator (RO) framework. However, to simulate ENSO realistically, careful choices must be made regarding the RO's key parameters. In particular, nonlinear parameters govern how well the model reproduces key ENSO asymmetries-El Ni\~no events tend to be stronger but shorter-lived, often transitioning into La Ni\~na, whereas La Ni\~na events are typically weaker but more persistent, sometimes lasting into a second year or beyond. While amplitude asymmetry has been widely studied within the RO framework, duration and transition asymmetries have received little attention, and their underlying causes remain debated. In this study, by systematically exploring the RO parameter space-rather than relying on commonly used fitting methods-we identify optimal parameter values that successfully capture key linear and nonlinear ENSO characteristics. An analytical expression for the temperature-heat content anomaly slope shows that the choice of heat content variable inherently reflects the sign of the Bjerknes feedback and the ocean adjustment timescale. We further show that self-sustained oscillations fail to reproduce the observed Nino 3 and 3.4 kurtosis. Finally, we demonstrate that incorporating red noise forcing distorts the RO simulated power spectrum and add unnecessary complexity. The most realistic yet simplest RO configuration is a strongly damped oscillator, with a decay timescale shorter than the dominant period, forced by multiplicative white noise and influenced by relatively weak deterministic nonlinearities. Identifying these minimal components preserves the conceptual clarity of the RO framework and isolates the core physical processes underlying ENSO behavior.</description>

      <title>Fusion of multi-source precipitation records via coordinate-based generative model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.11698</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.11698v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Precipitation remains one of the most challenging climate variables to observe and predict accurately. Existing datasets face intricate trade-offs: gauge observations are relatively trustworthy but sparse, satellites provide global coverage with retrieval uncertainties, and numerical models offer physical consistency but are biased and computationally intensive. Here we introduce PRIMER (Precipitation Record Infinite MERging), a deep generative framework that fuses these complementary sources to produce accurate, high-resolution, full-coverage precipitation estimates. PRIMER employs a coordinate-based diffusion model that learns from arbitrary spatial locations and associated precipitation values, enabling seamless integration of gridded data and irregular gauge observations. Through two-stage training--first learning large-scale patterns, then refining with accurate gauge measurements--PRIMER captures both large-scale climatology and local precision. Once trained, it can downscale forecasts, interpolate sparse observations, and correct systematic biases within a principled Bayesian framework. Using gauge observations as ground truth, PRIMER effectively corrects biases in existing datasets, yielding statistically significant error reductions at most stations and furthermore enhancing the spatial coherence of precipitation fields. Crucially, it generalizes without retraining, correcting biases in operational forecasts it has never seen. This demonstrates how generative AI can transform Earth system science by combining imperfect data, providing a scalable solution for global precipitation monitoring and prediction.</description>

      <title>A unified neural background-error covariance model for midlatitude and tropical atmospheric data assimilation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.11968</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.11968v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Estimating background-error covariances remains a core challenge in variational data assimilation (DA). Operational systems typically approximate these covariances by transformations that separate geostrophically balanced components from unbalanced inertio-gravity modes - an approach well-suited for the midlatitudes but less applicable in the tropics, where different physical balances prevail. This study estimates background-error covariances in a reduced-dimension latent space learned by a neural-network autoencoder (AE). The AE was trained using 40 years of ERA5 reanalysis data, enabling it to capture flow-dependent atmospheric balances from a diverse set of weather states.
  We demonstrate that performing DA in the latent space yields analysis increments that preserve multivariate horizontal and vertical physical balances in both tropical and midlatitude atmosphere. Assimilating a single 500 hPa geopotential height observation in the midlatitudes produces increments consistent with geostrophic and thermal wind balance, while assimilating a total column water vapor observation with a positive departure in the nearly-saturated tropical atmosphere generates an increment resembling the tropical response to (latent) heat-induced perturbations. The resulting increments are localized and flow-dependent, and shaped by orography and land-sea contrasts. Forecasts initialized from these analyses exhibit realistic weather evolution, including the excitation of an eastward-propagating Kelvin wave in the tropics.
  Finally, we explore the transition from using synthetic ensembles and a climatology-based background error covariance matrix to an operational ensemble of data assimilations. Despite significant compression-induced variance loss in some variables, latent-space assimilation produces balanced, flow-dependent increments - highlighting its potential for ensemble-based latent-space 4D-Var.</description>

      <title>Using gridpoint relaxation for forecast error diagnostics in neural weather models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.11987</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.11987v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Deep-learning (DL) weather prediction models offer notable advantages over traditional physics-based models, including auto-differentiability and low computational cost, enabling detailed diagnostics of forecast errors. Using our convolutional encoder-decoder model, ConvCastNet, we systematically relax selected subdomains of the forecast fields towards "true" weather states (ERA5 analyses) and monitor the forecast skill gain in other regions. Our results show that an 8-day midlatitude forecast improves substantially when the stratosphere and boundary layer are relaxed, while relaxation of the tropical atmosphere has negligible effect. This highlights the importance of accurately representing the stratosphere and the planetary boundary layer for medium-range weather prediction. Additionally, we investigate the relationship between model error sensitivity to initial conditions with relaxation experiments. By utilising auto-differentiability, we analyse saliency maps, i.e. the gradients of the forecast errors with respect to input fields, to identify overlapping regions of large error sensitivity and high impact of relaxation to truth. This combined approach provides valuable heuristics for diagnosing neural model errors and guiding targeted model improvements.</description>

      <title>Machine Learning-based Denoising of Surface Solar Irradiance simulated with Monte Carlo Ray Tracing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.06574</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.06574v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Simulating radiative transfer in the atmosphere with Monte Carlo ray tracing provides realistic surface irradiance in cloud-resolving models. However, Monte Carlo methods are computationally expensive because large sampling budgets are required to obtain sufficient convergence. Here, we explore the use of machine learning for denoising direct and diffuse surface solar irradiance fields. We use Monte Carlo ray tracing to compute pairs of noisy and well-converged surface irradiance fields for an ensemble of cumulus cloud fields and solar angles, and train a denoising autoencoder to predict the well-converged irradiance fields from the noisy input. We demonstrate that denoising diffuse irradiance from 1 sample per pixel (per spectral quadrature point) is an order of magnitude faster and twice as accurate as ray tracing with 128 samples per pixel, illustrating the advantage of denoising over larger sampling budgets. Denoising of direct irradiance is effective in sunlit areas, while errors persist on the edges of cloud shadows. For diffuse irradiance, providing additional atmospheric information such as liquid water paths and solar angles to train the denoising algorithm reduces errors by approximately a factor of two. Our results open up possibilities for coupled Monte Carlo ray tracing with computational costs approaching those of two-stream-based radiative transfer solvers, although future work is needed to improve generalization across resolutions and cloud types.</description>
