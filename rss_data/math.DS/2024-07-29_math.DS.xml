      <title>Li-Yorke Chaotic Weighted Composition Operators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.19091</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.19091v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We establish complete characterizations of the notion of Li-Yorke chaos for weighted composition operators on $C_0(X)$ spaces and on $L^p(\mu)$ spaces. As a consequence, we obtain simple characterizations of the Li-Yorke chaotic weighted shifts on $c_0$ and on $\ell^p$ ($1 \leq p &lt; \infty$) that complement previously known results. We also investigate the notion of Li-Yorke chaos for weighted shifts on Fr\'echet sequence spaces. As applications, we obtain characterizations of the Li-Yorke chaotic weighted shifts on K\"othe sequence spaces depending only on the entries of the K\"othe matrix and the weights of the shift.</description>

      <title>Nonlinear spectral analysis extracts harmonics from land-atmosphere fluxes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.19237</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.19237v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Understanding the dynamics of the land-atmosphere exchange of CO$_2$ is key to advance our predictive capacities of the coupled climate-carbon feedback system.
  In essence, the net vegetation flux is the difference of the uptake of CO$_2$ via photosynthesis and the release of CO$_2$ via respiration, while the system is driven by periodic processes at different time-scales.
  The complexity of the underlying dynamics poses challenges to classical decomposition methods focused on maximizing data variance, such as singular spectrum analysis.
  Here, we explore whether nonlinear data-driven methods can better separate periodic patterns and their harmonics from noise and stochastic variability.
  We find that Nonlinear Laplacian Spectral Analysis (NLSA) outperforms the linear method and detects multiple relevant harmonics. However, these harmonics are not detected in the presence of substantial measurement irregularities.
  In summary, the NLSA approach can be used to both extract the seasonal cycle more accurately than linear methods, but likewise detect irregular signals resulting from irregular land-atmosphere interactions or measurement failures. Improving the detection capabilities of time-series decomposition is essential for improving land-atmosphere interactions models that should operate accurately on any time scale.</description>

Abstract: This article explores the topology of Pseudo-B\"ottcher totally invariant connected components of the wandering set in dynamical systems generated by on-invertible inner (open surjective isolated) mappings of compact surfaces. We describe the possible topological types of these invariant connected subsets, which are more diverse then corresponding components of homeomorphisms.</description>

      <title>An inverse of Furstenberg's correspondence principle and applications to nice recurrence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.19444</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.19444v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We prove an inverse of Furstenberg's correspondence principle stating that for all measure preserving systems $(X,\mu,T)$ and $A\subset X$ measurable there exists a set $E \subset \mathbb{N}$ such that \[ \mu\left( \bigcap_{i=1}^k T^{-n_i}A\right) = \lim_{N\to \infty} \frac{\left|\left( \bigcap_{i=1}^k (E-n_i) \right)\cap \{0,\dots,N-1\}\right|}{N}\] for all $k,n_1,\dots,n_k \in \mathbb{N}$. As a corollary we show that a set $R\subset \mathbb{N}$ is a set of nice recurrence if and only if it is nicely intersective. Together, the inverse of Furstenberg's correspondence principle and it's corollary partially answer two questions of Moreira.</description>

      <title>On the boundary of an immediate attracting basin of a hyperbolic entire function</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.19963</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.19963v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $f$ be a transcendental entire function of finite order which has an attracting periodic point $z_0$ of period at least $2$. Suppose that the set of singularities of the inverse of $f$ is finite and contained in the component $U$ of the Fatou set that contains $z_0$. Under an additional hypothesis we show that the intersection of $\partial U$ with the escaping set of $f$ has Hausdorff dimension $1$. The additional hypothesis is satisfied for example if $f$ has the form $f(z)=\int_0^z p(t)e^{q(t)}dt+c$ with polynomials $p$ and $q$ and a constant $c$. This generalizes a result of Bara\'nski, Karpi\'nska and Zdunik dealing with the case $f(z)=\lambda e^z$.</description>

      <title>If a Minkowski billiard is projective, it is the standard billiard</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.20159</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.20159v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the recent paper arXiv:2405.13258, the first author of this note proved that if a billiard in a convex domain in $\mathbb{R}^n$ is simultaneously projective and Minkowski, then it is the standard Euclidean billiard in an appropriate Euclidean structure. The proof was quite complicated and required high smoothness. Here we present a direct simple proof of this result which works in $C^1$-smoothness. In addition we prove the semi-local and local versions of the result</description>

      <title>Dynamical localization for random scattering zippers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.19158</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.19158v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This article establishes a proof of dynamical localization for a random scattering zipper model. The scattering zipper operator is the product of two unitary by blocks operators, multiplicatively perturbed on the left and right by random unitary phases. One of the operator is shifted so that this configuration produces a random 5-diagonal unitary operator per blocks. To prove the dynamical localization for this operator, we use the method of fractional moments. We first prove the continuity and strict positivity of the Lyapunov exponents in an annulus around the unit circle, which leads to the exponential decay of a power of the norm of the products of transfer matrices. We then establish an explicit formulation of the coefficients of the finite resolvent from the coefficients of the transfer matrices using Schur's complement. From this we deduce, through two reduction results, the exponential decay of the resolvent, from which we get the dynamical localization after proving that it also implies the exponential decay of moments of order $2$ of the resolvent.</description>

      <title>Computational symplectic topology and symmetric orbits in the restricted three-body problem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.19159</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.19159v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper we propose a computational approach to proving the Birkhoff conjecture on the restricted three-body problem, which asserts the existence of a disk-like global surface of section. Birkhoff had conjectured this surface of section as a tool to prove existence of a direct periodic orbit. Using techniques from validated numerics we prove the existence of an approximately circular direct orbit for a wide range of mass parameters and Jacobi energies. We also provide methods to rigorously compute the Conley-Zehnder index of periodic Hamiltonian orbits using computational tools, thus giving some initial steps for developing computational Floer homology and providing the means to prove the Birkhoff conjecture via symplectic topology. We apply this method to various symmetric orbits in the restricted three-body problem.</description>

      <title>Decomposing heterogeneous dynamical systems with graph neural networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.19160</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.19160v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Natural physical, chemical, and biological dynamical systems are often complex, with heterogeneous components interacting in diverse ways. We show that graph neural networks can be designed to jointly learn the interaction rules and the structure of the heterogeneity from data alone. The learned latent structure and dynamics can be used to virtually decompose the complex system which is necessary to parameterize and infer the underlying governing equations. We tested the approach with simulation experiments of moving particles and vector fields that interact with each other. While our current aim is to better understand and validate the approach with simulated data, we anticipate it to become a generally applicable tool to uncover the governing rules underlying complex dynamics observed in nature.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.19312v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we study high-dimensional nonlinear quantum harmonic oscillator equation. We show the equation admits many time quasi-periodic solutions by establishing an abstract infinite dimensional KAM theorem with multiple normal frequencies. The proof is based on the classical KAM scheme, and the key is a decaying structure of Hessian matrices of Hamiltonian functions.</description>

      <title>Convergence of Random Batch Method with replacement for interacting particle systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.19315</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.19315v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Random Batch Method (RBM) proposed in [Jin et al. J Comput Phys, 2020] is an efficient algorithm for simulating interacting particle systems. In this paper, we investigate the Random Batch Method with replacement (RBM-r), which is the same as the kinetic Monte Carlo (KMC) method for the pairwise interacting particle system of size $N$. In the RBM-r algorithm, one randomly picks a small batch of size $p \ll N$, and only the particles in the picked batch interact among each other within the batch for a short time, where the weak interaction (of strength $\frac{1}{N-1}$) in the original system is replaced by a strong interaction (of strength $\frac{1}{p-1}$). Then one repeats this pick-interact process. This KMC algorithm dramatically reduces the computational cost from $O(N^2)$ to $O(pN)$ per time step, and provides an unbiased approximation of the original force/velocity field of the interacting particle system. In this paper, We give a rigorous proof of this approximation with an explicit convergence rate. An improved rate is also obtained when there is no diffusion in the system. Notably, the techniques in our analysis can potentially be applied to study KMC for other systems, including the stochastic Ising spin system.</description>

Abstract: This paper is devoted to the theoretical and numerical analysis of the null controllability of a coupled ODE-heat system internally and at the boundary with Neumann boundary control. First, we establish the null controllability of the ODE-heat with distributed control using Carleman estimates. Then, we conclude by the strategy of space domain extension. Finally, we illustrate the analysis with some numerical experiments.</description>

      <title>Data-driven Discovery of Delay Differential Equations with Discrete Delays</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.19640</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.19640v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Sparse Identification of Nonlinear Dynamics (SINDy) framework is a robust method for identifying governing equations, successfully applied to ordinary, partial, and stochastic differential equations. In this work we extend SINDy to identify delay differential equations by using an augmented library that includes delayed samples and Bayesian optimization. To identify a possibly unknown delay we minimize the reconstruction error over a set of candidates. The resulting methodology improves the overall performance by remarkably reducing the number of calls to SINDy with respect to a brute force approach. We also address a multivariate setting to identify multiple unknown delays and (non-multiplicative) parameters. Several numerical tests on delay differential equations with different long-term behavior, number of variables, delays, and parameters support the use of Bayesian optimization highlighting both the efficacy of the proposed methodology and its computational advantages. As a consequence, the class of discoverable models is significantly expanded.</description>

Abstract: In a recent work [Manucci, Unger, ArXiv e-print 2404.10511, 2024], the authors propose using two generalized Lyapunov equations (GLEs) to derive a balancing-based model order reduction~(MOR) method for a general class of switched differential-algebraic equations (DAEs). This work explains why these GLEs provide solutions suitable for MOR by showing that the image set of the solutions of the two GLEs always encloses the reachable and observable set of a suitably defined switched system with the same input to output map of the switched DAE system.</description>

      <title>Characterizing Dynamical Stability of Stochastic Gradient Descent in Overparameterized Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.20209</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.20209v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: For overparameterized optimization tasks, such as the ones found in modern machine learning, global minima are generally not unique. In order to understand generalization in these settings, it is vital to study to which minimum an optimization algorithm converges. The possibility of having minima that are unstable under the dynamics imposed by the optimization algorithm limits the potential minima that the algorithm can find. In this paper, we characterize the global minima that are dynamically stable/unstable for both deterministic and stochastic gradient descent (SGD). In particular, we introduce a characteristic Lyapunov exponent which depends on the local dynamics around a global minimum and rigorously prove that the sign of this Lyapunov exponent determines whether SGD can accumulate at the respective global minimum.</description>

      <title>A consensus-based algorithm for non-convex multiplayer games</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.08270</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.08270v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we present a novel consensus-based zeroth-order algorithm tailored for non-convex multiplayer games. The proposed method leverages a metaheuristic approach using concepts from swarm intelligence to reliably identify global Nash equilibria. We utilize a group of interacting particles, each agreeing on a specific consensus point, asymptotically converging to the corresponding optimal strategy. This paradigm permits a passage to the mean-field limit, allowing us to establish convergence guarantees under appropriate assumptions regarding initialization and objective functions. Finally, we conduct a series of numerical experiments to unveil the dependency of the proposed method on its parameters and apply it to solve a nonlinear Cournot oligopoly game involving multiple goods.</description>

      <title>On the Myrberg Limit Sets and Bowen-Margulis-Sullivan Measures for Visibility Manifolds without Conjugate Points</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.00910</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.00910v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we clarify the strong relationship between Myrberg type dynamics and the ergodic properties of the geodesic flows on (not necessarily compact) uniform visibility manifolds without conjugate points. We prove that the positivity of the Patterson-Sullivan measure of the Myrberg limit set is equivalent to the conservativity of the geodesic flow with respect to the Bowen-Margulis-Sullivan measure. Moreover we show that the Myrberg limit set is a full Patterson-Sullivan measure subset of the conical limit set. These results extend the classical works of P. Tukia and B. Stratmann from hyperbolic manifolds to the manifolds without conjugate points.</description>

      <title>Bounded-Confidence Models of Opinion Dynamics with Adaptive Confidence Bounds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.07563</link>
      <description>arXiv:2303.07563v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: People's opinions change with time as they interact with each other. In a bounded-confidence model (BCM) of opinion dynamics, individuals (which are represented by the nodes of a network) have continuous-valued opinions and are influenced by neighboring nodes whose opinions are sufficiently similar to theirs (i.e., are within a confidence bound). In this paper, we formulate and analyze discrete-time BCMs with heterogeneous and adaptive confidence bounds. We introduce two new models: (1) a BCM with synchronous opinion updates that generalizes the Hegselmann--Krause (HK) model and (2) a BCM with asynchronous opinion updates that generalizes the Deffuant--Weisbuch (DW) model. We analytically and numerically explore our adaptive BCMs' limiting behaviors, including the confidence-bound dynamics, the formation of clusters of nodes with similar opinions, and the time evolution of an "effective graph", which is a time-dependent subgraph of a network with edges between nodes that {are currently receptive to each other.} For a variety of networks and a wide range of values of the parameters that control the increase and decrease of confidence bounds, we demonstrate numerically that our adaptive BCMs result in fewer major opinion clusters and longer convergence times than the baseline (i.e., nonadaptive) BCMs. We also show that our adaptive BCMs can have adjacent nodes that converge to the same opinion but are not {receptive to each other.} This qualitative behavior does not occur in the associated baseline BCMs.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2308.14136v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We prove that the existence of one horosphere in the universal cover of a closed, strictly quarter pinched, negatively curved Riemannian manifold of dimension $n\geq 3$ on which the stable holonomy along minimizing geodesics coincide with the Riemannian parallel transport, implies that the manifold is homothetic to a real hyperbolic manifold.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2311.15559v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Let $f\colon X\to Y$ be a surjective morphism of Fano manifolds of Picard number 1 whose VMRTs at a general point are not dual defective. Suppose that the tangent bundle $T_X$ is big. We show that $f$ is an isomorphism unless $Y$ is a projective space. As applications, we study the bigness of the tangent bundles of complete intersections, del Pezzo manifolds, and Mukai manifolds, as well as their dynamical rigidity.</description>

      <title>Importance sampling for rare event tracking within the ensemble Kalman filtering framework</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.12793</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.12793v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this work we employ importance sampling (IS) techniques to track a small over-threshold probability of a running maximum associated with the solution of a stochastic differential equation (SDE) within the framework of ensemble Kalman filtering (EnKF). Between two observation times of the EnKF, we propose to use IS with respect to the initial condition of the SDE, IS with respect to the Wiener process via a stochastic optimal control formulation, and combined IS with respect to both initial condition and Wiener process. Both IS strategies require the approximation of the solution of Kolmogorov Backward equation (KBE) with boundary conditions. In multidimensional settings, we employ a Markovian projection dimension reduction technique to obtain an approximation of the solution of the KBE by just solving a one dimensional PDE. The proposed ideas are tested on three illustrative examples: Double Well SDE, Langevin dynamics and noisy Charney-deVore model, and showcase a significant variance reduction compared to the standard Monte Carlo method and another sampling-based IS technique, namely, multilevel cross entropy.</description>

      <title>Remarks on discrete subgroups with full limit sets in higher rank Lie groups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.10209</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.10209v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We show that real semi-simple Lie groups of higher rank contain (infinitely generated) discrete subgroups with full limit sets in the corresponding Furstenberg boundaries. Additionally, we provide criteria under which discrete subgroups of $G = \operatorname{SL}(3,\mathbb{R})$ must have a full limit set in the Furstenberg boundary of $G$.
  In the appendix, we show the the existence of Zariski-dense discrete subgroups $\Gamma$ of $\operatorname{SL}(n,\mathbb{R})$, where $n\ge 3$, such that the Jordan projection of some loxodromic element $\gamma \in\Gamma$ lies on the boundary of the limit cone of $\Gamma$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.04850v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper is focused on the modified Zakharov-Kusnetsov equation. We prove the associated Cauchy problem is locally (in time) well-posed in $H^s(\R \times \T)$ for $s &gt;1$. The new ingredient in this work is a trilinear estimate in the context of Bourgain spaces which controls the cubic non-linearity of the modified Zakharov-Kuznetsov equation in the contraction argument.</description>

      <title>Locally measure preserving property of bi-Lipschitz maps between Moran sets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.10161</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.10161v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In literature it is shown that bi-Lipschitz maps between self-similar sets or self-affine sets enjoy a locally measure preserving property, namely, if $f:(E,\mu)\to (F,\nu)$ is a bi-Lipschitz map, then the Radon-Nykodym derivative $df^*\nu/d\mu$ is a constant function on a subset $E'\subset E$ with $\mu(E')&gt;0$, where $f^*\nu(\cdot)=\nu(f(\cdot))$. Indeed, this measure preserving property plays an important role in Lipschitz classification of fractal sets. In this paper, we show that such measure preserving property also holds for bi-Lipschitz maps between two Moran sets in a certain class.</description>
