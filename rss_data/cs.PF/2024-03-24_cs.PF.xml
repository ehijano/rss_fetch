      <title>CASPER: Carbon-Aware Scheduling and Provisioning for Distributed Web Services</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.14792</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.14792v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: There has been a significant societal push towards sustainable practices, including in computing. Modern interactive workloads such as geo-distributed web-services exhibit various spatiotemporal and performance flexibility, enabling the possibility to adapt the location, time, and intensity of processing to align with the availability of renewable and low-carbon energy. An example is a web application hosted across multiple cloud regions, each with varying carbon intensity based on their local electricity mix. Distributed load-balancing enables the exploitation of low-carbon energy through load migration across regions, reducing web applications carbon footprint. In this paper, we present CASPER, a carbon-aware scheduling and provisioning system that primarily minimizes the carbon footprint of distributed web services while also respecting their Service Level Objectives (SLO). We formulate CASPER as an multi-objective optimization problem that considers both the variable carbon intensity and latency constraints of the network. Our evaluation reveals the significant potential of CASPER in achieving substantial reductions in carbon emissions. Compared to baseline methods, CASPER demonstrates improvements of up to 70% with no latency performance degradation.</description>

      <title>iSpLib: A Library for Accelerating Graph Neural Networks using Auto-tuned Sparse Operations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.14853</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.14853v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Core computations in Graph Neural Network (GNN) training and inference are often mapped to sparse matrix operations such as sparse-dense matrix multiplication (SpMM). These sparse operations are harder to optimize by manual tuning because their performance depends significantly on the sparsity of input graphs, GNN models, and computing platforms. To address this challenge, we present iSpLib, a PyTorch-based C++ library equipped with auto-tuned sparse operations. iSpLib expedites GNN training with a cache-enabled backpropagation that stores intermediate matrices in local caches. The library offers a user-friendly Python plug-in that allows users to take advantage of our optimized PyTorch operations out-of-the-box for any existing linear algebra-based PyTorch implementation of popular GNNs (Graph Convolution Network, GraphSAGE, Graph Inference Network, etc.) with only two lines of additional code. We demonstrate that iSpLib obtains up to 27x overall training speedup compared to the equivalent PyTorch 2.1.0 and PyTorch Geometric 2.4.0 implementations on the CPU. Our library is publicly available at https://github.com/HipGraph/iSpLib (https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.10806511).</description>

      <title>Network Calculus Characterization of Congestion Control for Time-Varying Traffic</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.15303</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.15303v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Models for the dynamics of congestion control generally involve systems of coupled differential equations. Universally, these models assume that traffic sources saturate the maximum transmissions allowed by the congestion control method. This is not suitable for studying congestion control of intermittent but bursty traffic sources. In this paper, we present a characterization of congestion control for arbitrary time-varying traffic that applies to rate-based as well as window-based congestion control. We leverage the capability of network calculus to precisely describe the input-output relationship at network elements for arbitrary source traffic. We show that our characterization can closely track the dynamics of even complex congestion control algorithms.</description>
