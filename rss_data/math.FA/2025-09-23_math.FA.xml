      <title>Approximation properties of operator coorbit spaces and sparsity classes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.16440</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.16440v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Extensions of coorbit spaces for functions to operators have been introduced by two different groups in \cite{doelumcskr24} and \cite{k\"obaLOC25}, where one is based on the coorbit theory of Feichtinger-Gr\"ochening while the other is based on the theory of localized frames. We show that for certain Gabor g-frames the co-orbit spaces in \cite{k\"obaLOC25} conincide with the ones in \cite{doelumcskr24} and we refer to this class of operators as operator coorbit spaces. Based on the description of operator coorbit spaces in terms of Gabor g-frames we provide operator dictionaries for these spaces that allow us to define sparsity classes in this setting. We establish that these sparsity classes also coincide with the operator coorbit spaces, which holds, in particular for all Feichtinger operators, a nice class of mixed states. Numerical examples confirm the expected approximation quality by few terms for appropriately chosen operators.</description>

      <title>On quantum Sobolev spaces consisting of Hilbert-Schmidt operators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.16575</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.16575v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the present paper, we study quantum Sobolev spaces whose elements are operators of the Hilbert-Schmidt class. We construct these Sobolev spaces from the Fourier transform for operators. Next, we obtain continuous embedding theorems. Finally, we delve into solving partial differential equations where the unknown is an operator. The results have potential applications in quantum physics, providing a new theoretical basis for relevant research.</description>

      <title>Weighted inversion of vector valued Dirichlet series</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.16658</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.16658v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $\Lambda\subset[0,\infty)$ be an additive semigroup with $0\in\Lambda$, $\omega$ be an admissible weight on $\Lambda$, $\mathcal A$ be a unital Banach algebra, and let $f(s)=\sum_{\lambda\in\Lambda} f_\lambda e^{-\lambda s}$ for $s\in\mathcal{H}=\{j+it\in\mathbb{C}:j\geq0\}$ be a generalized Dirichlet series satisfying $\|f\|_\omega=\sum_{\lambda\in\Lambda}\|f_\lambda\|\omega(\lambda)&lt;\infty,$ where $f_\lambda\in\mathcal{A}$ for all $\lambda\in\Lambda$. We take $\mathcal{A}$ to be a commutative complex Banach algebra (with $\Lambda=\log\mathbb{N}$) and $M_d(\mathcal{X})$ - the Banach algebra of $d \times d$ matrices having entries from $\mathcal{X}$, where $\mathcal{X}$ is either the complex plane or the real algebra of bicomplex numbers or quaternions, and show that $f$ is invertible if and only if the closure of the image of $f$ is contained in the set of all invertible elements of $\mathcal{A}$.</description>

      <title>Canonical integral operators on the Fock space II</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.16672</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.16672v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In \cite{DZ3} we introduced and studied a two-parameter family of integral operators $T^{(s,t)}$ on the Fock space $F^2$ of the complex plane. Under the inverse Bargmann transform, these operators include the classical {\it linear canonical transforms} in mathematical physics as special cases, so we called $T^{(s,t)}$ {\it canonical linear operators} on the Fock space. In this paper we continue the study of these operators. We show that when a canonical linear operator $T^{(s,t)}$ is compact, it actually belongs to the Schatten class $S_p$ for all $p&gt;0$. In this case, we find all singular values, determine the $S_p$ norm, and obtain a trace formula for $T^{(s,t)}$. We also show that the boundedness (and a natural version of compactness) of $T^{(s,t)}$ on $F^p$ for any given $p\in(0,\infty]$ is equivalent to the boundedness (and compactness) of $T^{(s,t)}$ on $F^2$. Our analysis is based on estimates and computations with the integral kernel of $T^{(s,t)}$, which also yield some interesting results about the Berezin transform and the bivariate Berezin transform of $T^{(s,t)}$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2509.16807v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: It is shown in this note that one can decide whether an $n$-dimensional subspace of $\ell_\infty^N$ is isometrically isomorphic to $\ell_\infty^n$ by testing a finite number of determinental inequalities. As a byproduct, an elementary proof is provided for the fact that an $n$-dimensional subspace of $\ell_\infty^N$ with projection constant equal to one must be isometrically isomorphic to $\ell_\infty^n$.</description>

      <title>Isometric and Quasi-isometric weighted composition operators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.16969</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.16969v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper we characterize $m$-isometric and quasi-$m$-isometric weighted composition operators on the Hilbert space $L^2(\mu)$. Also, we find that normal-$m$-isometry and normal quasi-$m$-isometry weighted composition operators have finite spectrum. Consequently we have the results for composition and multiplication operators. In addition, we prove that for $m\geq 2$, a multiplication operator is $m$-isometry (quasi-$m$-isometry) if and only if it is $2$-isometry (quasi-$2$-isometry). Some examples are provided to illustrate our results.</description>

      <title>On the Semicontinuity of Functionals on Function Spaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.17426</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.17426v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Results on the upper and lower semicontinuity of functionals defined on spaces of convex and more general functions are established. In particular, the following result is obtained. Let $\phi(v; \cdot)$ be the density of the absolutely continuous part of a Radon measure $\Phi(v; \cdot)$ associated to a function $v\colon X\rightarrow \mathbb{R}$ defined on the measure space $(X,\lambda)$. For concave $\zeta\colon [0, \infty)\rightarrow[0,\infty)$ with $\lim_{t\to 0} \zeta(t)=0$ and $\lim_{t\to\infty}\zeta(t)/t= 0$, it is shown that the functional $v\mapsto\int_{X} \zeta(\phi(v;x))\,\mathrm{d}\lambda(x)$ depends upper semicontinuously on $v$. Examples include so-called functional affine surface areas for convex functions.</description>

      <title>Maximal Noncompactness of Wiener-Hopf Operators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.17451</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.17451v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $X(\mathbb{R})$ be a separable translation-invariant Banach function space and $a$ be a Fourier multiplier on $X(\mathbb{R})$. We prove that the Wiener-Hopf operator $W(a)$ with symbol $a$ is maximally noncompact on the space $X(\mathbb{R}_+)$, that is, its Hausdorff measure of noncompactness, its essential norm and its norm are all equal. This equality for the Hausdorff measure of noncompactness of $W(a)$ is new even in the case of $X(\mathbb{R})=L^p(\mathbb{R})$ with $1\le p&lt;\infty$.</description>

      <title>A refined variant of Hartley convolution: Algebraic structures and related issues</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.17529</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.17529v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, we propose a novel convolution product associated with the $\mathscr{H}$-transform, denoted by $\underset{\mathscr{H}}{\ast}$, and explore its fundamental properties. Here, the $\mathscr{H}$-transform may be regarded as a refined variant of the classical Fourier, Hartley transform, with kernel function depending on two parameters $a,b$. Our first contribution shows that the space of integrable functions, equipped with multiplication given by the $\underset{\mathscr{H}}{\ast}$-convolution, constitutes the commutative Banach algebra over the complex field, albeit without an identity element. Second, we prove the Wiener--L\'evy invertibility criterion for the $\mathscr H$-algebra and formulate Gelfand's spectral radius theorem. Third, we obtain a sharp form of Young's inequality for the $\underset{\mathscr{H}}{\ast}$-convolution and its direct corollary. Finally, all of these theoretical findings are applied to investigate specific classes of the Fredholm integral equations and heat source problems, yielding a priori estimates under the established assumptions.</description>

      <title>Entrywise preservers of sign regularity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.17902</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.17902v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Entrywise functions preserving positivity and related notions have a rich history, beginning with the seminal works of Schur, P\'olya-Szeg\H{o}, Schoenberg, and Rudin. Following their classical results, it is well-known that entrywise functions preserving positive semidefiniteness for matrices of all dimensions must be real analytic with non-negative Taylor coefficients. These works were taken forward in the last decade by Belton, Guillot, Khare, Putinar, and Rajaratnam. Recently, Belton-Guillot-Khare-Putinar [J. d'Analyse Math. 2023] classified all functions that entrywise preserve totally positive (TP) and totally non-negative (TN) matrices. In this paper, we study entrywise preservers of strictly sign regular and sign regular matrices - a class that includes TP/TN matrices as special cases and was first studied by Schoenberg in 1930 to characterize variation diminution. Our main results provide complete characterizations of entrywise transforms of rectangular matrices which preserve: (i)~sign regularity and strict sign regularity, as well as (ii)~sign regularity and strict sign regularity with a given sign pattern.</description>

Abstract: We provide some Abelian and Tauberian results characterizing the quasiasymptotic behavior of Lizorkin distributions in terms of their Stockwell transform. We prove the continuity of the fractional wavelet transform and the corresponding synthesis operator on the Schwartz spaces and their duals, respectively. Additionally, we establish a connection between fractional Stockwell and fractional wavelet transforms and provide some asymptotic results for the distributional fractional wavelet transform.</description>

      <title>Kuramoto Mean Field Game with Intrinsic Frequencies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.18000</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.18000v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper studies a mean field game formulation of the classical Kuramoto model for synchronization. Our model captures the diversity within the population by considering random intrinsic frequencies, which allows us to study the impact of this heterogeneity on synchronization patterns and stability. Our findings contribute insights into the interplay between intrinsic frequency diversity and synchronization dynamics, offering a more realistic understanding of complex systems. The proposed framework has broad applications ranging from coupled oscillators in physics to social dynamics, and serves as a valuable tool for studying networks with distributed intrinsic frequencies.</description>

      <title>Matricial ranges, dilations, and unital contractive maps</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.18027</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.18027v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $J_n$ be the Jordan block of size $n$ with all eigen values zero. Arveson introduced the notion of the matricial range of an operator in his remarkable article called Subalgebras of $C^*$-algebras II (Acta Math, 128, 1972) and established that every unital positive map on the operator system generated by $J_2$ is completely positive. This describes the matricial range of $J_2$ as the set of all matrices with numerical radius at most $\frac{1}{2}$. Later, Choi and Li generalize this result of Arveson and prove that every unital positive map on the operator system generated by any $2\times 2$ matrix or any $3\times3$ matrix with a reducing subspace is completely positive. After fifty years of the above result of Arveson, the matricial range of $J_n$ for $n\geq 3$ has not been characterized. This article aims to investigate this long-standing open problem for $n=3$. We begin by establishing a structure theorem for a dilation of an operator $B$ satisfying $BB^*+B^*B=I$ and then investigate whether every $B\in\mathbb{M}_n$ satisfying $BB^*+B^*B\leq I_n$ admits a dilation $\widetilde{B}$ for which $\widetilde{B}\widetilde{B}^*+\widetilde{B}^*\widetilde{B}=I$. This study plays the central role to the development of this paper. We use this to prove that every unital contractive map on the operator system generated by $J_3$ is $2$-positive and obtain some partial results towards characterizing the matricial range of $J_3$. Next, we study unital contractive maps on operator systems generated by $4\times 4$ normal matrices, and show that this is equivalent to studying a unital contractive map on the operator system generated by $T=\text{diag}(\lambda,-1,i,-i)$, where $\Re{(\lambda)}\geq 0$. We prove that every unital contractive map on the operator system generated by $T=\text{diag}(1,-1,i,-i)$ is completely positive.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2509.16386v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Given a manifold $\mathcal{M} \subset \mathbb{R}^n$, we consider all subsets of $\mathcal{M}$ that satisfy the generalized Stokes' theorem and show that $\partial\mathcal{M}$ maximizes the associated information theoretic entropy functional. This provides an information theoretic characterization of the duality expressed by Stokes' theorem, whereby the boundary of a manifold is the `least informative' subset of the manifold satisfying the Stokes relation.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2509.16498v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, by using the concept of positive elements of $C^*$-algebras instead of the real numbers $\mathbb{R}$, a generalization of distribution functions, with a particular focus on distance distribution functions has been introduced as a novel approach in statistical mathematics. Also, by applying this concept, probabilistic metric space on $C^*$-algebras is defined and some properties such as topology and fixed point theorems have been investigated. Finally, some examples and applications to integral equations are given.</description>

      <title>Compactness and least energy solutions to the super-Liouville equation on the sphere</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.16712</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.16712v2 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this work, we study the super-Liouville equation on the sphere with positive coefficient functions. We begin by deriving estimates for the spinor component of the equation, thereby finding that the energy of the spinor part of solutions is uniformly bounded. We then analyze the compactness of the solution space in two aspects: the compactness for solutions with small energy and the compactness with respect to the conformal transformation group of the sphere. Finally, by introducing a new natural constraint, the Nehari manifold, and employing variational methods, we obtain the existence of the least energy solutions when the coefficient functions are even.</description>

      <title>Boundary Feller-Dynkin processes associated with Laguerre processes and Pickrell diffusions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.17045</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.17045v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we construct a Feller-Dynkin boundary process by applying the method of intertwiners to the coherent family, introduced in our previous work, of Laguerre processes with a fixed parameter. The corresponding boundary process is computed explicitly, and it turns out to be a deterministic dynamical system. Since the Pickrell diffusions that leave the Pickrell measure invariant are coherent with respect to the same projective system, we also obtain the stochastic boundary process associated with the coherent family of Pickrell diffusions.</description>

      <title>Commutativity of operator algebras</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.17673</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.17673v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We call an operator algebra A reversible if A with reversed multiplication is also an abstract operator algebra (in the modern operator space sense). This class of operator algebras is intimately related to the symmetric operator algebras: the subalgebras of B(H) on which the transpose map is a complete isometry. In previous work we studied the unital case, where reversibility is equivalent to commutativity. We give many sufficient conditions under which a nonunital reversible or symmetric operator algebra is commutative. We also give many complementary results of independent interest, and solve a few open questions from previous papers. Not every reversible or symmetric operator algebra is commutative, however we show that they all are 3-commutative. That is, order does not matter in the product of three or more elements from A. The proof of this relies on a rather technical analysis involving the injective envelope. Indeed nonunital algebras are often enormously more complicated than unital ones in regard to the topics we consider. On the positive side, our considerations raise very many questions even for low dimensional matrix algebras, some of which are of a computational nature and might be suitable for undergraduate research. The canonical anticommutation relation from mathematical physics plays a significant role.</description>

      <title>Real decomposable maps on operator systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.17708</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.17708v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We initiate and study the theory of ``real decomposable maps" between real operator systems. (Formally, this is new even in the complex case, which hitherto has restricted itself to the case where the systems are complex $C^*$-algebras.) We investigate how the definition interacts with the existing theory (which it generalizes) and with the complexification. A surprising term appears in the `Jordan decomposition' of real decomposable maps. This term constitutes a new class of completely bounded maps, a class that also showed up in disguised form in our recent study of real noncommutative (nc) convexity, and whose theory is likely to have applications in that subject. We also check the real case of many important known results related to decomposability, for example about the weak expectation property or injectivity of von Neumann algebras.</description>

      <title>On extremal points for some vectorial total variation seminorms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.12831</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.12831v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider the set of extremal points of the generalized unit ball induced by gradient total variation seminorms for vector-valued functions on bounded Euclidean domains. These are central to the understanding of sparse solutions and sparse optimization algorithms for variational problems posed among such functions. For cases in which either the domain or the target are one dimensional or the sum of the total variations of each component is used, we prove that these extremals consist of piecewise constant functions with two regions. For definitions involving more involved matrix norms and in particular spectral norms, we produce families of examples to show that the resulting set of extremal points is larger and includes piecewise constant functions with more than two regions. We also consider the total deformation induced by the symmetrized gradient, for which minimization with linear constraints appears in problems of determination of limit loads in a number of continuum mechanical models involving plasticity. For this case, we show piecewise infinitesimally rigid functions with two pieces to be extremal under mild assumptions. Finally, as an example which is not piecewise constant, we prove that unit radial vector fields are extremal for the Frobenius total variation in the plane.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2408.11132v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: For a scattered, locally compact Hausdorff space $K$, we prove that the essential norm on the Calkin algebra \break $\mathscr{B}(C_0(K))/\mathscr{K}(C_0(K))$ is a minimal algebra norm. The proof relies on establishing a quantitative factorization for the identity operator on $c_0$ through non-compact operators $T: C_0(K) \to X$, where $X$ is any Banach space that does not contain a copy of $\ell_1$ or whose dual unit ball is weak$^*$ sequentially compact. It follows that, for every ordinal $\alpha$, the algebras $\mathscr{B}(C[0,\alpha]))$ and $\mathscr{B}(C[0,\alpha]))/\mathscr{K}(C[0,\alpha]))$ have an unique algebra norm.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.21379v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We give a characterization of the operators on the injective tensor product $E \hat{\otimes}_\varepsilon X$ for any separable Banach space $E$ and any (non-separable) Banach space $X$ with few operators, in the sense that any operator $T: X \to X$ takes the form $T = \lambda I + S$ for a scalar $\lambda \in \mathbb{K}$ and an operator $S$ with separable range. This is used to give a classification of the complemented subspaces and closed operator ideals of spaces of the form $C_0(\omega \times K_\mathcal{A})$, where $K_\mathcal{A}$ is a locally compact Hausdorff space induced by an almost disjoint family $\mathcal{A}$ such that $C_0(K_\mathcal{A})$ has few operators.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2504.08491v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Fractal geometry deals mainly with irregularity and captures the complexity of a structure or phenomenon. In this article, we focus on the approximation of set-valued functions using modern machinery on the subject of fractal geometry. We first provide a construction of fractal functions for countable data sets and use these functions in the approximation and study of set-valued mappings. We also show the existence and uniqueness of an invariant Borel measure supported on the graph of a set-valued fractal function. In addition, we obtain some effective bounds on the dimensions of the constructed set-valued fractal functions.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2505.24425v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Bounded holomorphic interpolation problems associated to finitely many data have, in general, distinct solutions. Uniqueness arises only in some convex extreme configurations. Rational inner functions in a polydisk are the best understood examples in this sense. We analyze the continuity of global solutions as functions of the finite interpolation data in neighbourhoods of elements distinguished by this uniqueness property. Our study covers rational inner or Cayley rational inner functions in the polydisk and automorphisms of the Euclidean ball. The proof of the main superresolution result is derived from optimization theory techniques and volume estimates of sublevel sets of real polynomials, both emerging from Markov's multivariable moment problem.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2507.23750v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the relationships between a subvariety of the open unit ball in the complex $d$-dimensional space $\mathbb{C}^{d}$, the reproducing kernel Hilbert space (RKHS) obtained by restricting the Drury-Arveson space to the variety, and its multiplier algebra.
  We show that if two such RKHSs are almost isometrically isomorphic as RKHSs, their multiplier algebras are likewise almost completely isometrically isomorphic as multiplier algebras. In such cases, the underlying varieties are almost automorphically equivalent. For tractable homogeneous varieties, we further show that if the corresponding multiplier algebras are almost completely isometrically isomorphic as multiplier algebras or one variety is almost the image of the other under a unitary transformation, then the associated RKHSs are almost isometrically isomorphic as RKHSs.</description>

Abstract: By using the vector-valued theory of singular integrals, we prove a Hardy--Littlewood--Sobolev inequality on product Hardy spaces $H^p_{\rm{prod}}$, which is a parallel result of the classical Hardy--Littlewood--Sobolev inequality. The same technique shows the $H^p_{\rm{prod}}$-boundedness of the iterated Hilbert transform. As a byproduct, new proofs of several recently discovered Hardy type inequalities on product Hardy spaces are obtained, which avoid complicated Calder\'on--Zygmund theory on product domain, rendering them considerably simpler than the original proofs.</description>

Abstract: Obtaining explicit stability estimates in classical functional inequalities like the Sobolev inequality has been an essentially open question for 30 years, after the celebrated but non-constructive result of G. Bianchi and H. Egnell in 1991. Recently, new methods have emerged which provide some clues on these fascinating questions. The goal of the course is to give an introduction to the topic for some fundamental functional inequalities and present several methods that can be used to obtain explicit estimates.</description>

      <title>Concentration comparison for nonlinear diffusion on model manifolds and P\'olya-Szeg\H{o} inequality</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.19279</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.19279v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate the validity of the mass concentration comparison for a class of nonlinear diffusion equations posed on Riemannian manifolds $ \mathbb{M}^n $ that are spherically symmetric, that is, model manifolds. The concentration comparison states that the solution of a certain diffusion equation that takes the radially decreasing (Schwarz) rearrangement $ u_0^\star $ as its initial datum is more concentrated than the original solution starting from $u_0$. This is known to hold in $\mathbb{R}^n$ as a consequence of the celebrated P\'olya-Szeg\H{o} inequality, which asserts that the $ L^2 $ norm of the gradient of a function $f$ (belonging to an appropriate Sobolev space) is always larger than the $ L^2 $ norm of the gradient of its radially decreasing rearrangement $f^\star$. However, if $ \mathbb{M}^n $ is a general model manifold, it is not for granted that the P\'olya-Szeg\H{o} inequality holds; in fact, we will provide a simple condition involving the scalar curvature of $\mathbb{M}^n $ under which such an inequality actually fails. The main result we prove states that, given any continuous, nondecreasing, and nontrivial function $ \phi: [0,+\infty) \to [0,+\infty) $, the filtration equation $ \partial_t u = \Delta \phi(u) $ satisfies the concentration comparison in $ \mathbb{M}^n \times (0,+\infty) $ if and only if $ \mathbb{M}^n $ supports the P\'olya-Szeg\H{o} inequality. In particular, the validity of such a comparison for the heat equation is sufficient to guarantee that the same holds for all filtration equations. Moreover, we prove that if $ \mathbb{M}^n $ supports a centered isoperimetric inequality then the P\'olya-Szeg\H{o} inequality, and thus the concentration comparison, holds. This allows us to include important examples such as the hyperbolic space and the sphere.</description>

      <title>Algebra bundles, projective flatness and rationally-deformed tori</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.10812</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.10812v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We show that isomorphism classes $[\mathcal{A}]$ of flat $q\times q$ matrix bundles $\mathcal{A}$ (or projectively flat rank-$q$ complex vector bundles $\mathcal{E}$) on a pro-torus $\mathbb{T}$ are in bijective correspondence with the \v{C}ech cohomology group $H^2(\mathbb{T},\mu_q:=\text{$q^{th}$ roots of unity})$ (respectively $H^2(\mathbb{T},\mathbb{Z})$) via the image of $[A]\in H^1(\mathbb{T},PGL(q,\mathcal{C}_{\mathbb{T}}))$ through $H^1(\mathbb{T},PGL(q,\mathcal{C}_{\mathbb{T}}))\xrightarrow{\quad}H^2(\mathbb{T},\mu(q,\mathcal{C}_{\mathbb{T}}))$ (respectively the first Chern class $c_1(\mathcal{E})$). This is in the spirit of Auslander-Szczarba's result identifying real flat bundles on the torus with their first two Stiefel-Whitney classes, and contrasts with classifying spaces $B\Gamma$ of compact Lie groups $\Gamma$ (as opposed to $\mathbb{T}^n\cong B\mathbb{Z}^n$), on which flat non-trivial vector bundles abound. The discussion both recovers the Disney-Elliott-Kumjian-Raeburn classification of rational non-commutative tori $\mathbb{T}^n_{\theta}$ with a different, bundle-theoretic proof, and sheds some light on the connection between topological invariants associated to $\mathbb{T}^2_{\theta}$, $\theta\in\mathbb{Q}$ by Rieffel and respectively H{\o}egh-Krohn-Skjelbred.</description>
