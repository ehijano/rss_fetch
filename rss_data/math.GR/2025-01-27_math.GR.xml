      <title>Exotic proper actions on homogeneous spaces via convex cocompact representations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.14274</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.14274v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We construct a series of homogeneous spaces G/H of reductive type which admit proper actions of discrete subgroups of G isomorphic to cocompact lattices of O(n,1) (n=2,3,4) but do not admit proper actions of non-compact semisimple subgroups of G. The existence of such homogeneous spaces was previously not known even for n=2. Our construction of proper actions of discrete subgroups is based on Gu\'eritaud-Kassel's work on convex cocompact subgroups of O(n,1) and Danciger-Gu\'eritaud-Kassel's work on right-angled Coxeter groups. On the other hand, the non-existence of proper actions of non-compact semisimple subgroups is proved by the theory of nilpotent orbits and elementary combinatorics.</description>

      <title>Which coprime graphs are divisor graphs?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.14339</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.14339v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: For a finite group $G$, the coprime graph $\Gamma(G)$ of $G$ is a graph with vertex set $G$, in which two distinct vertices $a$ and $b$ are adjacent if the order of $a$ and the order of $b$ are coprime. In this paper, we first give a characterization for which generalized lexicographic products are divisor graphs. As applications, we show that every of power graph, reduced power graph and order graph is a divisor graph, which also implies the main result in [N. Takshak, A. Sehgal, A. Malik, Power graph of a finite group is always divisor graph, Asian-Eur. J. Math. 16 (2023), ID: 2250236]. Then, we prove that the coprime graph of a group is a generalized lexicographic product, and give two characterizations for which coprime graphs are divisor graphs. We also describe the groups $G$ with $|\pi(G)|\le 4$, whose coprime graph is a divisor graph. Finally, we classify the finite groups $G$ so that $\Gamma(G)$ is a divisor graph if $G$ is a nilpotent group, a dihedral group, a generalized quaternion group, a symmetric group, an alternating group, a direct product of two non-trivial groups, and a sporadic simple group.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2501.14125v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce and study blob and framed blob monoids. In particular, several realizations of these monoids are given. We compute the cardinality of the framed blob monoid and derive some combinatorial formulas involving this cardinality.</description>

      <title>The automorphism group of a strongly irreducible subshift on a group</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.14463</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.14463v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the automorphism group $\operatorname{Aut}(X)$ of a non-trivial strongly irreducible subshift $X$ on an arbitrary infinite group $G$ and generalize classical results of Ryan, Kim and Roush.
  We generalize Ryan's theorem by showing that the center of $\operatorname{Aux}(X)$ is generated by shifts by elements of the center of $G$ modded out by the kernel of the shift action. Thus up to isomorphism it coincides with $G$ modded out by the kernel of the shift action.
  We generalize Kim and Roush's theorem by showing that if the free group $F_k$ of rank $k\geq 1$ embeds into $G$, then the automorphism group of any full $F_k$-shift embeds into $\operatorname{Aut}(X)$. Moreover, if $X$ satisfies the strong topological Markov property (and, in particular, if $X$ is an SFT), then the automorphism group of any full $\mathbb{Z}$-shift embeds into $\operatorname{Aut}(X)$ provided $G$ is not locally finite, and the automorphism group of any full $F_k$-shift embeds into $\operatorname{Aut}(X)$ if $G$ is nonamenable. These results rely on a new marker lemma which is valid for any nonempty strongly irreducible subshift on an infinite group.
  We remark that the classical theorem of Ryan applies to a full $\mathbb{Z}$-shift, while the result of Kim and Roush applies to mixing $\mathbb{Z}$-SFTs. Thus in the case $G=\mathbb{Z}$, our results improve the current ones.</description>

      <title>Residual finiteness and discrete subgroups of Lie groups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.07680</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.07680v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Let $G$ be a real Lie group and $\Gamma &lt; G$ be a discrete subgroup of $G$. Is $\Gamma$ residually finite? This paper describes known positive and negative results then poses some questions whose answers will lead to a fairly complete answer for lattices.</description>

      <title>On the Boone--Higman Conjecture for groups acting on locally finite trees</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.05673</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.05673v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We develop a method for proving the Boone--Higman Conjecture for groups acting on locally finite trees. As a consequence, we prove the Boone--Higman Conjecture for all Baumslag--Solitar groups and for all free(finite rank)-by-cyclic groups, solving it in two cases that have been raised explicitly by Belk, Bleak, Matucci and Zaremsky. We also illustrate that our method has applications beyond these cases and may offer a route for proving the Boone--Higman Conjecture for many classes of groups.</description>

      <title>On stabilizers in finite permutation groups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.18534</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.18534v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Let $G$ be a permutation group on the finite set $\Omega$. We prove various results about partitions of $\Omega$ whose stabilizers have good properties. In particular, we obtain the following three theorems: In every solvable permutation group, there is a subset whose stabilizer has all orbits of length at most $6$, which is best possible and answers two questions of Babai. Every solvable maximal subgroup of any almost simple group has derived length at most $10$, which is best possible. In every primitive group with solvable stabilizer, there are two points whose pointwise stabilizer has derived length bounded by an absolute constant.</description>
