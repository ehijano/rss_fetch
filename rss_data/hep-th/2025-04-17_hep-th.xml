      <title>Self-duality and the Holomorphic Ansatz in Generalized BPS Skyrme Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.11533</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.11533v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose a generalization of the BPS Skyrme model for simple compact Lie groups $G$ that leads to Hermitian symmetric spaces. In such a theory, the Skyrme field takes its values in $G$, while the remaining fields correspond to the entries of a symmetric, positive, and invertible $\dim G \times \dim G$-dimensional matrix $h$. We also use the holomorphic map ansatz between $S^2 \rightarrow G/H \times U(1)$ to study the self-dual sector of the theory, which generalizes the holomorphic ansatz between $S^2 \rightarrow CP^N$. This ansatz is constructed using the fact that stable harmonic maps of the two $S^2$ spheres for compact Hermitian symmetric spaces are holomorphic or anti-holomorphic. Apart from some special cases, the self-duality equations do not fix the matrix $h$ entirely in terms of the Skyrme field, which is completely free, as it happens in the original self-dual Skyrme model for $G=SU(2)$. In general, the freedom of the $h$ fields tend to grow with the dimension of $G$. The holomorphic ansatz enable us to construct an infinite number of exact self-dual Skyrmions for each integer value of the topological charge and for each value of $N \geq 1$, in case of the $CP^N$, and for each values of $p,\,q\geq 1$ in case of $SU(p+q)/SU(p)\otimes SU(q)\otimes U(1)$.</description>

      <title>Inhomogeneous metrics on complex bundles in Lovelock gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.11562</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.11562v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider Lovelock gravity in arbitrary, even dimensions. We find a large class of new gravitational instantons by considering extended nontrivial circle bundles over K\"ahler manifolds. Concretely, we generalize the Page-Pope metric in the presence of higher-curvature corrections of the Lovelock class. A subset of these spaces admits analytic continuation into the Lorentzian sector, producing new stationary solutions in Lovelock gravity. The geometries are fully determined by a single algebraic equation. We also obtain necessary and sufficient conditions for Lovelock-constant K\"ahler manifolds to exist in Lovelock gravity. Finally, we find a wide class of Lovelock-Maxwell solutions beyond staticity, allowing us to obtain the electrovacuum extension of these instantons.</description>

      <title>Coherent States in Classical Field Theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.11887</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.11887v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We illustrate the emergence of classical analogue of coherent state and its generalisation in a purely classical field theoretical setting. Our algebraic approach makes use of the Poisson bracket and symmetries of the underlying field theory, in a complete parallel to the quantum construction. The classical phase space picture is found to play a key role in this construction.</description>

      <title>On 5-point conformal block with level 2 degenerate field insertion and its AGT dual</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.11921</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.11921v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we develop and explore recursive methods to investigate the 2d CFT 5-point conformal block with a level 2 degenerate insertion, as well as its AGT dual, by solving the BPZ differential equation. First, we represent the solution of the differential equation as a double series expansion. On the 2-node quiver gauge theory side, this corresponds to the instanton series. We then demonstrate that the expansion coefficients are uniquely determined by a recursion relation. Inspired by the approach initiated in a paper by D. Gaiotto and J. Teschner, we partially resum this series and show that the result can be elegantly expressed in terms of a single hypergeometric function and its derivative. This new representation makes it straightforward to relate different asymptotic regions. As a by-product, this provides us a simple derivation of fusion and braiding coefficients.
  We describe the subtle procedure of merging the degenerate field with the outgoing state, thereby obtaining a generic 4-point block, which on the gauge theory side corresponds to the partition function of $SU(2)$ gauge theory with four massive hypermultiplets in the $\Omega$-background.
  Finally, we performed several nontrivial checks, which confirm our results.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.11935</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.11935v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose a simple model of two-dimensional N=2 superconformal mechanics with a spin-orbit interaction term and demonstrate that it inherits the Galilean symmetry of the initial free-particle system. We then propose a quaternionic counterpart of this system, which describes the four-dimensional N=4 superconformal mechanics$D(1,2|\alpha). The bosonic part of the Hamiltonian describes a free particle on the cone, while the fermionic part necessarily includes the spin-orbit interaction term.</description>

      <title>Assessing WGC Compatibility in ModMax Black Holes via Photon Spheres Analysis and WCCC Validation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.11939</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.11939v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: It seems that the regime of Hawking radiation and evaporation ultimately drives charged black holes toward super-extremality of the charge parameter and the dominance of extremal conditions. This progression, in turn, lays the groundwork for satisfying the necessary conditions for the Weak Gravity Conjecture (WGC). Preliminary studies indicate that black holes such as the Reissner-Nordstr$\"o$m (RN) model, in their initial form, lack the capacity to sustain super-extremality of the charge parameter. If such conditions arise, these black holes transition into naked singularities-a scenario that is highly undesirable due to the loss of causality and the breakdown of space-time geometry. This raises whether the inability to sustain super-extremality is an inherent property of the model or a consequence of the approximations and precision limitations employed in its construction. To address this, we turned to the ModMax model, which represents an extension of the RN model. Our analysis revealed that the ModMax model not only accommodates super-extremality of the charge parameter but also, under certain conditions, emerges as a promising candidate for investigating the WGC. Furthermore, we independently observed how the inclusion of the de Sitter radius ($\ell$) in the AdS model and $f(R)$ gravitational corrections-both of which enhance and complicate the model-can have a direct impact on the range of super-extremal charge tolerance which, in turn, provides the realization of the conditions necessary for the WGC.</description>

      <title>Anatomy of the simplest renormalon</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.12044</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.12044v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Perhaps the simplest IR renormalon occurs in the ground state energy of a superrenormalizable model, the scalar $O(N)$ theory in two dimensions with a quartic potential and negative squared mass. We show that this renormalon, found previously in perturbation theory at next-to-leading order (NLO) in the $1/N$ expansion, gives indeed the correct asymptotic expansion of the exact large $N$ solution of the model, and we determine explicitly the complete trans-series of non-perturbative corrections to the perturbative result. We also use this framework to study the $O(N)$-invariant two-point function of the scalar field. As expected, it is IR finite in perturbation theory, but it is afflicted as well with an IR renormalon singularity and is not Borel summable. The pole mass is purely non-perturbative and its trans-series can be also fully determined at NLO in $1/N$</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.12081</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.12081v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We continue analytical study of the meson mass spectrum in the large-$N_c$ two-dimensional QCD, known as the 't Hooft model, by addressing the most general case of quarks with unequal masses. Based on our previous work, we develop non-perturbative methods to compute spectral sums and systematically derive large-$n$ WKB expansion of the spectrum. Furthermore, we examine the behavior of these results in various asymptotic regimes, including the chiral, heavy quark, and heavy-light limits, and establish a precise coincidence with known analytical and numerical results obtained through alternative approaches.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2504.12235v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We construct a three-parameter family of smooth and horizonless rotating solutions of Einstein-Maxwell theory with Chern-Simons term in five dimensions and discuss their stringy origin in terms of three-charge brane systems in Type IIB and M-theory. The general solution interpolates smoothly between Kerr and static Topological Star geometries. We show that for specific choices of the parameters and quantized values of the angular momentum the geometry terminates on a smooth five-dimensional cap, and it displays neither ergoregion nor closed timelike curves and a region of Gregory-Laflamme stability. We discuss the dimensional reduction to four dimensions and the propagation of particles and waves showing that geodetic motion is integrable and the radial and angular propagation of scalar perturbations can be separated and described in terms of two ordinary differential equations of confluent Heun type.</description>

      <title>Wormholes with Ends of the World</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.12278</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.12278v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study classical wormhole solutions in 3D gravity with end-of-the-world (EOW) branes, conical defects, kinks, and punctures. These solutions compute statistical averages of an ensemble of boundary conformal field theories (BCFTs) related to universal asymptotics of OPE data extracted from 2D conformal bootstrap. Conical defects connect BCFT bulk operators; branes join BCFT boundary intervals with identical boundary conditions; kinks (1D defects along branes) link BCFT boundary operators; and punctures (0D defects) are endpoints where conical defects terminate on branes. We provide evidence for a correspondence between the gravity theory and the ensemble. In particular, the agreement of $g$-function dependence results from an underlying topological aspect of the on-shell EOW brane action, from which a BCFT analogue of the Schlenker-Witten theorem also follows.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2504.12282v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the gravitational phase space associated to a stretched horizon within a finite-sized causal diamond in $(d+2)$-dimensional spacetimes. By imposing the Raychaudhuri equation, we obtain its constrained symplectic form using the covariant phase space formalism and derive the relevant quantum commutators by inverting the symplectic form and quantizing. Finally, we compute the area fluctuations of the causal diamond by taking a Carrollian limit of the stretched horizon in pure Minkowski spacetime, and derive the relationship $\langle (\Delta A)^2 \rangle \geq \frac{2\pi G}{d}\langle A \rangle$, showing that the variance of the area fluctuations is proportional to the area itself.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2504.12289v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We construct examples of renormalizable Carrollian theories with finite effective central charge and non-trivial dynamics. These include critical points that are not scale-invariant but rather exhibit hyperscaling violation. All of our examples are mildly non-Lagrangian, in that they arise from suitable $N\to 0$ limits of Carrollian theories with $N$-component fields, including limits of Carrollian vector models and non-abelian gauge theories. We discuss implications for flat space holography, highlighting challenges in realizing Carrollian duals to gravitational theories.</description>

Abstract: We explain how the spacetime diffeomorphism in the classical bosonic closed string field theory (SFT) is represented as $L_\infty$ gauge transformations in weakly curved backgrounds. In particular, we demonstrate the explicit map between covariant spacetime fields and the string fields in the flat-vertex frame to the leading few orders in perturbation theory. We further consider a Batalin-Vilkovisky system of extended string fields that manifests diffeomorphism invariance and allows for extending certain perturbative SFT solutions to the large field regime.</description>

      <title>Detecting Ultralight Dark Matter with Matter Effect</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.11522</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.11522v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Ultralight particles, with a mass below the electronvolt scale, exhibit wave-like behavior and have arisen as a compelling dark matter candidate. A particularly intriguing subclass is scalar dark matter, which induces variations in fundamental physical constants. However, detecting such particles becomes highly challenging in the mass range above $10^{-6}\,\text{eV}$, as traditional experiments face severe limitations in response time. In contrast, the matter effect becomes significant in a vast and unexplored parameter space. These effects include (i) a force arising from scattering between ordinary matter and the dark matter wind and (ii) a fifth force between ordinary matter induced by the dark matter background. Using the repulsive quadratic scalar-photon interaction as a case study, we develop a unified framework based on quantum mechanical scattering theory to systematically investigate these phenomena across both perturbative and non-perturbative regimes. Our approach not only reproduces prior results obtained through other methodologies but also covers novel regimes with nontrivial features, such as decoherence effects, screening effects, and their combinations. In particular, we highlight one finding related to both scattering and background-induced forces: the descreening effect observed in the non-perturbative region with large incident momentum, which alleviates the decoherence suppression. Furthermore, we discuss current and proposed experiments, including inverse-square-law tests, equivalence principle tests, and deep-space acceleration measurements. Notably, we go beyond the spherical approximation and revisit the MICROSCOPE constraints on the background-induced force in the large-momentum regime, where the decoherence and screening effects interplay. The ultraviolet models realizing the quadratic scalar-photon interaction are also discussed.</description>

      <title>Instability of the critical Ngai's coupling and two-boson mechanism in metals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.11523</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.11523v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the properties of a Fermi liquid coupled to a quantum critical boson via the two-boson interaction known as Ngai's coupling. We find that the original quantum critical point is generally unstable, resulting in a finite-momentum spatially modulated state unless two conditions are satisfied: (i) the critical boson is polar and transverse, and (ii) the ratio of the Fermi velocity to the transverse-boson velocity is sufficiently large. If these conditions hold and the uniform state remains stable, we demonstrate that the system enters a strong-coupling regime below a certain energy scale. In this regime, we discuss a self-consistent solution at criticality in two-dimensional systems and show that the critical boson field develops a nontrivial anomalous dimension, $\eta=1/2$. Our findings highlight the significant role of two-boson coupling in critical theories, challenging the conventional view that its effects are subdominant to linear coupling.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2504.11799v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Gaussian quantum mechanics is a powerful tool regularly used in quantum optics to model linear and quadratic Hamiltonians efficiently. Recent interest in qubit-CV hybrid models has revealed a simple, yet important gap in our knowledge, namely, how to fully manipulate superpositions of Gaussian states. In this paper, we show how to faithfully represent a quadratic Gaussian state in the Fock basis. Specifically, we evaluate the phase necessary to equate the unitary representation of a zero-mean Gaussian state with its Fock representation. This allows for the coherent manipulation of superpositions of Gaussian states, especially the evaluation of expectation values from these superposed states. We then use this method to model a simple quantum field theory communication protocol using quadratic detectors in a regime that has previously been impossible to solve. The result presented in this paper is expected to become increasingly relevant with hybrid-CV systems, especially in the strong-coupling regime.</description>

      <title>Entropy bounds from quantum thermodynamics</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.11807v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Within an inherently classical perspective, there is always an unavoidable energy cost associated with the information deletion and this common lore is at the heart of the Landauer's conjecture that does not impose, per se, any relevant limit on the information acquisition. Although such a mindset should generally apply to systems of any size, its quantum mechanical implications are particularly intriguing and, for this reason, we examine here a minimal physical structure where the system and the environment are described, respectively, by a pair of quantum oscillators coupled by an appropriate Hermitian interaction able to amplify the entropy of the initial state. Since at the onset of the dynamical evolution the system is originally in a pure state, its entropy variation is always positive semidefinite and the Landauer's conjecture should not impose any constraint. Nonetheless, provided the quantum amplification is effective, it turns out that the entropy variation of the system always undershoots the heat transferred to the environment. When the initial thermal state of the environment is characterized by a chemical potential, the entropy growth is bounded both by the particles and by the heat flowing to the environment. The limits deduced in the quantum thermodynamical framework are also scrutinized from a field theory standpoint where species of different spins are copiously produced (especially in a cosmological context) thanks to the rapid variation of the space-time curvature.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2504.11904v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The gauge/gravity duality, combined with information from lattice QCD, nuclear theory, and perturbative QCD, can be used to constrain the equation of state of hot and dense QCD. I discuss an approach based on the holographic V-QCD model, which includes both nuclear and quark matter phases, separated by a first order phase transition. By using this model in state-of-the-art simulations of neutron star binaries, I study the formation of quark matter during the merger process, and its effect on the threshold mass for prompt collapse into a black hole.</description>

      <title>Separate universe in multifield inflation: a phase-space approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.11929</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.11929v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this article we extend a study of the validity conditions of the separate-universe approach of cosmological perturbations to models of inflation with multiple fields. The separate-universe approach consists in describing the universe as a collection of homogeneous and isotropic patches, giving us an effective description of perturbation theory at large scales through phase-space reduction. This approximation is a necessary step in stochastic inflation, an effective theory of coarse-grained, super-Hubble, scalar fields fluctuations. One needs a stochastic inflation description in the context of primordial black hole productions since it needs enhancements of the curvature power spectrum. It easily achievable in multifield inflation models but necessarily comes with strong diffusive effects. We study and compare cosmological perturbation theory and the separate-universe approach in said non-linear sigma models as a typical framework of multifield inflation and employing the Hamiltonian formalism to keep track of the complete phase space (or the reduced isotropic phase space in the separate-universe approach). We find that the separate-universe approach adequately describes the cosmological perturbation theory provided the wavelength of the modes considered is greater that several lower bounds that depend on the cosmological horizon and the inverse of the effective Hamiltonian masses of the fields; the latter being fixed by the coupling potential and the field-space geometry. We also compare gauge-invariant variables and several gauge fixing procedures in both approaches. For instance, we showed that the uniform-expansion gauge is nicely described by the separate-universe picture, hence qualifying its use in stochastic inflation as commonly done.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2504.11955v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The quantization of unimodular gravity in minisuperspace leads to a time evolution of states generated by the Hamiltonian, as in usual quantum mechanics. We revisit the analysis made in Ref. \cite{unruh}, extending it to phantom scalar fields. It is argued that only in this case a non-trivial evolution for the scalar field can be obtained. The behavior of the scale factor presents a bounce followed by a de Sitter expansion, reproducing the quantum cosmological scenario in General Relativity when the source is given by a cosmological term described by the Schutz variable. The analysis is extended to the Brans-Dicke scalar tensor theory.</description>

Abstract: A new notion of quasilocal mass is defined for generic, compact, two dimensional, spacelike surfaces in four dimensional spacetimes with negative cosmological constant. The definition is spinorial and based on work for vanishing cosmological constant by Penrose and Dougan &amp; Mason. Furthermore, this mass is non-negative, equal to the Misner-Sharp mass in spherical symmetry, equal to zero for every generic surface in AdS, has an appropriate form for gravity linearised about AdS and has an appropriate limit for large spheres in asymptotically AdS spacetimes.</description>

      <title>Non-Markovian Quantum Master and Fokker-Planck Equation for Gravitational Systems and Gravitational Decoherence</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.11991v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A quantum master equation describing the stochastic dynamics of a quantum massive system interacting with a quantum gravitational field is useful for the investigation of quantum gravitational and quantum informational issues such as the quantum nature of gravity, gravity-induced entanglement and gravitational decoherence. Studies of the decoherence of quantum systems by an electromagnetic field shows that a lower temperature environment is more conducive to successful quantum information processing experiments. Likewise, the quantum nature of (perturbative) gravity is far better revealed at lower temperatures than high, minimizing the corruptive effects of thermal noise. In this work, generalizing earlier results of the Markovian ABH master equation [1,2] which is valid only for high temperatures, we derive a non-Markovian quantum master equation for the reduced density matrix, and the associated Fokker-Planck equation for the Wigner distribution function, for the stochastic dynamics of two masses following quantum trajectories, interacting with a graviton field, including the effects of graviton noise, valid for all temperatures. We follow the influence functional approach exemplified in the derivation of the non-Markovian Hu-Paz-Zhang master equation [62,64] for quantum Brownian motion. We find that in the low temperature limit, the off-diagonal elements of the reduced density matrix decrease in time logarithmically for the zero temperature part and quadratically in time for the temperature-dependent part, which is distinctly different from the Markovian case. We end with a summary of our findings and a discussion on how this problem studied here is related to the quantum stochastic equation derived in [77] for gravitational self force studies, and to quantum optomechanics where experimental observation of gravitational decoherence and entanglement may be implemented.</description>

      <title>Hawking evaporation and the fate of black holes in loop quantum gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.11998</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.11998v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A recent covariant formulation, that includes non-perturbative effects from loop quantum gravity (LQG) as self-consistent effective models, has revealed the possibility of non-singular black hole solutions. The new framework makes it possible to couple scalar matter to such LQG black holes and derive Hawking radiation in the presence of quantum space-time effects while respecting general covariance. Standard methods to derive particle production both within the geometric optics approximation and the Parikh-Wilczek tunneling approach are therefore available and confirm the thermal nature of Hawking radiation. The covariant description of scale-dependent decreasing holonomy corrections maintains Hawking temperature as well as universality of the low-energy transmission coefficients, stating that the absorption rates are proportional to the horizon area at leading order. Quantum-geometry effects enter the thermal distribution only through sub-leading corrections in the greybody factors. Nevertheless, they do impact energy emission of the black hole and its final state in a crucial way regarding one of the main questions of black-hole evaporation: whether a black-to-white-hole transition, or a stable remnant, is preferred. For the first time, a first-principles derivation, based on a discussion of backreaction, finds evidence that points to the former outcome.</description>

      <title>Area spectrum and black hole thermodynamics</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.12014v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The role of horizon area quantization on black hole thermodynamics is investigated in this article. The coefficient appearing in the quantization of area is fixed by an appeal to the saturated form of the Landauer's principle. Then by considering transition between discrete states of the event horizon area which in turn is equivalent to transitions between discrete mass states of the black hole, the change in the mass can be obtained. The change in mass is then equated to the product of the Hawking temperature and change in entropy of the black hole between two consecutive discrete states applying the first law of black hole thermodynamics. This gives the corrected Hawking temperature. In particular, we apply this technique to the Schwarzschild black hole, the quantum corrected Schwarzschild black hole, the Reissner-Nordstr\"{o}m black hole which is a charged black hole, and the rotating Kerr black hole geometry, and obtain the corrected Hawking temperature in each of these cases. We then take a step forward by inserting this corrected Hawking temperature in the first law of black hole thermodynamics once again to calculate the entropy of the black hole in terms of the horizon area of the black hole. This leads to logarithmic and inverse corrections to the entropy of the black hole.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2504.12042v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We explore the construction of diverse regular spacetimes (black holes and defects) in General Relativity (GR) using a generic parametrised density profile (the Dekel-Zhao profile), which includes, for specific parameter choices, various well-known examples usually studied in the context of dark matter halos. Our solutions, in the Schwarzschild gauge, include new regular black holes as well as non-singular solutions representing spacetime defects. For a sub-class of metrics, a TOV equation approach with a chosen equation of state works. The status of the energy conditions and the issue of geodesic completeness are explored in detail. We also provide possible Lagrangian density constructions for the matter energy-momentum tensors. Further, we study the shadow radius of the new regular black holes, and compare our findings with available observational results from the EHT collaboration. Finally, for the defect solution, we present a model for a stable star (a gravastar) by explicit use of the junction conditions and obtain relevant consequences highlighting its characteristic features.</description>

      <title>Refining the Understanding of Operator Size Dynamics in Open Quantum Systems</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.12056v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Information scrambling refers to the phenomenon in which local quantum information in a many-body system becomes dispersed throughout the entire system under unitary evolution. It has been extensively studied in closed quantum systems, where it is quantified by operator size growth, revealing deep connections between condensed matter physics, high-energy physics, and quantum information. However, when extending the study of operator size dynamics to open quantum systems, two different definitions of operator size distributions emerge. These definitions are based on different treatments of the bath. In this work, we aim to establish a unified picture for operator size dynamics in open quantum systems, using the solvable Brownian SYK models at generic system size. In particular, we provide the conditions under which the signature of scrambling transition, discovered using one particular definition, appears in operator size dynamics under the other definition. Additionally, we extend previous studies by exploring finite-size effects that are not captured by the scramblon theory. Our results provide a refined understanding of operator size dynamics in open quantum systems.</description>

      <title>Barrow and Tsallis entropies after the DESI DR2 BAO data</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.12205v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Modified cosmology based on Barrow entropy arises from the gravity-thermodynamics conjecture, in which the standard Bekenstein-Hawking entropy is replaced by the Barrow entropy of quantum-gravitational origin, characterized by the Barrow parameter $\Delta$. Interestingly, this framework exhibits similarities with cosmology based on Tsallis $\delta$-entropy, which, although rooted in a non-extensive generalization of Boltzmann-Gibbs statistics, features the same power-law deformation of the holographic scaling present in the Barrow case. We use observational data from Supernova Type Ia (SNIa), Cosmic Chronometers (CC), and Baryonic acoustic oscillations (BAO), including the recently released DESI DR2 data, in order to extract constraints on such scenarios. As we show, the best-fit value for the Barrow exponent $\Delta$ is found to be negative, while the zero value, which corresponds to $\Lambda$CDM paradigm, is allowed only in the range of $2\sigma $ for three out of four datasets. Additionally, for the case of the SN$_{0}$+OHD+BAO dataset, for the current Hubble function we obtain a value of $H_0= 72.2_{-0.9}^{+0.9}$, which offers an alleviation for the $H_0$ tension. Finally, by applying information criteria such as the Akaike Information Criterion and the Bayes evidence, we compare the fitting efficiency of the scenario at hand with $\Lambda$CDM cosmology, showing that the latter is slightly favoured.</description>

Abstract: We extend the formula for correlation functions of scalar field theories in terms of quantum $A_{\infty}$ algebras, presented in arXiv:2203.05366, to incorporate Dirac fields. We use a description that is analogous to string field theory, and the formula for correlation functions takes the same form for both scalar fields and Dirac fields. We prove that correlation functions from our formula satisfy the Schwinger-Dyson equations in the free theory. The proof for interacting theories is presented in the companion paper arXiv:2305.13103 by one of the authors. We also explain the relation of our formula to the definition of correlation functions in the approach by Costello and Gwilliam based on factorization algebras.</description>

We also study the spectral sums in the chiral limit and the heavy quark limit and find a complete agreement with known results.</description>

      <title>More About the Lattice Hamiltonian for Adjoint QCD$_2$</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.19164v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In our earlier work arXiv:2311.09334, we introduced a lattice Hamiltonian for Adjoint QCD$_2$ using staggered Majorana fermions. We found the gauge invariant space of states explicitly for the gauge group $\text{SU}(2)$ and used them for numerical calculations of observables, such as the spectrum and the expectation value of the fermion bilinear. In this paper, we carry out a more in-depth study of our lattice model, extending it to any compact and simply-connected gauge group $G$. We show how to find the gauge invariant space of states and use it to study various observables. We also use the lattice model to calculate the mixed 't Hooft anomalies of Adjoint QCD$_2$ for arbitrary $G$. We show that the matrix elements of the lattice Hamiltonian can be expressed in terms of the Wigner 6$j$-symbols of $G$. For $G = \text{SU}(3)$, we perform exact diagonalization for lattices of up to six sites and study the low-lying spectrum, the fermion bilinear condensate, and the string tension. We also show how to write the lattice strong coupling expansion for ground state energies and operator expectation values in terms of the Wigner 6$j$-symbols. For $\text{SU}(3)$ we carry this out explicitly and find good agreement with the exact diagonalizations, and for $\text{SU}(4)$ we give expansions that can be compared with future numerical studies.</description>

      <title>Pinching rules in the chiral-splitting description of one-loop string amplitudes</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.19641v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Loop amplitudes in string theories reduce to those of gauge theories and (super)gravity in their worldline description as the inverse string tension $\alpha'$ tends to zero. The appearance of reducible diagrams in these $\alpha' \rightarrow 0$ limits is determined through so-called pinching rules in the worldline literature. In this work, we extend these pinching rules to the chiral-splitting description of one-loop superstring amplitudes where left- and right-moving degrees of freedom decouple at fixed loop momentum. Starting from six points, the Kronecker-Eisenstein integrands of chiral amplitudes introduce subtleties into the pinching rules and integration-by-parts simplifications. Resolutions of these subtleties are presented and applied to produce a new superspace representation of the six-point one-loop amplitude of type IIA/B supergravity. The worldline computations and their subtleties are compared with the ambitwistor-string approach to one-loop field-theory amplitudes where integration-by-parts manipulations are shown to be more flexible. Throughout this work, the homology invariance of loop-momentum dependent correlation functions on the torus is highlighted as a consistency condition of $\alpha' \rightarrow 0$ limits and their comparison with ambitwistor methods.</description>

      <title>Superadditivity in large $N$ field theories and performance of quantum tasks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.04183</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.04183v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Field theories exhibit dramatic changes in the structure of their operator algebras in the limit where the number of local degrees of freedom ($N$) becomes infinite. An important example of this is that the algebras associated to local subregions may not be additively generated in the limit. We investigate examples and explore the consequences of this ``superadditivity'' phenomenon in large $N$ field theories and holographic systems. In holographic examples we find cases in which superadditive algebras can probe the black hole interior, while the additive algebra cannot. We also discuss how superaddivity explains the sucess of quantum error correction models of holography. Finally we demonstrate how superadditivity is intimately related to the ability of holographic field theories to perform quantum tasks that would naievely be impossible. We argue that the connected wedge theorems (CWTs) of May, Penington, Sorce, and Yoshida, which characterize holographic protocols for quantum tasks, can be re-phrased in terms of superadditive algebras and use this re-phrasing to conjecture a generalization of the CWTs that is an equivalence statement.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.10967v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We show how curing an anomaly of the twistor uplift of self-dual Yang-Mills theory implies linear relations among one-loop, $n$-gluon, color-ordered subamplitudes in QCD, when all $n$ gluon helicities are positive, or when exactly one is negative. We compute the number of linearly independent subamplitudes as determined by these relations, in terms of unsigned Stirling numbers. Then we use a momentum-twistor parametrization to show that there are no further linear dependencies.</description>

      <title>Do anomalies break the momentum routing invariance?</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.00930v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The diagrammatic computation of anomalies is usually associated with the breaking of the momentum routing invariance. This is because the momentum routing is usually chosen to fulfill the desired Ward identity. In the case of the chiral anomaly, the momentum routing is chosen in order to fulfill the gauge Ward identity and break the chiral Ward identity. Although the chiral anomaly is physical because it is associated with the pion decay into two photons, this does not necessarily mean that the momentum routing invariance is broken because the momentum routing was chosen in the computation of the anomaly. The reciprocal is not true, {\it i. e.} anomalies do not imply in momentum routing invariance breaking. In this work, we show that if gauge invariance is assumed, the chiral and the scale anomalies are independent of the momentum routing chosen and as a result they are momentum routing invariant. This idea is applied to a QED with non-minimal CPT and Lorentz violation, where momentum routing invariance is used to find out what symmetry is broken in the Ward identities.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2501.05743v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The planar three-gluon form factor for the chiral stress tensor operator in planar maximally supersymmetric Yang-Mills theory is an analog of the Higgs-to-three-gluon scattering amplitude in QCD. The amplitude (symbol) bootstrap program has provided a wealth of high-loop perturbative data about this form factor, with results up to eight loops available. The symbol of the form factor at $L$ loops is given by words of length $2L$ in six letters with associated integer coefficients. In this paper, we analyze this data, describing patterns of zero coefficients and relations between coefficients. We find many sequences of words whose coefficients are given by closed-form expressions which we expect to be valid at any loop order. Moreover, motivated by our previous machine-learning analysis, we identify simple recursion relations that relate the coefficient of a word to the coefficients of particular lower-loop words. These results open an exciting door for understanding scattering amplitudes at all loop orders.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2501.10691v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we systematically develop a quantum thread picture that characterizes the entanglement structure of holographic duality. Behind this construction lies a simple philosophy: holographic quantum entanglement can be visualized by thread-like objects. Inspired by tensor network models and the earlier concept of bit threads, we propose rules governing the trajectories of quantum threads in the holographic bulk. These rules not only carry meaningful interpretations at the level of quantum information theory but also determine that the quantum threads travel along geodesics in the holographic bulk. This makes kinematic space a tailor-made language for describing quantum thread configurations. We hope that the quantum thread method can provide necessary constraints or useful guidance for constructing genuine holographic tensor networks beyond toy models.</description>

      <title>On the Underlying Nonrelativistic Nature of Relativistic Holography</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.03031</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.03031v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Over the past quarter century, considerable effort has been invested in the study of nonrelativistic (NR) string theory, its U-dual NR brane theories, and their geometric foundations in (generalized) Newton-Cartan geometry. Many interesting results have been obtained, both for their intrinsic value and in the hope that they hold useful lessons for relativistic string/M theory. By synthesizing two strands of recent developments (especially, arXiv:2312.13243 and arXiv:2410.03591), we argue that this hope has already come to fruition, because standard, relativistic holography can now be recognized as a statement within a corresponding nonrelativistic brane theory. Our main conclusions are general, but in the familiar example of D3-brane based holography, they read as follows: (i) N=4 SYM is exactly the worldvolume theory of D3-branes within `NR D3-brane theory'; (ii) AdS_5*S^5 is exactly the corresponding RR black 3-brane, and includes an asymptotically flat-Newton-Cartan region; (iii) AdS/CFT duality is precisely synonymous with black-brane/D-brane (i.e., closed-string/open-string) duality within NR D3-brane theory; (iv) Newton-Cartan geometry is the underlying structure upon which entanglement of the D3-brane degrees of freedom builds relativistic spacetime.</description>

      <title>Quantization of Lie-Poisson algebra and Lie algebra solutions of mass-deformed type IIB matrix model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.24060</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.24060v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A quantization of Lie-Poisson algebras is studied. Classical solutions of the mass-deformed IKKT matrix model can be constructed from semisimple Lie algebras whose dimension matches the number of matrices in the model. We consider the geometry described by the classical solutions of the Lie algebras in the limit where the mass vanishes and the matrix size tends to infinity. Lie-Poisson varieties are regarded as such geometric objects.We provide a quantization called ``weak matrix regularization''of Lie-Poisson algebras (linear Poisson algebras) on the algebraic varieties defined by their Casimir polynomials. Casimir polynomials correspond with Casimir operators of the Lie algebra by the quantization. This quantization is a generalization of the method for constructing the fuzzy sphere. In order to define the weak matrix regularization of the quotient space by the ideal generated by the Casimir polynomials, we take a fixed reduced Gr\"obner basis of the ideal. The Gr\"obner basis determines remainders of polynomials. The operation of replacing this remainders with representation matrices of a Lie algebra roughly corresponds to a weak matrix regularization. As concrete examples, we construct weak matrix regularization for $\mathfrak{su}(2)$ and $\mathfrak{su}(3)$. In the case of $\mathfrak{su}(3)$, we not only construct weak matrix regularization for the quadratic Casimir polynomial, but also construct weak matrix regularization for the cubic Casimir polynomial.</description>

      <title>The off-shell one- and two-loop box recovered from intersection theory</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.05843v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We advertise intersection theory for generalised hypergeometric functions as a means of evaluating Mellin-Barnes representations. As an example, we study two-parameter representations of the off-shell one- and two-loop box graphs in exactly four-dimensional configuration space. Closing the integration contours for the MB parameters we transform these into double sums. Polygamma functions in the MB representation of the double box and the occurrence of higher poles are taken into account by parametric differentiation. Summing over any one of the counters results into a $_{p+1}F_p$ that we replace by its Euler integral representation. The process can be repeated a second time and results in a two- or four-parameter Euler integral, respectively. We use intersection theory to derive Pfaffian systems of equations on related sets of master integrals and solve for the box and double box integrals reproducing the known expressions. Finally, we use a trick to re-derive the double box from a two-parameter Euler integral. This second computation requires only very little computing resources.</description>

      <title>Resurgence in Lorentzian quantum cosmology: No-boundary saddles and resummation of quantum gravity corrections around tunneling saddle points</title>

      <description>arXiv:2402.09981v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We revisit the path-integral approach to the wave function of the Universe by utilizing Lefschetz thimble analyses and resurgence theory. The traditional Euclidean path-integral of gravity has the notorious ambiguity of the direction of Wick rotation. In contrast, the Lorentzian method can be formulated concretely with the Picard-Lefschetz theory. Yet, a challenge remains: the physical parameter space lies on a Stokes line, meaning that the Lefschetz-thimble structure is still unclear. Through complex deformations, we resolve this issue by uniquely identifying the thimble structure. This leads to the tunneling wave function, as opposed to the no-boundary wave function, offering a more rigorous proof of the previous results. Further exploring the parameter space, we discover rich structures: the ambiguity of the Borel resummation of perturbative series around the tunneling saddle points is exactly canceled by the ambiguity of the contributions from no-boundary saddle points. This indicates that resurgence also works in quantum cosmology, particularly in the minisuperspace model.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2402.17626v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Most approaches towards a quantum theory of gravitation indicate the existence of a minimal length scale of the order of the Planck length. Quantum mechanical models incorporating such an intrinsic length scale call for a deformation of Heisenberg's algebra resulting in a generalized uncertainty principle and constitute what is called gravitational quantum mechanics. Utilizing the position representation of this deformed algebra, we study various models of gravitational quantum mechanics. The free time evolution of a Gaussian wave packet is investigated as well as the spectral properties of a particle bound by an external attractive potential. Here the cases of a box with infinite walls and an attractive potential well of finite depth are considered.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.01402v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study gravitational perturbations of the Schwarzschild metric in the context of noncommutative gravity. $r-\varphi$ and $r-t$ noncommutativity are introduced through a Moyal twist of the Hopf algebra of diffeomorphisms. Differential geometric structures such as curvature tensors are also twisted. Noncommutative equations of motion are derived from the recently proposed NC vacuum Einstein equation. Here, in addition to previously calculated axial NC potential, we present the polar solution which generalizes the work done by Zerilli. Quasinormal mode frequencies of the two potentials are calculated using three methods: WKB, P\"oschl-Teller and Rosen-Morse. Notably, we apply the WKB method up to the 13th order and determine the optimal order for each noncommutative parameter value individually. Additionally, we provide comprehensive error estimations for the higher-order WKB calculations, offering insights into the accuracy of our results. By comparing the spectra, we conclude that the classical isospectrality of axial and polar modes is broken upon spacetime quantization. Isospectrality is restored in the eikonal limit.</description>

      <title>Modified $f(R,T)$ theory in light of gravitational wave standard sirens</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.12674v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we ponder observational constraints
  on the modified $f(R,T)$ gravity, where the gravitational action is
  a function of Ricci scalar $R$ plus the trace of the energy-momentum
  tensor $T$, regarding the functional form
  $f(R,T)=R+2f(T)$ with $f(T)=8\pi G\lambda T$.
  For this purpose, we utilize recently available data,
  including cosmic microwave background, weak lensing, supernovae,
  baryon acoustic oscillations, and redshift-space distortions
  measurements, together with forcasted gravitational wave
  (GW) data from Laser Interferometer Space Antenna (LISA).
  Notably, we examine the potentiality of simulated GW data
  from LISA standard sirens (SS) sources to enhance
  cosmological constraints on the $f(R,T)$ model parameters.
  In this regard, we create three LISA mock catalogs,
  namely Pop III, Delay, and No Delay, to improve the
  obtained constraints on cosmological parameters of $f(R,T)$
  gravity from current observations. Numerical analysis
  reveals that mock GW data from LISA SS sources
  make marginal improvements on constraining the $f(R,T)$
  model cosmological parameters.</description>

      <title>Universal finite-size scaling in the extraordinary-log boundary phase of three-dimensional $O(N)$ model</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.05089v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recent advances in boundary critical phenomena have led to the discovery of a new surface universality class in the three-dimensional $O(N)$ model. The newly found ``extraordinary-log" phase can be realized on a two-dimensional surface for $N&lt; N_c$, with $N_c&gt;3$, and on a plane defect embedded into a three-dimensional system, for any $N$. One of the key features of the extraordinary-log phase is the presence of logarithmic violations of standard finite-size scaling. In this work we study finite-size scaling in the extraordinary-log universality class by means of Monte Carlo simulations of an improved lattice model. We simulate the model with open boundary conditions, realizing the extraordinary-log phase on the surface for $N=2,3$, as well as with fully periodic boundary conditions and in the presence of a plane defect for $N=2,3,4$. In line with theory predictions, renormalization-group invariant observables studied here exhibit a logarithmic dependence on the size of the system. We numerically access not only the leading term in the $\beta$-function governing these logarithmic violations, but also the subleading term, which controls the evolution of the boundary phase diagram as a function of $N$.</description>

      <title>(2+1) Lorentzian quantum cosmology from spin-foams: opportunities and obstacles for semi-classicality</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.08109</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.08109v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We construct an effective cosmological spin-foam model for a (2+1) dimensional spatially flat universe, discretized on a hypercubical lattice, containing both space- and time-like regions. Our starting point is the recently proposed coherent state spin-foam model for (2+1) Lorentzian quantum gravity. The full amplitude is assumed to factorize into single vertex amplitudes with boundary data corresponding to Lorentzian 3-frusta. A stationary phase approximation is performed at each vertex individually, where the inverse square root of the Hessian determinant serves as a measure for the effective path integral. Additionally, a massive scalar field is coupled to the geometry, and we show that its mass renders the partition function convergent. For a single 3-frustum with time-like struts, we compute the expectation value of the bulk strut length and show that it generically agrees with the classical solutions and that it is a discontinuous function of the scalar field mass. Allowing the struts to be space-like introduces causality violations, which drive the expectation values away from the classical solutions due to the lack of an exponential suppression of these configurations. This is a direct consequence of the semi-classical amplitude only containing the real part of deficit angles, in contrast with the Lorentzian Regge action used in effective spin-foams. We give an outlook on how to evaluate the partition function on an extended discretization including a bulk spatial slice. This serves as a foundation for future investigations of physically interesting scenarios such as a quantum bounce or the viability of massive scalar field clocks. Our results demonstrate that the effective path integral in the causally regular sector serves as a viable quantum cosmology model, but that the agreement of expectation values with classical solutions is tightly bound to the path integral measure.</description>

      <title>Singularity resolution in spherically reduced 2D semiclassical gravity with negative central charge</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.10523</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.10523v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We analyze the semiclassical Schwarzschild geometry in the Boulware quantum state in the framework of two-dimensional (2D) dilaton gravity. The classical model is defined by the spherical reduction of Einstein's gravity sourced with conformal scalar fields. The expectation value of the stress-energy tensor in the Boulware state is singular at the classical horizon of the Schwarzschild spacetime, but when backreaction effects are considered, previous results have shown that the 2D geometry is horizonless and described by a non-symmetric wormhole with a curvature singularity on the other side of the throat. In this work we show that reversing the sign of the central charge of the conformal matter removes the curvature singularity of the 2D backreacted geometry, which happens to be horizonless and asymptotically flat. This result is consistent with a similar analysis recently performed for the CGHS model. We also argue the physical significance of negative central charges in conformal anomalies from a four-dimensional perspective.</description>

      <title>Dark Universe inspired by the Kaluza-Klein gravity and impact on Primordial Gravitational Waves</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.14176</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.14176v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We explore the potential implications of Kaluza-Klein (KK) gravity in unifying the dark sector of the Universe. Through dimensional reduction in KK gravity, the 5D spacetime framework can be reformulated in terms of a 4D spacetime metric, along with additional scalar and vector fields. From the 4D perspective, this suggests the existence of a tower of particle states, including KK gravitons with spin-0 and spin-1 states, in addition to the massless spin-2 gravitons of general relativity (GR). The key idea in the present paper is the analogy with superconductivity theory. By assuming a minimal coupling between an additional complex scalar field and the gauge field, a "mass" term emerges for the spin-1 gravitons. This, in turn, leads to long-range gravitational effects that could modify Newton's law of gravity through Yukawa-type corrections. Assuming an environment-dependent mass for the spin-1 graviton, near the galactic center the repulsive force from this spin-1 graviton is suppressed by an additional attractive component from Newton's constant corrections, resulting in a Newtonian-like, attraction-dominated effect. In the galaxy's outer regions, the repulsive force fades due to its short range, making dark matter appear only as an effective outcome of the dominant attractive corrections. This approach also explains dark matter's emergence as an apparent effects on cosmological scales while our model is equivalent to the scalar-vector-tensor gravity theory. Finally, we examine the impact of dark matter on the primordial gravitational wave (PGW) spectrum and show that it is sensitive to dark matter effects, providing an opportunity to test this theory through future GW observatories.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.07383v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The Nishimori point of the random bond Ising model is a prototype of renormalization group fixed points with strong disorder. We show that the exact correlation length and crossover critical exponents at this point can be identified in two and three spatial dimensions starting from properties of the Nishimori line. These are the first exact exponents for frustrated random magnets, a circumstance to be also contrasted with the fact that the exact exponents of the Ising model without disorder are not known in three dimensions. Our considerations extend to higher dimensions and models other than Ising.</description>

      <title>Tripartite Haar random state has no bipartite entanglement</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.04437v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We show that no EPR-like bipartite entanglement can be distilled from a tripartite Haar random state $|\Psi\rangle_{ABC}$ by local unitaries or local operations when each subsystem $A$, $B$, or $C$ has fewer than half of the total qubits. Specifically, we derive an upper bound on the probability of sampling a state with EPR-like entanglement at a given EPR fidelity tolerance, showing a doubly-exponential suppression in the number of qubits. Our proof relies on a simple volume argument supplemented by an $\epsilon$-net argument and concentration of measure. Viewing $|\Psi\rangle_{ABC}$ as a bipartite quantum error-correcting code $C\to AB$, this implies that neither output subsystem $A$ nor $B$ supports any non-trivial logical operator. We also discuss a physical interpretation in the AdS/CFT correspondence, indicating that a connected entanglement wedge does not necessarily imply bipartite entanglement, contrary to a previous belief.</description>

      <title>Low-Acceleration Gravitational Anomaly from Bayesian 3D Modeling of Wide Binary Orbits: Methodology and Results with Gaia DR3</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.09373</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.09373v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Isolated wide binary stars provide natural laboratories to directly probe gravity for Newtonian acceleration $g_{\rm{N}}\lesssim 10^{-9}$ m s$^{-2}$. Recent statistical analyses of wide binaries have been performed only with sky-projected relative velocities $v_p$ in the pairs. A new method of Bayesian orbit modeling exploiting three relative velocity components including the radial (line-of-sight) component $v_r$ is developed to measure a gravitational anomaly parameter $\Gamma\equiv\log_{10}\sqrt{\gamma_g}\equiv\log_{10}\sqrt{G_{\rm{eff}}/G_{\rm{N}}}$ where $G_{\rm{eff}}$ is the effective gravitational constant for pseudo-Newtonian elliptical orbits, while $G_{\rm{N}}$ is Newton's constant. The method infers individual probability distributions of $\Gamma$ and then combines the independent distributions to obtain a consolidated distribution in a specific range of $g_{\rm{N}}$. Here the method is described and applied to a sample of 312 wide binaries in a broad dynamic range $10^{-11.0}\lesssim g_{\rm{N}}\lesssim 10^{-6.7}$ m s$^{-2}$ with $v_r$ uncertainties in the range $168&lt;\sigma_{v_r}&lt;380$ m s$^{-1}$ selected from the Gaia DR3 database. The following results are obtained: $\Gamma = 0.000\pm 0.011$ ($N_{\rm{binary}}=125$) for a high acceleration regime ($10^{-7.9} \lesssim g_{\rm{N}} \lesssim 10^{-6.7}$ m s$^{-2}$) agreeing well with Newton, but $\Gamma = 0.085\pm 0.040$ or $\gamma_g=1.48_{-0.23}^{+0.33}$ (35) for a MOND regime ($10^{-11.0}\lesssim g_{\rm{N}}\lesssim 10^{-9.5}$ m s$^{-2}$) and $\Gamma = 0.063\pm 0.015$ or $\gamma_g=1.34_{-0.08}^{+0.10}$ (111) for a MOND+transition regime ($10^{-11.0}\lesssim g_{\rm{N}}\lesssim 10^{-8.5}$ m s$^{-2}$). These results show that gravitational anomaly is evident for $g_{\rm{N}}\lesssim 10^{-9}$ m s$^{-2}$ and $\Gamma$ in the MOND regime ($\lesssim 10^{-9.5}$ m s$^{-2}$) agrees with the prediction ($\approx 0.07$) of MOND gravity theories.</description>

      <title>The stochastic gravitational wave background from cosmic superstrings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.10361</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.10361v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the stochastic gravitational wave background sourced by a network of cosmic superstrings and demonstrate that incorporating higher-mass string species, beyond the fundamental string, is crucial for accurately modelling the resulting gravitational wave spectrum across frequencies ranging from nanohertz to kilohertz. Using the multi-tension velocity-dependent one-scale model to evolve the cosmic superstring network, we perform several fits to the NANOGrav 15-year dataset and obtain expectation values for the fundamental string tension, string coupling and effective size of compact extra dimensions. We find that the cosmic superstring best-fits are comparable in likelihood to Supermassive Black Hole models, thought by many to be the leading candidate explanation of the signal. The implications of the best-fit spectra are discussed within the context of future gravitational wave experiments. We obtain expectation values for the fundamental string tension of $\log_{10}(G\mu_1)=-11.4^{+0.3}_{-0.2}$($-11.5^{+0.3}_{-0.2}$) for gravitational waves originating from large cuspy (kinky) cosmic superstring loops and $\log_{10}(G\mu_1)=-9.7^{+0.7}_{-0.7}$($-9.9^{+1.0}_{-0.5}$) for small cuspy (kinky) loops. We also place $2\sigma$ upper bounds on the string coupling, finding $g_s&lt;0.7$ in all cases, and comment on the implication of our results for the effective size of the compact extra dimensions.</description>

      <title>First Measurement of Entanglement Dynamics in the SYK Model using Quantum Computers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.18580</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.18580v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The Sachdev-Ye-Kitaev (SYK) model, fundamental to quantum chaos, many-body physics, and holographic duality, exhibits both maximal chaos and exact solvability, yet its entanglement entropy has never been measured experimentally. Here, we present the first measurement of entanglement entropy growth under the SYK Hamiltonian using IBM's superconducting quantum computer as a programmable quantum platform. We implement an optimized swap-based many-body interference protocol tailored for limited qubit connectivity to measure entanglement entropy. Additionally, we enhance the randomized measurement protocol for entropy measurement by expanding the unitary ensemble, which increases the circuit volume and pushes the capability of the near-term devices. However, we tackle this challenge by employing a quantum multi-programming strategy that parallelizes circuit execution. This work paves the way for exploring chaotic quantum dynamics and establishes scalable methods for investigating complex entanglement growth on current quantum platforms.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.24250v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Grand unification possibilities in Nambu-Jona-Lasinio-like models are studied. To address the problem of vector boson masses and nonrenormalizability of the theory, algebraic formalism encompassing the effective action, Schwinger-Keldysh path integral, and Bogoliubov-Parasiuk-Hepp-Zimmerman renormalization is constructed. A new NJL-like model: the theory of current metric field interacting with fermions is proposed. Bosonization in this model can produce massless vector bosons under certain conditions which makes it a candidate grand unified theory. Both Higgs and non-Higgs effects can contribute to particle masses.</description>

      <title>A new approach for simulating PBH formation from generic curvature fluctuations with the Misner-Sharp formalism</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.05813</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.05813v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Primordial Black Holes (PBHs) may have formed in the early Universe due to the collapse of super-horizon curvature fluctuations. Simulations of PBH formation have been essential for inferring the initial conditions that lead to black hole formation and for studying their properties and impact on our Universe. The Misner-Sharp formalism is commonly used as a standard approach for these simulations. Recently, type-II fluctuations, characterized by a non-monotonic areal radius, have gained interest. In the standard Misner-Sharp approach for simulating PBH formation with these fluctuations, the evolution equations exhibit divergent terms ($0/0$), which complicate and prevent the simulations. We formulate a new approach to overcome this issue in a simple manner by using the trace of the extrinsic curvature as an auxiliary variable, allowing simulations of type-II fluctuations within the Misner-Sharp formalism. Using a set of standard exponential-shaped curvature profiles, we apply our new approach and numerical code based on pseudospectral methods to study the time evolution of the gravitational collapse, threshold values of type A/B PBHs and PBH mass. Interestingly, we identify cases of type-II fluctuations that do not necessarily result in PBH formation.</description>

      <title>The threshold for PBH formation in the type-II region and its analytical estimation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.05814</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.05814v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We numerically simulate the formation of Primordial Black Holes (PBHs) in a radiation-dominated Universe under the assumption of spherical symmetry, driven by the collapse of adiabatic fluctuations, for different curvature profiles $\zeta$. Our results show that the threshold for PBH formation, defined as the peak value of the critical compaction function $\mathcal{C}_{c}(r_m)$ (where $r_m$ is the scale at which the peak occurs), does not asymptotically saturate to its maximum possible value in the type-I region for sufficiently sharp profiles. Instead, the threshold is found in the type-II region with $\mathcal{C}_{c}(r_m)$ being a minimum. We find, for the cases tested, that this is a general trend associated with profiles that exhibit extremely large curvatures in the linear component of the compaction function $\mathcal{C}_{l}(r) \equiv -4r \zeta'(r)/3$ shape around its peak $r_m$ (spiky shapes). To measure this curvature at $r_m$, we define a dimensionless parameter: $\kappa \equiv -r^{2}_m \mathcal{C}_l''(r_m)$, and we find that the thresholds observed in the type-II region occur for $\kappa \gtrsim 30$ for the profiles we have used. By defining the threshold in terms of $\mathcal{C}_{l,c}(r_m)$, we extend previous analytical estimations to the type-II region, which is shown to be accurate within a few percent when compared to the numerical simulations for the tested profiles. Our results suggest that current PBH abundance calculations for models where the threshold lies in the type-II region may have been overestimated due to the general assumption that it should saturate at the boundary between the type-I and type-II regions.</description>
