      <title>Relating the modular Hamiltonian to two-point functions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.09669</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.09669v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider the modular Hamiltonian associated to standard subspaces for a free scalar field in a globally hyperbolic spacetime in an arbitrary Gaussian state. We show how the modular Hamiltonian is related to the two-point function of the theory. For the restriction of the modular Hamiltonian to the subspace, we recover formulas that were obtained previously by Casini and Huerta. Lastly, we show how the same results can be obtained more directly from the KMS condition.</description>

      <title>Soliton Resonances in Four Dimensional Wess-Zumino-Witten Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.08250</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.08250v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present two kinds of resonance soliton solutions on the Ultrahyperbolic space $\mathbb{U}$ for the G=U(2) Yang equation which is equivalent to the anti-self-dual Yang-Mills (ASDYM) equation. We reveal and illustrate the solitonic behaviors in four-dimensional Wess-Zumino-Witten (WZW$_4$) model through the sigma model action densities. The WZW$_4$ model on $\mathbb{U}$ describes a string field theory action of open N=2 string theories and hence our solutions suggest the existence of the corresponding classical objects in the N=2 string theories. Our solutions include multiple-pole solutions and V-shape soliton solutions. The V-shape solitons suggest annihilation and creation process of two solitons and would be building blocks to classify the ASDYM solitons, like the role of Y-shape solitons in classification of the KP (line) solitons.
  We also clarify the relationship between the Cauchy matrix approach and the binary Darboux transformation in terms of quasideterminants. Our formalism can start with a simpler input data for the soliton solutions and hence might give a suitable framework of the classification of the ASDYM solitons.</description>

      <title>Higher Representations and Quark Confinement</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.09069</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.09069v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The concept of a (de)confined phase in QFT is well-defined in the presence of $1$-form symmetries and their spontaneous symmetry breaking. However, in scenarios where such symmetries are absent, confinement is not a well-defined phase property. In this work, we propose that, when restricting to a specific submanifold of the parameter space - namely at zero temperature and fixed quark mass - the confined and color-superconducting (CSC) phases of scalar QCD can be distinguished through the different organization of their spectra, as seen from the perspective of the baryon symmetry. The analysis is performed in terms of an appropriate higher-categorical representation theory, recently developed for generalized symmetries. Consistent with expectations, we find that the confined phase permits only particles with integer baryon charges, while the CSC phase is characterized by the coexistence of bare quarks and vortices, exhibiting a non-trivial Aharonov-Bohm effect between these excitations.</description>

      <title>Pseudo-real quantum fields</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.09111</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.09111v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce the concept of pseudo-reality for complex numbers. We show that this concept, applied to quantum fields, provides a unifying framework for two distinct approaches to pseudo-Hermitian quantum field theories. The first approach stems from analytically continuing Hermitian theories into the complex plane, while the second is based on constructing them from first principles. The pseudo-reality condition for bosonic fields resolves a long-standing problem with the formulation of gauge theories involving pseudo-Hermitian currents, sheds new light on the resolution of the so-called Hermiticity Puzzle, and leads to a consistent minimal coupling of pseudo-Hermitian quantum field theories to gravity. These results contribute significantly to the ongoing development of the first-principles construction of pseudo-Hermitian quantum field theories, including their formulation in curved spacetimes.</description>

      <title>Relationship between total reflection and Fabry-Perot bound states in the continuum</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.09207</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.09207v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Bound states in the continuum (BICs) have interesting properties and important applications in photonics. A particular class of BICs are found in Fabry-Perot (FP) cavities formed by two parallel periodic dielectric layers separated by a distance $h$. A periodic dielectric layer can totally reflect a plane incident wave with a particular frequency and a particular wavenumber. Existing FP-BICs are found when $h$ is close to the values deduced from a phase-matching condition related to the reflection coefficient, but they are obtained in FP-cavities where the periodic layers have a reflection symmetry in the periodic direction. In this paper, we further clarify the connection between total reflections and FP-BICs. Our numerical results indicate that if the wavenumber is zero or the periodic layers have a reflection symmetry in the periodic direction, FP-BICs can indeed be found near the parameters of total reflections. However, if the wavenumber is nonzero and the periodic layer is asymmetric (in the periodic direction), we are unable to find a FP-BIC (with a frequency and a wavenumber near those of a total reflection) by tuning $h$ or other structural parameters. Consequently, a total reflection does not always lead to a FP-BIC even when the parameters of the FP-cavity are tuned.</description>

      <title>Invariant Reduction for Partial Differential Equations. II: The General Mechanism</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.09313</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.09313v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A mechanism of reduction of symmetry-invariant conservation laws, presymplectic structures, and variational principles of partial differential equations (PDEs) is proposed. The mechanism applies for an arbitrary PDE system that admits a local (point, contact, or higher) symmetry, and relates symmetry-invariant conservation laws, as well as presymplectic structures, variational principles, etc., to their analogs for systems that describe the corresponding invariant solutions. A version of Noether's theorem for the PDE system satisfied by symmetry-invariant solutions is presented. Several detailed examples, including cases of point and higher symmetry invariance, are considered.</description>

      <title>Pretty-good simulation of all quantum measurements by projective measurements</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.09339</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.09339v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In quantum theory general measurements are described by so-called Positive Operator-Valued Measures (POVMs). We show that in $d$-dimensional quantum systems an application of depolarizing noise with constant (independent of $d$) visibility parameter makes any POVM simulable by a randomized implementation of projective measurements that do not require any auxiliary systems to be realized.
  This result significantly limits the asymptotic advantage that POVMs can offer over projective measurements in various information-processing tasks, including state discrimination, shadow tomography or quantum metrology. We also apply our findings to questions originating from quantum foundations by asymptotically improving the range of visibilities for which noisy pure states of two qudits admit a local model for generalized measurements. As a byproduct, we give asymptotically tight (in terms of dimension) bounds on critical visibility for which all POVMs are jointly measurable.
  On the technical side we use recent advances in POVM simulation, the solution to the celebrated Kadison-Singer problem, and a method of approximate implementation of nearly projective POVMs by a convex combination of projective measurements, which we call dimension-deficient Naimark theorem. Finally, some of our intermediate results show (on information-theoretic grounds) the existence of circuit-knitting strategies allowing to simulate general $2N$ qubit circuits by randomization of subcircuits operating on $N+1$ qubit systems, with a constant (independent of $N$) probabilistic overhead.</description>

      <title>Cosmological Solutions in Scalar-Tensor theory via the Eisenhart-Duval lift</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.09356</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.09356v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We implement the Einsenhart-Duval lift in scalar-tensor gravity as a means to construct integrable cosmological models and analytic cosmological solutions. Specifically, we employ a geometric criterion to constrain the free functions of the scalar-tensor theory such that the field equations can be written in the equivalent form of linear equations. This geometric linearization is achieved by the introduction of an extended minisuperspace description. The results are applied to construct analytic solutions in modified theories of gravity such as the $f\left( R\right) $-theory and the hybrid metric-Palatini $f\left( \mathcal{R}\right) $-gravity.</description>

      <title>Quantum algorithm for the gradient of a logarithm-determinant</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.09413</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.09413v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The logarithm-determinant is a common quantity in many areas of physics and computer science. Derivatives of the logarithm-determinant compute physically relevant quantities in statistical physics models, quantum field theories, as well as the inverses of matrices. A multi-variable version of the quantum gradient algorithm is developed here to evaluate the derivative of the logarithm-determinant. From this, the inverse of a sparse-rank input operator may be determined efficiently. Measuring an expectation value of the quantum state--instead of all $N^2$ elements of the input operator--can be accomplished in $O(k\sigma)$ time in the idealized case for $k$ relevant eigenvectors of the input matrix. A factor $\sigma=\frac1{\varepsilon^3}$ or $-\frac1{\varepsilon^2}\log_2\varepsilon$ depends on the version of the quantum Fourier transform used for a precision $\varepsilon$. Practical implementation of the required operator will likely need $\log_2N$ overhead, giving an overall complexity of $O(k\sigma\log_2 N)$. The method applies widely and converges super-linearly in $k$ when the condition number is high. For non-sparse-rank inputs, the algorithm can be evaluated provided that an equal superposition of eigenstates is provided. The output is given in $O(1)$ queries of oracle, which is given explicitly here and only relies on time-evolution operators that can be implemented with arbitrarily small error. The algorithm is envisioned for fully error-corrected quantum computers but may be implementable on near-term machines. We discuss how this algorithm can be used for kernel-based quantum machine-learning.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2501.09498v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a closed-form expression for the contribution of surface defects to the supersymmetric R\'enyi entropy in six-dimensional $(2,0)$ theories. Our results show that this defect contribution is a linear function of $1/n$ and is directly proportional to $2b-d_2$, where $b$ and $d_2$ are the surface defect Weyl anomaly coefficients. We also derive a closed-form expression for the defect contribution to the supersymmetric Casimir energy, which simplifies to $-d_2$ (up to a proportionality constant) in the chiral algebra limit.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2501.09610v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This study explores the applications of the Prouhet-Thue-Morse (PTM) sequence in quantum computing, highlighting its mathematical elegance and practical relevance. We demonstrate the critical role of the PTM sequence in quantum error correction, in noise-resistant quantum memories, and in providing insights into quantum chaos. Notably, we demonstrate how the PTM sequence naturally appears in Ising X-X interacting systems, leading to a proposed robust encoding of quantum memories in such systems. Furthermore, connections to number theory, including the Riemann zeta function, bridge quantum computing with pure mathematics. Our findings emphasize the PTM sequence's importance in understanding the mathematical structure of quantum computing systems and the development of the full potential of quantum technologies and invite further interdisciplinary research.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2501.09627v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In four spacetime dimensions, the classically integrable self-dual sectors of gauge theory and gravity have associated chiral algebras, which emerge naturally from their description in twistor space. We show that there are similar chiral algebras associated to integrable sectors of gauge theory and gravity whenever the spacetime dimension is an integer multiple of four. In particular, the hyperk\"ahler sector of gravity and the hyperholomorphic sector of gauge theory in $4m$-dimensions have well-known twistor descriptions giving rise to chiral algebras. Using twistor sigma models to describe these sectors, we demonstrate that the chiral algebras in higher-dimensions also arise as soft symmetry algebras under a certain notion of collinear limit. Interestingly, the chiral algebras and collinear limits in higher-dimensions are defined on the 2-sphere, rather than the full celestial sphere.</description>

      <title>Optimal paths and dynamical symmetry breaking in the current fluctuations of driven diffusive media</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.09629v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Large deviation theory provides a framework to understand macroscopic fluctuations and collective phenomena in many-body nonequilibrium systems in terms of microscopic dynamics. In these lecture notes we discuss the large deviation statistics of the current, a central observable out of equilibrium, using mostly macroscopic fluctuation theory (MFT) but also microscopic spectral methods. Special emphasis is put on describing the optimal path leading to a rare fluctuation, as well as on different dynamical symmetry breaking phenomena that appear at the fluctuating level. We start with an overview of trajectory statistics in driven diffusive systems as described by MFT. We discuss the additivity principle, a simplifying conjecture to compute the current distribution in one-dimensional nonequilibrium systems, and extend this idea to higher dimensions, where the nonlocal structure of the optimal current vector field becomes crucial. Next we explore dynamical phase transitions (DPTs) in current fluctuations, which manifest as symmetry-breaking events in trajectory statistics. These include particle-hole symmetry-breaking DPTs in open channels, for which we work out a Landau-like theory as well as the joint statistics of the current and the order parameter. Time-translation symmetry-breaking DPTs in periodic systems are also discussed, where coherent traveling condensates emerge to facilitate current deviations. We also discuss the microscopic spectral mechanism leading to these DPTs, which is linked to an emerging degeneracy of the leading eigenspace. Using this spectral perspective, we find the signatures of the recently discovered time-crystal phases of matter in traveling-wave DPTs, and use Doob's transform to propose a packing-field mechanism to create programmable time-crystals in driven systems. Finally, we address open challenges and future directions in this rapidly evolving field.</description>

      <title>Quantum Contextual Hypergraphs, Operators, Inequalities, and Applications in Higher Dimensions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.09637</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.09637v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Quantum contextuality plays a significant role in supporting quantum computation and quantum information theory. The key tools for this are the Kochen--Specker and non-Kochen--Specker contextual sets. Traditionally, their representation has been predominantly operator-based, mainly focusing on specific constructs in dimensions ranging from three to eight. However, nearly all of these constructs can be represented as low-dimensional hypergraphs. This study demonstrates how to generate contextual hypergraphs in any dimension using various methods, particularly those that do not scale in complexity with increasing dimensions. Furthermore, we introduce innovative examples of hypergraphs extending to dimension 32. Our methodology reveals the intricate structural properties of hypergraphs, enabling precise quantifications of contextuality of implemented sets. Additionally, we investigate several promising applications of hypergraphs in quantum communication and quantum computation, paving the way for future breakthroughs in the field.</description>

      <title>Faber-Krahn inequality for the heat content on quantum graphs via random walk expansion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.09693</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.09693v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the heat content on quantum graphs and investigate whether an analogon of the Rayleigh-Faber-Krahn inequality holds. This means that heat content at time $T$ among graphs of equal volume would be maximized by intervals (the graph analogon of balls as in the classic Rayleigh-Faber-Krahn inequality). We prove that this holds at extremal times, that is at small and at large times. For this, we employ two complementary approaches: In the large time regime, we rely on a spectral-theoretic approach, using Mercer's theorem whereas the small-time regime is dealt with by a random walk approach using the Feynman-Kac formula and Brownian motions on metric graphs. In particular, in proving the latter, we develop a new expression for the heat content as a positive linear combination of expected return times of (discrete) random walks - a formulation which seems to yield additional insights compared to previously available methods such as the celebrated Roth formula and which is crucial for our proof. The question whether a Rayleigh-Faber-Krahn inequality for the heat content on metric graphs holds at all times remains open.</description>

      <title>Belavkin-Staszewski Quantum Markov Chains</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.09708v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: It is well-known that the conditional mutual information of a quantum state is zero if, and only if, the quantum state is a quantum Markov chain. Replacing the Umegaki relative entropy in the definition of the conditional mutual information by the Belavkin-Staszewski (BS) relative entropy, we obtain the BS-conditional mutual information, and we call the states with zero BS-conditional mutual information Belavkin-Staszewski quantum Markov chains. In this article, we establish a correspondence which relates quantum Markov chains and BS-quantum Markov chains. This correspondence allows us to find a recovery map for the BS-relative entropy in the spirit of the Petz recovery map. Moreover, we prove a structural decomposition of the Belavkin-Staszewski quantum Markov chains and also study states for which the BS-conditional mutual information is only approximately zero. As an application, we show that the conditional mutual information of the state associated to the Gibbs state of a quantum spin chain with local, finite-range, translation-invariant interactions at any positive temperature via this new correspondence decays superexponentially fast with the size of the middle system.</description>

      <title>Exact Parent Hamiltonians for All Landau Level States in a Half-flux Lattice</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.09742</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.09742v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Realizing topological flat bands with tailored single-particle Hilbert spaces is a critical step toward exploring many-body phases, such as those featuring anyonic excitations. One prominent example is the Kapit-Mueller model, a variant of the Harper-Hofstadter model that stabilizes lattice analogs of the lowest Landau level states. The Kapit-Mueller model is constructed based on the Poisson summation rule, an exact lattice sum rule for coherent states. In this work, we consider higher Landau-level generalizations of the Poisson summation rule, from which we derive families of parent Hamiltonians on a half-flux lattice which have exact flat bands whose flatband wavefunctions are lattice version of higher Landau level states. Focusing on generic Bravais lattices with only translation and inversion symmetries, we discuss how these symmetries enforced gaplessness and singular points for odd Landau level series, and how to achieve fully gapped parent Hamiltonians by mixing even and odd series. Our model points to a large class of tight-binding models with suitable energetic and quantum geometries that are potentially useful for realizing non-Abelian fractionalized states when interactions are included. The model exhibits fast decay hopping amplitudes, making it potentially realizable with neutral atoms in optical lattices.</description>

      <title>Coming full circle -- A unified framework for Kochen-Specker contextuality</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.09750</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.09750v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Contextuality is a key distinguishing feature between classical and quantum physics. It expresses a fundamental obstruction to describing quantum theory using classical concepts. In turn, when understood as a resource for quantum computation, it is expected to hold the key to quantum advantage. Yet, despite its long recognised importance in quantum foundations and, more recently, in quantum computation, the mathematics of contextuality has remained somewhat elusive - different frameworks address different aspects of the phenomenon, yet their precise relationship often is unclear. In fact, there is a glaring discrepancy already between the original notion of contextuality introduced by Kochen and Specker on the one side [J. Math. Mech., 17, 59, (1967)], and the modern approach of studying contextual correlations on the other [Rev. Mod. Phys., 94, 045007 (2022)].
  In a companion paper [arXiv:2408.16764], we introduce the conceptually new tool called ``context connections'', which allows to cast and analyse Kochen-Specker (KS) contextuality in new form. Here, we generalise this notion, and based on it prove a complete characterisation of KS contextuality for finite-dimensional systems. To this end, we develop the framework of ``observable algebras". We show in detail how this framework subsumes the marginal and graph-theoretic approaches to contextuality, and thus that it offers a unified perspective on KS contextuality. In particular, we establish the precise relationships between the various notions of ``contextuality" used in the respective settings, and in doing so, generalise a number of results on the characterisation of the respective notions in the literature.</description>

      <title>Normalized ground states for the NLS equation with combined nonlinearities</title>

      <description>arXiv:1811.00826v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study existence and properties of ground states for the nonlinear Schr\"odinger equation with combined power nonlinearities \[ -\Delta u= \lambda u + \mu |u|^{q-2} u + |u|^{p-2} u \qquad \text{in $\mathbb{R}^N$, $N \ge 1$,} \] having prescribed mass \[ \int_{\mathbb{R}^N} |u|^2 = a^2. \] Under different assumptions on $q&lt;p$, $a&gt;0$ and $\mu \in \mathbb{R}$ we prove several existence and stability/instability results. In particular, we consider cases when \[ 2&lt;q \le 2+ \frac{4}{N} \le p&lt;2^*, \quad q \neq p, \] i.e. the two nonlinearities have different character with respect to the $L^2$-critical exponent. These cases present substantial differences with respect to purely subcritical or supercritical situations, which were already studied in the literature.
  We also give new criteria for global existence and finite time blow-up in the associated dispersive equation.</description>

Abstract: We compute analytically the probability distribution and moments of the sum and product of the non-zero eigenvalues and singular values of random matrices with (i) non-negative entries, (ii) fixed rank, and (iii) prescribed sums of the entries in each row. Applications of such matrices are discussed in the context of Markov chains, economics and social networks to name a few. All results are valid at finite matrix size and are given in terms of the statistics of vectors of general Dirichlet random variables. Analytical results are corroborated by numerical simulations throughout with excellent agreement.</description>

      <title>Cubic Dirac operator for $U_q(\mathfrak{sl}_2)$</title>

      <description>arXiv:2209.09591v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We construct the $q$-deformed Clifford algebra of $\mathfrak{sl}_2$ and study its properties. This allows us to define the $q$-deformed noncommutative Weil algebra $\mathcal{W}_q(\mathfrak{sl}_2)$ for $U_q(\mathfrak{sl}_2)$ and the corresponding cubic Dirac operator $D_q$. In the classical case it was done by Alekseev and Meinrenken. We show that the cubic Dirac operator $D_q$ is invariant with respect to the $U_q(\mathfrak{sl}_2)$-action and *-structures on $\mathcal{W}_q(\mathfrak{sl}_2)$, moreover, the square of $D_q$ is central in $\mathcal{W}_q(\mathfrak{sl}_2)$. We compute the spectrum of the cubic element on finite-dimensional and Verma modules of~$U_q(\mathfrak{sl}_2)$ and the corresponding Dirac cohomology.</description>

      <title>The fuzzy Potts model in the plane: Scaling limits and arm exponents</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2209.12529</link>
      <description>arXiv:2209.12529v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We consider a critical Fortuin-Kasteleyn (FK) percolation with cluster weight $q \in [1,4)$ in the plane, and color its clusters in red (respectively blue) with probability $r \in (0,1)$ (respectively $1-r$), independently of each other. We study the resulting fuzzy Potts model, which corresponds to the critical Ising model in the special case $q=2$ and $r=1/2$. We show that under the assumption that the critical FK percolation converges to a conformally invariant scaling limit (which is known to hold for the FK-Ising model, i.e. $q=2$), the obtained coloring converges to variants of Conformal Loop Ensembles constructed, described and studied by Miller, Sheffield and Werner. Based on discrete considerations, we also show that the arm exponents for this coloring in the discrete model are identical to the ones of the continuum model. Using the values of these arm exponents in the continuum, we determine the arm exponents for the fuzzy Potts model.</description>

Abstract: We give a proof of Local Decay Estimates for Schr\"odinger type equations, which is based on the knowledge of Asymptotic Completeness (AC). This approach extends to time dependent potential perturbations, as it does not rely on Resolvent Estimates or related methods. Global in time Strichartz estimates follow for quasi-periodic time-dependent potentials from our results.</description>

      <title>Topological origin of non-Hermitian skin effect in higher dimensions and uniform spectra</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.12022</link>
      <description>arXiv:2306.12022v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The non-Hermitian skin effect is an iconic phenomenon characterized by the aggregation of eigenstates near the system boundaries in non-Hermitian systems. While extensively studied in one dimension, understanding the skin effect and extending the non-Bloch band theory to higher dimensions encounters a formidable challenge, primarily due to infinite lattice geometries or open boundary conditions. This work adopts a point-gap perspective and unveils that non-Hermitian skin effect in all spatial dimensions originates from point gaps. We introduce the concept of uniform spectra and reveal that regardless of lattice geometry, their energy spectra are universally given by the uniform spectra, even though their manifestations of skin modes may differ. Building on the uniform spectra, we demonstrate how to account for the skin effect with generic lattice cuts and establish the connections of skin modes across different geometric shapes via momentum-basis transformations. Our findings highlight the pivotal roles point gaps play, offering a unified understanding of the topological origin of non-Hermitian skin effect in all dimensions.</description>

      <title>Noise-like analytic properties of imaginary chaos</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.14942</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.14942v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this note we continue the study of imaginary multiplicative chaos $\mu_\beta := \exp(i \beta \Gamma)$, where $\Gamma$ is a two-dimensional continuum Gaussian free field. We concentrate here on the fine-scale analytic properties of $|\mu_\beta(Q(x,r))|$ as $r \to 0$, where $Q(x,r)$ is a square of side-length $2r$ centred at $x$. More precisely, we prove monofractality of this process, a law of the iterated logarithm as $r \to 0$ and analyse its exceptional points, which have a close connection to fast points of Brownian motion. Some of the technical ideas developed to address these questions also help us pin down the exact Besov regularity of imaginary chaos, a question left open in [JSW20]. All the mentioned properties illustrate the noise-like behaviour of the imaginary chaos. We conclude by proving that the processes $x \mapsto |\mu_\beta(Q(x,r))|^2$, when normalised additively and multiplicatively, converge as $r \to 0$ in law, but not in probability, to white noise; this suggests that all the information of the multiplicative chaos is contained in the angular parts of $\mu_\beta(Q(x,r))$.</description>

Abstract: We combine Hilbert module and algebraic techniques to give necessary and sufficient conditions for the existence of an Hermitian torsion-free connection on the bimodule of differential one-forms of a first order differential calculus. In the presence of the extra structure of a bimodule connection, we give sufficient conditions for uniqueness. We prove that any $\theta$-deformation of a compact Riemannian manifold admits a unique Hermitian torsion-free bimodule connection and provide an explicit construction of it. Specialising to classical Riemannian manifolds yields a novel construction of the Levi-Civita connection on the cotangent bundle.</description>

      <title>Free energy equivalence between mean-field models and nonsparsely diluted mean-field models</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.13245v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We studied nonsparsely diluted mean-field models that differ from sparsely diluted mean-field models, such as the Viana--Bray model. When the existence probability of each edge follows a Bernoulli distribution, we rigorously prove that the free energy of nonsparsely diluted mean-field models with appropriate parameterization coincides exactly with that of the corresponding mean-field models in ferromagnetic and spin-glass models composed of any discrete spin $S$ in the thermodynamic limit. Our results is a broad generalization of the result of a previous study [Bovier and Gayrard, J. Stat. Phys. 72, 643 (1993)], where the densely diluted mean-field ferromagnetic Ising model (diluted Curie--Weiss model) with appropriate parameterization was analyzed rigorously, and it was proven that its free energy was exactly equivalent to that of the corresponding mean-field model (Curie--Weiss model).</description>

      <description>arXiv:2408.10312v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In the tensor network approach to statistical physics, properties of the critical point of a 2D lattice model are encoded by a four-legged tensor which is a fixed point of an RG map. The traditional way to find the fixed point tensor consists in iterating the RG map after having tuned the temperature to criticality. Here we develop a different and more direct technique, which solves the fixed point equation via the Newton method. This is challenging due to the existence of marginal deformations -- linear transformations of the coordinate frame, which parametrize a two-dimensional family of fixed points. We address this challenge by including a 90 degree rotation into the RG map. This flips the sign of the problematic marginal eigenvalues, rendering the fixed point isolated and accessible via the Newton method. We demonstrate the power of this technique via explicit computations for the 2D Ising and 3-state Potts models. Using the Gilt-TNR algorithm at bond dimension $\chi=30$, we find the fixed point tensors with $10^{-9}$ accuracy, much higher than what was previously achieved.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.08266v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study infinite dimensional Lie algebras, whose infinite dimensional mutually commuting subalgebras correspond with the symmetry algebra of $2d$ integrable models. These Lie algebras are defined by the set of infinitesimal, nonlinear, and higher derivative symmetry transformations present in theories with a left(right)-moving or (anti)-holomorphic current. We study a large class of such Lagrangian theories. We study the commuting subalgebras of the $2d$ free massless scalar, and find the symmetries of the known integrable models such as sine-Gordon, Liouville, Bullough-Dodd, and Korteweg-de Vries. Along the way, we find several new sequences of commuting charges, which we conjecture are charges of integrable models which are new deformations of a single scalar. After quantizing, the Lie algebra is deformed, and so are their commuting subalgebras.</description>

      <title>A non-rational Verlinde formula from Virasoro TQFT</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.07285</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.07285v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We use the Virasoro TQFT to derive an integral identity that we view as a non-rational generalization of the Verlinde formula for the Virasoro algebra with central charge $c\geq 25$. The identity expresses the Virasoro fusion kernel as an integral over a ratio of modular S-kernels on the (punctured) torus. In particular, it shows that the one-point S-kernel diagonalizes the Virasoro $6j$ symbol. After carefully studying the analytic properties of this `Virasoro-Verlinde formula', we present three applications. In boundary Liouville CFT, the formula ensures the open-closed duality of the boundary one-point function on the annulus. In pure 3d gravity, it provides an essential step in computing the partition function on hyperbolic 3-manifolds that fiber over the circle. Lastly, in AdS$_3$/CFT$_2$, the formula computes a three-boundary torus wormhole, which leads to a prediction for the statistical correlation between the density of states and two OPE coefficients in the dual large-$c$ CFT ensemble. We conclude by discussing the implications of our result for the fusion rules in generic non-rational 2d CFTs.</description>

      <title>Quantum particle in the wrong box (or: the perils of finite-dimensional approximations)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.15889</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.15889v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: When numerically simulating the unitary time evolution of an infinite-dimensional quantum system, one is usually led to treat the Hamiltonian $H$ as an "infinite-dimensional matrix" by expressing it in some orthonormal basis of the Hilbert space, and then truncate it to some finite dimensions. However, the solutions of the Schr\"odinger equations generated by the truncated Hamiltonians need not converge, in general, to the solution of the Schr\"odinger equation corresponding to the actual Hamiltonian.
  In this paper we demonstrate that, under mild assumptions, they converge to the solution of the Schr\"odinger equation generated by a specific Hamiltonian which crucially depends on the particular choice of basis: the Friedrichs extension of the restriction of $H$ to the space of finite linear combinations of elements of the basis. Importantly, this is generally different from $H$ itself; in all such cases, numerical simulations will unavoidably reproduce the wrong dynamics in the limit, and yet there is no numerical test that can reveal this failure, unless one has the analytical solution to compare with.
  As a practical demonstration of such results, we consider the quantum particle in the box, and we show that, for a wide class of bases (which include associated Legendre polynomials as a concrete example) the dynamics generated by the truncated Hamiltonians will always converge to the one corresponding to the particle with Dirichlet boundary conditions, regardless the initial choice of boundary conditions. Other such examples are discussed.</description>

      <title>The discrete Painlev\'{e} XXXIV hierarchy arising from the gap probability distributions of Freud random matrix ensembles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.18782</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.18782v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We consider the symmetric gap probability distributions of certain Freud unitary ensembles. This problem is related to the Hankel determinants generated by the Freud weights supported on the complement of a symmetric interval. By using Chen and Ismail's ladder operator approach, we obtain the difference equations satisfied by the recurrence coefficients for the orthogonal polynomials with the discontinuous Freud weights. We find that these equations, with a minor change of variables, are the discrete Painlev\'{e} XXXIV hierarchy proposed by Cresswell and Joshi [{\em J. Phys. A: Math. Gen.} {\bf 32} ({1999}) {655--669}]. This is the first time that the discrete Painlev\'{e} XXXIV hierarchy appears in the study of Random Matrix Theory. We also derive the differential-difference equations for the recurrence coefficients and show the relationship between the logarithmic derivative of the gap probabilities, the nontrivial leading coefficients of the monic orthogonal polynomials and the recurrence coefficients.</description>

      <title>Asymptotics of the Humbert functions $\Psi_1$ and $\Psi_2$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.07281</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.07281v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A compilation of new results on the asymptotic behaviour of the Humbert functions $\Psi_1$ and $\Psi_2$, and also on the Appell function $F_2$, is presented. As a by-product, we confirm a conjectured limit which appeared recently in the study of the $1D$ Glauber-Ising model. We also propose two elementary asymptotic methods and confirm through some illustrative examples that both methods have great potential and can be applied to a large class of problems of asymptotic analysis. Finally, some directions of future research are pointed out in order to suggest ideas for further study.</description>

      <title>Novel possible symmetries of $S$-matrix generated by $\mathbb{Z}_2^n$-graded Lie superalgebras</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.07311</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.07311v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we explore the $\mathbb{Z}_2^n$-graded Lie (super)algebras as novel possible generators of symmetries of $S$-matrix. As the results, we demonstrate that a $\mathbb{Z}_2^n$-graded extension of the supersymmetric algebra can be a symmetry of $S$-matrix. Furthermore, it turns out that a $\mathbb{Z}_2^n$-graded Lie algebra appears as internal symmetries. They are natural extensions of Coleman-Mandula theorem and Haag-Lopszanski-Sohnius theorem, which are the no-go theorems for generators of symmetries of $S$-matrix.</description>
