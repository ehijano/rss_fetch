      <title>Bose-Fermi $N$-polaron state emergence from correlation-mediated blocking of phase separation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.13785</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.13785v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study $N$ fermionic impurities in a one-dimensional lattice bosonic bath at unit filling. Using DMRG and mixed boundary conditions -- closed for bosons, open for fermions -- we find an $N$-polaron ground state replacing phase separation at high interspecies repulsion. This tightly bound state of clustered particles emerges due to strong impurity-bath correlations which induce large impurity-impurity correlations, that we quantify via the von Neumann entropy and bipartite mutual information respectively. This system also reveals a fermionic self-localization effect from a Mott insulator background due to local correlations between the impurities and the bath. The growth of long-range correlations breaks this Mott phase, resulting in the transition to localized impurity clusters. Finally, we show that there is a critical impurity number, which depends on intraspecies bosonic interaction, beyond which phase separation is recovered.</description>

      <title>Transition temperature of the homogeneous imperfect Bose gas</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.14036</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.14036v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We calculate the critical temperature from Cornwall-Jackiw-Tomboulis effective action formalism within the improved Hartree-Fock approximation for ultracold Bose gas at finite temperature. An enhancement of the critical temperature compared with that of the ideal Bose gas is found in linear with respect to the scattering length in the leading-order term. The sloop is in good agreement with some other papers.</description>

      <title>Realization of a period-3 coplanar state in one-dimensional spin-orbit coupled optical lattice</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.14380</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.14380v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In ultracold atoms, achieving a period-$3$ structure poses a significant challenge. In this work, we propose a three-sublattice spin-flop transition mechanism, differing from the two-sublattice counterpart used to explain the emergence of ferrimagnetic orders in higher dimensions. Guided by this mechanism, we design a setup of alkaline-earth-metal atoms to create a spin-orbit coupled optical lattice, where we identify a triplet-fold degenerate $YX\bar{Y}$ state with a period-$3$ coplanar spin ordering within the deep Mott-insulating phase region of the ground-state phase diagram. The $YX\bar{Y}$ state is protected by a finite gap, and its characteristic angle can be finely tuned by specific setup parameters. Moreover, we use the Rabi spectroscopy technique to detect the $YX\bar{Y}$ state. Our work not only shows the feasibility of achieving a period-$3$ structure \textit{via} the new mechanism but also suggests its potential applications for exploring other periodic structures in optical lattices.</description>

      <title>Effective approaches to the dynamical properties of two distinguishable Bose polarons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.15093</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.15093v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We explore effective approaches for describing the dynamics of induced interactions amongst two non-interacting distinguishable impurities - Bose polarons - when their couplings to the host species are switched on. First, we evaluate the time-dependent characteristics of each polaron through reduced single-particle models. Their validity is ultimately judged by comparing to observables obtained within a many-body variational approach. We argue that utilizing a time-dependent optimization process with the effective mass and frequency being fitting parameters leads to an accurate matching on the level of one-body observables with the prediction of the many-body method. Next, we construct two-body effective models, which besides the effective parameters of the single polaron, include a contact interaction potential modelling the induced interactions. It is shown that the instantaneous coupling strength obtained with a time-dependent optimization process allows for an accurate description of the impurities two-body correlation dynamics when compared to the many-body calculations. In this sense, it is possible to describe the dynamical crossover from correlated to anti-correlated impurity patterns related to the transition from attractive to repulsive induced interactions. Our results should facilitate the description of strongly particle-imbalanced mixtures via reduced models and hence their experimental understanding.</description>

      <title>Two-component repulsive atomic Fermi gases in a thin spherical shell</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.15108</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.15108v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present possible ground-state structures of two-component atomic Fermi gases with repulsive interactions in a thin spherical shell geometry by implementing a self-consistent Hartree-Fock approximation. The system exhibits a miscible-immiscible transition from a homogeneous mixture to two-chunk phase separation as the interaction strength crosses a critical value. While the critical value is relatively insensitive to population imbalance for equal-mass mixtures, it decreases with the mass ratio when mass-imbalance is present. The interaction may be tuned by the two-body scattering length or the radius of the sphere, thereby allowing the system to cross the transition by varying different parameters. When the sphere is rotating, three-chunk sandwich structures emerge in mass-imbalanced mixtures as a consequence of maximal angular momentum along the rotation axis. Some indications of geometric effects and possible experimental implications are also discussed.</description>

      <title>Interaction dependence of the Hall response for the Bose-Hubbard triangular ladder</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.15276</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.15276v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We explore the behavior of the Hall response of a Bose-Hubbard triangular ladder in a magnetic field as a function of the repulsive on-site atomic interactions. We consider a wide range of interaction strengths, from the weakly interacting limit to the hardcore regime. This is realized by computing the Hall polarization following the quench of a weak linear potential which induces the flow of a current through the system, using time-dependent matrix product state numerical simulations. We complement our understanding in the regime of small magnetic fields by analytical calculations of the equilibrium value of the Hall polarization for non-interacting bosonic atoms, or under a mean-field assumption. The Bose-Hubbard triangular flux ladder exhibits a rich phase diagram, containing Meissner, vortex and biased-chiral superfluid phases. We show that the Hall response can be employed to fingerprint the various chiral state, the frustration effects occurring in the limit of strong interactions, and the phase boundaries of the equilibrium phase diagram.</description>

      <title>Geometric Optimization of Quantum Control with Minimum Cost</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.14540</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.14540v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the optimization of quantum control from the perspective of differential geometry. Here, optimal quantum control takes the minimum cost of transporting a quantum state. By defining a cost function, we quantify the cost by the length of a trajectory in the relevant Riemannian manifold. We demonstrate the optimization protocol using SU(2) and SU(1,1) dynamically symmetric systems, which cover a large class of physical scenarios. For these systems, time evolution is visualized in the three-dimensional manifold. Given the initial and final states, the minimum-cost quantum control corresponds to the geodesic of the manifold. When the trajectory linking the initial and final states is specified, the minimum-cost quantum control corresponds to the geodesic in a sub-manifold embedded in the three-dimensional manifold. Optimal quantum control in this situation provides a geometrical means of optimizing shortcuts to adiabatic driving.</description>

      <title>Simulating Schwinger model dynamics with quasi-one-dimensional qubit arrays</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.14544</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.14544v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Real-time dynamics of the Schwinger model provide an effective description of quark confinement out of equilibrium, routinely employed to model hadronization processes in particle-physics event generators. Ab-initio simulations of such non-perturbative processes are far beyond the reach of existing computational tools, and remain an outstanding open quest for quantum simulators to date. In this work we develop a general strategy to run Schwinger model dynamics on synthetic quantum spin lattices, such as neutral-atom or superconducting-qubit arrays. Our construction encodes the constrained fermionic and bosonic degrees of freedom of the model into the geometric shape of a magnetic interface. We show that global magnetic field patterns can drive coherent quantum dynamics of the interface equivalent to the lattice Schwinger Hamiltonian. We rigorously establish that the optimal array required for simulating real-time wave packet collisions and string fragmentation processes with accuracy $\epsilon$ in the continuum field-theory limit, is a quasi-one-dimensional ribbon with polynomial length and polylogarithmic width in $\epsilon^{-1}$. We finally discuss a concrete advantageous implementation using a state-of-the-art dual-species Rydberg atom array. This work opens up a path for near-term quantum simulators to address questions of immediate relevance to particle physics.</description>

      <title>Pair size and quantum geometry in a multiband Hubbard model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.14921</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.14921v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the size of two-body bound states and Cooper pairs within a multiband Hubbard model that features time-reversal symmetry and uniform pairing on a generic lattice. Our analysis involves (i) an exact calculation of the localization tensor to determine the size of lowest-lying two-body bound state in vacuum, and (ii) an evaluation of the average size of Cooper pairs using mean-field BCS-BEC crossover theory at zero temperature. Beyond the conventional intraband contribution that depends on Bloch bands, we show that pair size also has a geometric contribution governed by the quantum-metric tensor of the Bloch states and their band-resolved quantum-metric tensors. As a concrete example, we investigate the pyrochlore-Hubbard model numerically and demonstrate that, while the pair size diverges in the weakly interacting BCS regime, it remains finite and relatively small in the flat-band regime, even for infinitesimal interaction, perfectly matching the exact two-body result in the dilute limit.</description>

      <title>Asymmetric Tunneling of Bose-Einstein Condensates</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2110.15298</link>
      <description>arXiv:2110.15298v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In his celebrated textbook, $\textit{Quantum Mechanics: Nonrelativistic Theory}$, Landau argued that, for single particle systems in 1D, tunneling probability remains the same for a particle incident from the left or the right of a barrier. This left-right symmetry of tunneling probability holds regardless of the shape of the potential barrier. However, there are a variety of known cases that break this symmetry, e.g. when observing composite particles. We computationally (and analytically, in the simplest case) show this breaking of the left-right tunneling symmetry for Bose-Einstein condensates (BEC) in 1D, modelled by the Gross-Pitaevskii equation (GPE). By varying $g$, the parameter of inter-particle interaction in the BEC, we demonstrate that the transition from symmetric ($g=0$) to asymmetric tunneling is a threshold phenomenon. Our computations employ experimentally feasible parameters such that these results may be experimentally demonstrated in the near future. We conclude by suggesting applications of the phenomena to design atomtronic diodes, synthetic gauge fields, Maxwell's demons, and black-hole analogues.</description>

Abstract: A Wigner chain in a periodic potential is a paradigmatic example of geometric frustration with long-range interactions. The dynamics emulates the Frenkel-Kontorova model with Coulomb interactions. In the continuum approximation, dislocations are sine-Gordon solitons with power-law decaying tails. We show that their action is mapped into a massive, long-range (1+1) Thirring model, where the solitons are charged fermionic excitations over an effective Dirac sea. We identify the corresponding mean field theory and show that the Coulomb interactions destabilize structures commensurate with the periodic substrate, suppressing their onset and giving rise to {\it interaction-induced} lubrication. Our study identifies the role of long-range interactions on determining nanofriction. Our predictions can be probed in state-of-the-art trapped ion experiments.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.05292v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the Josephson junction made of a one-dimensional ultradilute quantum liquid in a double-well potential. We analyze the dynamics as a function of the interaction strength and compare the results to the standard bosonic Josephson junction. It is found that the beyond-mean-field effects alter the dynamics, particularly in the regime, where the beyond-mean-field corrections dominate over the residual mean-field interaction. In that case, we observe nonlinear dynamics describing localization revivals instead of regular Josephson oscillations. In the regime where the ultradilute quantum liquids perform the regular Josephson oscillations, their frequency is also significantly changed in comparison with the regular Josephson junction. These results provide experimental characteristics of the ultradilute quantum liquids that contrast with the Josephson oscillations of a regular Bose-Einstein condensate.</description>

      <title>Improved models for ideal Fermi gas and ideal Bose gas using quantum phase space</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.09998</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.09998v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this work, it is shown that the improvements can be introduced into the current models of ideal Fermi and ideal gas to take into account the quantum nature of phase space related to the uncertainty principle. The construction of the improved models is based on the use of the concepts of phase space representation of quantum mechanics and quantum phase space that were introduced and developed recently. Hamiltonian operator of a gas particle and its eigenstates are firstly determined and the use of quantum statistical mechanics leads to the deduction of the thermodynamics properties of the ideal gas itself. The explicit expressions of thermodynamic quantities such as the grand canonical potential, the thermodynamic particles number, the internal energy, the Von Neumann entropy and the pressure as well as the state equations, corresponding to the improved models, are established for both bosons and fermions. The corrections introduced by these expressions are expected to be particularly significant at low temperature and for confined volume. They permit in particular to highlight the existence of quantum shape and size effects. It is also shown that the thermodynamics functions and variables are directly related to the momenta quantum statistical variances. Well-known relations corresponding to classical ideal gas model can be retrieved from the improved models as asymptotic limits at high temperature and for large volume.</description>

      <title>Many-body phases from effective geometrical frustration and long-range interactions in a subwavelength lattice</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.01443v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Geometrical frustration and long-range couplings are key contributors to create quantum phases with different properties throughout physics. We propose a scheme where both ingredients naturally emerge in a Raman induced subwavelength lattice. We first demonstrate that Raman-coupled multicomponent quantum gases can realize a highly versatile frustrated Hubbard Hamiltonian with long-range interactions. The deeply subwavelength lattice period leads to strong long-range interparticle repulsion with tunable range and decay. We numerically demonstrate that the combination of frustration and long-range couplings generates many-body phases of bosons, including a range of density-wave and superfluid phases with broken translational and time reversal symmetries, respectively. Our results thus represent a powerful approach for efficiently combining long-range interactions and frustration in quantum simulations.</description>

      <title>Bounds on detection of Bell correlations with entangled ultra-cold atoms in optical lattices under occupation defects</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.02873</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.02873v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Bell non-locality stems from quantum correlations effectively identified using inequalities. Spin chains, simulated with ultra-cold atoms in optical lattices, Rydberg atoms in tweezer arrays, trapped ions, or molecules, allow single-spin control and measurement. Therefore, they are suitable for studying fundamental aspects of these correlations and non-locality. Occupation defects, such as vacancies or multiple atoms occupying a single site due to imperfect system preparation, limit the detection of Bell correlations. We study their effects with the help of a simplified toy model parameterised by the probability $p$ of having a single occupation for a given site. Within this model, and for entangled systems obtained by one-axis twisting evolution from an initial factorised state, we derive two Bell inequalities, one based on many-site correlations and the other on two-site correlations, and identify the smallest probability $p$ that allows the Bell inequalities violation to be detected. We then consider two physical realizations using entangled ultra-cold atoms in optical lattices where the parameter $p$ is related to a non-unitary filling factor and non-zero temperature. We test the predictions of the toy model against exact numerical results.</description>

      <title>Rotational properties of two interacting cold polar molecules: linear, symmetric, and asymmetric tops</title>

      <description>arXiv:2303.02199v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We examine the potential-energy curves and polarization of the dipole moments of two static polar molecules under the influence of an external dc electric field and their anisotropic dipole-dipole interaction. We model the molecules as quantum rigid rotors to take their rotational degrees of freedom into account and consider a selection of linear, symmetric, and asymmetric top molecules. We provide a comprehensive examination of the energy curves and polarization of the dipoles for varying inter-molecular separation and direction of the electric field and find that the properties of the molecules depend strongly on the field's direction at short separations, showing the importance of accounting for molecular rotation. The latter provides insight into the possible effects of accounting for rotational degrees of freedom in molecular dipolar gases.</description>

      <title>Synthetic magnetoelectric response of lattice bosonic insulators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.00918</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.00918v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In the absence of parity and time-reversal symmetries, insulators can exhibit magnetoelectric responses, in which applied magnetic fields induce charge polarization and, conversely, applied electric fields induce magnetization. While there is a long history of the study of magnetoelectric response in fermionic insulators, the same for bosonic insulators has been limited. We consider the magnetoelectric response in lattice insulators built out of charged bosonic degrees of freedom and derive a bulk formula for the corresponding linear response tensor. The resulting formulae feature several contributions including a Chern-Simons integral over the bands of the bosonic excitations. We construct several minimal microscopic models that illustrate the ingredients required to obtain a sizable bosonic magnetoelectric response. Our formalism can be applied to bosonic Mott insulators subject to synthetic gauge fields and/or tilted potentials as well as to the spinon sector in the Coulomb phase of a $U(1)$ quantum spin liquid.</description>

      <title>Analytical derivation and extension of the anti-Kibble-Zurek scaling in the transverse field Ising model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.17247</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.17247v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A defect density which quantifies the deviation from the spin ground state characterizes non-equilibrium dynamics during phase transitions. The widely recognized Kibble-Zurek scaling predicts how the defect density evolves during phase transitions. However, it can be perturbed by a noise, leading to the anti-Kibble-Zurek scaling. In this research, we analytically investigate the effect of Gaussian white noise on the transition probabilities of the Landau-Zener model. We apply this analysis to the one-dimensional transverse field Ising model and obtain an analytical approximate solution of the defect density. Our analysis reveals that when the introduced noise is small, the model follows the previously known anti-Kibble-Zurek scaling. Conversely, when the noise increases, the scaling can be obtained by using the adiabatic approximation. This result indicates that deriving the anti-Kibble-Zurek scaling does not require solving differential equations, instead, it can be achieved simply by applying the adiabatic approximation. Furthermore, we identify the parameter that minimizes the defect density based on the new scaling, which allows us to verify how effective the already known scaling of the optimized parameter is.</description>
