      <title>A Spiral Bicycle Track that Can Be Traced by a Unicycle</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.11847</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.11847v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A unibike curve is a track that can be made by either a bicycle or a unicycle. More precisely, the end of a unit tangent vector at any point on a unibike curve lies on the curve (so the bike's front wheel always lies on the track made by the rear wheel). David Finn found such a curve in 2002, but it loops around itself in an extremely complicated way with many twists and self-intersections. Starting with the polar square root curve r = sqrt[t/(2 pi)] and iterating a simple construction involving a differential equation apparently leads in the limit to a unibike curve having a spiral shape. The iteration gets each curve as a rear track of its predecessor. Solving hundreds of differential equations numerically, where each depends on the preceding one, leads to error buildup, but with some care one can get a curve having unibike error less than 10^-7. The evidence is strong for the conjecture that the limit of the iteration exists and is a unibike curve.</description>

      <title>Singularities of two-dimensional Nijenhuis operators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.11852</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.11852v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A Nijenhuis operator $L$ is a $(1,1)$-tensor field on a smooth manifold $M$ with vanishing Nijenhuis torsion ${ {\mathcal N_L}}$. At each point $x\in M$, the algebraic type of $L(x)$ is characterized by its Jordan normal form. In this paper, we study singularities of a two-dimensional Nijenhuis operator in the case when its trace has a non-zero differential at the singular point. A description of such singularities reduces to studying the smoothness of some function, which is a fraction depending on partial derivatives of the determinant of $L$. We completely describe singularities for some special classes of functions. We also obtained interesting examples of Nijenhuis operators and their singularities.</description>

      <title>Almost Differentially Nondegenerate Nijenhuis Operators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.11860</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.11860v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The paper is devoted to the study of Nijenhuis operators of arbitrary dimension $n$ in a neighborhood of a point at which the first $n-1$ coefficients of the characteristic polynomial are functionally independent, and the last coefficient (the determinant of the operator) is an arbitrary function. We prove a theorem on the general form of such Nijenhuis operators, and also obtain their complete description for the case in which the determinant has a nondegenerate singularity.</description>

      <title>Elementary Differential Singularities of Three-Dimensional Nijenhuis Operators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.11865</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.11865v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the paper, three-dimensional Nijenhuis operators are studied that have differential singularities, i.e., such points at which the coefficients of the characteristic polynomials are dependent. The case is studied in which the differentials of all invariants of the Nijenhuis operator are proportional, as well as the case when two invariants are functionally independent and the third defines a fold-type singularity. In particular, new examples of three-dimensional Nijenhuis operators with singularities of the specified type are constructed.</description>

      <title>The degeneration of Calabi-Yau 3-folds via 3-forms and the SYZ conjecture</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.11992</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.11992v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we investigate the geometries associated with 3-forms of various orbital types on a symplectic 6-manifold. We demonstrate that certain unstable 3-forms, which naturally emerge from specific degenerations of Calabi-Yau structures, exhibit remarkably rich geometric properties. This, in turn, offers a novel perspective on the SYZ conjecture.</description>

      <title>On Product Lie Algebroids, and Collective Motion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.12059</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.12059v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This work explores the geometrical/algebraic framework of Lie algebroids, with a specific focus on the decoupling and coupling phenomena within the bicocycle double cross product realization. The bicocycle double cross product theory serves as the most general method for (de)coupling an algebroid into the direct sum of two vector bundles in the presence of mutual \textit{representations}, along with two twisted cocycle terms. Consequently, it encompasses unified product, double cross product (matched pairs), semi-direct product, and cocycle extension frameworks as particular instances. In addition to algebraic constructions, the research extends to both reversible and irreversible Lagrangian and Hamiltonian dynamics on (de)coupled Lie algebroids, as well as Euler-Poincar\'{e}-(Herglotz) and Lie-Poisson-(Herglotz) dynamics on (de)coupled Lie algebras, providing insights into potential physical applications.</description>

      <title>The large mass limit of $G_2$ and Calabi-Yau monopoles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.12075</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.12075v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We develop a structure theory for the limit of $SU(2)$ $G_2$-monopoles (resp. Calabi-Yau monopoles) on a principal $SU(2)$-bundle over an asymptotically conical $G_2$-manifolds (resp. Calabi-Yau 3-folds) as the mass parameter tends to infinity, while the topologial data for the bundle stays fixed. We show how to extract a singular abelian $G_2$-monopole (resp. Calabi-Yau monopole) with Dirac singularity along a calibrated cycle in the large mass limit, and we prove an energy identity for monopole bubbles.</description>

      <title>On an Arnold's Conjecture Concerning the Space of Hyperbolic Homogeneous Polynomials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.12219</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.12219v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The set of homogeneous polynomials of degree $D$ is a topological space that contains the subspace $Hyp(D)$ constituted only by hyperbolic polynomials. In 2002, V. I. Arnold conjectured that the number of connected components of $Hyp (D)$ increases, as $D$ increases, at least as a linear function of $D$. In this paper we prove that this conjecture is true. We determine the exact number of connected components of $Hyp (D)$ and we provide a representative for each component. The proof is constructive; our approach uses homotopy invariance of the index of a curve and properties of homogeneous polynomials.</description>

      <title>Resurgence of Tritronqu\'{e}es Solutions of the Deformed Painlev\'{e} I Equation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.12290</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.12290v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We prove that the formal $\hbar$-power series solution of the deformed Painlev\'{e} I equation is resurgent, which means it is generically Borel summable and its Borel transform admits endless analytic continuation. In particular, we find that the Borel transform defines a global multivalued holomorphic function on a singular algebraic surface isomorphic to the Fermat quintic surface $x^5 + y^5 + z^5 = 0$ modulo an involution. This surface is an algebraic fibration over the complex plane of the differential equation with generic fibre a smooth quintic curve. Each fibre is equipped with a fivefold covering map over another complex plane (the Borel plane) with ten ramification points (the Borel singularities) spread equally over two branch points giving two opposite Stokes rays.</description>

      <title>A calibration in $\mathbf R^{16}$ and Federer's product question</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.12402</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.12402v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Building upon the construction of a Cayley calibration adapted to a complex structure, we introduce a calibration $\Phi$ in $\bigwedge^8 \mathbf R^{16}$ with $|\Phi^2| = 294$. This enables us to show that the product of two orthogonally supported calibrations is not necessarily a calibration, thereby providing a negative answer to a question posed by Federer. Dadok and Harvey developed a general method for constructing calibrations as outer products of two unit spinors in the Clifford algebra. We show that $\Phi$ arises from the product of two spinors with norm $1$ and $\sqrt{2}$.</description>

Abstract: In this work, we construct several sequences of metrics on sphere with different limiting behaviors. By combining with the work of Deruelle, we use it and the localized maximum principle to construct various examples of expanding gradient Ricci solitons with positive curvature and exotic curvature decay. This answers a question proposed by Chow-Lu-Ni and also a question by Cao-Liu, respectively.</description>

      <title>On Hermitian manifolds with constant mixed curvature</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.12432</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.12432v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In a recent work, Kai Tang conjectured that any compact Hermitian manifold with non-zero constant mixed curvature must be K\"ahler. He confirmed the conjecture in complex dimension $2$ and for Chern K\"ahler-like manifolds in general dimensions. In this paper, we verify his conjecture for several special types of Hermitian manifolds, including complex nilmanifolds, solvmanifolds with complex commutators, almost abelian Lie groups, and Lie algebras containing a $J$-invariant abelian ideal of codimension $2$. We also verify the conjecture for all compact balanced threefolds when the Bismut connection has parallel torsion. These results provide partial evidence towards the validity of Tang's conjecture.</description>

      <title>The min-max width of spheres associated to the distance function</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.12477</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.12477v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: What one obtains when the min-max methods for the distance function are applied on the space of pairs of points of a Riemannian two-sphere? This question is studied in details in the present article. We show that the associated min-max width do not always coincide with half of the length of a simple closed geodesic which is the union of two minimizing geodesics with the same endpoints. Therefore, it is a new geometric invariant. We study the structure of the set of minimizing geodesics joining a pair of points realizing the width, and relationships between this invariant and the diameter. The extrinsic case of an embedded Riemannian sphere is also considered.</description>

      <title>Holography and Cheeger constant of asymptotically CMC submanifolds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.12703</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.12703v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $(M^{n+1},g_+)$ be an asymptotically hyperbolic manifold. We compute the Cheeger constant of conformally compact asymptotically constant mean curvature submanifolds $ \iota : Y^{k+1} \to (M^{n+1},g_+)$ with arbitrary codimension. As an application, we provide two classes of examples of $(n+1)$-dimensional asymptotically hyperbolic manifolds with Cheeger constant equal to $n$, whose conformal infinity is of the following types: 1) positive Yamabe invariant, and 2) negative Yamabe invariant. Moreover, in the same spirit as Blitz--Gover--Waldron \cite{BlitzSamuel2021CFFa}, we show that an asymptotically hyperbolic manifold with umbilic boundary is conformally weakly Poincar\'e--Einstein if and only if the third conformal fundamental form of the boundary vanishes. Next, in the space of asymptotically minimal hypersurfaces $Y$ within a Poincar\'e--Einstein manifold, we identify an extrinsic conformal invariant of $\partial Y$ which obstructs the vanishing of the mean curvature of $Y$ to second order. This conformal invariant is a linear combination of two Riemannian hypersurface invariants of $\partial Y,$ one which depends on its extrinsic geometry within $\overline{Y}$ and the other on its extrinsic geometry within $\partial M;$ neither of which are conformal invariants individually. Finally, we show that for asymptotically minimal hypersurfaces with mean curvature vanishing to second order inside of a Poincar\'e--Einstein space, being weakly Poincar\'e--Einstein is equivalent to the boundary of $Y$ having vanishing second and third conformal fundamental forms when viewed as a hypersurface within the conformal infinity.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.13365v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we prove the existence of $L^p$-approximate critical Hermitian structures on Higgs orbi-bundles over compact Gauduchon orbifolds. In terms of the orbifold Chern classes, we obtain the generalized Bogomolov type inequality for general Higgs sheaves on compact K\"{a}hler klt spaces with respect to the nef and big classes. As an application, we derive the Bogomolov-Gieseker inequality for semistable Higgs sheaves with respect to the nef classes of numerical dimension $\geq n-1$. Furthermore, we prove the Miyaoka-Yau inequality for all minimal K\"{a}hler klt spaces.</description>

      <title>The Beltrami -- de Sitter model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.12364</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.12364v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We combine the well -- known Beltrami -- Klein model of non -- Euclidean geometry on a two -- dimensional disk, where the geodesics are the chords of the disk, with the two -- dimensional de Sitter space. The geometry of the de Sitter space is defined on the complement of the Beltrami -- Klein disk in the plane, with the de Sitter metric being the unique Lorentzian Einstein metric whose light cones form cones tangent to the disk in this complement. This leads to a Beltrami -- de Sitter model on the plane ${\bf R}^2$, which is endowed with the Riemannian Beltrami metric on the disk and the Lorentzian de Sitter metric outside the disk in ${\bf R}^2$.
  We explore the relevance of this model for Penrose's Conformal Cyclic Cosmology, first in the two -- dimensional setting and subsequently in higher dimensions, including the physically significant case of four dimensions. In this context, we define a Radon-like transform between the de Sitter and Beltrami spaces, facilitating the purely geometric transformation of physical fields from the Lorentzian de Sitter space to the Riemannian Beltrami space.
  In the two -- dimensional case, we also uncover a hidden ${\bf G}_2$ symmetry associated with the two -- dimensional de Sitter space, which is related to a vector distribution naturally defined by the geometry of the model. We suggest the potential for discovering similar hidden symmetries in the $n$ -- dimensional Beltrami-de Sitter model.</description>

      <title>Constructions of symplectic surfaces in symplectic 4-manifolds with transversal intersections</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.12428</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.12428v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In the breakthrough paper [V. Mu\~noz, A Smale-Barden manifold admitting K-contact but not Sasakian structure, 2024, 10.4171/JEMS/1496], it is constructed the first example of a simply connected compact 5-manifold (aka.\ Smale-Barden manifold) which admits a K-contact structure but does not carry a Sasakian structure, thus settling the question raised as Open Problem 10.2.1 in n [C. Boyer and K. Galicki, Sasakian Geometry, OUP, 2007]. In this paper we revise, refine and generalize the constructions of symplectic surfaces in a symplectic 4-manifold with transversal intersections. These are needed to produce the ramification locus of Seifert bundles over symplectic 4-orbifolds that serve to produce K-contact 5-manifolds.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.12599v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the local in time well-posedness of the initial boundary value problem (IBVP) for the vacuum Einstein equations in general relativity with geometric boundary conditions. For conformal-mean curvature boundary conditions, consisting of the conformal class of the boundary metric and mean curvature of the boundary, well-posedness does not hold without imposing additional angle data at the corner. When the corner angle is included as corner data, we prove well-posedness of the linearized problem in $C^{\infty}$, where the linearization is taken at any smooth vacuum Einstein metric.</description>

      <title>On Ma\~n\'e's critical value for the two-component Hunter-Saxton system and a infnite dimensional magnetic Hopf-Rinow theorem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.12901</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.12901v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we introduce a nonlinear system of partial differential equations, the magnetic two-component Hunter-Saxton system (M2HS). This system is formulated as a magnetic geodesic equation on an infinite-dimensional Lie group equipped with a right-invariant metric, the $\dot{H}^1$ -metric, which is closely related to the infinite-dimensional Fisher-Rao metric, and the derivative of an infinite-dimensional contact-type form as the magnetic field. We define Ma\~n\'e's critical value for exact magnetic systems on Hilbert manifolds in full generality and compute it explicitly for the (M2HS). Moreover, we establish an infinite-dimensional Hopf-Rinow theorem for this magnetic system, where Ma\~n\'e's critical value serves as the threshold beyond which the Hopf-Rinow theorem no longer holds. This geometric framework enables us to thoroughly analyze the blow-up behavior of solutions to the (M2HS). Using this insight, we extend solutions beyond blow-up by introducing and proving the existence of global conservative weak solutions. This extension is facilitated by extending the Madelung transform from an isometry into a magnetomorphism, embedding the magnetic system into a magnetic system on an infinite-dimensional sphere equipped with the derivative of the standard contact form as the magnetic field. Crucially, this setup can always be reduced, via a dynamical reduction theorem, to a totally magnetic three-sphere, providing a deeper understanding of the underlying dynamics.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.12938v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce to spectral noncommutative geometry the notion of tangled spectral triple, which encompasses the anisotropies arising in parabolic geometry as well as the parabolic commutator bounds arising in so-called ``bad Kasparov products''. Tangled spectral triples incorporate anisotropy by replacing the unbounded operator in a spectral triple that mimics a Dirac operator with several unbounded operators mimicking directional Dirac operators. We allow for varying and dependent orders in different directions, controlled by using the tools of tropical combinatorics. We study the conformal equivariance of tangled spectral triples as well as how they fit into $K$-homology by means of producing higher order spectral triples. Our main examples are hypoelliptic spectral triples constructed from Rockland complexes on parabolic geometries; we also build spectral triples on nilpotent group $C^*$-algebras from the dual Dirac element and crossed product spectral triples for parabolic dynamical systems.</description>

Abstract: We study the length-preserving elastic flow of curves in arbitrary codimension with free boundary on hypersurfaces. This constrained gradient flow is given by a nonlocal evolution equation with nonlinear higher-order boundary conditions. We prove global existence and subconvergence to critical points. The proof strategy involves a careful treatment of short-time existence, uniqueness, and parabolic energy estimates.</description>

      <title>Sharp eigenvalue estimates and related rigidity theorems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2003.13231</link>
      <description>arXiv:2003.13231v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, sharp bounds for the first nonzero eigenvalues of different type have been obtained. Moreover, when those bounds are achieved, related rigidities can be characterized. More precisely, first, by applying the Bishop-type volume comparison proven in [10,13] and the Escobar-type eigenvalue comparisons for the first nonzero Steklov eigenvalue of the Laplacian proven in [26], for manifolds with radial sectional curvature upper bound, under suitable preconditions, we can show that the first nonzero Wentzell eigenvalue of the geodesic ball on these manifolds can be bounded from above by that of the geodesic ball with the same radius in the model space (i.e., spherically symmetric manifolds) determined by the curvature bound. Besides, this upper bound for the first nonzero Wentzell eigenvalue can be achieved if and only if these two geodesic balls are isometric with each other. This conclusion can be seen as an extension of eigenvalue comparisons in [9,26]. Second, we prove a general Reilly formula for the drifting Laplacian, and then use the formula to give a sharp lower bound for the first nonzero Steklov eigenvalue of the drifting Laplacian on compact smooth metric measure spaces with boundary and convex potential function. Besides, this lower bound can be achieved only for the Euclidean ball of the prescribed radius.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2203.15313v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper investigates the question of stability for a class of Ricci flows which start at possibly non-smooth metric spaces. We show that if the initial metric space is Reifenberg and locally bi-Lipschitz to Euclidean space, then two solutions to the Ricci flow whose Ricci curvature is uniformly bounded from below and whose curvature is bounded by $c\cdot t^{-1}$ converge to one another at an exponential rate once they have been appropriately gauged. As an application, we show that smooth three dimensional, complete, uniformly Ricci-pinched Riemannian manifolds with bounded curvature are either compact or flat, thus confirming a conjecture of Hamilton and Lott.</description>

      <title>Isoperimetric problem and structure at infinity on Alexandrov spaces with nonnegative curvature</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2302.10091</link>
      <description>arXiv:2302.10091v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper we consider nonnegatively curved finite dimensional Alexandrov spaces with a non-collapsing condition, i.e., such that unit balls have volumes uniformly bounded from below away from zero. We study the relation between the isoperimetric profile, the existence of isoperimetric sets, and the asymptotic structure at infinity of such spaces. In this setting, we prove that the following conditions are equivalent: the space has linear volume growth; it is Gromov--Hausdorff asymptotic to one cylinder at infinity; it has uniformly bounded isoperimetric profile; the entire space is a tubular neighborhood of either a line or a ray. Moreover, on a space satisfying any of the previous conditions, we prove existence of isoperimetric sets for sufficiently large volumes, and we characterize the geometric rigidity at the level of the isoperimetric profile. Specializing our study to the $2$-dimensional case, we prove that unit balls have always volumes uniformly bounded from below away from zero, and we prove existence of isoperimetric sets for every volume, characterizing also their topology when the space has no boundary. The proofs exploit a variational approach, and in particular apply to Riemannian manifolds with nonnegative sectional curvature and to Euclidean convex bodies. Up to the authors' knowledge, most of the results are new even in these smooth cases.</description>

Abstract: Let $D$ be a regular strictly convex bounded domain of $\mathbb{R}^3$, and consider a regular Jordan curve $\Gamma \subset \partial D$. Then, for each $\epsilon&gt;0$, we obtain the existence of a complete proper minimal immersion $\psi_\epsilon :\mathbb{D} \to D$ satisfying that the Hausdorff distance $\delta^H(\psi_\epsilon(\partial \mathbb{D}), \Gamma) &lt; \epsilon,$ where $\psi_\epsilon(\partial \mathbb{D})$ represents the limit set of the minimal disk $\psi_\epsilon(\mathbb{D}).$
  This result has some interesting consequences. Among other things, we can prove that any bounded regular domain $R$ in $\mathbb{R}^3$ admits a complete proper minimal immersion $\psi: \mathbb{D} \longrightarrow R$.</description>

      <title>Total masses of solutions to general Toda systems with singular sources</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/1605.07759</link>
      <description>arXiv:1605.07759v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this article we obtain total masses of solutions to the Toda system associated to a general simple Lie algebra with singular sources at the origin. The determination of such total masses is one of the important steps towards establishing the a priori bound for solutions to the mean field type of Toda system on compact surfaces. The total mass is found to be related to the longest element $\kappa$ in the Weyl group of the corresponding Lie algebra. This is the foundation to future work relating the local blowup masses (from analysis) with the Weyl group.
  This work generalizes the previous works in Lin et al. (2012), Ao et al. (2015) and Nie (20160 for Toda systems of types $A, G_2$ and $B, C$. However, a more Lie-theoretic method is needed here for the general case, and the method relies heavily on the DPW method, Drinfeld-Sokolov gauge and the $W$-invariants. The last crucial step for the total masses is obtained by applying the work of Kostant (1979) on the one dimensional Toda lattice.</description>

Abstract: We study the system of first order PDEs for the pseudo-Riemannian metrics governing the Hamiltonian formalism for systems of hydrodynamic type. In the diagonal setting the Tsarev's integrability conditions ensure the compatibility of this system and, thanks to a classical theorem of Darboux, the existence of a family of solutions depending on functional parameters. In this paper we study the generalization of this result for the class of non-diagonalizable systems of hydrodymic type that naturally generalises Tsarev's integrable diagonal systems.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2501.00657v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Relative pose (position and orientation) estimation is an essential component of many robotics applications. Fiducial markers, such as the AprilTag visual fiducial system, yield a relative pose measurement from a single marker detection and provide a powerful tool for pose estimation. In this paper, we perform a Lie algebraic nonlinear observability analysis on a nonlinear dual quaternion system that is composed of a relative pose measurement model and a relative motion model. We prove that many common dual quaternion expressions yield Jacobian matrices with advantageous block structures and rank properties that are beneficial for analysis. We show that using a dual quaternion representation yields an observability matrix with a simple block triangular structure and satisfies the necessary full rank condition.</description>

      <title>Unique continuation for locally uniformly distributed measures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.13869</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.13869v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this note we show that the support of a locally $k$-uniform measure in $\mathbb R^{n+1}$ satisfies a kind of unique continuation property. As a consequence, we show that locally uniformly distributed measures satisfy a weaker unique continuation property. This continues work of Kirchheim and Preiss (Math. Scand. 2002) and David, Kenig and Toro (Comm. Pure Appl. Math. 2001) and lends additional evidence to the conjecture proposed by Kowalski and Preiss (J. Reine Angew. Math. 1987) that each connected component of the support of a locally $n$-uniform measure in $\mathbb R^{n+1}$ is contained in the zero set of a quadratic polynomial.</description>
