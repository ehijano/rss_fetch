      <title>The Effects of Stellar and AGN Feedback on the Cosmic Star Formation History in the Simba Simulations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.07252</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.07252v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Using several variants of the cosmological Simba simulations, we investigate the impact of different feedback prescriptions on the cosmic star formation history. Adopting a global-to-local approach, we link signatures seen in global observables, such as the star formation rate density (SFRD) and the galaxy stellar mass function (GSMF), to feedback effects in individual galaxies. We find a consistent picture: stellar feedback mainly suppresses star formation below halo masses of $M_{\rm H} = 10^{12} \rm \, M_{\odot}$ and before $z = 2$, whereas AGN feedback quenches the more massive systems after $z = 2$. Among Simba's AGN feedback modes, AGN jets are the dominant quenching mechanism and set the shape of the SFRD and the GSMF at late times. AGN-powered winds only suppress the star formation rate in intermediate-mass galaxies ($M_{\rm \star} = 10^{9.5 - 10} \rm \, M_{\odot}$), without affecting the overall stellar mass-assembly significantly. At late times, the AGN X-ray feedback mode mainly quenches residual star formation in massive galaxies. Our analysis reveals that this mode is also necessary to produce the first fully quenched galaxies before $z=2$, where the jets alone are inefficient. These initially highly star-forming galaxies contain relatively large black holes, likely strengthening the X-ray-powered heating and ejection of gas from the dense, central region of galaxies. Such extra heating source quenches the local star formation and produces a more variable accretion rate. More generally, this effect also causes the break down of correlations between the specific star formation rate, the accretion rate and the black hole mass.</description>

      <title>The stability of dense cores near the Serpens South protocluster</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.07259v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Most stars form in clusters and groups rather than in isolation. We present $\lesssim 5^{\prime\prime}$ angular resolution ($\sim 2000$ au, or 0.01 pc) Very Large Array NH$_3$ (1,1), (2,2), and (3,3) and 1.3 cm continuum emission observations of the dense gas within the Serpens South protocluster and extended filaments to the north and south. We identify 94 dense cores using a dendrogram analysis of the NH$_3$ (1,1) integrated intensity. Gas temperatures $T_K$ and non-thermal linewidths $\sigma_\mathrm{NT}$ both increase towards the centre of the young stellar cluster, in the dense gas generally and in the cores specifically. We find that most cores (54\%) are super-virial, with gravitationally bound cores located primarily in the filaments. Cores in the protocluster have higher virial parameters by a factor $\sim 1.7$, driven primarily by the increased core $\sigma_\mathrm{NT}$ values. These cores cannot collapse to form stars unless they accrete additional mass or their core internal motions are reduced. The southern filament shows a significant velocity gradient previously interpreted as mass flow toward the cluster. We find more complex kinematics in the northern filament. We find a strong correlation between $\sigma_\mathrm{NT}$ and $T_K$, and argue that the enhanced temperatures and non-thermal motions are due to mechanical heating and interaction between the protocluster-driven outflows and the dense gas. Filament-led accretion may also contribute to the increased $\sigma_\mathrm{NT}$ values. Assuming a constant fraction of core mass ends up in the young stars, future star formation in the Serpens South protocluster will shift to higher masses by a factor $\sim 2$.</description>

      <title>JWST/MIRI detection of suprathermal OH rotational emissions: probing the dissociation of the water by Lyman alpha photons near the protostar HOPS 370</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.07299</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.07299v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Using the MIRI/MRS spectrometer on JWST, we have detected pure rotational, suprathermal OH emissions from the vicinity of the intermediate-mass protostar HOPS 370 (OMC2/FIR3). These emissions are observed from shocked knots in a jet/outflow, and originate in states of rotational quantum number as high as 46 that possess excitation energies as large as $E_U/k = 4.65 \times 10^4$ K. The relative strengths of the observed OH lines provide a powerful diagnostic of the ultraviolet radiation field in a heavily-extinguished region ($A_V \sim 10 - 20$) where direct UV observations are impossible. To high precision, the OH line strengths are consistent with a picture in which the suprathermal OH states are populated following the photodissociation of water in its $\tilde B - X$ band by ultraviolet radiation produced by fast ($\sim 80\,\rm km\,s^{-1}$) shocks along the jet. The observed dominance of emission from symmetric ($A^\prime$) OH states over that from antisymmetric ($A^{\prime\prime}$) states provides a distinctive signature of this particular population mechanism. Moreover, the variation of intensity with rotational quantum number suggests specifically that Ly$\alpha$ radiation is responsible for the photodissociation of water, an alternative model with photodissociation by a 10$^4$ K blackbody being disfavored at a high level of significance. Using measurements of the Br$\alpha$ flux to estimate the Ly$\alpha$ production rate, we find that $\sim 4\%$ of the Ly$\alpha$ photons are absorbed by water. Combined with direct measurements of water emissions in the $\nu_2 = 1 -0$ band, the OH observations promise to provide key constraints on future models for the diffusion of Ly$\alpha$ photons in the vicinity of a shock front.</description>

      <title>The Physical Origin of the Stellar Initial Mass Function</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.07301</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.07301v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Stars are amongst the most fundamental structures of our Universe. They comprise most of the baryonic and luminous mass of galaxies, synthethise heavy elements, and injec\ t mass, momentum, and energy into the interstellar medium. They are also home to the planets. Since stellar properties are primarily decided by their mass, the so-called \ stellar initial mass function (IMF) is critical to the structuring of our Universe. We review the various physical processes, and theories which have been put forward as well as the numerical simulations which have been carried out to explain the origin of the stellar initial mass function. Key messages from this review are: (1) Gravity and turbulence most likely determine the power-law, high-mass part of the IMF. (2) Depending of the Mach number and the density distribution, several regimes are possible, including $\Gamma _{IMF} \simeq 0$, -0.8, -1 or -1.3 where $d N / d \log M \propto M^{\Gamma_{IMF}}$. These regimes are likely universal, however the transition between these regimes is not. (3) Protostellar jets can play a regulating influence on the IMF by injecting momentum into collapsing clumps and unbinding gas. (4) The peak of the IMF may be a consequence of dust opacity and molecular hydrogen physics at the origin of the first hydrostatic core. This depends weakly on large scale environmental conditions such as radiation, magnetic field, turbulence or metallicity. This likely constitutes one of the reason of the relative universality of the IMF.</description>

      <title>Cosmological gas accretion history onto the stellar discs of Milky Way-like galaxies in the Auriga simulations -- (II) The inside-out growth of discs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.07320</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.07320v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the growth of stellar discs in Milky Way-mass galaxies using the magnetohydrodynamical simulations of the Auriga Project in a full cosmological context. We focus on the gas accretion process along the discs, calculating the net, infall and outflow rates as a function of galactocentric distance, and investigate the relation between them and the star formation activity. The stellar distributions of around 70% of the simulated galaxies exhibit an ``inside-out'' pattern, with older (younger) stellar populations preferentially located in the inner (outer) disc regions. In all cases, we find a very tight correlation between the infall, outflow and net accretion rates, as well as between these three quantities and the star formation rate. This is because the amount of gas which is ultimately available for star formation in each radial ring depends not only on the infall rates, but also on the amount of gas leaving the disc in outflows, which directly relates to the local star formation level. Therefore, any of these rates can be used to identify galaxies with inside-out growth. For these galaxies, the correlation between the dominant times of accretion/star formation and disc radius is well fitted by a linear function. We also find that, when averaged over galaxies with formation histories similar to the Milky Way, the simulated accretion rates show a similar evolution (both temporally- and radially-integrated) to the usual accretion prescriptions used in chemical evolution models, although some major differences arise at early times and in the inner disc regions.</description>

      <title>Proper motion study of the 6.7 GHz methanol maser rings. I. A sample of sources with little variation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.07333</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.07333v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Methanol masers at 6.7~GHz are well-known signposts of high-mass star-forming regions. [...] We aim to understand the origin of the ring-like structures outlined by methanol maser emission in a number of sources. This emission could be, a priori, spatially associated with an outflow and/or disc around a high-mass protostar. [...] Using sensitive, three-epoch observations spanning over eight years with the European VLBI Network, we have started the most direct investigations of maser rings using very accurate proper motion measurements with uncertainties below 1\,km~s$^{-1}$. We present full results for the five targets of our sample, G23.207-00.377, G23.389+00.185, G28.817+00.365, G31.047+00.356, and G31.581+00.077, where proper motions show similar characteristics; maser cloudlets do not move inwards towards the centre of the rings but rather outwards. We also include the most circular source, G23.657-00.127, in the discussion as a reference. The magnitude of maser proper motions ranges from a maximum of about 13\,km~s$^{-1}$ to 0.5~km~s$^{-1}$. In two of the five sources with a high number of maser spots (&gt;100), namely G23.207-00.377 and G23.389+00.185, we show that the size of the best elliptical model, fitted to the distribution of persistent masers, increases in time in a manner similar to the case of G23.657-00.127. Moreover, we checked the separations between the pairs of spots from distinct regions, and we were able to assess that G28.817+00.365 and G31.047+00.356 can be interpreted as showing expanding motions. We analysed the profiles of single maser cloudlets and studied their variability. Contrary to single-dish studies, the interferometric data indicate variability of the emission of single-masing cloudlets. In five of the six targets expansion motions prevail. Only in the case of G31.581+00.077 can a scenario of disc-like rotation not be excluded. [...]</description>

      <title>Monitoring AGNs with H$\beta$ Asymmetry. IV. First Reverberation Mapping Results of 14 AGNs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.07343</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.07343v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We report first-time reverberation mapping results for 14 AGNs from the ongoing Monitoring AGNs with H$\beta$ Asymmetry campaign (MAHA). These results utilize optical spectra obtained with the Long Slit Spectrograph on the Wyoming Infrared 2.3m Telescope between 2017 November-2023 May. MAHA combines long-duration monitoring with high cadence. We report results from multiple observing seasons for 9 of the 14 objects. These results include H$\beta$ time lags, supermassive black hole masses, and velocity-resolved time lags. The velocity-resolved lags allow us to investigate the kinematics of the broad-line region.</description>

      <title>Resolved UV and optical color gradients reveal environmental influence on galaxy evolution at redshift z$\sim$1.6</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.07355</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.07355v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The changes in colors across a galaxy are intimately connected to the galaxy's formation, growth, quenching history, and dust content. A particularly important epoch in the growth of galaxies is near $z \sim 2$ often referred to as 'cosmic noon', where galaxies on average reach the peak of their star formation. We study a population of 125 cluster galaxies at $z \sim 1.6$ in three Hubble Space Telescope (HST) filters, F475W, F625W, and F160W, roughly corresponding to the rest-frame FUV, NUV, and r band, respectively. By comparing to a control sample of 200 field galaxies at similar redshift, we reveal clear, statistically significant differences in the overall spatially resolved colors and color gradients in galaxies across these two different environments. On average, cluster galaxies have redder UV colors in both the inner and outer regions bounded by $r_{\mathrm{50}}$, as well as an overall wider dispersion of outside-in color gradients. The presence of these observed differences, along with evidence from ancillary data from previous studies, strongly suggests that the environment drives these population-level color differences, by affecting the stellar populations and/or dust content.</description>

      <title>ALMA-IMF XV: N$_2$H$^+$ kinematic analysis on the intermediate protocluster G353.41</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.07363</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.07363v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The ALMA-IMF Large Program provides multi-tracer observations of 15 Galactic massive protoclusters at matched sensitivity and spatial resolution. We focus on the dense gas kinematics of the G353.41 protocluster traced by N$_2$H$^+$ (1$-$0), with a critical density of $2\times10^5$~cm$^{-3}$, and spatial resolution $\sim$0.02~pc. G353.41, at a distance of 2~kpc, is embedded in a larger scale ($\sim$8~pc) filament and has a mass of 2500~M$_{\odot}$ within $1.3\times1.3$~pc$^2$. We extract the N$_2$H$^+$ isolated line component and we decompose it by fitting up to 3 Gaussian velocity components. This allows us to identify velocity structures that are either muddled or impossible to identify in the traditional position-velocity diagram. We identify multiple velocity gradients (VGs) on large and small scales. We find good agreement between the N$_2$H$^+$ and the previously reported DCN core velocities, suggesting that cores are kinematically coupled to the dense gas in which they form. We measure 9 converging V-shaped VGs, located in filaments, that are sometimes associated with cores near their point of convergence. The average timescale associated with the V-shapes are $\sim$67~kyr, or about twice the free-fall time of cores in the same area ($\sim$~33~kyr) but substantially shorter than protostar lifetime estimates ($\sim$~0.5~Myr). We interpret these V-shapes as inflowing gas feeding the regions near cores and we derive their mass accretion rates. This feeding might lead to further filament collapse and formation of new cores. We suggest that the protocluster is collapsing on large scales, but the velocity signature of collapse is slow compared to pure free-fall. Thus these data are consistent with a comparatively slow global protocluster contraction under gravity, and faster core formation within, suggesting the formation of multiple generations of stars over the protocluster lifetime.</description>

      <title>New SiS destruction and formation routes via neutral-neutral reactions and their fundamental role in interstellar clouds at low and high metallicity values</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.07406</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.07406v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Among the silicon bearing species discovered in the interstellar medium, SiS and SiO stand out as key tracers due to their distinct chemistry and abundances in interstellar and circumstellar environments. Our objective is to enhance the network of Si- and S-bearing chemical reactions for a gas-grain model in molecular clouds, encompassing both low and high metallicities. We have calculated the energies and rate coefficients for 6 neutral atom-diatom reactions involved in the SiCS triatomic system, with a special focus on the C+SiS and S+SiC collisions. We employ the coupled cluster method with single and double substitutions and a perturbative treatment of triple substitutions (CCSD(T)) refined at the explicitly correlated CCSD(T)-F12 level. With these computational results in conjunction with data from the literature, we construct an extended network of neutral-neutral chemical reactions. We performed time-dependent models employing the Nautilus gas-grain code, setting the gas temperature to 10 K and the density to 2x10$^4$ cm$^{-3}$. The temperature dependence for the reactions involving SiS were modelled using $k(T)=\alpha \left( T/300 \right)^{\beta} \exp{(-\gamma/T)}$. The high-metallicity models significantly boost the SiS production. Higher initial abundances of C, S, and Si, roughly $\sim$2, 190, and 210 times higher, respectively, contribute to this. Around 10$^3$ yr, destruction mechanisms become relevant. The proposed production reaction S + SiC $\rightarrow$ C + SiS, mitigates these effects. By expanding the gas reaction network using a high metallicity model, we derived estimates for the abundances of interstellar molecules. The inclusion of neutral-neutral mechanisms, particularly via Si+HS and S+SiC channels, played a pivotal role in determining SiS abundance. These mechanisms carry a significance on a par with the well-known and fast ion-neutral reactions.</description>

      <title>Emission-line galaxies at $z\sim1$ from near-IR HST Slitless Spectroscopy: metallicities, star formation rates and redshift confirmations from VLT/FORS2 spectroscopy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.07497</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.07497v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We follow up emission line galaxies identified through the near-infrared slitless HST/WFC3 WISP survey with VLT/FORS2 optical spectroscopy. Over 4 WISP fields, we targetted 85 of 138 line emission objects at $0.4&lt;z&lt;2$ identified in WFC3 spectroscopy. Half the galaxies are fainter than $H_{AB}=24$mag, and would not have been included in many well-known surveys based on broad-band magnitude selection. We confirm 95% of the initial WFC3 grism redshifts in the 38 cases where we detect lines in FORS2 spectroscopy. However, for targets which exhibited a single emission line in WFC3, up to 65% at $z&lt;1.28$ did not have expected emission lines detected in FORS2 and hence may be spurious (although this false-detection rate improves to 33% using the latest public WISP emission line catalogue). From the Balmer decrement the extinction of the WISP galaxies is consistent with $A($H$\alpha)=1$mag. From SED fits to multi-band photometry including Spitzer $3.6\mu$m, we find a median stellar mass of $\log_{10}(M/M_{\odot})=8.94$. Our emission-line-selected galaxies tend to lie above the star-forming main sequence (i.e. higher specific star formation rates). Using [OIII], [OII] and H$\beta$ lines to derive gas-phase metallicities, we find typically sub-solar metallicities, decreasing with redshift. Our WISP galaxies lie below the $z=0$ mass-metallicity relation, and galaxies with higher star formation rates tend to have lower metallicity. Finally, we find a strong evolution with redshift of the H$\alpha$ rest-frame equivalent width, $EW_0($H$\alpha)\propto (1+z)^{1.85\pm0.24}$ with higher $EW_0$ galaxies having larger [OIII]/H$\beta$ and O32 ratios on average, suggesting lower metallicity or higher ionisation parameter in these extreme emission line galaxies.</description>

      <title>CN and CCH derivatives of ethylene and ethane: Confirmation of the detection of CH$_3$CH$_2$CCH in TMC-1</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.07585</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.07585v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a study of CH$_3$CH$_2$CCH, CH$_3$CH$_2$CN, CH$_2$CHCCH, and CH$_2$CHCN in TMC-1 using the QUIJOTE$^1$ line survey. We confirm the presence of CH$_3$CH$_2$CCH in TMC-1, which was previously reported as tentative by our group. From a detailed study of the ethynyl and cyanide derivatives of CH$_2$CH$_2$ and CH$_3$CH$_3$ in TMC-1, we found that the CH$_2$CHCCH/CH$_2$CHCN and CH$_3$CH$_2$CCH/CH$_3$CH$_2$CN abundance ratios are 1.5$\pm$0.1 and 4.8$\pm$0.5, respectively. The derived CH$_2$CHCCH/CH$_3$CH$_2$CCH abundance ratio is 15.3$\pm$0.8, and that of CH$_2$CHCN over CH$_3$CH$_2$CN is 48$\pm$5. All the single substituted isotopologs of vinyl cyanide have been detected, and we found that the first and second carbon substitutions in CH$_2$CHCN provide a $^{12}$C/$^{13}$C ratio in line with that found for other three-carbon bearing species such as HCCNC and HNCCC. However, the third $^{13}$C isotopolog, CH$_2$CH$^{13}$CN, presents an increase in its abundance similar to that found for HCCCN. Finally, we observed eight $b$-type transitions of CH$_2$CHCN, and we find that their intensity cannot be fitted adopting the dipole moment $\mu_b$ derived previously. These transitions involve the same rotational levels as those of the $a$-type transitions. From their intensity, we obtain $\mu_b$=0.80$\pm$0.03\,D, which is found to be in between earlier values derived in the laboratory using intensity measurements or the Stark effect. Our chemical model indicates that the abundances of CH$_3$CH$_2$CCH, CH$_3$CH$_2$CN, CH$_2$CHCCH, and CH$_2$CHCN observed in TMC-1 can be explained in terms of gas-phase reactions.</description>

      <title>Addition of the Local Volume sample of galaxies from the FAST HI survey</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.07636</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.07636v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We report the discovery of 20 new dwarf galaxies in the Local Volume identified as optical counterparts to the Five-hundred-meter Aperture Spherical radio Telescope (FAST) All Sky HI Survey (FASHI) sources. The galaxies have a median stellar mass of $7.8\times 10^6~M_{\odot}$ and a median HI mass of $1.0\times 10^7~M_{\odot}$. Most of them are field galaxies while three are probable members of M 101 and M 106 groups. We also found seven FASHI radio sources to be probable dark HI clouds in nearby groups. Together with four other known HI clouds in the local groups, their mean-square radial velocity difference of 49 km s$^{-1}$ with respect to the host galaxies yields an average total mass of these groups to be ($2.7\pm1.0)\times10^{11}~M_{\odot}$ on the projected scale of 90 kpc.</description>

      <title>Kinematics $\&amp;$ Star Formation in the Hub-Filament System G6.55-0.1</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.07640</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.07640v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Hub-filament systems (HFSs) being the potential sites of formation of star clusters and high mass stars, provide a test bed for the current theories that attempt to explain star formation globally. It is thus important to study a large number of HFSs using both intensity and velocity information to constrain these objects better observationally. We present here a study of the hub-filament system associated with G6.55-0.1 using newly obtained observations of radio continuum and $J$=2--1 transition of CO, $^{13}$CO, and C$^{18}$O. The radio continuum maps show multiple peaks that coincide with far-infrared dust continuum peaks indicating the presence of more than one young massive stars in the hub of the HFS. We used the velocity information from the C$^{18}$O(2--1) map to (a) show that the source G6.55-0.1 is not physically associated with the SNR W28 and (b) disentangle and identify the velocity components genuinely associated with G6.55-0.1. Among the velocity-coherent structures identified, the two filaments at 13.8 and 17.3 km s$^{-1}$ contribute a total mass accretion rate of $\sim$3000 M$_{\odot}$ Myr$^{-1}$ to the hub. Both the filaments also show V-shaped structure, characteristic of gravitational collapse, in their velocity profile at the location of the hub. Estimated mass per unit length of the segments of the filaments are smaller than the critical line masses derived from virial equilibrium considerations. This suggests that while the filaments are not gravitationally collapsing as a whole, the spectra from the hub indicate that the inner parts are dynamically decoupled and collapsing to form stars.</description>

      <title>An Investigation of the Current Star Formation Rate of Star-forming Galaxies at z &lt; 0.5 with FADO</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.07744</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.07744v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The star formation rate (SFR) is a crucial astrophysical tracer for understanding the formation and evolution of galaxies, determining the interaction between interstellar medium properties and star formation. The mainstream approach to study the stellar content in galaxies relies on pure stellar population synthesis models. However, these methods fail to account for the contamination of SFR caused by nebular gas radiation. Recent studies have indicated that neglecting nebular radiation contamination appears to be non-negligible in galaxies with intense star-forming activities and at relatively high redshifts, potentially leading to overestimation of stellar masses. However, there is currently limited targeted research, particularly regarding galaxies at higher redshifts (z &lt; 0.5). In this investigation, we employ the BPT diagram to select a sample of 2575 star-formation galaxies (SFG) from the SDSS-DR18 dataset, all within specified signal-to-noise ratio (S/N) ranges. Using the spectroscopic fitting tool FADO, which is capable of excluding nebular radiation contributions in spectral fitting, we conduct a tentative investigation of the SFR of star-forming galaxies in SDSS- DR18 with redshifts z &lt; 0.5. Our results show that 45% of the samples show H{\alpha}{\lambda}6563 obtained from FADO fitting to be smaller than that derived solely from the pure stellar population synthesis model qsofitmore, particularly pronounced between redshifts 0.2 and 0.4. We find that the contribution of nebulae is significant and exhibits an evolutionary trend with redshift. We anticipate that by combining optical and near-infrared spectral data, the influence of nebulae may become more prominent in star-forming galaxies at higher redshifts.</description>

      <title>Galmoss: A package for GPU-accelerated Galaxy Profile Fitting</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.07780</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.07780v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce galmoss, a python-based, torch-powered tool for two-dimensional fitting of galaxy profiles. By seamlessly enabling GPU parallelization, galmoss meets the high computational demands of large-scale galaxy surveys, placing galaxy profile fitting in the LSST-era. It incorporates widely used profiles such as the S\'ersic, Exponential disk, Ferrer, King, Gaussian, and Moffat profiles, and allows for the easy integration of more complex models. Tested on 8,289 galaxies from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) g-band with a single NVIDIA A100 GPU, galmoss completed classical S\'ersic profile fitting in about 10 minutes. Benchmark tests show that galmoss achieves computational speeds that are 6 $\times$ faster than those of default implementations.</description>

      <title>Probing Three-Dimensional Magnetic Fields: III -- Synchrotron Emission and Machine Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.07806</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.07806v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Synchrotron observation serves as a fundamental tool for studying magnetic fields in various astrophysical settings, yet its ability to unveil three-dimensional (3D) magnetic fields-including plane-of-the-sky orientation, inclination angle relative to the line of sight, and magnetization-remains largely underexplored. Inspired by the latest insights into anisotropic magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) turbulence, we found that synchrotron emission's intensity structures inherently reflect this anisotropy, carrying detailed information about 3D magnetic fields. Capitalizing on this foundation, we integrate a machine learning approach-Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)-to extract this latent information, thereby facilitating the exploration of 3D magnetic fields. The model is trained on synthetic synchrotron emission maps, derived from 3D MHD turbulence simulations encompassing a range of sub-Alfv\'enic to super-Alfv\'enic conditions. We show that the CNN model is physically interpretable and the CNN is capable of reconstructing 3D magnetic field topology and assessing magnetization. In addition, we test our methodology against noise and resolution effects. We show that this CNN-based approach maintains a high degree of robustness in tracing 3D magnetic fields, even when the low spatial frequencies of the synchrotron image are absent. This renders the method particularly suitable for application to interferometric data lacking single-dish measurements.</description>

      <title>A broad linewidth, compact, millimeter-bright molecular emission line source near the Galactic Center</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.07808</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.07808v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A compact source, G0.02467-0.0727, was detected in ALMA \threemm observations in continuum and very broad line emission. The continuum emission has a spectral index $\alpha\approx3.3$, suggesting that the emission is from dust. The line emission is detected in several transitions of CS, SO, and SO$_2$ and exhibits a line width FWHM $\approx160$ \kms. The line profile appears Gaussian. The emission is weakly spatially resolved, coming from an area on the sky $\lesssim1"$ in diameter ($\lesssim10^4$ AU at the distance of the Galactic Center; GC). The centroid velocity is $v_{LSR}\approx40$-$50$ \kms, which is consistent with a location in the Galactic Center. With multiple SO lines detected, and assuming local thermodynamic equilibrium (LTE) conditions, $T_\mathrm{LTE} = 13$ K, which is colder than seen in typical GC clouds, though we cannot rule out low-density, subthermally excited, warmer gas. Despite the high velocity dispersion, no emission is observed from SiO, suggesting that there are no strong ($\gtrsim10~\mathrm{km~s}^{-1}$) shocks in the molecular gas. There are no detections at other wavelengths, including X-ray, infrared, and radio.
  We consider several explanations for the Millimeter Ultra-Broad Line Object (MUBLO), including protostellar outflow, explosive outflow, collapsing cloud, evolved star, stellar merger, high-velocity compact cloud, intermediate mass black hole, and background galaxy. Most of these conceptual models are either inconsistent with the data or do not fully explain it. The MUBLO is, at present, an observationally unique object.</description>

      <title>The effects of stellar feedback on molecular clumps in the Lagoon Nebula (M8)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.07920</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.07920v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Lagoon Nebula (M8) is host to multiple regions with recent and ongoing massive star formation. With M8-Main and M8 East, two prominent regions of massive star formation have been studied in detail over the past years, while large parts of the nebula have received little attention. These largely unexplored regions comprise a large sample of molecular clumps that are affected by the presence of massive O- and B-type stars. We establish an inventory of species observed towards 37 known molecular clumps in M8 by conducting an unbiased line survey for each clump. For this, we used APEX and the IRAM 30m telescope for pointed on-off observations on the clumps. These observations cover bandwidths of 53GHz and 40GHz in frequency ranges from 210GHz to 280GHz and from 70GHz to 117GHz, respectively. Temperatures are derived from rotational transitions of CH3CN, CH3C2H and para-H2CO. Additional archival data from the Spitzer, Herschel, MSX, APEX, WISE, JCMT and AKARI telescopes are used to derive physical parameters of the dust emission by fitting spectral energy distributions to the observed flux densities. Across the observed M8 region, we identify 346 transitions from 70 different molecular species, including isotopologues. We detect tracers of photo-dissociation regions across all the clumps and 38% of these clumps show signs of star formation. We find that PDR tracers are most abundant in clumps with relatively lower H2 column densities. When comparing M8 clumps to ATLASGAL sources at similar distances, we find them to be slightly less massive and have compatible luminosities and radii. This possibly indicates a fragmentation of the gas caused by the O- and B-type stars. In contrast, dust temperatures of the clumps in M8 are found to be increased by approximately 5K (25%) indicating substantial external heating of the clumps by radiation of the present massive stars.</description>

      <title>First Search for High-Energy Neutrino Emission from Galaxy Mergers</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.06539v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The exact sources of high-energy neutrinos detected by the IceCube neutrino observatory still remain a mystery. For the first time, this work explores the hypothesis that galaxy mergers may serve as sources for these high-energy neutrinos. Galaxy mergers can host very high-energy hadronic and photohadronic processes, which may produce very high-energy neutrinos. We perform an unbinned maximum-likelihood-ratio analysis utilizing the galaxy merger data from six catalogs and 10 years of public IceCube muon-track data to quantify any correlation between these mergers and neutrino events. First, we perform the single source search analysis, which reveals that none of the considered galaxy mergers exhibit a statistically significant correlation with high-energy neutrino events detected by IceCube. Furthermore, we conduct a stacking analysis with three different weighting schemes to understand if these galaxy mergers can contribute significantly to the diffuse flux of high-energy astrophysical neutrinos detected by IceCube. We find that upper limits (at $95\%$ c.l.) of the all flavour high-energy neutrino flux, associated with galaxy mergers considered in this study, at $100$ TeV with spectral index $\Gamma=-2$ are $2.57\times 10^{-18}$, $8.51 \times 10^{-19}$ and $2.36 \times 10^{-18}$ $\rm GeV^{-1}\,cm^2\,s^{-1}\,sr^{-1}$ for the three weighting schemes. This work shows that these selected galaxy mergers do not contribute significantly to the IceCube detected high energy neutrino flux. We hope that in the near future with more data, the search for neutrinos from galaxy mergers can either discover their neutrino production or impose more stringent constraints on the production mechanism of high-energy neutrinos within galaxy mergers.</description>

      <title>PolyBin3D: A Suite of Optimal and Efficient Power Spectrum and Bispectrum Estimators for Large-Scale Structure</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.07249</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.07249v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: By measuring, modeling and interpreting cosmological datasets, one can place strong constraints on models of the Universe. Central to this effort are summary statistics such as power spectra and bispectra, which condense the high-dimensional dataset into low-dimensional representations. In this work, we introduce a modern set of estimators for computing such statistics from three-dimensional clustering data, and provide a flexible Python implementation; PolyBin3D. Working in a maximum-likelihood formalism, we derive general estimators for the two- and three-point functions, which yield unbiased spectra regardless of the survey mask, weighting scheme, and presence of holes in the window function. These can be directly compared to theory without the need for mask-convolution. Furthermore, we present a numerical scheme for computing the optimal (minimum-variance) estimators for a given survey, which is shown to reduce error-bars on large-scales. Our Python package includes both general "unwindowed'' estimators and idealized equivalents (appropriate for simulations), each of which are efficiently implemented using fast Fourier transforms and Monte Carlo summation tricks, and additionally supports GPU acceleration. These are extensively validated in this work, with Monte Carlo convergence (relevant for masked data) achieved using only a small number of iterations (typically $&lt;10$ for bispectra). This will allow for fast and unified measurement of two- and three-point functions from current and upcoming survey data.</description>

      <title>Reionization after JWST: a photon budget crisis?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.07250</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.07250v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: New James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) observations are revealing the first galaxies to be prolific producers of ionizing photons, which we argue gives rise to a tension between different probes of reionization. For hydrogen reionization to proceed there must be enough ionizing photons for all of the hydrogen atoms, including their recombinations. Over the last two decades a consensus has emerged where star-forming galaxies are able to generate these photons, given reasonable values for their number densities, ionizing efficiencies $\xi_{\rm ion}$ (per unit UV luminosity), and escape fractions $f_{\rm esc}$. However, new JWST observations infer high values of $\xi_{\rm ion}$ during reionization and an enhanced abundance of earlier ($z\gtrsim 9$) galaxies, dramatically increasing the number of ionizing photons produced at high $z$. Simultaneously, recent low-$z$ studies predict significant escape fractions for faint reionization-era galaxies. Put together, we show that the galaxies we have directly observed ($M_{\rm UV} &lt; -15$) not only can drive reionization, but would end it too early. That is, our current galaxy observations, taken at face value, imply an excess of ionizing photons and thus a process of reionization in tension with the cosmic microwave background (CMB) and Lyman-$\alpha$ forest. Considering galaxies down to $M_{\rm UV}\approx -11$, below current observational limits, only worsens this tension, requiring on average $f_{\rm esc}\approx 3\%$, far lower than expected for early galaxies from post-reionization studies. We discuss possible avenues to resolve this photon budget crisis, including missing astrophysical or observational selection effects, as well as enhanced recombinations.</description>

      <title>Closing the stellar labels gap: Stellar label independent evidence for [$\alpha$/M] information in $\textit{Gaia}$ BP/RP spectra</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.07316</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.07316v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Data-driven models for stellar spectra which depend on stellar labels suffer from label systematics which decrease model performance: the "stellar labels gap". To close the stellar labels gap, we present a stellar label independent model for $\textit{Gaia}$ BP/RP (XP) spectra. We develop a novel implementation of a variational auto-encoder; a $\textit{scatter}$ VAE, which learns to generate an XP spectrum and intrinsic scatter without relying on stellar labels. We demonstrate that our model achieves competitive XP spectra reconstructions in comparison to stellar label dependent models. We find that our model learns stellar properties directly from the data itself. We then apply our model to XP/APOGEE giant stars to study the [$\alpha$/M] information in $\textit{Gaia}$ XP. We provide strong evidence that the XP spectra contain meaningful [$\alpha$/M] information by demonstrating that our model learns the $\alpha$-bimodality $\textit{without relying on stellar label correlations}$, for stars with $T_{\rm eff} &lt;$ 5000 K. We publicly release our trained model, codebase and data. Importantly, our stellar label independent model can be implemented for any/all XP spectra because our model performance scales with training object density, not training label density.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.07391v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Accurate age estimation of nearby young moving groups (NYMGs) is important as they serve as crucial testbeds in various fields of astrophysics, including formation and evolution of stars, planets, as well as loose stellar associations. The $\beta$-Pictoris moving group (BPMG), being one of the closest and youngest NYMGs, has been extensively investigated, and its estimated ages have a wide range from $\sim$10 to 25 Myr, depending on the age estimation methods and data used. Unlike other age dating methods, kinematic traceback analysis offers a model-independent age assessment hence the merit in comparing many seemingly discordant age estimates. In this study, we determine the kinematic ages of the BPMG using three methods: probabilistic volume calculation, mean pairwise distance calculation, and covariance matrix analysis. These methods yield consistent results, with estimated ages in the range of 14 to 20 Myr. Implementing corrections to radial velocities due to gravitational redshift and convectional blueshift increases the ages by $\sim2-4$ Myr. Conversely, considering data uncertainties decreases the estimated ages by 1 to 2 Myr. Taken together, our analysis determined the kinematic age of BPMG to be 16.3$^{+3.4}_{-2.1}$ Myr. This age is significantly younger than the commonly accepted age of the BPMG ($\sim$24 Myr) determined primarily from the lithium depletion boundary analysis. This younger kinematic age may point to the discrepancy between the luminosity evolution and lithium depletion models or the presence of unaccounted systematic error in the method. This result underscores the necessity for systematic reevaluations of age-dating methods for nearby, young moving groups.</description>

      <title>Stellar black holes can "stretch'' supermassive black hole accretion disks</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.07407v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Stellar black holes (sBHs) are widely believed to exist in the accretion disks of active galactic nuclei (AGNs). Previous studies often focus on the transient emission produced by embedded sBHs. Here, we explore the possible observational consequences of an AGN accretion disk that contains a population of accreting sBHs. Embedded accreting sBHs change the effective temperature distribution of the AGN accretion disk by heating gas in the outer regions. Two possible observational consequences are presented. First, the spectral energy distribution has a turnover feature at $\sim 4700\ \textrm{\AA}$ when the supermassive black hole (SMBH) mass is $\sim 10^8\ M_{\odot}$, which can help explain the observed shallow spectral shape at wavelengths $&gt;5000\ \textrm{\AA}$ for the Sloan Digital Sky Survey quasar composite spectrum. Second, the half-light radius of a given relatively long wavelength is significantly larger than for an AGN disk without sBHs, which can be tested by microlensing observations. With appropriate sBH distributions, the model can be reconciled with quasar microlensing disk sizes. We propose that the half-light radius-wavelength relation can be utilized to investigate the distributions of embedded sBHs in AGN accretion disks.</description>

      <title>The Sydney Radio Star Catalogue: properties of radio stars at megahertz to gigahertz frequencies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.07418</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.07418v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present the Sydney Radio Star Catalogue, a new catalogue of stars detected at megahertz to gigahertz radio frequencies. It consists of 839 unique stars with 3,405 radio detections, more than doubling the previously known number of radio stars. We have included stars from large area searches for radio stars found using circular polarisation searches, cross-matching, variability searches, and proper motion searches as well as presenting hundreds of newly detected stars from our search of Australian SKA Pathfinder observations. The focus of this first version of the catalogue is on objects detected in surveys using SKA precursor instruments; however we will expand this scope in future versions. The 839 objects in the Sydney Radio Star Catalogue are distributed across the whole sky and range from ultracool dwarfs to Wolf-Rayet stars. We find that the radio luminosities of cool dwarfs are lower than the radio luminosities of more evolved sub-giant and giant stars. We use X-ray detections of 530 radio stars by the eROSITA soft X-ray instrument onboard the SRG spacecraft to show that almost all of the radio stars in the catalogue are over-luminous in the radio, indicating that the majority of stars at these radio frequencies are coherent radio emitters. The Sydney Radio Star Catalogue can be found in Vizier or at https://radiostars.org.</description>

      <title>A Chandra Search for Periodic X-ray Sources in the Bulge of M31</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.07432</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.07432v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a systematic search for periodic X-ray sources in the bulge of M31, using ~ 2 Ms of archival Chandra observations spanning a temporal baseline of 16 years. Utilizing the Gregory-Loredo algorithm that is designed for photon-counting, phase-folded light curves, we detect seven periodic X-ray sources, among which five are newly discovered. Three of these sources are novae, the identified periods of which range between 1.3-2.0 hour and is most likely the orbital period. The other four sources are low-mass X-ray binaries, the identified periods of which range between 0.13-19.3 hour and are also likely orbital due to a clear eclipsing/dipping behavior in the light curve. We address implications on the X-ray binary population of the M31 bulge. Our study demonstrates the potential of using archival X-ray observations to systematically identify periodic X-ray sources in external galaxies, which would provide valuable information about the underlying exotic stellar populations.</description>

      <title>A Giant Metrewave Radio Telescope Survey of Radio-loud Broad Absorption Line Quasars</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.07726v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A substantial fraction of quasars display broad absorption lines (BALs) in their rest-frame ultraviolet spectra. While the origin of BALs is thought to be related to the accretion disc wind, it remains unclear whether the observed ratio of BAL to non-BAL quasars is due to orientation. We conducted observations of 48 BAL quasars and the same number of non-BAL quasars at 322 MHz using the Giant Metrewave Radio Telescope. Combined with previous flux measurements ranging from MHz to GHz frequencies, we compared continuum radio spectra between the two quasar groups. These data offer insights into low-frequency radio properties that have been difficult to investigate with previous observations only at GHz frequencies. Our results present that $73\pm13$ per cent of the BAL quasars exhibit steep or peaked spectra, a higher proportion than $44 \pm 14$ per cent observed in the non-BAL quasars. In contrast, there are no discernible differences between the two quasar groups in the radio luminosity, peak frequency, and spectral index distributions of sources with steep or peaked spectra and sources with flat or inverted spectra. Generally, as the jet axis and line of sight become closer to parallel, quasars exhibit flat or inverted spectra rather than steep or peaked ones. Therefore, these results suggest that BAL quasars are more frequently observed farther from the jet axis than non-BAL quasars. However, given that a certain proportion of BAL quasars exhibit flat or inverted spectra, more than the simple orientation scenario is required to elucidate the radio properties of BAL quasars.</description>

      <title>High speed stars: III. Detailed abundances and binary nature of the extreme speed star GHS143</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.07731v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Gaia satellite has provided the community with three releases containing astrometrical and photometric data as well as by products, such as stellar parameters and variability indicators. By selecting in the Gaia database, one can select stars with the requested characteristics, such as high speed. At present any selection is based on available Gaia releases including a subset of the observations. This, for some stars, can show some limitations, for example there is still not a sufficient number of observations to detect binarity. We investigated a star selected in Gaia EDR3 for its high speed that appears unbound to the Galaxy. We requested high-quality spectra to derive more information on the star. {From the spectroscopic investigation we confirm the low metallicity content of the star, and we derive a detailed chemical composition. The star is poor in carbon and very rich in oxygen: [(C+N+O)/Fe]=+0.65. From the two spectra observed we conclude that the star is in a binary system and from the investigation of the ionisation balance we derive that the star is closer than implied by the Gaia DR3 parallax, and thus has a a lower intrinsic luminosity. The star is probably still unbound, but there is the possibility that it is bound to the Galaxy. Its low carbon abundance suggests that the star was formed in a dwarf galaxy.</description>

      <title>Capture of stars into gaseous discs around massive black holes: Alignment, circularization and growth</title>

      <description>arXiv:2212.11301v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The majority of massive black holes (MBHs) likely hosted gas discs during their lifetimes. These could either be long-lived active galactic nuclei (AGN) discs, or shorter-lived discs formed following singular gas infall events, as was likely the case in our own Galactic Center. Stars and compact objects in such environments are therefore expected to interact with the gaseous disc as they go through it, and potentially become aligned and fully embedded within it. The interactions of embedded stars with the gas could give rise to a plethora of physical processes affecting the stars, including growth through accretion of gas, migration in the disc, stellar captures, and mergers with other stars. The impact of such processes strongly depends on the population of stars that eventually align with the disc and become embedded in it. Here we make use of analytic tools to analyze the alignment process, accounting for both geometric drag and gas dynamical friction. We find that up to $\sim 50\%$ of main sequence stars and stellar mass black holes in the central 0.1 pc can align with AGN discs in the Galactic Center and similar galactic nuclei. The orbits of aligned stars are typically circularized and are prograde with respect to the AGN disc. Furthermore, alignment and accretion are intimately linked, and the capture of stars by an AGN disc can potentially explain the origin of the young stellar disc in the Galactic Center with a top-heavy mass function, even without the need for a star-formation event.</description>

      <title>On the origin of globular clusters in a hierarchical Universe</title>

      <description>arXiv:2307.02530v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present an end-to-end description of the formation process of globular clusters (GCs) which combines a treatment for their formation and dynamical evolution within galaxy haloes with a state-of-the-art semi-analytic simulation of galaxy formation. Our approach allows us to obtain exquisite statistics to study the effect of the environment and assembly history of galaxies, while still allowing a very efficient exploration of the parameter space of star cluster physics. Our reference model, including both efficient cluster disruption during galaxy mergers and a model for the dynamical friction of GCs within the galactic potential, accurately reproduces the observed correlation between the total mass in GCs and the parent halo mass. A deviation from linearity is predicted at low halo masses, which is driven by a strong dependence on morphological type: bulge-dominated galaxies tend to host larger masses of GCs than their later-type counterparts of similar stellar mass. While the significance of the difference might be affected by resolution at the lowest halo masses considered, this is a robust prediction of our model and represents a natural consequence of the assumption that cluster migration from the disk to the halo is triggered by galaxy mergers. Our model requires an environmental dependence of GC radii to reproduce the observed mass distribution of GCs in our Galaxy at the low-mass end. At GC masses $&gt;10^6\,{\rm M}_\odot$, our model predicts fewer GCs than observed due to an overly aggressive treatment of dynamical friction. The metallicity distribution measured for Galactic GCs is well reproduced by our model, even though it predicts systematically younger GCs than observed. We argue that this adds further evidence for an anomalously early formation of the stars in our Galaxy.</description>

      <title>The abundance of dark matter haloes down to Earth mass</title>

      <description>arXiv:2310.16093v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We use the Voids-within-Voids-within-Voids (VVV) simulations, a suite of successive nested N-body simulations with extremely high resolution (denoted, from low to high resolution, by L0 to L7), to test the Press-Schechter (PS), Sheth-Tormen (ST), and extended Press-Schechter (EPS) formulae for the halo abundance over the entire mass range, from mini-haloes of $10^{-6}\ \mathrm{M_\odot}$, to cluster haloes of $10^{15}\ \mathrm{M_\odot}$, at different redshifts, from $z=30$ to the present. We find that at $z=0$ and $z=2$, ST best reproduces the results of L0, which has the mean cosmic density (overdensity $\delta=0$), at $10^{11-15} ~\mathrm{M_\odot}$. The higher resolution levels (L1-L7) are biased underdense regions ($\delta&lt;-0.6$). The EPS formalism takes this into account since it gives the mass function of a region conditioned, in this case, on having a given underdensity. EPS provides good matches to these higher levels, with deviations $\lesssim 20\%$, at $10^{-6-12.5} ~\mathrm{M_\odot}$. At $z \sim 7-15$, the ST predictions for L0 and the EPS for L1-L7 show somewhat larger deviations from the simulation results. However, at even higher redshifts, $z \sim 30$, EPS fits the simulations well again. We confirm our results by picking more subvolumes from the L0 simulation, finding that our conclusions depend only weakly on the size and overdensity of the region. The good agreement of EPS with the higher-level simulations implies that PS (or ST) gives an accurate description of the total halo mass function in representative regions of the universe.</description>

      <title>ERGO-ML: Comparing IllustrisTNG and HSC galaxy images via contrastive learning</title>

      <description>arXiv:2310.19904v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Modern cosmological hydrodynamical galaxy simulations provide tens of thousands of reasonably realistic synthetic galaxies across cosmic time. However, quantitatively assessing the level of realism of simulated universes in comparison to the real one is difficult. In this paper of the ERGO-ML series (Extracting Reality from Galaxy Observables with Machine Learning), we utilize contrastive learning to directly compare a large sample of simulated and observed galaxies based on their stellar-light images. This eliminates the need to specify summary statistics and allows to exploit the whole information content of the observations. We produce survey-realistic galaxy mock datasets resembling real Hyper Suprime-Cam (HSC) observations using the cosmological simulations TNG50 and TNG100. Our focus is on galaxies with stellar masses between $10^9$ and $10^{12} M_\odot$ at $z=0.1-0.4$. This allows us to evaluate the realism of the simulated TNG galaxies in comparison to actual HSC observations. We apply the self-supervised contrastive learning method NNCLR to the images from both simulated and observed datasets (g, r, i - bands). This results in a 256-dimensional representation space, encoding all relevant observable galaxy properties. Firstly, this allows us to identify simulated galaxies that closely resemble real ones by seeking similar images in this multi-dimensional space. Even more powerful, we quantify the alignment between the representations of these two image sets, finding that the majority ($\gtrsim 70$ per cent) of the TNG galaxies align well with observed HSC images. However, a subset of simulated galaxies with larger sizes, steeper Sersic profiles, smaller Sersic ellipticities, and larger asymmetries appears unrealistic. We also demonstrate the utility of our derived image representations by inferring properties of real HSC galaxies using simulated TNG galaxies as the ground truth.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2310.20184v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Numerical simulations and observations show that galaxies are not uniformly distributed. In cosmology, the largest known structures in the universe are galaxy filaments formed from the hierarchical clustering of galaxies due to gravitational forces. These structures consist of walls and bridges that connect clusters. Here, we use graph theory to model the structures as Euclidean networks in three-dimensional space. Using percolation theory, cosmological graphs are reduced based on the valency of nodes to reveal the inner, most robust structural formation. By constraining the network, we then find thresholds for physical features, such as length-scale and density, at which galaxy filament clusters are identified.</description>

      <title>On the tension between the Radial Acceleration Relation and Solar System quadrupole in modified gravity MOND</title>

      <description>arXiv:2401.04796v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Modified Newtonian Dynamics (MOND), postulating a breakdown of Newtonian mechanics at low accelerations, has considerable success at explaining galaxy kinematics. However, the quadrupole of the gravitational field of the Solar System (SS) provides a strong constraint on the way in which Newtonian gravity can be modified. In this paper we assess the extent to which the AQUAL and QUMOND modified gravity formulations of MOND are capable of accounting simultaneously for the Radial Acceleration Relation (RAR), the Cassini measurement of the SS quadrupole and the kinematics of wide binaries in the Solar neighbourhood. We achieve this by inferring the location and sharpness of the MOND transition from the SPARC RAR under broad assumptions for the behaviour of the interpolating function and external field effect. We constrain the same quantities from the SS quadrupole, finding that this requires a significantly sharper transition between the deep-MOND and Newtonian regimes than is allowed by the RAR (an 8.7$\sigma$ tension under fiducial model assumptions). This may be relieved somewhat by allowing additional freedom in galaxies' mass-to-light ratios -- which also improves the RAR fit -- and more significantly (to 1.9$\sigma$) by removing galaxies with bulges. For the first time, we also apply to the SPARC RAR fit an AQUAL correction for flattened systems, obtaining similar results. Finally we show that the SS quadrupole constraint implies, to high precision, no deviation from Newtonian gravity in nearby wide binaries, and speculate on possible resolutions of this tension between SS and galaxy data within the MOND paradigm.</description>

      <title>Hidden Gems on a Ring: Infant Massive Clusters and Their Formation Timeline Unveiled by ALMA, HST, and JWST in NGC 3351</title>

      <description>arXiv:2401.14453v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study young massive clusters (YMCs) in their embedded "infant" phase with $\sim0.\!^{\prime\prime}1$ ALMA, HST, and JWST observations targeting the central starburst ring in NGC 3351, a nearby Milky Way analog galaxy. Our new ALMA data reveal 18 bright and compact (sub-)millimeter continuum sources, of which 8 have counterparts in JWST images and only 6 have counterparts in HST images. Based on the ALMA continuum and molecular line data, as well as ancillary measurements for the HST and JWST counterparts, we identify 14 sources as infant star clusters with high stellar and/or gas masses (${\sim}10^5\;\mathrm{M_\odot}$), small radii (${\lesssim}\,5\;\mathrm{pc}$), large escape velocities ($6{-}10\;\mathrm{km/s}$), and short free-fall times ($0.5{-}1\;\mathrm{Myr}$). Their multiwavelength properties motivate us to divide them into four categories, likely corresponding to four evolutionary stages from starless clumps to exposed HII region-cluster complexes. Leveraging age estimates for HST-identified clusters in the same region, we infer an evolutionary timeline going from $\sim$1-2 Myr before cluster formation as starless clumps, to $\sim$4-6 Myr after as exposed HII region-cluster complexes. Finally, we show that the YMCs make up a substantial fraction of recent star formation across the ring, exhibit an non-uniform azimuthal distribution without a very coherent evolutionary trend along the ring, and are capable of driving large-scale gas outflows.</description>

Abstract: The detection of blue-shifted absorption lines likely associated with ionized Iron K-shell transitions in the X-ray spectra of many Active Galactic Nuclei (AGN) suggests the presence of a highly ionized gas outflowing with mildly relativistic velocities (0.03c-0.6c), named Ultra-Fast Outflow (UFO). Within the SUBWAYS project we characterized these winds starting from a sample of 22 radio-quiet quasars at 0.1 &lt; z &lt; 0.4, and compared the results with similar studies in the literature on samples of 42 local radio-quiet Seyfert galaxies and 14 high redshift radio-quiet quasars. The scope of our work is a statistical study of UFO parameters and incidence, considering key physical properties of the sources, e.g. supermassive black hole (SMBH) mass, bolometric luminosity, accretion rates and Spectral Energy Distribution, with the aim of gaining new insights into the UFO launching mechanisms. We find indications that highly luminous AGN with steeper X-ray/UV ratio, are more likely to host UFO. The presence of UFO is not significantly related to any other AGN property in our sample. These findings suggest that the UFO phenomenon may be transient. Focusing on AGN with UFO, other important results are: (1) faster UFO have larger ionization parameters and column densities; (2) X-ray radiation plays a more crucial role in driving highly ionized winds compared to UV; (3) the correlation between outflow velocity and luminosity is significantly flatter than what expected for radiatively driven winds; (4) more massive BH experience higher wind mass-losses, suppressing accretion of matter onto the BH; (5) the UFO launching radius is positively correlated with the Eddington ratio. Furthermore, our analysis suggest the involvement of multiple launching mechanisms, including radiation pressure and magneto-hydrodynamic processes, rather than pointing to a single, universally applicable mechanism.</description>

      <title>Stellar Populations of AGN-host Dwarf Galaxies Selected with Different Methods</title>

Abstract: In this paper we investigate the stellar populations and star formation histories of 235 active galactic nuclei (AGN)-host dwarf galaxies, consisting of four samples identified separately with different methods (i.e., radio, X-ray, mid-IR and variability), utilizing the synthesis code STARLIGHT and spectra from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) Data Release 8. Our results show that the variability sample is the oldest, while the mid-IR sample is the youngest, for which the luminosity at 4020 \AA\ is dominated ($&gt;50\%$) by the young population ($t&lt;10^8$ yr). The light-weighted mean stellar age of the whole sample is in general about 0.7 dex younger than the optical sample studied in Cai et al. We compare the population results between fitting models with and without a power-law (PL) component and find that the neglect of a PL component would lead to an under- and over-estimation by 0.2 and 0.1 dex for the light- and mass-weighted mean stellar age, respectively, for our sample of dwarf galaxies, which has a mean fractional contribution of $\sim$16\% from the AGN. In addition, we obtain further evidence for a possible suppression of star formation in the host galaxy by the central AGN. We also find that there exists an anti-correlation between the extinction-corrected [O\,{\sc iii}] luminosity and light-weighted mean stellar age, confirming our previous finding that there is a physical connection between AGN and star-forming activities in AGN-host dwarfs.</description>

      <title>The origin of supermassive black holes at cosmic dawn</title>

      <description>arXiv:2310.06898v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate the steady spherically symmetric accretion in the combined potential of a central black hole and a dark matter halo. For the halo, we consider a Hernquist and an NFW potential and calculate the critical points of the flow. We find that the trans-sonic solution to the centre is not possible without a black hole, whereas two types of trans-sonic solutions are possible in its presence. We also derive the mass accretion rate for a black hole at the centre of a dark matter halo. Our results indicate two phases of accretion. The first is an initial phase with a low accretion rate that depends on the black hole mass, followed by a second phase with a high accretion rate that depends on the halo mass. In the second phase, the black hole mass increases rapidly to supermassive scales, which explains the existence of quasars at redshift $z\ge 6$ and also the recently detected supermassive black holes (SMBHs) by the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST). Further, we calculate the evolution of the Eddington ratio for growing black holes. The accretion is mostly sub-Eddington except for a short super-Eddington episode when the mass accretion rate transitions from low to high. However, during that episode, the black hole mass is likely inadequate to hinder accretion through radiative feedback.</description>

      <title>XMM-Newton --NuSTAR monitoring campaign of the Seyfert 1 galaxy IC 4329A</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.00783</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.00783v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present the results of a joint {\it XMM-Newton} and {\it NuSTAR} campaign on the active galactic nucleus (AGN) IC 4329A, consisting of 9 $\times$ 20 ks {\it XMM-Newton} observations, and 5 $\times$ 20 ks {\it NuSTAR} observations within nine days, performed in August 2021. Within each observation, the AGN is not very variable, with the fractional variability never exceeding 5%. Flux variations are observed between the different observations, on timescales of days, with a 30% ratio between the minimum and the maximum 2-10 keV flux. These variations follow the softer-when-brighter behavior typically observed in AGN. In all observations, a soft excess is clearly present. Consistently with previous observations, the X-ray spectra of the source exhibit a cut-off energy between 140 and 250 keV, constant within the error in the different observations. We detected a prominent component of the $6.4$\,keV Fe~K$\alpha$ line consistent with being constant during the monitoring, consisting of an unresolved narrow core and a broader component likely originating in the inner accredion disc. We find that the reflection component is weak ($R_{\rm max}=0.009\pm0.002$) and most likely originating in distant neutral medium. We also found the presence of a warm absorber component together with an ultra-fast outflow. Looking at their energetic, these outflows have enough mechanical power to exercise a significant feedback impact on the AGN surrounding environment.</description>

      <title>"SNe Ia twins for life" towards a precise determination of H$_{0}$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.10334</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.10334v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Here we present an approach to the measurement of extragalactic distances using twin SNe Ia, taken from the early down to the nebular phase. The approach is purely empirical, although we can give a theoretical background on why the method is reliable. Studying those twins in galaxies where peculiar velocities are relatively unimportant, we can tackle the H$_{0}$ tension problem. Here we apply the method to the determination of the distances to NGC 7250 and NGC 2525, who hosted respectively SN 2013dy and SN 2018gv, twins of two different SNe Ia prototypes: SN 2013aa/ SN 2017cbv and SN2011fe. From the study of the SN 2013aa and SN 2017cbv twin pair, by comparing it with SN 2011fe and applying the difference between the SN 2013aa/2017cbv and the SN 2011fe class, we find as well a good estimate of the distance to NGC 5643. We just have started to measure distances with this method for the samples in Freedman et al. (2019) and Riess et al. (2022). There are differences in measured distances to the same galaxy using Cepheids or TRGBs. In this context of discrepancy, the "twins for life" method is very competitive, as it can provide distance estimates with a modulus error of $\sigma_{\mu}$ $=$ 0.04 mag. Our findings call for a revision of the distance measured with Cepheids in Riess et al. (2022). NGC 7250 and NGC 2525 need better measurements with Cepheids. The Hubble tension can arise from the way in which the local SNe Ia sample is linked to the SNe Ia Hubble flow sample. A good calibration of distances of SNe Ia in the local sample can be provided with this approach. We aim at comparing them with SNe Ia twins in galaxies at z $&gt;$0.02--0.03 well into the Hubble flow to obtain a reliable value for H$_{0}$.</description>

      <title>Thermal Structure Determines Kinematics: Vertical Shear Instability in Stellar Irradiated Protoplanetary Disks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.05608</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.05608v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Turbulence is crucial for protoplanetary disk dynamics, and Vertical Shear Instability (VSI) is a promising mechanism in outer disk regions to generate turbulence. We use Athena++ radiation module to study VSI in full and transition disks, accounting for radiation transport and stellar irradiation. We find that the thermal structure and cooling timescale significantly influence VSI behavior. The inner rim location and radial optical depth affect disk kinematics. Compared with previous vertically-isothermal simulations, our full disk and transition disks with small cavities have a superheated atmosphere and cool midplane with long cooling timescales, which suppresses the corrugation mode and the associated meridional circulation. This temperature structure also produces a strong vertical shear at $\mathrm{\tau_*}$ = 1, producing an outgoing flow layer at $\tau_* &lt; 1$ on top of an ingoing flow layer at $\tau_* \sim 1$. The midplane becomes less turbulent, while the surface becomes more turbulent with effective $\alpha$ reaching $\sim10^{-2}$ at $\tau_* \lesssim$1. This large surface stress drives significant surface accretion, producing substructures. Using temperature and cooling time measured/estimated from radiation-hydro simulations, we demonstrate that less computationally-intensive simulations incorporating simple orbital cooling can almost reproduce radiation-hydro results. By generating synthetic images, we find that substructures are more pronounced in disks with larger cavities. The higher velocity dispersion at the gap edge could also slow particle settling. Both properties are consistent with recent Near-IR and ALMA observations. Our simulations predict that regions with significant temperature changes are accompanied by significant velocity changes, which can be tested by ALMA kinematics/chemistry observations.</description>

      <title>A Multi-wavelength Study on A Gamma-ray Bright AGN 1308+326 Using KVN at 22 and 43 GHz</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.06882</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.06882v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we conduct a multi-frequency analysis of the gamma-ray bright blazar 1308+326 from February 2013 to March 2020, using the Korean VLBI Network at 22 and 43 GHz and gamma-ray data from the Fermi Large Area Telescope (LAT). Our findings reveal spectral variations around the 2014 gamma-ray flare, aligning with the shock-in-jet model. A strong correlation is observed between gamma-ray and 43 GHz emissions, with a 27-day lag in the VLBI core light curve, indicating a 50-day delay from the beginning of a specific radio flare to the gamma-ray peak. This radio flare correlates with a new jet component, suggesting the 2014 gamma-ray flare resulted from its interaction with a stationary component. Our analysis indicates the 2014 gamma-ray flare originated 40-63 parsecs from the central engine, with seed photons for the gamma-ray emission unlikely from the broad-line region.</description>
