      <title>Enhancing the conformal predictability of context-aware recommendation systems by using Deep Autoencoders</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.12110</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.12110v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the field of Recommender Systems (RS), neural collaborative filtering represents a significant milestone by combining matrix factorization and deep neural networks to achieve promising results. Traditional methods like matrix factorization often rely on linear models, limiting their capability to capture complex interactions between users, items, and contexts. This limitation becomes particularly evident with high-dimensional datasets due to their inability to capture relationships among users, items, and contextual factors. Unsupervised learning and dimension reduction tasks utilize autoencoders, neural network-based models renowned for their capacity to encode and decode data. Autoencoders learn latent representations of inputs, reducing dataset size while capturing complex patterns and features. In this paper, we introduce a framework that combines neural contextual matrix factorization with autoencoders to predict user ratings for items. We provide a comprehensive overview of the framework's design and implementation. To evaluate its performance, we conduct experiments on various real-world datasets and compare the results against state-of-the-art approaches. We also extend the concept of conformal prediction to prediction rating and introduce a Conformal Prediction Rating (CPR). For RS, we define the nonconformity score, a key concept of conformal prediction, and demonstrate that it satisfies the exchangeability property.</description>

      <title>LLM is Knowledge Graph Reasoner: LLM's Intuition-aware Knowledge Graph Reasoning for Cold-start Sequential Recommendation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.12464</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.12464v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Knowledge Graphs (KGs) represent relationships between entities in a graph structure and have been widely studied as promising tools for realizing recommendations that consider the accurate content information of items. However, traditional KG-based recommendation methods face fundamental challenges: insufficient consideration of temporal information and poor performance in cold-start scenarios. On the other hand, Large Language Models (LLMs) can be considered databases with a wealth of knowledge learned from the web data, and they have recently gained attention due to their potential application as recommendation systems. Although approaches that treat LLMs as recommendation systems can leverage LLMs' high recommendation literacy, their input token limitations make it impractical to consider the entire recommendation domain dataset and result in scalability issues. To address these challenges, we propose a LLM's Intuition-aware Knowledge graph Reasoning model (LIKR). Our main idea is to treat LLMs as reasoners that output intuitive exploration strategies for KGs. To integrate the knowledge of LLMs and KGs, we trained a recommendation agent through reinforcement learning using a reward function that integrates different recommendation strategies, including LLM's intuition and KG embeddings. By incorporating temporal awareness through prompt engineering and generating textual representations of user preferences from limited interactions, LIKR can improve recommendation performance in cold-start scenarios. Furthermore, LIKR can avoid scalability issues by using KGs to represent recommendation domain datasets and limiting the LLM's output to KG exploration strategies. Experiments on real-world datasets demonstrate that our model outperforms state-of-the-art recommendation methods in cold-start sequential recommendation scenarios.</description>

      <title>Boosting LLM-based Relevance Modeling with Distribution-Aware Robust Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.12504</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.12504v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: With the rapid advancement of pre-trained large language models (LLMs), recent endeavors have leveraged the capabilities of LLMs in relevance modeling, resulting in enhanced performance. This is usually done through the process of fine-tuning LLMs on specifically annotated datasets to determine the relevance between queries and items. However, there are two limitations when LLMs are naively employed for relevance modeling through fine-tuning and inference. First, it is not inherently efficient for performing nuanced tasks beyond simple yes or no answers, such as assessing search relevance. It may therefore tend to be overconfident and struggle to distinguish fine-grained degrees of relevance (e.g., strong relevance, weak relevance, irrelevance) used in search engines. Second, it exhibits significant performance degradation when confronted with data distribution shift in real-world scenarios. In this paper, we propose a novel Distribution-Aware Robust Learning framework (DaRL) for relevance modeling in Alipay Search. Specifically, we design an effective loss function to enhance the discriminability of LLM-based relevance modeling across various fine-grained degrees of query-item relevance. To improve the generalizability of LLM-based relevance modeling, we first propose the Distribution-Aware Sample Augmentation (DASA) module. This module utilizes out-of-distribution (OOD) detection techniques to actively select appropriate samples that are not well covered by the original training set for model fine-tuning. Furthermore, we adopt a multi-stage fine-tuning strategy to simultaneously improve in-distribution (ID) and OOD performance, bridging the performance gap between them. DaRL has been deployed online to serve the Alipay's insurance product search...</description>

      <title>Token-Level Graphs for Short Text Classification</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.12754</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.12754v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The classification of short texts is a common subtask in Information Retrieval (IR). Recent advances in graph machine learning have led to interest in graph-based approaches for low resource scenarios, showing promise in such settings. However, existing methods face limitations such as not accounting for different meanings of the same words or constraints from transductive approaches. We propose an approach which constructs text graphs entirely based on tokens obtained through pre-trained language models (PLMs). By applying a PLM to tokenize and embed the texts when creating the graph(-nodes), our method captures contextual and semantic information, overcomes vocabulary constraints, and allows for context-dependent word meanings. Our approach also makes classification more efficient with reduced parameters compared to classical PLM fine-tuning, resulting in more robust training with few samples. Experimental results demonstrate how our method consistently achieves higher scores or on-par performance with existing methods, presenting an advancement in graph-based text classification techniques. To support reproducibility of our work we make all implementations publicly available to the community\footnote{\url{https://github.com/doGregor/TokenGraph}}.</description>

      <title>A Survey on Sequential Recommendation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.12770</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.12770v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Different from most conventional recommendation problems, sequential recommendation focuses on learning users' preferences by exploiting the internal order and dependency among the interacted items, which has received significant attention from both researchers and practitioners. In recent years, we have witnessed great progress and achievements in this field, necessitating a new survey. In this survey, we study the SR problem from a new perspective (i.e., the construction of an item's properties), and summarize the most recent techniques used in sequential recommendation such as pure ID-based SR, SR with side information, multi-modal SR, generative SR, LLM-powered SR, ultra-long SR and data-augmented SR. Moreover, we introduce some frontier research topics in sequential recommendation, e.g., open-domain SR, data-centric SR, could-edge collaborative SR, continuous SR, SR for good, and explainable SR. We believe that our survey could be served as a valuable roadmap for readers in this field.</description>

      <title>RemoteRAG: A Privacy-Preserving LLM Cloud RAG Service</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.12775</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.12775v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) improves the service quality of large language models by retrieving relevant documents from credible literature and integrating them into the context of the user query. Recently, the rise of the cloud RAG service has made it possible for users to query relevant documents conveniently. However, directly sending queries to the cloud brings potential privacy leakage. In this paper, we are the first to formally define the privacy-preserving cloud RAG service to protect the user query and propose RemoteRAG as a solution regarding privacy, efficiency, and accuracy. For privacy, we introduce $(n,\epsilon)$-DistanceDP to characterize privacy leakage of the user query and the leakage inferred from relevant documents. For efficiency, we limit the search range from the total documents to a small number of selected documents related to a perturbed embedding generated from $(n,\epsilon)$-DistanceDP, so that computation and communication costs required for privacy protection significantly decrease. For accuracy, we ensure that the small range includes target documents related to the user query with detailed theoretical analysis. Experimental results also demonstrate that RemoteRAG can resist existing embedding inversion attack methods while achieving no loss in retrieval under various settings. Moreover, RemoteRAG is efficient, incurring only $0.67$ seconds and $46.66$KB of data transmission ($2.72$ hours and $1.43$ GB with the non-optimized privacy-preserving scheme) when retrieving from a total of $10^6$ documents.</description>

      <title>A Survey on Recommendation Unlearning: Fundamentals, Taxonomy, Evaluation, and Open Questions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.12836</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.12836v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recommender systems have become increasingly influential in shaping user behavior and decision-making, highlighting their growing impact in various domains. Meanwhile, the widespread adoption of machine learning models in recommender systems has raised significant concerns regarding user privacy and security. As compliance with privacy regulations becomes more critical, there is a pressing need to address the issue of recommendation unlearning, i.e., eliminating the memory of specific training data from the learned recommendation models. Despite its importance, traditional machine unlearning methods are ill-suited for recommendation unlearning due to the unique challenges posed by collaborative interactions and model parameters. This survey offers a comprehensive review of the latest advancements in recommendation unlearning, exploring the design principles, challenges, and methodologies associated with this emerging field. We provide a unified taxonomy that categorizes different recommendation unlearning approaches, followed by a summary of widely used benchmarks and metrics for evaluation. By reviewing the current state of research, this survey aims to guide the development of more efficient, scalable, and robust recommendation unlearning techniques. Furthermore, we identify open research questions in this field, which could pave the way for future innovations not only in recommendation unlearning but also in a broader range of unlearning tasks across different machine learning applications.</description>

      <title>AIR-Bench: Automated Heterogeneous Information Retrieval Benchmark</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.13102</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.13102v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Evaluation plays a crucial role in the advancement of information retrieval (IR) models. However, current benchmarks, which are based on predefined domains and human-labeled data, face limitations in addressing evaluation needs for emerging domains both cost-effectively and efficiently. To address this challenge, we propose the Automated Heterogeneous Information Retrieval Benchmark (AIR-Bench). AIR-Bench is distinguished by three key features: 1) Automated. The testing data in AIR-Bench is automatically generated by large language models (LLMs) without human intervention. 2) Heterogeneous. The testing data in AIR-Bench is generated with respect to diverse tasks, domains and languages. 3) Dynamic. The domains and languages covered by AIR-Bench are constantly augmented to provide an increasingly comprehensive evaluation benchmark for community developers. We develop a reliable and robust data generation pipeline to automatically create diverse and high-quality evaluation datasets based on real-world corpora. Our findings demonstrate that the generated testing data in AIR-Bench aligns well with human-labeled testing data, making AIR-Bench a dependable benchmark for evaluating IR models. The resources in AIR-Bench are publicly available at https://github.com/AIR-Bench/AIR-Bench.</description>

      <title>RAG Playground: A Framework for Systematic Evaluation of Retrieval Strategies and Prompt Engineering in RAG Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.12322</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.12322v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present RAG Playground, an open-source framework for systematic evaluation of Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) systems. The framework implements and compares three retrieval approaches: naive vector search, reranking, and hybrid vector-keyword search, combined with ReAct agents using different prompting strategies. We introduce a comprehensive evaluation framework with novel metrics and provide empirical results comparing different language models (Llama 3.1 and Qwen 2.5) across various retrieval configurations. Our experiments demonstrate significant performance improvements through hybrid search methods and structured self-evaluation prompting, achieving up to 72.7% pass rate on our multi-metric evaluation framework. The results also highlight the importance of prompt engineering in RAG systems, with our custom-prompted agents showing consistent improvements in retrieval accuracy and response quality.</description>

      <title>Refining Dimensions for Improving Clustering-based Cross-lingual Topic Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.12433</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.12433v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recent works in clustering-based topic models perform well in monolingual topic identification by introducing a pipeline to cluster the contextualized representations. However, the pipeline is suboptimal in identifying topics across languages due to the presence of language-dependent dimensions (LDDs) generated by multilingual language models. To address this issue, we introduce a novel, SVD-based dimension refinement component into the pipeline of the clustering-based topic model. This component effectively neutralizes the negative impact of LDDs, enabling the model to accurately identify topics across languages. Our experiments on three datasets demonstrate that the updated pipeline with the dimension refinement component generally outperforms other state-of-the-art cross-lingual topic models.</description>

      <title>LITA: An Efficient LLM-assisted Iterative Topic Augmentation Framework</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.12459</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.12459v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Topic modeling is widely used for uncovering thematic structures within text corpora, yet traditional models often struggle with specificity and coherence in domain-focused applications. Guided approaches, such as SeededLDA and CorEx, incorporate user-provided seed words to improve relevance but remain labor-intensive and static. Large language models (LLMs) offer potential for dynamic topic refinement and discovery, yet their application often incurs high API costs. To address these challenges, we propose the LLM-assisted Iterative Topic Augmentation framework (LITA), an LLM-assisted approach that integrates user-provided seeds with embedding-based clustering and iterative refinement. LITA identifies a small number of ambiguous documents and employs an LLM to reassign them to existing or new topics, minimizing API costs while enhancing topic quality. Experiments on two datasets across topic quality and clustering performance metrics demonstrate that LITA outperforms five baseline models, including LDA, SeededLDA, CorEx, BERTopic, and PromptTopic. Our work offers an efficient and adaptable framework for advancing topic modeling and text clustering.</description>

      <title>Boosting Long-Context Information Seeking via Query-Guided Activation Refilling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.12486</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.12486v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Processing long contexts poses a significant challenge for large language models (LLMs) due to their inherent context-window limitations and the computational burden of extensive key-value (KV) activations, which severely impact efficiency. For information-seeking tasks, full context perception is often unnecessary, as a query's information needs can dynamically range from localized details to a global perspective, depending on its complexity. However, existing methods struggle to adapt effectively to these dynamic information needs.
  In the paper, we propose a method for processing long-context information-seeking tasks via query-guided Activation Refilling (ACRE). ACRE constructs a Bi-layer KV Cache for long contexts, where the layer-1 (L1) cache compactly captures global information, and the layer-2 (L2) cache provides detailed and localized information. ACRE establishes a proxying relationship between the two caches, allowing the input query to attend to the L1 cache and dynamically refill it with relevant entries from the L2 cache. This mechanism integrates global understanding with query-specific local details, thus improving answer decoding. Experiments on a variety of long-context information-seeking datasets demonstrate ACRE's effectiveness, achieving improvements in both performance and efficiency.</description>

      <title>EXIT: Context-Aware Extractive Compression for Enhancing Retrieval-Augmented Generation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.12559</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.12559v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce EXIT, an extractive context compression framework that enhances both the effectiveness and efficiency of retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) in question answering (QA). Current RAG systems often struggle when retrieval models fail to rank the most relevant documents, leading to the inclusion of more context at the expense of latency and accuracy. While abstractive compression methods can drastically reduce token counts, their token-by-token generation process significantly increases end-to-end latency. Conversely, existing extractive methods reduce latency but rely on independent, non-adaptive sentence selection, failing to fully utilize contextual information. EXIT addresses these limitations by classifying sentences from retrieved documents - while preserving their contextual dependencies - enabling parallelizable, context-aware extraction that adapts to query complexity and retrieval quality. Our evaluations on both single-hop and multi-hop QA tasks show that EXIT consistently surpasses existing compression methods and even uncompressed baselines in QA accuracy, while also delivering substantial reductions in inference time and token count. By improving both effectiveness and efficiency, EXIT provides a promising direction for developing scalable, high-quality QA solutions in RAG pipelines.

      <title>SynthCypher: A Fully Synthetic Data Generation Framework for Text-to-Cypher Querying in Knowledge Graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.12612</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.12612v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Cypher, the query language for Neo4j graph databases, plays a critical role in enabling graph-based analytics and data exploration. While substantial research has been dedicated to natural language to SQL query generation (Text2SQL), the analogous problem for graph databases referred to as Text2Cypher remains underexplored. In this work, we introduce SynthCypher, a fully synthetic and automated data generation pipeline designed to address this gap. SynthCypher employs a novel LLMSupervised Generation-Verification framework, ensuring syntactically and semantically correct Cypher queries across diverse domains and query complexities. Using this pipeline, we create SynthCypher Dataset, a large-scale benchmark containing 29.8k Text2Cypher instances. Fine-tuning open-source large language models (LLMs), including LLaMa-3.1- 8B, Mistral-7B, and QWEN-7B, on SynthCypher yields significant performance improvements of up to 40% on the Text2Cypher test set and 30% on the SPIDER benchmark adapted for graph databases. This work demonstrates that high-quality synthetic data can effectively advance the state-of-the-art in Text2Cypher tasks.</description>

      <title>Cross-Dialect Information Retrieval: Information Access in Low-Resource and High-Variance Languages</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.12806</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.12806v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A large amount of local and culture-specific knowledge (e.g., people, traditions, food) can only be found in documents written in dialects. While there has been extensive research conducted on cross-lingual information retrieval (CLIR), the field of cross-dialect retrieval (CDIR) has received limited attention. Dialect retrieval poses unique challenges due to the limited availability of resources to train retrieval models and the high variability in non-standardized languages. We study these challenges on the example of German dialects and introduce the first German dialect retrieval dataset, dubbed WikiDIR, which consists of seven German dialects extracted from Wikipedia. Using WikiDIR, we demonstrate the weakness of lexical methods in dealing with high lexical variation in dialects. We further show that commonly used zero-shot cross-lingual transfer approach with multilingual encoders do not transfer well to extremely low-resource setups, motivating the need for resource-lean and dialect-specific retrieval models. We finally demonstrate that (document) translation is an effective way to reduce the dialect gap in CDIR.</description>

      <title>Selective Shot Learning for Code Explanation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.12852</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.12852v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Code explanation plays a crucial role in the software engineering domain, aiding developers in grasping code functionality efficiently. Recent work shows that the performance of LLMs for code explanation improves in a few-shot setting, especially when the few-shot examples are selected intelligently. State-of-the-art approaches for such Selective Shot Learning (SSL) include token-based and embedding-based methods. However, these SSL approaches have been evaluated on proprietary LLMs, without much exploration on open-source Code-LLMs. Additionally, these methods lack consideration for programming language syntax. To bridge these gaps, we present a comparative study and propose a novel SSL method (SSL_ner) that utilizes entity information for few-shot example selection. We present several insights and show the effectiveness of SSL_ner approach over state-of-the-art methods across two datasets. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first systematic benchmarking of open-source Code-LLMs while assessing the performances of the various few-shot examples selection approaches for the code explanation task.</description>

      <title>Cluster-guided Contrastive Class-imbalanced Graph Classification</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.12984</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.12984v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper studies the problem of class-imbalanced graph classification, which aims at effectively classifying the categories of graphs in scenarios with imbalanced class distribution. Despite the tremendous success of graph neural networks (GNNs), their modeling ability for imbalanced graph-structured data is inadequate, which typically leads to predictions biased towards the majority classes. Besides, existing class-imbalanced learning methods in visions may overlook the rich graph semantic substructures of the majority classes and excessively emphasize learning from the minority classes. To tackle this issue, this paper proposes a simple yet powerful approach called C$^3$GNN that incorporates the idea of clustering into contrastive learning to enhance class-imbalanced graph classification. Technically, C$^3$GNN clusters graphs from each majority class into multiple subclasses, ensuring they have similar sizes to the minority class, thus alleviating class imbalance. Additionally, it utilizes the Mixup technique to synthesize new samples and enrich the semantic information of each subclass, and leverages supervised contrastive learning to hierarchically learn effective graph representations. In this way, we can not only sufficiently explore the semantic substructures within the majority class but also effectively alleviate excessive focus on the minority class. Extensive experiments on real-world graph benchmark datasets verify the superior performance of our proposed method.</description>

      <title>Enabling Low-Resource Language Retrieval: Establishing Baselines for Urdu MS MARCO</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.12997</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.12997v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: As the Information Retrieval (IR) field increasingly recognizes the importance of inclusivity, addressing the needs of low-resource languages remains a significant challenge. This paper introduces the first large-scale Urdu IR dataset, created by translating the MS MARCO dataset through machine translation. We establish baseline results through zero-shot learning for IR in Urdu and subsequently apply the mMARCO multilingual IR methodology to this newly translated dataset. Our findings demonstrate that the fine-tuned model (Urdu-mT5-mMARCO) achieves a Mean Reciprocal Rank (MRR@10) of 0.247 and a Recall@10 of 0.439, representing significant improvements over zero-shot results and showing the potential for expanding IR access for Urdu speakers. By bridging access gaps for speakers of low-resource languages, this work not only advances multilingual IR research but also emphasizes the ethical and societal importance of inclusive IR technologies. This work provides valuable insights into the challenges and solutions for improving language representation and lays the groundwork for future research, especially in South Asian languages, which can benefit from the adaptable methods used in this study.</description>

      <title>CLASP: Contrastive Language-Speech Pretraining for Multilingual Multimodal Information Retrieval</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.13071</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.13071v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This study introduces CLASP (Contrastive Language-Speech Pretraining), a multilingual, multimodal representation tailored for audio-text information retrieval. CLASP leverages the synergy between spoken content and textual data. During training, we utilize our newly introduced speech-text dataset, which encompasses 15 diverse categories ranging from fiction to religion. CLASP's audio component integrates audio spectrograms with a pre-trained self-supervised speech model, while its language encoding counterpart employs a sentence encoder pre-trained on over 100 languages. This unified lightweight model bridges the gap between various modalities and languages, enhancing its effectiveness in handling and retrieving multilingual and multimodal data. Our evaluations across multiple languages demonstrate that CLASP establishes new benchmarks in HITS@1, MRR, and meanR metrics, outperforming traditional ASR-based retrieval approaches in specific scenarios.</description>

      <title>C-FedRAG: A Confidential Federated Retrieval-Augmented Generation System</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.13163</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.13163v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Organizations seeking to utilize Large Language Models (LLMs) for knowledge querying and analysis often encounter challenges in maintaining an LLM fine-tuned on targeted, up-to-date information that keeps answers relevant and grounded. Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) has quickly become a feasible solution for organizations looking to overcome the challenges of maintaining proprietary models and to help reduce LLM hallucinations in their query responses. However, RAG comes with its own issues regarding scaling data pipelines across tiered-access and disparate data sources. In many scenarios, it is necessary to query beyond a single data silo to provide richer and more relevant context for an LLM. Analyzing data sources within and across organizational trust boundaries is often limited by complex data-sharing policies that prohibit centralized data storage, therefore, inhibit the fast and effective setup and scaling of RAG solutions. In this paper, we introduce Confidential Computing (CC) techniques as a solution for secure Federated Retrieval Augmented Generation (FedRAG). Our proposed Confidential FedRAG system (C-FedRAG) enables secure connection and scaling of a RAG workflows across a decentralized network of data providers by ensuring context confidentiality. We also demonstrate how to implement a C-FedRAG system using the NVIDIA FLARE SDK and assess its performance using the MedRAG toolkit and MIRAGE benchmarking dataset.</description>

      <title>Re-calibrating methodologies in social media research: Challenge the visual, work with Speech</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.13170</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.13170v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This article methodologically reflects on how social media scholars can effectively engage with speech-based data in their analyses. While contemporary media studies have embraced textual, visual, and relational data, the aural dimension remained comparatively under-explored. Building on the notion of secondary orality and rejection towards purely visual culture, the paper argues that considering voice and speech at scale enriches our understanding of multimodal digital content. The paper presents the TikTok Subtitles Toolkit that offers accessible speech processing readily compatible with existing workflows. In doing so, it opens new avenues for large-scale inquiries that blend quantitative insights with qualitative precision. Two illustrative cases highlight both opportunities and limitations of speech research: while genres like #storytime on TikTok benefit from the exploration of spoken narratives, nonverbal or music-driven content may not yield significant insights using speech data. The article encourages researchers to integrate aural exploration thoughtfully to complement existing methods, rather than replacing them. I conclude that the expansion of our methodological repertoire enables richer interpretations of platformised content, and our capacity to unpack digital cultures as they become increasingly multimodal.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2308.07857v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Novel data sources bring new opportunities to improve the quality of recommender systems and serve as a catalyst for the creation of new paradigms on personalized recommendations. Impressions are a novel data source containing the items shown to users on their screens. Past research focused on providing personalized recommendations using interactions, and occasionally using impressions when such a data source was available. Interest in impressions has increased due to their potential to provide more accurate recommendations. Despite this increased interest, research in recommender systems using impressions is still dispersed. Many works have distinct interpretations of impressions and use impressions in recommender systems in numerous different manners. To unify those interpretations into a single framework, we present a systematic literature review on recommender systems using impressions, focusing on three fundamental perspectives: recommendation models, datasets, and evaluation methodologies. We define a theoretical framework to delimit recommender systems using impressions and a novel paradigm for personalized recommendations, called impression-aware recommender systems. We propose a classification system for recommenders in this paradigm, which we use to categorize the recommendation models, datasets, and evaluation methodologies used in past research. Lastly, we identify open questions and future directions, highlighting missing aspects in the reviewed literature.</description>

      <title>Non-autoregressive Generative Models for Reranking Recommendation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.06871</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.06871v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Contemporary recommendation systems are designed to meet users' needs by delivering tailored lists of items that align with their specific demands or interests. In a multi-stage recommendation system, reranking plays a crucial role by modeling the intra-list correlations among items. The key challenge of reranking lies in the exploration of optimal sequences within the combinatorial space of permutations. Recent research proposes a generator-evaluator learning paradigm, where the generator generates multiple feasible sequences and the evaluator picks out the best sequence based on the estimated listwise score. The generator is of vital importance, and generative models are well-suited for the generator function. Current generative models employ an autoregressive strategy for sequence generation. However, deploying autoregressive models in real-time industrial systems is challenging. To address these issues, we propose a Non-AutoRegressive generative model for reranking Recommendation (NAR4Rec) designed to enhance efficiency and effectiveness. To tackle challenges such as sparse training samples and dynamic candidates, we introduce a matching model. Considering the diverse nature of user feedback, we employ a sequence-level unlikelihood training objective to differentiate feasible sequences from unfeasible ones. Additionally, to overcome the lack of dependency modeling in non-autoregressive models regarding target items, we introduce contrastive decoding to capture correlations among these items. Extensive offline experiments validate the superior performance of NAR4Rec over state-of-the-art reranking methods. Online A/B tests reveal that NAR4Rec significantly enhances the user experience. Furthermore, NAR4Rec has been fully deployed in a popular video app Kuaishou with over 300 million daily active users.</description>

      <title>It is Never Too Late to Mend: Separate Learning for Multimedia Recommendation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.08270</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.08270v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Multimedia recommendation, which incorporates various modalities (e.g., images, texts, etc.) into user or item representation to improve recommendation quality, and self-supervised learning carries multimedia recommendation to a plateau of performance, because of its superior performance in aligning different modalities. However, more and more research finds that aligning all modal representations is suboptimal because it damages the unique attributes of each modal. These studies use subtraction and orthogonal constraints in geometric space to learn unique parts. However, our rigorous analysis reveals the flaws in this approach, such as that subtraction does not necessarily yield the desired modal-unique and that orthogonal constraints are ineffective in user and item high-dimensional representation spaces. To make up for the previous weaknesses, we propose Separate Learning (SEA) for multimedia recommendation, which mainly includes mutual information view of modal-unique and -generic learning. Specifically, we first use GNN to learn the representations of users and items in different modalities and split each modal representation into generic and unique parts. We employ contrastive log-ratio upper bound to minimize the mutual information between the general and unique parts within the same modality, to distance their representations, thus learning modal-unique features. Then, we design Solosimloss to maximize the lower bound of mutual information, to align the general parts of different modalities, thus learning more high-quality modal-generic features. Finally, extensive experiments on three datasets demonstrate the effectiveness and generalization of our proposed framework. The code is available at SEA and the full training record of the main experiment.</description>

      <title>DELRec: Distilling Sequential Pattern to Enhance LLMs-based Sequential Recommendation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.11156v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Sequential recommendation (SR) tasks aim to predict users' next interaction by learning their behavior sequence and capturing the connection between users' past interactions and their changing preferences. Conventional SR models often focus solely on capturing sequential patterns within the training data, neglecting the broader context and semantic information embedded in item titles from external sources. This limits their predictive power and adaptability. Large language models (LLMs) have recently shown promise in SR tasks due to their advanced understanding capabilities and strong generalization abilities. Researchers have attempted to enhance LLMs-based recommendation performance by incorporating information from conventional SR models. However, previous approaches have encountered problems such as 1) limited textual information leading to poor recommendation performance, 2) incomplete understanding and utilization of conventional SR model information by LLMs, and 3) excessive complexity and low interpretability of LLMs-based methods. To improve the performance of LLMs-based SR, we propose a novel framework, Distilling Sequential Pattern to Enhance LLMs-based Sequential Recommendation (DELRec), which aims to extract knowledge from conventional SR models and enable LLMs to easily comprehend and utilize the extracted knowledge for more effective SRs. DELRec consists of two main stages: 1) Distill Pattern from Conventional SR Models, focusing on extracting behavioral patterns exhibited by conventional SR models using soft prompts through two well-designed strategies; 2) LLMs-based Sequential Recommendation, aiming to fine-tune LLMs to effectively use the distilled auxiliary information to perform SR tasks. Extensive experimental results conducted on four real datasets validate the effectiveness of the DELRec framework.</description>

      <title>Multi-Modal Recommendation Unlearning for Legal, Licensing, and Modality Constraints</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.15328v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: User data spread across multiple modalities has popularized multi-modal recommender systems (MMRS). They recommend diverse content such as products, social media posts, TikTok reels, etc., based on a user-item interaction graph. With rising data privacy demands, recent methods propose unlearning private user data from uni-modal recommender systems (RS). However, methods for unlearning item data related to outdated user preferences, revoked licenses, and legally requested removals are still largely unexplored.
  Previous RS unlearning methods are unsuitable for MMRS due to the incompatibility of their matrix-based representation with the multi-modal user-item interaction graph. Moreover, their data partitioning step degrades performance on each shard due to poor data heterogeneity and requires costly performance aggregation across shards.
  This paper introduces MMRecUn, the first approach known to us for unlearning in MMRS and unlearning item data. Given a trained RS model, MMRecUn employs a novel Reverse Bayesian Personalized Ranking (BPR) objective to enable the model to forget marked data. The reverse BPR attenuates the impact of user-item interactions within the forget set, while the forward BPR reinforces the significance of user-item interactions within the retain set. Our experiments demonstrate that MMRecUn outperforms baseline methods across various unlearning requests when evaluated on benchmark MMRS datasets. MMRecUn achieves recall performance improvements of up to 49.85% compared to baseline methods and is up to $\mathbf{1.3}\times$ faster than the Gold model, which is trained on retain set from scratch. MMRecUn offers significant advantages, including superiority in removing target interactions, preserving retained interactions, and zero overhead costs compared to previous methods. The code will be released after review.</description>

      <title>Familiarity-Aware Evidence Compression for Retrieval-Augmented Generation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.12468v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) improves large language models (LMs) by incorporating non-parametric knowledge through evidence retrieved from external sources. However, it often struggles to cope with inconsistent and irrelevant information that can distract the LM from its tasks, especially when multiple evidence pieces are required. While compressing the retrieved evidence with a compression model aims to address this issue, the compressed evidence may still be unfamiliar to the target model used for downstream tasks, potentially failing to utilize the evidence effectively. We propose FaviComp (Familarity-Aware Evidence Compression), a novel training-free evidence compression technique that makes retrieved evidence more familiar to the target model, while seamlessly integrating parametric knowledge from the model. Experimental results show that FaviComp consistently outperforms most recent evidence compression baselines across multiple open-domain QA datasets, improving accuracy by up to 28.1% while achieving high compression rates.
