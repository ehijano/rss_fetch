      <title>Scott analysis, linear orders and almost periodic functions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.01836</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.01836v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: For any limit ordinal $\lambda$, we construct a linear order $L_\lambda$ whose Scott complexity is $\Sigma_{\lambda+1}$. This completes the classification of the possible Scott sentence complexities of linear orderings. Previously, there was only one known construction of any structure (of any signature) with Scott complexity $\Sigma_{\lambda+1}$, and our construction gives new examples, e.g., rigid structures, of this complexity.
  Moreover, we can construct the linear orders $L_\lambda$ so that not only does $L_\lambda$ have Scott complexity $\Sigma_{\lambda+1}$, but there are continuum-many structures $M \equiv_\lambda L_\lambda$ and all such structures also have Scott complexity $\Sigma_{\lambda+1}$. In contrast, we demonstrate that there is no structure (of any signature) with Scott complexity $\Pi_{\lambda+1}$ that is only $\lambda$-equivalent to structures with Scott complexity $\Pi_{\lambda+1}$.
  Our construction is based on functions $f \colon \mathbb{Z}\to \mathbb{N}\cup \{\infty\}$ which are almost periodic but not periodic, such as those arising from shifts of the $p$-adic valuations.</description>

      <title>Hybrid Maximal Filter Spaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.01840</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.01840v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce a new way of encoding general topology in second order arithmetic that we call hybrid maximal filter (hybrid MF) spaces. This notion is a modification of the notion of a proper MF space introduced by Montalb\'an. We justify the shift by showing that proper MF spaces are not able to code most topological spaces, while hybrid MF spaces can code any second countable MF space. We then answer Montalb\'an's question about metrization of well-behaved MF spaces to this shifted context. To be specific, we show that in stark contrast to the original MF formalization used by Mummert and Simpson, the metrization theorem can be proven for hybrid MF spaces within $\text{ACA}_0$ instead of needing $\Pi_2^1-\text{CA}_0$.</description>

      <title>On Ramsey degrees, compactness and approximability</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.02007</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.02007v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: One of the consequences of the Compactness Principle in structural Ramsey theory is that the small Ramsey degrees cannot exceed the corresponding big Ramsey degrees, thereby justifying the choice of adjectives. However, it is unclear what happens in the realm of dual Ramsey degrees due to the lack of the compactness argument that applies to that setting. In this paper we present a framework within which both ``direct'' and dual Ramsey statements can be stated and reasoned about in a uniform fashion. We introduce the notion of approximability which yields a general compactness argument powerful enough to prove statements about both ``direct'' and dual Ramsey phenomena. We conclude the paper with an application of the new strategies by generalizing Voigt's $\star$-version of the Infinite Ramsey Theorem to a large class of relational structures and deriving a Ramsey statement for ``loose colorings'' of enumerated Fra\"{\i}ss\'{e} limits.</description>

      <title>Description Complexity of Unary Structures in First-Order Logic with Links to Entropy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.02108</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.02108v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The description complexity of a model is the length of the shortest formula that defines the model. We study the description complexity of unary structures in first-order logic FO, also drawing links to semantic complexity in the form of entropy. The class of unary structures provides a simple way to represent tabular Boolean data sets as relational structures. We define structures with FO-formulas that are strictly linear in the size of the model as opposed to using the naive quadratic ones, and we use arguments based on formula size games to obtain related lower bounds for description complexity. We also obtain a precise asymptotic result on the expected description complexity of a randomly selected structure. We then give bounds on the relationship between Shannon entropy and description complexity. We extend this relationship also to Boltzmann entropy by establishing an asymptotic match between the two entropies. Despite the simplicity of unary structures, our arguments require the use of formula size games, Stirling's approximation and Chernoff bounds.</description>

      <title>Borel Complexity and the Schr\"oder-Bernstein Property</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/1810.00493</link>
      <description>arXiv:1810.00493v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We introduce a new invariant of Borel reducibility, namely the notion of thickness; this associates to every sentence $\Phi$ of $\mathcal{L}_{\omega_1 \omega}$ and to every cardinal $\lambda$, the thickness $\tau(\Phi, \lambda)$ of $\Phi$ at $\lambda$. As applications, we show that all the Friedman-Stanley jumps of torsion abelian groups are non-Borel complete. We also show that under the existence of large cardinals, if $\Phi$ is a sentence of $\mathcal{L}_{\omega_1 \omega}$ with the Schr\"{o}der-Bernstein property (that is, whenever two countable models of $\Phi$ are biembeddable, then they are isomorphic), then $\Phi$ is not Borel complete.</description>

      <title>Differentially Henselian Fields</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.07456</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.07456v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the class of differentially henselian fields, which are henselian valued fields equipped with generic derivations in the sense of Cubides Kovacics and Point, and are special cases of differentially large fields in the sense of Le\'on S\'anchez and Tressl. We prove that many results from henselian valued fields as well as differentially large fields can be lifted to the differentially henselian setting, for instance Ax-Kochen/Ershov principles, characterisations in terms of differential algebras, etc. We also give methods to concretely construct such fields in terms of iterated power series expansions and inductive constructions on transcendence bases.</description>

      <title>Equational theory of ordinals with addition and left multiplication by $\omega$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.13661</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.13661v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We show that the equational theory of the structure $\langle \omega^{\omega}: (x,y)\mapsto x+y, x\mapsto \omega x \rangle $ is finitely axiomatizable and give a simple axiom schema when the domain is the set of transfinite ordinals. We give an algorithm that given a pair of terms $(E,F)$ decides in linear time with respect of their common length whether or not $E=F$ is a consequence of the axioms.</description>

      <title>Defining $\mathbb Z$ using unit groups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.02521</link>
      <description>arXiv:2303.02521v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We consider first-order definability and decidability questions over rings of integers of algebraic extensions of $\Q$, paying attention to the uniformity of definitions. The uniformity follows from the simplicity of our first-order definition of $\Z$. Namely, we prove that for a large collection of algebraic extensions $K/\Q$, $$ \{x \in \oo_K : \text{$\forall \e \in \oo_K^\times \;\exists \delta \in \oo_K^\times$ such that $\delta-1 \equiv (\e-1)x \pmod{(\e-1)^2}$}\} = \Z $$ where $\oo_K$ denotes the ring of integers of $K$. One of the corollaries of our results is undecidability of the field of constructible numbers, a question posed by Tarski in 1948.</description>

      <title>Differentiable approximation of continuous definable maps that preserves the image</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.10538</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.10538v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recently Paw\l{}ucki showed that compact sets that are definable in some o-minimal structure admit triangulations of class $\mathcal{C}^p$ for each integer $p\geq 1$. In this work, we make use of these new techniques of triangulation to show that all continuous definable maps between compact definable sets can be approximated by differentiable maps without changing their image after the approximation. The argument is an interplay between o-minimal geometry and PL geometry and makes use of a `surjective definable version' of the finite simplicial approximation theorem that we prove here.</description>
