      <title>First order operators on shrinking graph-like spaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.19904</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.19904v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this article we discuss the convergence of first order operators on a thickened graph (a graph-like space) towards a similar operator on the underlying metric graph. On the graph-like space, the first order operator is of the form exterior derivative (the gradient) on functions and its adjoint (the negative divergence) on closed 1-forms (irrotational vector fields). Under the assumption that each cross section of the tubular edge neighbourhood is convex, that each vertex neighbourhood is simply connected and under suitable uniformity assumptions (which hold in particular, if the spaces are compact) we establish generalised norm resolvent convergence of the first order operator on the graph-like space towards the one on the metric graph. The square of the first order operator is of Laplace type; on the metric graph, the function (0-form) component is the usual standard (Kirchhoff) Laplacian. A key ingredient in the proof is a uniform Gaffney estimate: such an estimate follows from an equality relating here the divergence operator with all (weak) partial derivatives and a curvature term, together with a (localised) Sobolev trace estimate.</description>

      <title>Hyperelliptic sigma functions and the Kadomtsev-Petviashvili equation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.19972</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.19972v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, a theory of hyperelliptic functions based on multidimensional sigma functions is developed and explicit formulas for hyperelliptic solutions to the Kadomtsev-Petviashvili equations KP-I and KP-II are obtained. The long-standing problem of describing the dependence of these solutions on the variation of the parameters of hyperelliptic curves, which are integrals of the equations, is solved.</description>

      <title>Limit theorems for the non-convex multispecies Curie-Weiss model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.20155</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.20155v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the thermodynamic properties of the generalized non-convex multispecies Curie-Weiss model, where interactions among different types of particles (forming the species) are encoded in a generic matrix. For spins with a generic prior distribution, we compute the pressure in the thermodynamic limit using simple interpolation techniques. For Ising spins, we further analyze the fluctuations of the magnetization in the thermodynamic limit under the Boltzmann-Gibbs measure. It is shown that a central limit theorem holds for a rescaled and centered vector of species magnetizations, which converges to either a centered or non-centered multivariate normal distribution, depending on the rate of convergence of the relative sizes of the species.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2502.20219v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this study, a recursive solution technique in conjunction with generalized integrating factors is presented and applied to address first and second order linear differential equations. This approach demonstrates practical utility in classical differential equations encountered in physics, inclusive of equations with variable coefficients, particularly when a pattern within the recursion is identifiable, thus enabling the derivation of an explicit expression for $y(x)$.</description>

      <title>Non-relativistic limit of Dirac Hamiltonians with Aharonov-Bohm fields</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.20318</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.20318v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We characterise the families of self-adjoint Dirac and Schr\"{o}dinger operators with Aharonov-Bohm magnetic field, and we exploit the non-relativistic limit of infinite light speed to connect the former to the latter. The limit consists of the customary removal of the rest energy and of a suitable scaling, with the light speed, of the short-scale boundary condition of self-adjointness. This ensures that the scattering length of the Aharonov-Bohm interaction is preserved along the limit. Noteworthy is the fact that the whole family of Dirac-AB operators is mapped, in the non-relativistic limit, into the physically relevant sub-family of $s$-wave, angular-momentum-commuting, Schr\"{o}\-dinger-AB Hamiltonians with relativistic Dirac approximants.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2010.15723v5 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper introduces an alternative generalization of the static solution with quadrupole moment, the $\rm q$-metric, that describes a deformed compact object in the presence of the external fields characterized by multipole moments. In addition, we also examine the impact of the external fields up to quadrupole on the circular geodesics and the interplay of these two quadrupoles on the place of the innermost stable circular orbit (ISCO) in the equatorial plane.</description>

      <title>Vacuum polarization effects in the background of a deformed compact object and implications for photon velocity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.15399</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.15399v2 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper studies the impact of vacuum polarization on light propagation in the background of a distorted, deformed compact object. Focusing on a spacetime containing two quadrupole parameters associated with the central object and external fields, we explore how these parameters influence observable effects as dynamical degrees of freedom. In this setup, we investigate electromagnetic birefringence, noting distinct polarization-dependent photon velocity variations and gravitational lens effects. Although current resolution may limit detection, future high-precision observations could reveal these quantum electrodynamics (QED) induced birefringence effects, advancing our understanding of vacuum birefringence in astrophysical contexts. We further analyze the dependence of shadow properties on the model's variables, using observational data from Sgr A*.</description>

      <title>Infinite-dimensional Extension of the Linear Combination of Hamiltonian Simulation: Theorems and Applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.19688</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.19688v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We generalize the Linear Combination of Hamiltonian Simulation (LCHS) formula [An, Liu, Lin, Phys. Rev. Lett. 2023] to simulate time-evolution operators in infinite-dimensional spaces, including scenarios involving unbounded operators. This extension, named Inf-LCHS for short, bridges the gap between finite-dimensional quantum simulations and the broader class of infinite-dimensional quantum dynamics governed by partial differential equations (PDEs). Furthermore, we propose two sampling methods by integrating the infinite-dimensional LCHS with Gaussian quadrature schemes (Inf-LCHS-Gaussian) or Monte Carlo integration schemes (Inf-LCHS-MC). We demonstrate the applicability of the Inf-LCHS theorem to a wide range of non-Hermitian dynamics, including linear parabolic PDEs, queueing models (birth-or-death processes), Schr\"odinger equations with complex potentials, Lindblad equations, and black hole thermal field equations. Our analysis provides insights into simulating general linear dynamics using a finite number of quantum dynamics and includes cost estimates for the corresponding quantum algorithms.</description>

      <title>Axisymmetric type II blowup solutions to the three dimensional Keller-Segel system</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.19775</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.19775v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We construct axisymmetric solutions to the three-dimensional parabolic-elliptic Keller-Segel system that blows up in finite time. In particular, the singularity is of type II, which admits locally a leading order profile of the rescaled stationary solution of the two-dimensional system. Additionally, mass concentration occurs along a one-dimensional ring in the plane. In the analysis, we rely on an approximate solution of the eigenproblem associated with the linearized operator around the stationary solution as well as the modulation dynamics to control the perturbation function and derive the accurate blowup rate.</description>

      <title>Postponing the choice: advantage of deferred measurements in quantum information processing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.19871</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.19871v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Simultaneously implementing two arbitrary quantum measurements on the same system is impossible. The consequence of this limitation is that selecting one measurement actively excludes other possibilities. Two incompatible choices can then be forced together only at the cost of adding enough noise to the measurements. An intriguing alternative is to postpone the choice, or part of it, until a later stage. We explore the advantages of this deferred decision-making and discover that the benefits critically depends on the assumptions about the forthcoming choice. In certain scenarios postponing the choice introduces no additional cost, while in others partial postponement can be effectively the same as full postponement.</description>

      <title>Integral representation of solutions to initial-boundary value problems in the framework of the hyperbolic heat equation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.20057</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.20057v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider initial-boundary value problems on a finite interval for the system of the energy balance equation and modified Fourier's law (constitutive equation, commonly called the Cattaneo equation) describing temperature (or internal energy) and heat flux. This hyperbolic system of first-order partial differential equations is the simplest model of non-Fourier heat conduction. Boundary conditions comprise various models of behavior of a physical system at the boundaries, including boundary conditions describing Newton's law, which states that the heat flux at the boundary is directly proportional to the difference in the temperature of the physical system and ambient temperature. In this case the boundary conditions express the relationship of unknown functions (temperature or internal energy and heat flux) with each other. To solve the problems, we apply the Fokas unified transform method.</description>

      <title>Highly Entangled 2D Ground State: Tensor Network, Order Parameter and Correlation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.20192v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this article we present analytical results on the exact tensor network representation, spin order parameter and color correlation function of the first example of 2D ground states with entanglement phase transitions from area law to extensive entanglement entropy. The tensor network constructed is one dimension higher than the lattice of the physical system, allowing entangled physical degrees of freedoms to be paired with one another arbitrarily far away. Contraction rules of the internal legs are specified by a simple translationally invariant set of rules in terms of the tesselation of cubes in 3D space. The network directly generalizes the previous holographic tensor networks for 1D Fredkin and Motzkin chains. We also analyze the order parameter of in the spin sector from the scaling of the height function of random surfaces, and the correlation in the color sector.</description>

      <title>Decay of resolvent kernels and Schr\"odinger eigenstates for L\'evy operators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.20210</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.20210v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the spatial decay behaviour of resolvent kernels for a large class of non-local L\'evy operators and bound states of the corresponding Schr\"odinger operators. Our findings naturally lead us to proving results for L\'evy measures, which have subexponential or exponential decay, respectively. This leads to sharp transitions in the the decay rates of the resolvent kernels. We obtain estimates that allow us to describe and understand the intricate decay behaviour of the resolvent kernels and the bound states in either regime, extending findings by Carmona, Masters and Simon for fractional Laplacians (the subexponential regime) and classical relativistic operators (the exponential regime). Our proofs are mainly based on methods from the theory of operator semigroups.</description>

      <title>Environment-friendly technologies with lead-free piezoelectric materials: A review of recent developments, applications, and modelling approaches</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.20250</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.20250v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Piezoelectric materials are widely used in several industries, including power sources, energy harvesting, biomedical, electronics, haptic, photostrictive, and sensor/actuator technologies. Conventional piezoelectric materials, such lead zirconate titanate (PZT), pose significant environmental and health risks due to lead content. Recent years have seen a growing need for eco-friendly alternatives to lead-based piezoelectric technologies. The drawback of lead-free piezoelectric materials is a reduced responsiveness. To enhance the performance of lead-free piezoelectric materials, substantial research is being undertaken using both experimental and numerical methods. The experimental studies provide a deep understanding of the process and are crucial for developing lead-free piezoelectric materials. Relying only on experimental research is not feasible due to high expenditures. To understand the piezoelectric properties of lead-free materials and enhance their efficiency, it is crucial to develop varied numerical models and computational methods. This paper is a comprehensive summary of lead-free piezoelectric technology breakthroughs. The study emphasizes numerical models that demonstrate enhanced piezoelectric behaviour and their use in eco-friendly technologies like energy harvesting, haptics, nano-electromechanical, photostrictive, and biomedical sensors and actuators using lead-free materials. The paper discusses the synthesis, properties, and applications of eco-friendly materials, highlighting their potential to revolutionize piezoelectric devices and promote sustainable development and conservation.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2502.20251v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Manin theories are a class of non-topological deformations of Chern-Simons theories that naturally realise the third-way mechanism and furthermore admit localisation despite not being supersymmetric in the usual sense. In this paper, we extend this construction to higher dimensions, thereby producing a large class of examples of third-way-type theories. Furthermore, the construction naturally yields Yang-Baxter integrable deformations of the principal chiral model as well as gravitational models various dimensions.</description>

      <title>Symmetry defects and gauging for quantum states with matrix product unitary symmetries</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.20257</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.20257v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this work, we examine the consequences of the existence of a finite group of matrix product unitary (MPU) symmetries for matrix product states (MPS). We generalize the well-understood picture of onsite unitary symmetries, which give rise to virtual symmetry defects given by insertions of operators in the bonds of the MPS. In the MPU case, we can define analogous defect tensors, this time sitting on lattice sites, that can be created, moved, and fused by local unitary operators. We leverage this formalism to study the gauging of MPU symmetries. We introduce a condition, block independence, under which we can gauge the symmetries by promoting the symmetry defects to gauge degrees of freedom, yielding an MPS of the same bond dimension that supports a local version of the symmetry given by commuting gauge constraints. Whenever block independence does not hold (which happens, in particular, whenever the symmetry representation is anomalous), a modification of our method which we call state-level gauging still gives rise to a locally symmetric MPS by promotion of the symmetry defects, at the expense of producing gauge constraints that do not commute on different sites.</description>

      <title>Boltzmann framework for polyatomic gases: review on well-posedness, higher integrability and physical relevance</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.20308</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.20308v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper reviews results on the scalar Boltzmann equation for a single-component polyatomic gas with continuous internal energy. For the space homogeneous problem, $L^1$-theory is established, for solutions with initial strictly positive mass and bounded energy, which enables to solve the Cauchy problem for initial data with $L^1_{2^+}$-moments using the comparison principle for ODEs. Then, deriving entropy-based estimates, $L^p$-integrability properties of the solution are explored, $p\in (1,\infty]$. All these analytical results hold under a specific assumption on the collision kernel corresponding to cut-off and hard-potentials type. A mean to verify physical applicability of the model is to evaluate the corresponding Boltzmann collision operator and to derive models for transport coefficients in terms of the collision kernel parameters. Comparison with experimental data for polytropic gases determines values of these parameters showing the physical relevance of the collision kernel.</description>

      <title>Probing non-equilibrium steady states of the Klein-Gordon field with Unruh-DeWitt detectors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.20328</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.20328v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We calculate the transition rate of an Unruh-DeWitt detector coupled to a non-equilibrium steady state (NESS) of a free massless scalar field on four-dimensional Minkowski spacetime. The NESS arises from bringing two semi-infinite heat baths into thermal contact along a hypersurface. The detector couples linearly to the field by a monopole interaction, and it moves inertially along the axis of the NESS heat flow. We contrast the resulting transition rates with the case of a detector that is coupled to an inertial thermal equilibrium state. The results illustrate that the monopole does not properly couple to the heat flow, resulting in the detector to merely register kinematical effects. Hence dynamical features of the NESS are hidden from this detector model.</description>

Abstract: We study the connection between $\mathrm{SU}(n)$ spin chains and one-dimensional sigma models on flag manifolds. Using this connection, we calculate the spectrum of the Laplace-Beltrami operator and geodesics for a particular class of metrics on $\mathbb{CP}^1$ and $\mathcal{F}_3$, which is a manifold of complete flags in $\mathbb{C}^3$.</description>

Abstract: We locally classify all possible cosmological homogeneous and isotropic Landsberg-type Finsler structures, in 4-dimensions. Among them, we identify viable non-stationary Finsler spacetimes, i.e. those geometries leading to a physical causal structure and a dynamical universe. Noting that any non-stationary Landsberg metric must be actually non-Berwaldian (i.e., it should be a so-called 'unicorn'), we construct the unique Finsler, non-Berwaldian Landsberg generalization of Friedmann-Lemaitre-Robertson-Walker geometry.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2502.18349v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Recent advancements have been made to understand the statistics of the Aztec diamond dimer model under general periodic weights. In this work we define a model that breaks periodicity in one direction by combining two different two-periodic weightings. We compute the correlation kernel for this Aztec diamond dimer model by extending the methods developed by Berggren and Duits (2019), which utilize the Eynard-Mehta theorem and a Wiener-Hopf factorization. From a form of the correlation kernel that is suitable for asymptotics, we compute the local asymptotics of the model in the different macroscopic regions present. We prove that the local asymptotics of the model agree with the typical two-periodic model in the highest order, however the sub-leading order terms are affected.</description>

      <title>Gromov-Witten Invariants and Mirror Symmetry For Non-Fano Varieties Via Tropical Disks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.16782</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.16782v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Under mirror symmetry a non-Fano variety $X$ corresponds to an instanton corrected Hori-Vafa potential $W$. The classical period of $W$ equals the regularized quantum period of $X$, which is a generating function for descendant Gromov-Witten invariants. These periods define closed mirror maps relating complex with symplectic parameters and open mirror maps relating coordinates on the mirror curves.
  We interpret the corrections to $W$ by broken lines in a scattering diagram, so that $W$ is the primitive theta function $\vartheta_1$. We show that, after wall crossing to infinity and application of the closed mirror map, $W=\vartheta_1$ is equal to the open mirror map. By tropical correspondence, $\vartheta_1$ is a generating function for $2$-marked logarithmic Gromov-Witten invariants, which are algebraic analogues of counts of Maslov index $2$ disks. This generalizes the predictions of mirror symmetry to the non-Fano case.</description>

      <title>Infinitesimal 2-braidings from 2-shifted Poisson structures</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.00391v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: It is shown that every $2$-shifted Poisson structure on a finitely generated semi-free commutative differential graded algebra $A$ defines a very explicit infinitesimal $2$-braiding on the homotopy $2$-category of the symmetric monoidal dg-category of finitely generated semi-free $A$-dg-modules. This provides a concrete realization, to first order in the deformation parameter $\hbar$, of the abstract deformation quantization results in derived algebraic geometry due to Calaque, Pantev, To\"en, Vaqui\'e and Vezzosi. Of particular interest is the case when $A$ is the Chevalley-Eilenberg algebra of a Lie $N$-algebra, where the braided monoidal deformations developed in this paper may be interpreted as candidates for representation categories of `higher quantum groups'.</description>

Abstract: We revisit key notions related to the evolution of quantum information in few-body quantum mechanics (fbQM) and, for a wide class of dispersion relations, prove uniform bounds on the maximal speed of propagation of quantum information for states and observables with exponential error bounds. Our results imply, in particular, a fbQM version of the Lieb-Robinson bound, which is known to have wide applications in quantum information sciences. We propose a novel approach to proving maximal speed bounds.</description>

      <title>Gelation in Vector Multiplicative Coalescence and Extinction in Multi-Type Poisson Branching Processes</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.06910v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Random coalescent processes and branching processes are two fundamental constructs in the field of stochastic processes, each with a rich history and a wide range of applications. Though developed within distinct contexts, in this note we present a novel connection between a multi-type (vector) multiplicative coalescent process and a multi-type branching process with Poisson offspring distributions. More specifically, we show that the equations that govern the phenomenon of gelation in the vector multiplicative coalescent process are equivalent to the set of equations that yield the extinction probabilities of the corresponding multi-type Poisson branching process. We then leverage this connection with two applications, one in each direction. The first is a new quick proof of gelation in the vector multiplicative coalescent process using a well known result of branching processes, and the second is a new series expression for the extinction probabilities of the multi-type Poisson branching process using results derived from the theory of vector multiplicative coalescence. While the correspondence is fairly straightforward, it illuminates a deep connection between these two paradigms which we hope will continue to reveal new insights and potential for cross-disciplinary research.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.24109v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Using a renormalization-inspired perturbation expansion we show that oscillons in a generic field theory in (1+1) dimensions arise as dressed $Q$-balls of a universal (up to the leading nonlinear order) complex field theory. This theory reveals a close similarity to the integrable complex sine-Gordon model which possesses exact multi-$Q$-balls. We show that excited oscillons, with characteristic modulations of their amplitude, are two-oscillons bound states generated from a two $Q$-ball solution.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.14434v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We discuss a large class of non-relativistic continuum field theories where the Euclidean spatial symmetry of the classical theory is violated in the quantum theory by an Adler-Bell-Jackiw-like anomaly. In particular, the continuous translation symmetry of the classical theory is broken in the quantum theory to a discrete symmetry. Furthermore, that discrete symmetry is extended by an internal symmetry, making it non-Abelian. This presentation streamlines and extends the discussion in [1]. In an Appendix, we present an elementary introduction to 't Hooft and Adler-Bell-Jackiw anomalies using a well-known system.</description>

      <title>Oscillons from $Q$-balls</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.09136</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.09136v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Using Renormalization Group Theory we show that oscillons in (1+1)-dimensions can be obtained, at the leading nonlinear order, from $Q$-balls of universal complex field theories. For potentials with a nonzero cubic or quartic term the universal $Q$-ball theory is well approximated by the integrable complex sine-Gordon model. This allows us to generalize the usual perturbative expansion by Fodor et. al. beyond the simplest unmodulated oscillon case. Concretely, we explain the characteristic amplitude modulations of excited oscillons as an effect of formation of a two-$Q$-ball (two-oscillon) bound state.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2502.11796v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We consider a Brownian particle performing an overdamped motion in a power-law repulsive potential. If the potential grows with the distance faster than quadratically, the particle escapes to infinity in a finite time. We determine the average blowup time and study the probability distribution of the blowup time. In particular, we show that the long-time tail of this probability distribution decays purely exponentially, while the short-time tail exhibits an essential singularity. These qualitative features turn out to be quite universal, as they occur for all rapidly growing power-law potentials in arbitrary spatial dimensions. The quartic potential is especially tractable, and we analyze it in more detail.</description>
