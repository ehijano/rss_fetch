      <title>Ukrainian-style oligarchic economies: how concentrated power undermines value added in production chains</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.02949</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.02949v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Oligarchic control exerts significant distortions on economic efficiency. Ukraine exemplifies this phenomenon, where oligarchs dominate key sectors and achieve economies of scale through vertical integration of coal mines, steel mills, and power plants while controlling critical infrastructure (e.g. access to transportation networks) to stifle competition. Their Soviet-era production chain monopolization strategies, coupled with political patronage networks (including both local and national governments), reinforce systemic inefficiencies and barriers to market entry.
  Although existing studies highlight the developmental benefits of de-oligarchization, this work advances the literature through computational modeling. We develop an agent-based model of a partially oligarch-controlled economy, where firms with heterogeneous production functions interact within a value-added network. Through numerical simulations, we quantify how different de-oligarchization policies affect aggregate GDP growth.
  The results indicate that the optimal de-oligarchization strategies are determined by the position of the oligarch in the production chain. Depending on the oligarch's position, dismantling oligarchic structures should either focus on removing oligarchs' access to raw materials or on breaking oligarchs' influence on other transactions in the production chain.</description>

      <title>Measuring Human Leadership Skills with Artificially Intelligent Agents</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.02966</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.02966v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We show that the ability to lead groups of humans is predicted by leadership skill with Artificially Intelligent agents. In a large pre-registered lab experiment, human leaders worked with AI agents to solve problems. Their performance on this 'AI leadership test' was strongly correlated with their causal impact on human teams, which we estimate by repeatedly randomly assigning leaders to groups of human followers and measuring team performance. Successful leaders of both humans and AI agents ask more questions and engage in more conversational turn-taking; they score higher on measures of social intelligence, fluid intelligence, and decision-making skill, but do not differ in gender, age, ethnicity or education. Our findings indicate that AI agents can be effective proxies for human participants in social experiments, which greatly simplifies the measurement of leadership and teamwork skills.</description>

      <title>Web3 x AI Agents: Landscape, Integrations, and Foundational Challenges</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.02773</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.02773v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The convergence of Web3 technologies and AI agents represents a rapidly evolving frontier poised to reshape decentralized ecosystems. This paper presents the first and most comprehensive analysis of the intersection between Web3 and AI agents, examining five critical dimensions: landscape, economics, governance, security, and trust mechanisms. Through an analysis of 133 existing projects, we first develop a taxonomy and systematically map the current market landscape (RQ1), identifying distinct patterns in project distribution and capitalization. Building upon these findings, we further investigate four key integrations: (1) the role of AI agents in participating in and optimizing decentralized finance (RQ2); (2) their contribution to enhancing Web3 governance mechanisms (RQ3); (3) their capacity to strengthen Web3 security via intelligent vulnerability detection and automated smart contract auditing (RQ4); and (4) the establishment of robust reliability frameworks for AI agent operations leveraging Web3's inherent trust infrastructure (RQ5). By synthesizing these dimensions, we identify key integration patterns, highlight foundational challenges related to scalability, security, and ethics, and outline critical considerations for future research toward building robust, intelligent, and trustworthy decentralized systems with effective AI agent interactions.</description>

      <title>The Theory of Economic Complexity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.18829</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.18829v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Economic complexity methods aim to estimate the combined presence of economic factors without having to explicitly define them. A key method in this literature is the Economic Complexity Index or ECI, an eigenvector derived from specialization matrices that explains variation in economic growth, inequality, and sustainability. Yet, despite the widespread use of ECI in economic development, economic geography, and innovation studies, we still lack a principled theory that can deduce it from a mechanistic model. Here, we calculate $ECI$ analytically for a model where the output of an economy in an activity increases if the economy is more likely to be endowed with the factors required by the activity. We derive ECI analytically and numerically and show that it is a monotonic function of the probability that an economy is endowed with many factors, validating the idea that ECI is an agnostic estimate of the presence of multiple factors in an economy. We then generalize this result to other production functions and to a short-run equilibrium framework with prices, wages, and consumption, finding that the derived wage function is consistent with economies converging to an income that is compatible with their complexity. Finally, we show this model explains differences in the shapes of networks of related activities, such as the product space and the research space. These findings solve long standing puzzles in the literature and validate metrics of economic complexity as estimates of the combined presence of multiple factors.</description>

      <title>Trade Policy and Structural Change</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.01360</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.01360v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We examine how tariffs affect sectoral composition and welfare in an economy with nonhomothetic preferences and sectors being complements -- key drivers of structural change. Beyond their conventional role in trade protection, tariffs influence industrial structure by altering relative prices and income levels. We qualitatively characterize these mechanisms and use a quantitative dynamic model to show that a counterfactual 20-percentage-point increase in U.S. manufacturing tariffs since 2001 would have raised the manufacturing value-added share by one percentage point and increased welfare by 0.36 percent. However, if all the U.S. trading partners responded reciprocally, U.S. welfare would have declined by 0.12 percent.</description>
