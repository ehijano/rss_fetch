      <title>Phone physics and the Gateway Arch: Fun with friends and physics at the AAPT Winter Meeting in St. Louis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.22746</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.22746v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: As a famous landmark and feat of engineering, the Gateway Arch was a popular destination at the 2025 AAPT Winter Meeting in St. Louis. The visit to the observation deck of the Gateway Arch is unique, climbing the steps after exiting the small tram capsules and seeing a floor that continues to slope upward assures that you are in fact at the very top. Everyone in our group excitedly took pictures, pointing out local features like the Dred Scott Courthouse. There were many selfies at the pinnacle, and we discussed how to work them into future questions for our students. During our tram ride to the top observation deck of the arch, we lamented that we should have brought pendula to measure the acceleration due to gravity. You can take physics teachers out of the physics conference, but you apparently can't get us to stop talking about physics teaching. Recognizing that we had accelerometers on our phones we collected data on the descent. The authors wanted to collect more complete measurements and returned two days later to repeat the journey, the results of which we present here. For readers wishing to repeat with their students, or who want to apply more advanced data analysis techniques, the authors have made the raw data, our spreadsheets, and a teacher's guide available.</description>

      <title>Initial Results From the First Field Expedition of UAPx to Study Unidentified Anomalous Phenomena</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.00558</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.00558v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In July 2021, faculty from the UAlbany Department of Physics participated in a week-long field expedition with the organization UAPx to collect data on UAPs in Avalon, California, located on Catalina Island, and nearby. This paper reviews both the hardware and software techniques which this collaboration employed, and contains a frank discussion of the successes and failures, with a section about how to apply lessons learned to future expeditions. Both observable-light and infrared cameras were deployed, as well as sensors for other (non-EM) emissions. A pixel-subtraction method was augmented with other similarly simple methods to provide initial identification of objects in the sky and/or the sea crossing the cameras' fields of view. The first results will be presented based upon approximately one hour in total of triggered visible/night-vision-mode video and over 600 hours of un-triggered (far) IR video recorded, as well as 55 hours of (background) radiation measurements. Following multiple explanatory resolutions of several ambiguities that were potentially anomalous at first, we focus on the primary remaining ambiguity captured at approximately 4am Pacific Time on Friday, July 16: a dark spot in the visible/near-IR camera possibly coincident with ionizing radiation that has so far resisted prosaic explanation. We conclude with quantitative suggestions (3-5 sigma rules) for serious researchers in the still-maligned field of hard-science-based UAP studies, with an ultimate goal of identifying UAPs without confirmation bias toward mundane / speculative conclusions.</description>
