      <title>Stability Analysis of Gr\"unwald Interpolation Operators on Chebyshev Nodes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.16927</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.16927v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In 1941, G. Gr\"unwald proved the convergence of a sequence of operators constructed using classical Lagrange interpolation at Chebyshev nodes. In this work, we establish a perturbed version of Gr\"unwald's result, thereby extending the class of admissible nodal points. Specifically, we provide sufficient conditions for convergence when the interpolation nodes are of the form {cos eta_k} for k = 1, ..., n, where {eta_k} is a general sequence. We refer to these operators as Gr\"unwald operators. In particular, we prove a convergence result when {eta_k} is equidistant and uniformly distributed. We establish a Voronovskaja-type estimate for the convergence of these operators and derive quantitative results involving the first and second moduli of smoothness.</description>

      <title>Mercer's Theorem for Vector-Valued Reproducing Kernel Hilbert Spaces in Kaplansky-Hilbert Modules over $L_{\infty}(\Omega)$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.16981</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.16981v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The study presents a vector-valued extension of the classical Mercer theorem within the framework of reproducing kernel Hilbert spaces defined over Kaplansky-Hilbert modules associated with the algebra of essentially bounded measurable functions. The analysis focuses on a partial integral operator with a positive definite kernel depending on a measurable parameter, and establishes the equivalence of three fundamental properties: the completeness of the system of eigenfunctions in the corresponding vector-valued space, the injectivity of the adjoint embedding operator, and the existence of a pointwise spectral decomposition of the kernel in terms of the eigenvalues and eigenfunctions of a parameterized family of operators. The proof relies on constructing an isometric isomorphism between the Kaplansky-Hilbert module and the space of measurable sections of a Hilbert bundle, thereby reducing the problem to the application of the classical Mercer theorem on each fiber of the bundle. Furthermore, a formalism of vector-valued lifting is developed to guarantee the coherence of inner product structures between the original module and its bundle representation.</description>

      <title>Restriction Theorem and Strichartz estimate for orthonormal functions associated with the Special Hermite Operator</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.17230</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.17230v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $\mathcal{L}$ be the special Hermite operator on $\mathbb{C}^n$. As a continuation of the recent results in \cite{SG}, we establish new Strichartz estimates for systems of orthonormal functions associated with general flows of the form $e^{-it\phi(\mathcal{L})}$, where $ \phi : \mathbb{R}^{+} \to \mathbb{R} $ is a smooth function. Our approach relies on restriction estimates for the Fourier-special Hermite transform on the class of surfaces $\{(\lambda, \mu, \nu)\in \mathbb{R}\times\mathbb{N}_0^n\times\mathbb{N}_0^n : \lambda=\phi(2|\nu|+n)\}$. We also discuss the endpoint case of the orthonormal Strichartz estimate for the Schr\"{o}dinger propagator $e^{-it\mathcal{L}}$. Furthermore, we generalize restriction estimates for the special Hermite spectral projections in the context of trace ideals (Schatten spaces).</description>

      <title>Sampling on infinite-dimensional Paley-Wiener spaces on graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.17343</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.17343v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We prove a sampling theorem for infinite-dimensional Paley-Wiener spaces on graphs which allows for stable frame reconstruction. We prove that all sampling sets for a fixed Paley-Wiener space are complements of lambda-sets (i.e. sets where a Poincar\'e-type inequality holds), thereby providing a sufficient condition for stable sampling and reconstruction on graphs such as $\mathbb{Z}^n$-lattices and radial trees with finite geometry.</description>

      <title>Abstract fractional linear transformations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.17383</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.17383v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We begin with (densely-defined) fractional linear transformations (FLT) on (some) Banach algebras and their relatives. This leads to Wedderburn's continued fractions (recursively-defined noncommutative polynomials) for any ring. Along the way, we discover a one-parameter family of (noncommutative) polynomials \st if one of them is invertible, then read in the opposite order, the corresponding polynomial is also invertible (extending the well known $1+ab$ is invertible if $1+ ba$ is, and the not-so-well-known, $a + abc + c$ and $a + cba + c$).
  This in turn leads to a definition of FLT for general rings $R$, which turns out to be PE$(2,R)$ (the projective elementary group). Using Wedderburn's polynomials, this permits us to define a length function on PE$(2,R)$, which suggests a stable range type condition (for $n =1$, it {\it is\/} stable range one, but higher values do not correspond.
  Again using the length results, we prove the expected results for PE$(2,R)$: under very modest conditions on $R$, the commutator subgroup of PE$(2,R)$ is perfect and of index one or two.
  Along the same lines, we also prove results on simplicity of the commutator subgroup: we require the usual generative properties on the simple ring $R$, as well either the very restrictive $1$ in the range, or a mild condition about invertibles, involving intersections of three translates of GL$(1,R)$. This last property is explored in the appendices, which give examples (and non-examples).
  Numerous questions suggest themselves throughout.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2511.17035v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Infinite-dimensional differential algebraic equations (short DAEs) with input and output are studied. The concepts of operator nodes and system nodes are extended to systems which additionally may include algebraic constraints. Extrapolation spaces are investigated for differential-algebraic equations, and solutions of the extrapolated DAE are characterized using augmented Wong sequences. The resulting theory is then applied to characterize infinite-dimensional port-Hamiltonian DAEs.</description>

      <title>On gap properties for the linearized 1D Dirac--Soler model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.17451</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.17451v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study spectral properties of the Dirac operator $L_0$ arising as the upper-right off-diagonal block in the linearization around standing wave solutions of the one-dimensional Soler model with power nonlinearity $f(s)=s|s|^{p-1}$, $p&gt;0$. Our main results concern the so-called gap property: we show that if $p \geq 1$, then the only eigenvalues of $L_0$ are its ground state energies, $-2\omega$ and $0$. In contrast, for $p&lt;1$, additional eigenvalues appear from the thresholds of the essential spectrum. Furthermore, we prove that the thresholds never admit eigenvalues and that they have at most one resonance.</description>

      <title>Factorizations for variable exponent Muckenhoupt weights</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.23300</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.23300v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Given two variable exponent Muckenhoupt weights $w\in A_{p(\cdot)}$ and $w_1\in A_{p_1(\cdot)}$, we prove that for all small enough $\theta&gt;0,$ there holds that $w_0\in A_{p_0(\cdot)},$ where the weight is determined by $w = w_0^{1-\theta}w_1^{\theta}$ and exponent of the weight class by $1/p(\cdot) = (1-\theta)/p_0(\cdot) + \theta/p_1(\cdot).$ The proof is based on a recent reverse H\"older's inequality for variable exponent Muckenhoupt weights by Cruz-Uribe and Penrod. We upgrade these factorizations to the restricted range context by using a recent transformation formula due to Nieraeth. Then, following an extrapolation of compactness scheme by Hyt\"onen and Lappas, we provide an alternative proof of the recent extrapolation of compactness results of Lorist and Nieraeth in the context of weighted variable exponent Lebesgue spaces.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2508.19975v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Bounded composition operators in Paley-Wiener spaces have simple forms, and they are just operators composed through affine mappings of the complex plane. The purpose of this article is to explore some notions about bounded operators and linear dynamics and provide complete answers for composition operators in Paley-Wiener spaces concerning compactness, spectrum, spectral radius, Li-Yorke chaos, positive expansivity, positive shadowing property, and absolute Ces\`aro boundedness.</description>

      <title>Lie structures of the group of Sheffer operators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.14898</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.14898v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Let $\Phi$ be an (LB)-space over $\mathbb F=\mathbb R$ or $\mathbb C$, and let $\Phi'$ be the dual space of~$\Phi$. We study the set $\mathbb S(\Phi)$ of Sheffer operators acting in polynomials on $\Phi'$. We prove that $\mathbb S(\Phi)$ is a group for the usual product of operators. We equip $\mathbb S(\Phi)$ with a natural topology which makes $\mathbb S(\Phi)$ into an infinite-dimensional manifold with a global parametrization. We show that $\mathbb S(\Phi)$ is an infinite-dimensional, regular Lie group, and provide an explicit description of the Lie algebra of $\mathbb S(\Phi)$, including an explicit form of the Lie bracket on it. Our main results are new even in the one-dimensional case, $\Phi=\mathbb{F}$. Furthermore, our results lead to improved understanding of the Lie algebra of the Riordan group, cf.\ Cheon, Luz\'on, Mor\'on, Prieto-Martinez, {\it Adv. Math.} 319 (2017) 522--566.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2308.04859v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We characterize the restrictions of B\'ekoll\'e--Bonami weights of bounded hyperbolic oscillation, to subsets of the unit disc, thus proving an analogue of Wolff's restriction theorem for Muckenhoupt weights. Sundberg proved a discrete version of Wolff's original theorem, by characterizing the trace of $BMO$-functions onto interpolating sequences. We consider an analogous question in our setting, by studying the trace of Bloch functions. Through Makarov's probabilistic approach to the Bloch space, our question can be recast as a restriction problem for dyadic martingales with uniformly bounded increments.</description>

      <title>Contraction of Markovian Operators in Orlicz Spaces and Error Bounds for Markov Chain Monte Carlo</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.11200</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.11200v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We introduce a novel concept of convergence for Markovian processes within Orlicz spaces, extending beyond the conventional approach associated with $L_p$ spaces. After showing that Markovian operators are contractive in Orlicz spaces, our key technical contribution is an upper bound on their contraction coefficient, which admits a closed-form expression. The bound is tight in some settings, and it recovers well-known results, such as the connection between contraction and ergodicity, ultra-mixing and Doeblin's minorisation. Specialising our approach to $L_p$ spaces leads to a significant improvement upon classical Riesz-Thorin's interpolation methods.
  Furthermore, by exploiting the flexibility offered by Orlicz spaces, we can tackle settings where the stationary distribution is heavy-tailed, a severely under-studied setup. The technical tools introduced lend themselves to providing novel bounds on the contraction coefficient (SDPI constant) of information-theoretic divergences. We thus provide a variety of examples in which we show an improvement over the state of the art. As an application of the framework put forward in the paper, we introduce tighter bounds on the mixing time of Markovian processes, better exponential concentration bounds for MCMC methods, and better lower bounds on the burn-in period. To conclude, we show how our results can be used to prove the concentration of measure phenomenon for a sequence of Markovian random variables.</description>

      <title>Commutativity of operator algebras</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.17673</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.17673v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We call an operator algebra A {\em reversible} if A with reversed multiplication is also an abstract operator algebra (in the modern operator space sense). This class of operator algebras is intimately related to the {\em symmetric operator algebras}: the subalgebras of B(H) on which the transpose map is a complete isometry. In previous work we studied the unital case, where reversibility is equivalent to commutativity. We give many sufficient conditions under which a nonunital reversible or symmetric operator algebra is commutative. We also give many complementary results of independent interest, and solve a few open questions from previous papers. Not every reversible or symmetric operator algebra is commutative, however we show that they all are 3-commutative. That is, order does not matter in the product of three or more elements from A. The proof of this relies on a technical analysis involving the injective envelope. Indeed nonunital algebras are often enormously more complicated than unital ones in regard to the topics we consider. On the positive side, our considerations raise very many questions even for low dimensional matrix algebras, some of which are of a computational nature and might be suitable for undergraduate research. The canonical anticommutation relations from mathematical physics play a significant role.</description>

Abstract: We study the behavior of a probability measure near the bottom of its support in terms of time averaged quotients of its Laplace transform. We discuss how our results are connected to both rank-one perturbation theory as well as renewal theory. We further apply our results in order to derive criteria for the existence and non-existence of ground states for a finite dimensional quantum system coupled to a bosonic field.</description>
