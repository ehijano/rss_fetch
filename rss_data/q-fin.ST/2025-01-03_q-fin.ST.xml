      <title>Time Series Feature Redundancy Paradox: An Empirical Study Based on Mortgage Default Prediction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.00034</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.00034v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: With the widespread application of machine learning in financial risk management, conventional wisdom suggests that longer training periods and more feature variables contribute to improved model performance. This paper, focusing on mortgage default prediction, empirically discovers a phenomenon that contradicts traditional knowledge: in time series prediction, increased training data timespan and additional non-critical features actually lead to significant deterioration in prediction effectiveness. Using Fannie Mae's mortgage data, the study compares predictive performance across different time window lengths (2012-2022) and feature combinations, revealing that shorter time windows (such as single-year periods) paired with carefully selected key features yield superior prediction results. The experimental results indicate that extended time spans may introduce noise from historical data and outdated market patterns, while excessive non-critical features interfere with the model's learning of core default factors. This research not only challenges the traditional "more is better" approach in data modeling but also provides new insights and practical guidance for feature selection and time window optimization in financial risk prediction.</description>

      <title>Minimal Batch Adaptive Learning Policy Engine for Real-Time Mid-Price Forecasting in High-Frequency Trading</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.19372</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.19372v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: High-frequency trading (HFT) has transformed modern financial markets, making reliable short-term price forecasting models essential. In this study, we present a novel approach to mid-price forecasting using Level 1 limit order book (LOB) data from NASDAQ, focusing on 100 U.S. stocks from the S&amp;P 500 index during the period from September to November 2022. Expanding on our previous work with Radial Basis Function Neural Networks (RBFNN), which leveraged automated feature importance techniques based on mean decrease impurity (MDI) and gradient descent (GD), we introduce the Adaptive Learning Policy Engine (ALPE) - a reinforcement learning (RL)-based agent designed for batch-free, immediate mid-price forecasting. ALPE incorporates adaptive epsilon decay to dynamically balance exploration and exploitation, outperforming a diverse range of highly effective machine learning (ML) and deep learning (DL) models in forecasting performance.</description>
