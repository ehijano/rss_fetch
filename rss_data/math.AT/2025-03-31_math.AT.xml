      <title>Measurable bounded cohomology of $t$-discrete measured groupoids via resolutions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.22350</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.22350v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We define bounded cohomology of $t$-discrete measured groupoids with coefficients into measurable bundles of Banach spaces. Our approach via homological algebra extends the classic theory developed by Ivanov and by Monod. As a consequence, we show that the bounded cohomology of a $t$-discrete groupoid $\mathcal{G}$ can be computed using any amenable $\mathcal{G}$-space. In particular, we can compute bounded cohomology using strong boundaries.</description>

      <title>The Serre spectral sequence in bounded cohomology</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.22505</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.22505v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We construct the analogue of the Serre spectral sequence for the bounded cohomology of simplicial sets with seminormed local coefficients. As applications, we obtain a (non-isometric) generalization of Gromov's mapping theorem and some partial results on the simplicial volume of manifold bundles.</description>

      <title>Persistent homology of Morse decomposition in Markov chains based on combinatorial multivector fields</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.22308</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.22308v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we introduce a novel persistence framework for Morse decompositions in Markov chains using combinatorial multivector fields. Our approach provides a structured method to analyze recurrence and stability in finite-state stochastic processes. In our setting filtrations are governed by transition probabilities rather than spatial distances. We construct multivector fields directly from Markov transition matrices, treating states and transitions as elements of a directed graph. By applying Morse decomposition to the induced multivector field, we obtain a hierarchical structure of invariant sets that evolve under changes in transition probabilities. This structure naturally defines a persistence diagram, where each Morse set is indexed by its topological and dynamical complexity via homology and Conley index dimensions.</description>

      <title>A universal characteristic class for vector bundles with a connection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.22314</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.22314v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In the paper I introduce a new characteristic class $c(E)$ for a finite rank vector bundle $E$ on an affine scheme $S:=Spec(A)$ - the fundamental class of $E$. The class $c(E)$ is not a characteristic class in the classical sense in the sense that it lives in a ponted cohomology torsor $\operatorname{Ext}^1(L, \operatorname{End}_A(E))$. Most characteristic classes lives in a cohomology group. The pointed cohomology torsor $\operatorname{Ext}^1(L, \operatorname{End}_A(E))$ is a torsor on the abelian group $\operatorname{H}^2(L, Z(\operatorname{End}_A(E)))$ where $Z(\operatorname{End}_A(E))$ is the center of the ring of endomorphisms of $E$ and where the cohomology is the Lie-Rinehart cohomology of the center. The class $c(E)$ is trivial if and only if $E$ has a flat algebraic connection. Hence the class $c(T_S)$ where $T_S$ is the tangent bundle, is an an obstruction for $S$ to be algebraically parallelizable. I use a connection $\nabla$ to define $c(E)$ and I also prove the class $c(E)$ is independent of choice of connection, hence $c(E)$ is an invariant of the vector bundle $E$. The class generalize the Chern class, the Pontryagin class, the Euler class and the Teleman characteristic class. I prove using an explicit example that the class $c(E)$ is stronger than the Chern class and the Euler class. I also give a new proof of a formula for the curvature of a connection $\nabla$ in terms of an idempotent endomorphism $\phi$ defining $E$. This formula was claimed and proved in a paper put out on the arXiv in 2011, and in this paper I give a new proof that is easier to read. The class may be interesting in the study of the "cancellation problem" in affine algebraic geometry and the problem of giving algebraic formulas for the topological Euler characteristic. I also calculate the algebraic deRham cohomology of the complex two sphere and prove it is infinite dimensional.</description>

      <title>Non vanishing of the fourth bounded cohomology of free groups and codimension 2 subspaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.22511</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.22511v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this note we prove that the fouth bounded cohomology of non-abelian free
  groups with trivial real coefficients is non-zero. In order to prove this, we
  establish a splitting argument whose simplest form is as follows: Let
  $M$ denote an $n$-manifold of non-zero simplicial volume and
  $S$ a codimension two submanifold of $M$, then one can
  conclude that the $n$-th bounded cohomology of the fundamental group of
  $M \setminus S$ is non-zero.
  While in this note this approach is only used for degree $4$. There is no
  reason to expect that this approach and its generalizations is not suitable
  to prove the non-vanishing of higher degrees or the bounded cohomology of
  different groups as well.</description>

      <title>Adversarially Robust Topological Inference</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2206.01795</link>
      <description>arXiv:2206.01795v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The distance function to a compact set plays a crucial role in the paradigm of topological data analysis. In particular, the sublevel sets of the distance function are used in the computation of persistent homology -- a backbone of the topological data analysis pipeline. Despite its stability to perturbations in the Hausdorff distance, persistent homology is highly sensitive to outliers. In this work, we develop a framework of statistical inference for persistent homology in the presence of outliers. Drawing inspiration from recent developments in robust statistics, we propose a \textit{median-of-means} variant of the distance function (\textsf{MoM Dist}) and establish its statistical properties. In particular, we show that, even in the presence of outliers, the sublevel filtrations and weighted filtrations induced by \textsf{MoM Dist} are both consistent estimators of the true underlying population counterpart and exhibit near minimax-optimal performance in adversarial settings. Finally, we demonstrate the advantages of the proposed methodology through simulations and applications.</description>

      <title>$E$-theory is compactly assembled</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.18228</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.18228v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We show that the equivariant $E$-theory category $\mathrm{E}_{\mathrm{sep}}^{G}$ for separable $C^{*}$-algebras is a compactly assembled stable $\infty$-category. We derive this result as a consequence of the shape theory for $C^{*}$-algebras developed by Blackadar and Dardarlat and a new construction of $\mathrm{E}_{\mathrm{sep}}^{G}$. As an application we investigate a topological enrichment of the homotopy category of a compactly assembled $\infty$-category in general and argue that the results of Carri\'on and Schafhauser on the enrichment of the classical $E$-theory category can be derived by specialization.</description>

      <title>Deformations and Lifts of Calabi-Yau Varieties in Characteristic $p$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.09256</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.09256v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study deformations of Calabi-Yau varieties in characteristic $p$ using techniques from derived algebraic geometry. We prove a mixed characteristic analogue of the Bogomolov-Tian-Todorov theorem (which states that Calabi-Yau varieties in characteristic $0$ are unobstructed), and we show that ordinary Calabi-Yau varieties admit canonical lifts to characteristic $0$, generalising the Serre-Tate theorem on ordinary abelian varieties.</description>
