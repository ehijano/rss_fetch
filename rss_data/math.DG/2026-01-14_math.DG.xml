      <title>Three Bernstein type theorems for hypersurfaces with zero Gaussian curvature</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.08124</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.08124v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we prove Bernstein type theorems for entire convex graphical hypersurfaces with zero Gaussian curvature in both Euclidean and Minkowski context. A supplementary example illustrates that zero Gaussian convex spacelike hypersurfaces are not necessary hyperplanes without additional conditions. We show that a zero Gaussian curvature convex hypersurface must be a hyperplane if the mean curvature goes to zero at infinity. In the Minkowski context, we prove similar results for hypersurface without timelike points.</description>

      <title>A Dynamical Framework for the McKay Correspondence via Gauge-Theoretic Morse Flow</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.08195</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.08195v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The McKay correspondence establishes a bijection between the cohomology of a minimal resolution and the irreducible representations of a finite subgroup $\Gamma \subset \text{SU}(2)$. While traditional proofs rely on static algebraic isomorphisms, we propose a dynamical framework grounded in gauge theory and Morse-Bott theory. We analyze an $S^1$-invariant Morse-Bott function on the minimal resolution, interpreting its gradient flow lines as $1$-parameter families of holonomy representations of flat connections from $\Gamma$ to $GL(R)$. We conjecture that the flow emanating from a critical submanifold converges asymptotically at the boundary to a specific irreducible representation of $\Gamma$. This dynamical process explicitly constructs the identification between the cohomology basis and the irreducible representations of $\Gamma$ prescribed by the McKay correspondence. We prove this conjecture for cyclic cases.</description>

      <title>On the Lambert conformal conical projection and the general map of the Russian Empire</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.08377</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.08377v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The problem of drawing geographical maps is the one of mapping a subset of the sphere, representing a country or some other region on the surface of the Earth, into the Euclidean plane, minimising certain distortion properties that are specified in advance. It is known that from the purely mathematical point of view, this is an extremely difficult problem. One of Leonhard Euler's duties during his first stay at the Imperial Academy of Sciences of Saint Petersburg (1727-1741) was to help establishing maps of the Russian Empire. He worked on this project under the direction of the famous French geographer Joseph-Nicolas Delisle, who was the head of the astronomy and geography departments of the Academy. The general map of the Russian Empire, together with several maps of its particular regions were published under Euler's direction in the so-called Russian Atlas in 1745. In his later memoir ``De proiectione geographica De Lisliana in mappa generali imperii russici usitata'', written in 1777, Euler developed the mathematical theory of the method used by Delisle on a heuristic basis, which he himself used for drawing the general map of the Russian Empire. This method usually carries now the name Delisle--Euler map. In a previous paper, the first two authors of the present paper compared the Delisle--Euler map with several other maps of the conical type, with respect to various mathematical distorsion properties. They showed that this map is the best one from all the points of view considered, when it is applied to the drawing of the Russian Empire. In the present paper, we compare the Euler--Delisle map with a map which was not considered in the paper mentioned, namely, the so-called Lambert conformal conical projection, applied to the same region of the Earth. We show that the latter is better in several respects than all the other maps considered in the previous paper, including the Delisle--Euler map.</description>

      <title>On Globalization Problem of Multi-Hamiltonian Formalisms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.08576</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.08576v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The globalization problem arises when local tensor fields possess a given property (such as being symplectic or Poisson) but cannot be consistently extended to a global object due to incompatibilities on chart overlaps. A notable instance occurs in locally conformal analysis, where local representatives coincide only up to conformal factors. The locally conformal approach not only enables the definition of novel and rich geometric structures but also provides Hamiltonian formulations for irreversible systems, yielding physically meaningful dynamical consequences. While extensively studied for symplectic, cosymplectic, and Poisson geometries, its systematic extension to multi-Hamiltonian settings remains largely unexplored.
  In this work, we investigate locally conformally Nambu--Poisson and locally conformally generalized Poisson manifolds, showing that these structures naturally induce Nambu--Jacobi and generalized Jacobi manifolds, respectively. From a dynamical point of view, we construct Hamiltonian-type evolution equations, and for locally conformal $3$-Nambu structures, we introduce locally conformal bi-Hamiltonian systems. The resulting dynamics are particularly suitable for modeling irreversible multi-Hamiltonian processes, as they generally do not preserve the system's energy.
  Collectively, this work provides a unified framework for understanding both the geometric structures and Hamiltonian dynamics of classical, Nambu--Poisson, and generalized Poisson manifolds within a locally conformal context.</description>

      <title>Half-space theorems for translating solitons of the r-mean curvature flow</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.08661</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.08661v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we establish nonexistence results for complete translating solitons of the r-mean curvature flow under suitable growth conditions on the (r-1)-mean curvature and on the norm of the second fundamental form. We first show that such solitons cannot be entirely contained in the complement of a right rotational cone whose axis of symmetry is aligned with the translation direction. We then relax the growth condition on the (r-1)-mean curvature and prove that properly immersed translating solitons cannot be confined to certain half-spaces opposite to the translation direction. We conclude the paper by showing that complete, properly immersed translating solitons satisfying appropriate growth conditions on the (r-1)-mean curvature cannot lie completely within the intersection of two transversal vertical half-spaces.</description>

      <title>Price Inequality and the Growth of Harmonic Functions on Non-Positively Curved Manifolds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.08804</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.08804v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We obtain effective estimates for the growth rate of the $L^2$-energy of harmonic functions on geodesic balls in complete simply connected non-positively curved Riemannian manifolds with pinched sectional curvature. Our study relies upon a double-sided Price inequality for harmonic functions. Finally, we apply this circle of ideas to study the analytical structure of a potential counterexample to the Singer conjecture in degree one.</description>

      <title>The Minimal Polynomial of a Riemannian C_0-Space</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.08827</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.08827v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We construct, at every point of a Riemannian C_0-space, a polynomial in one variable whose coefficients are polynomial functions on the tangent space. For a homogeneous Riemannian C_0-space (for instance, a G.O. space) these pointwise-defined polynomials glue to a global polynomial whose coefficients are Killing tensors invariant under the full isometry group. Moreover, the degree of this polynomial provides an upper bound for the Singer invariant of the space.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2601.07996v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper provides an introduction to non-abelian Hodge theory and moduli spaces of Higgs bundles on compact Riemann surfaces. We develop the moduli theory of vector bundles and Higgs bundles, establish the main correspondences of non-abelian Hodge theory, and interpret them through the hyperk\"ahler structure on the Hitchin moduli space. We study the Hitchin fibration and its geometric properties, including SYZ mirror symmetry and topological mirror symmetry for type $\mathsf{A}$ Hitchin systems. As an illustration, we compute the Poincar\'e polynomial of the rank 2 moduli space and verify topological mirror symmetry in this case.</description>

Abstract: In this article, we prove the orbifold version of the Bogomolov-Gieseker inequality for stable $\mathbb Q$-sheaves on K\"ahler varieties, generalizing our earlier work \cite{GP25} in dimension three. We also provide a characterization of the equality case, a new purely analytical proof of the numerical characterization of complex torus quotients as well as a novel, complex analytic interpretation of the second orbifold Chern class associated to a $\mathbb Q$-sheaf.</description>

      <title>The symplectic groupoid for Adler-Gelfand-Dikii Poisson structure</title>

      <description>arXiv:2601.08632v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Adler-Gelfand-Dikii Poisson structure arises naturally in the study of $n$-th order differential operators on the circle and plays a central role in Poisson geometry and integrable systems. Let $G$ be one of the Lie groups $\mathrm{PSL}(n)$, $\mathrm{PSp}(n)$ (for even $n$), or $\mathrm{PSO}(n)$ (for odd $n$). In this paper, we construct the symplectic groupoid integrating the Adler-Gelfand-Dikii Poisson structure associated to $G$ and prove that it is Morita equivalent to the quasi-symplectic groupoid integrating the Dirac structure on $Y_n(\mathbf{C})$, where $Y_n(\mathbf{C})$ denotes the quotient of the space of quasi-periodic non-degenerate curves by homotopies preserving the monodromy.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2601.08656v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We construct a class of Riemannian metrics in closed surfaces of genus greater than one, having Anosov geodesic flows, and some regions of positive curvature, such that for each such surface, there exists a smooth curve of conformal deformations that preserves the Anosov property and connects the surface with a Riemannian metric of negative curvature. The conformal deformation does not arise from geometric flows like the Ricci flow, since it is known that such flows might generate conjugate points in the presence of points of positive curvature in the surface.</description>

      <title>Biharmonic Maps Between Conformally Compact Manifolds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.13580</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.13580v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study biharmonic maps between conformally compact manifolds, a large class of complete manifolds with bounded geometry, asymptotically negative curvature, and smooth compactification. These metrics provide a far-reaching generalization of hyperbolic space. We work on the class of simple $b$-maps, i.e. maps which send interior to interior, boundary to boundary, and are transversal to the boundary of the target manifold. The main result of this paper is a non-existence result: if a simple $b$-map $u:\left(M,g\right)\to\left(N,h\right)$ between conformally compact manifolds is biharmonic, its restriction to the boundary is non-constant, and moreover $\left(N,h\right)$ is non-positively curved, then $u$ is harmonic. We do not assume any integrability condition on $u$: in particular, $u$ is not required to have finite energy, nor is its tension field required to be in $L^{p}$ for any $p$. Our result implies the following version of the Generalized Chen's Conjecture: if $\left(N,h\right)$ is a non-positively curved conformally compact manifold, and $\Sigma\hookrightarrow N$ is a properly embedded submanifold with boundary meeting $\partial N$ transversely, then $\Sigma$ is biharmonic if and only if it is minimal.</description>

      <title>Distributional sectional curvature bounds for Riemannian metrics of low regularity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.17337</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.17337v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Sectional curvature bounds are of central importance in the study of Riemannian mani\-folds, both in smooth differential geometry and in the generalized synthetic setting of Alexandrov spaces. Riemannian metrics along with metric spaces of bounded sectional curvature enjoy a variety of, oftentimes rigid, geometric properties. The purpose of this article is to introduce and discuss a new notion of sectional curvature bounds for manifolds equipped with continuous Riemannian metrics of Geroch--Traschen regularity, i.e., $H^1_{\mathrm{loc}} \cap C^0$, based on a distributional version of the classical formula. Our main result states that for $g \in C^1$, this new notion recovers the corresponding bound based on triangle comparison in the sense of Alexandrov. A weaker version of this statement is also proven for locally Lipschitz continuous metrics.</description>

Abstract: In this paper we investigate the existence of metrics with weighted constant scalar curvature (wcscK for short) on a compact K\"ahler manifold $X$: this notion include constant scalar curvature K\"ahler metrics, weighted solitons, Calabi's extremal K\"ahler metrics and extremal metric on semisimple principal fibrations. We prove that the coercivity of the weighted Mabuchi functional implies the existence of a wcscK metric, thereby achieving the equivalence. \\ We then give several applications in K\"ahler and toric geometry, such as a weighted version of the toric Yau-Tian-Donaldson correspondence, and the characterization of the existence of wcscK metric on total space of semisimple principal fibration $Y$ in term of existence of wcscK metric on its fiber $X$.</description>

      <title>Lorentzian Cheeger-Gromov convergence and temporal functions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.15441</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.15441v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Uniqueness (up to isometries) and existence of limits are studied in the context of Cheeger-Gromov convergence of spacetimes. To address the non-compactness of the vector isometry group in the semi-Riemannian setting, standard pointed convergence is strengthened to anchored convergence, which in the Lorentzian case requires the convergence of a timelike direction. This allows one to construct a local isometry between neighborhoods of the basepoints, which can be extended globally under geodesic completeness or just inextensibility. In spacetimes, by using Cauchy temporal functions as both strengthening of anchors and tools to ``Wick rotate'' metrics, a special notion of convergence for globally hyperbolic spacetimes (including those with timelike boundaries) is introduced. After revisiting the tools related to time functions and studying their connections with Sormani-Vega null distance, the machinery of Riemannian Cheeger-Gromov theory becomes applicable. In particular, several results of independent interest are obtained, including local regularity of time functions up to rescaling, global and local characterizations of $h$-steep functions, independence of steepness and $h$-steepness for temporal functions, compatibility of both conditions for Cauchy temporal functions, and stability of the latter.</description>

      <title>Timelike conjugate points in Lorentzian length spaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.12855</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.12855v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study notions of conjugate points along timelike geodesics in the synthetic setting of Lorentzian (pre-)length spaces, inspired by earlier work for metric spaces by Shankar--Sormani. After preliminary considerations on convergence of timelike and causal geodesics, we introduce and compare one-sided, symmetric, unreachable and ultimate conjugate points along timelike geodesics. We show that all such notions are compatible with the usual one in the smooth (strongly causal) spacetime setting. As applications, we prove a timelike Rauch comparison theorem, as well as a result closely related to the recently established Lorentzian Cartan--Hadamard theorem by Er\"{o}s--Gieger. In the appendix, we give a detailed treatment of the Fr\'{e}chet distance on the space of non-stopping curves up to reparametrization, a technical tool used throughout the paper.</description>

      <title>The $L_p$ dual Minkowski problem for capillary hypersurfaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.12804</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.12804v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we consider the $L_p$ dual Minkowski problem for capillary hypersurfaces for $p&gt;q$ and $q\leq 1$, which aims to find a capillary convex body with a prescribed capillary $(p,q)$-th dual curvature measure in the Euclidean half-space. We reduce it to a Monge-Amp\`ere type equation with a Robin boundary condition on the unit spherical cap, we prove that there exists a unique smooth solution that solves this problem provided $\theta\in (0,\frac{\pi}{2})$.</description>

      <title>Minimal Lagrangian surfaces in the two dimensional complex quadric via the loop group method</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.15326</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.15326v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We develop a loop group (DPW-type) representation for minimal Lagrangian surfaces in the complex quadric $Q_{2}\cong \mathbb S^{2}\times \mathbb S^{2}$, formulated via a flat family of connections $\{\nabla^\lambda\}_{\lambda\in \mathbb S^{1}}$ on a trivial bundle. We prove that minimality is equivalent to the flatness of $\nabla^\lambda$ for all $\lambda$, describe the associated isometric $\mathbb S^{1}$-family, and establish a precise correspondence with minimal surfaces in $\mathbb S^{3}$ through their Gauss maps. Our framework unifies and streamlines earlier constructions (e.g., Castro--Urbano) and yields explicit families including $\mathbb R$-equivariant, radially symmetric, and trinoid-type examples.</description>

      <title>Asymptotics of high-codimensional area-minimizing currents in hyperbolic space</title>

      <description>arXiv:2601.04027v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate the asymptotic behavior of high-codimensional area-minimizing locally rectifiable currents in hyperbolic space, addressing a problem posed by F.H. Lin and establishing ``boundary regularity at infinity" results for such currents near their asymptotic boundaries under the standard Euclidean metric. Intrinsic obstructions to high-order regularity arise for odd-dimensional minimal surfaces, revealing a constraint dependent on the geometry of the asymptotic boundary. Our work advances the asymptotic theory of high-codimensional minimal surfaces in hyperbolic space.</description>

      <title>An alternative solvability criterion for the Dirichlet problem for the minimal surface equation and an application to the mean curvature flow</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.09806</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.09806v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We propose an alternative condition for the solvability of the Dirichlet problem for the minimal surface equation that applies to non-mean convex domains. This condition is derived from a second-order ordinary differential equation whose solution produces a barrier that appears to be novel in the context of barrier constructions. It admits an explicit formulation and, in the setting of Hadamard manifolds, reveals a direct and transparent relationship between the geometry of the domain and the behavior of the boundary data required for solvability.The condition also extends naturally to unbounded domains.
  In the Euclidean case, it is not only more practical to verify but also less restrictive than the classical Jenkins-Serrin criterion, ensuring the existence of solutions in situations where that approach fails. Furthermore, unlike the Jenkins-Serrin condition, our approach separates the domain's geometric properties from its boundary data, providing a clearer and more manageable framework for solvability analysis.
  Beyond the stationary theory, the same ODE-generated barrier also yields natural sub- and supersolutions for the mean curvature flow of graphs, allowing one to initiate and control the short-time evolution from non-mean convex boundaries. As a consequence, our barrier construction extends a classical result of Ecker-Huisken on short-time existence of graphical mean curvature flow to domains with non-mean convex boundary; in the mean convex setting, their original result is recovered.</description>
