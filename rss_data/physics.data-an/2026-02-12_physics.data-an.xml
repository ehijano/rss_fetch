      <title>Collective and nonlinear structure of wind power correlations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.10136</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.10136v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We describe the correlation structure of wind power fluctuations in a farm of 80 turbines, sampled over 5 years. We report the presence of universal, collective, and nonlinear correlations, responsible for the excess persistency and intermittency of farm-aggregated power output. A first cross-correlation analysis of turbine production reveals a dynamical scaling transition (\`a la Family-Vicszek) from local decoherence to large-scale turbulence-driven scaling, and responsible for the geographical smoothing effect, previously reported beyond farm scale [M. M. Bandi, Phys. Rev. Lett. 118, 028301 (2017)]. A second bivariate analysis shows the long-range correlation of non-Gaussian features, responsible for their amplification in total farm output. These findings provide a new perspective on wind power variability, highlighting the importance of nonlinear correlations in power production dynamics. By better characterizing these fluctuations, our results can inform strategies for grid management, storage optimization, and wind farm design, ultimately improving the integration of wind energy into modern power systems.</description>

      <title>The search for the gust-wing interaction "textbook"</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.10968</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.10968v2 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We address whether complex physical relations can be investigated through the synergy of automated high-volume experiments and the reduction of large datasets to a concise, representative subset of canonical examples -- a "textbook". To this end, we consider the unsteady aerodynamics of wing-gust interactions, which is characterized by its rich, high-dimensional physics. We take advantage of a purpose-built gust generator to systematically produce over 1,000 distinct random gust events and to measure the unsteady loads induced on a delta wing. We then employ a data summarization procedure to identify representative subsets of increasing size from the large-scale database, which then serve as training data for a machine-learning model of the aerodynamic loads from sparse pressure measurements. An appropriately selected "textbook" of a few events can achieve predictive accuracy comparable to random training sets up to two orders of magnitude larger, capturing the intrinsic diversity of the full-scale data and enhancing modeling efficiency and interpretability. Our methodology evidences the potential of distilling the essential information contained in large amounts of experimental observations.</description>
