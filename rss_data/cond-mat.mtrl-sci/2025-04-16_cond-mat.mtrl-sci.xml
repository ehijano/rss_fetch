      <title>Transmission of low energy electrons through a polyethylene terephthalate 800-nm diameter nanocapillary</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.11479</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.11479v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The transmission of 2-keV electrons through a polyethylene terephthalate (PET) nanocapillary with a diameter of 800 nm and a length of 10 {\mu}m is studied. The transmitted electrons are detected using a microchannel plate (MCP) with a phosphor screen. It is found that the transmission rate for the transmitted electrons at the incident energy can reach up to 10% for an aligned capillary in the beam direction, but drops to less than 1% when the tilt angle exceeds the geometrically allowable angle. The transmitted electrons with the incident energy do not move with changes in the tilt angle, so the incident electrons are not guided in the insulating capillary, which is different from the behavior of positive ions. In the final stage of transmission, the angular distribution of the transmitted electrons within the geometrically allowable angle splits into two peaks along the observation angle perpendicular to the tilt angle. The time evolution of the transmitted complete angular distribution shows that when the beam is turned on, the transmission profile forms a single peak. As the incident charge and time accumulate, the transmission profile begins to stretch in the plane perpendicular to the tilt angle and gradually splits into two peaks. When the tilt angle of the nanocapillary exceeds the geometrically allowable angle, this splitting tends to disappear. Simulation of charge deposition in the capillary directly exposed to the beam indicates the formation of positive charge patches, which are not conducive to guiding, unlike positive ions. Based on the simulation results, we can explain our data and discuss the possible reasons for the splitting of the transmission angular profiles.</description>

      <title>Reconstructions and Dynamics of $\beta$-Lithium Thiophosphate Surfaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.11553</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.11553v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Lithium thiophosphate (LPS) is a promising solid electrolyte for next-generation lithium-ion batteries due to its superior energy storage, high ionic conductivity, and low-flammability components. Despite its potential, the high reactivity of LPS with common contaminants such as atmospheric water, preparation solvents, and electrode materials poses significant challenges for commercialization. The lack of understanding regarding the structure, morphology, and chemical behavior of LPS's surface slows down the search for solutions to these issues. Here, we utilize a machine learning interatomic potential to achieve a fundamental, atomistic understanding of the mechanical and chemical properties of the $\beta$-Li$_3$PS$_4$ surfaces. Employing molecular dynamics simulations, we identify relevant surface complexions formed by surface reconstructions, determine their surface energies and compute the Wulff shape of $\beta$-LPS. The most stable complexions exhibit properties distinctly different from the bulk, including amorphization, increased density, decreased conductivity and large deformation of the structure building blocks. We demonstrate that these surfaces are not static, but undergo significant dynamical activity which is clearly identified by an analysis featuring a time-averaged structural descriptor. Finally, we examine the changes of the electronic structure induced by the surface complexions, which provides us with details on changes in surface reactivity and active sites, underlining the importance to investigate surface complexions under realistic conditions.</description>

      <title>X-ray scattering investigation of hydride surface segregation in epitaxial Nb films</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.11573</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.11573v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Hydride precipitation in niobium-based, superconducting circuits is a damaging side-effect of hydrofluoric acid treatments used to clean and thin the Nb surface oxides and Si oxides. The precipitate microstructure is difficult to probe because of the high hydrogen mobility in the niobium matrix. In particular, destructive techniques used to prepare samples for elemental depth profiling can change the hydride structure. Here, we use X-ray surface scattering to non-destructively probe the depth distribution of precipitates in hydrided, epitaxial, niobium thin films. We find that the niobium hydride is confined within the top ten nm of the surface.</description>

      <title>A statistical understanding of oxygen vacancies in distorted high-entropy oxides</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.11587</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.11587v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: High entropy perovskite oxides (HEPOs) have emerged as a promising family of stable electrode materials for high-temperature water splitting. The concentration of oxygen vacancies in HEPOs significantly influences critical properties, such as the ionic conductivity and thermal expansion coefficient. However, predicting their concentration in HEPOs remains a challenge due to the complex and high-entropic arrangements of metal cations. Here, we employ a combined experimental, computational, and theoretical approach to quantify the oxygen vacancy concentration and understand its dependence on the A-site cation compositions of HEPOs. While we found that the concentration of the A-site 2+ cation influences the oxygen vacancy concentration, as expected, this factor alone is insufficient. Our findings reveal that variations in A-site cation size constitute another crucial factor in affecting the oxygen vacancy concentration. We investigated this dependence through atomistic simulations using a machine-learned universal interatomic potential, demonstrating that the lattice distortions from A-site size variations result in a broadened distribution of oxygen vacancy formation energies. Our theoretical analysis, grounded in statistical thermodynamics, further provides formulations for the enthalpy and entropy of oxygen vacancy formation as functions of variance in oxygen bonding energy. Overall, our experimental, computational, and theoretical findings consistently highlight the significant impact of A-site cation site variations on the oxygen vacancy concentration in perovskites, providing a new approach to adjusting the oxygen vacancy concentrations in these materials.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2504.11591v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We show by acoustic emission analysis that FeAlCrMo complex-concentrated alloy (CCA) exhibits signatures of self-organization of deformation processes during both microplasticity and serrated flow (dynamic strain aging). Due to complex microstructures of CCAs and scarcity of literature data, these novel alloys are a prominent subject of future research efforts.</description>

      <title>Relation of Continuous Chirality Measure to Spin and Orbital Polarization, and Chiroptical Properties in Solids</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.11596</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.11596v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Chirality introduces intriguing topological, electronic, and optical properties to molecules and solids. In this work, we investigate the influence of structural chirality on spin and orbital polarization as well as optical activity through first-principles calculations and continuous chirality measure (CCM). By using chiral selenium (Se) and 2D hybrid perovskites as examples, we demonstrate that chirality continuously modifies spin-orbit splitting and orbital angular momentum (OAM) polarization. We establish a direct relation between chirality transfer across organic-inorganic interfaces and inversion symmetry breaking, which induces Rashba-Dresselhaus spin splitting in hybrid perovskites. Additionally, we examine the effects of chirality on circular dichroism (CD) and the circular photogalvanic effect (CPGE), demonstrating how the continuous tuning of chirality dictates their magnitude and anisotropy. Our findings highlight that applying hydrostatic pressure can effectively tune the CCM, thereby enhancing the chirality-induced effects such as spin selectivity. By integrating CCM with electronic structure calculations, we present a predictive strategy for designing chiral materials with tailored optical and spintronic functionalities.</description>

      <title>Identifying high performance spectrally-stable quantum defects in diamond</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.11598</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.11598v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Point defects in semiconductors are becoming central to quantum technologies. They can be used as spin qubits interfacing with photons, which are fundamental for building quantum networks. Currently, the most prominent quantum defect in diamond is the nitrogen-vacancy (NV) center. However, it suffers from spectral diffusion that negatively impacts optical coherence and is due to the coupling of the emission energy with uncontrolled electric fields. The group IV vacancy complexes on the other hand have shown to be significantly more spectrally-stable as they are centrosymmetric and thus immune to the linear Stark shift. They however suffer from several issues ranging from low operation temperature to low optical efficiency due to dark states and difficulty in stabilizing the right defect charge state. Here we search for alternative to the group IV vacancy complex in diamond by systematically evaluating all possible vacancy complex using high-throughput first-principles computational screening. We identify the defects that combine centrosymmetry, emission in the visible range, as well as favorable and achievable electronic structure promoting higher operation temperature and defect levels well within the band gap. We find Zn$V^{-2}$ to be especially appealing.</description>

      <title>Practical considerations for crystallographic and microstructure mapping with direct electron detector-based electron backscatter diffraction</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.11624v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Compact direct electron detectors are becoming increasingly popular in electron microscopy applications including electron backscatter diffraction, as they offer an opportunity for low cost and accessible microstructural analysis. In this work, we explore how one of these commercial devices based on the Timepix chip can be optimized to obtain high quality data quickly and easily, through careful systematic analysis of a variety of samples, including: semiconductor silicon, commercially pure nickel, a dual phase titanium-molybdenum alloy, and a silicon carbide ceramic matrix composite. Our findings provide strategies for very fast collection of orientation maps, including at low voltage (5-10 keV) and low beam current conditions. Additionally, strategies for collection of very high quality EBSD patterns are demonstrated that have significant potential for advanced EBSD applications (e.g. elastic strain mapping).</description>

      <title>Towards High-Voltage Cathodes for Zinc-Ion Batteries: Discovery Pipeline and Material Design Rules</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.11678</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.11678v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Efficient energy storage systems are crucial to address the intermittency of renewable energy sources. As multivalent batteries, Zn-ion batteries (ZIBs), while inherently low voltage, offer a promising low cost alternative to Li-ion batteries due to viable use of zinc as the anode. However, to maximize the potential impact of ZIBs, rechargable cathodes with improved Zn diffusion are needed. To better understand the chemical and structural factors influencing Zn-ion mobility within battery electrode materials, we employ a high-throughput computational screening approach to systematically evaluate candidate intercalation hosts for ZIB cathodes, expanding the chemical search space on empty intercalation hosts that do not contain Zn. We leverage a high-throughput screening funnel to identify promising cathodes in ZIBs, integrating screening criteria with DFT-based calculations of Zn$^{2+}$ intercalation and diffusion inside the host materials. Using this data, we identify the design principles that favor Zn-ion mobility in candidate cathode materials. Building on previous work on divalent ion cathodes, this study broadens the chemical space for next-generation multivalent energy storage systems.</description>

      <title>Predominant Electronic Order Parameter for Structural Chirality -- Role of Spinless Electronic Toroidal Multipoles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.11682</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.11682v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We discuss predominant order parameters for structural chirality, and demonstrate that time-reversal-even axial-quadrupole plays a key role in stabilizing a chiral structure. Using the symmetry-adapted closest Wannier model of the trigonal Te and Se, we quantify the evolution of the spin-independent (spinless) and spin-dependent (spinful) electric toroidal (ET) (axial) multipole moments across the transition from an achiral to a chiral structure. Our results clearly identify that a spin-independent off-diagonal real hopping between $p$ orbitals, which corresponds to the bond-cluster spinless ET quadrupole of $(3z^{2}-r^{2})$ type $G_{u}$, is the predominant order parameter in stabilizing helical structures. We further elucidate that the above itinerant spinless ET quadrupole induces a monopole-like orbital angular momentum texture in the momentum space, which can be observed via circular-dichroism in soft x-ray photoemission spectroscopy measurement. Our findings highlight a critical role of the orbital angular momentum in chiral materials rather than less dominant spin angular momentum arising from the relativistic spin-orbit coupling.</description>

      <title>Epitaxial formation of ultrathin HfO2 on graphene by sequential oxidation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.11693</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.11693v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We demonstrate the formation of epitaxial, ultrathin hafnia (HfO2) on graphene. Monoclinic hafnia (m-HfO2) forms as the end of a series of sequential oxidation reactions. Starting from Hf metal grown epitaxially on graphene, oxidation leads first to an amorphous suboxide (a-HfOx), then to a crystalline, hexagonal suboxide (h-HfOx) in epitaxial relationship with the substrate, and finally to m-HfO2 that is also epitaxial. We use scanning transmission electron microscopy to characterize the epitaxial relationships and to investigate the structure of h-HfOx. We propose a series of displacive transformations that relate the different crystalline phases and are consistent with the observed epitaxial relationships with the graphene substrate. ReaxFF based reactive molecular dynamics simulations confirm our model of the oxide phase sequencing, and illustrate the role of graphene in promoting oxide crystallization. Our results suggest a way to achieve heteroepitaxial integration of high-performance, crystalline dielectrics with two dimensional (2D) semiconductors with an atomically sharp interface, which is also relevant to hafnia phase engineering.</description>

      <title>Ideal antiferroelectricity with large digital electrostrain in PbZrO3 epitaxial thin films</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.11724</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.11724v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Antiferroelectrics exhibit reversible antipolar-polar phase transitions under electric fields, yielding large electrostrain suitable for electromechanical devices. Nevertheless, in thin-film form, the antiferroelectric behavior is often obscured by competing ferroic orders, resulting in slanted hysteresis loops with undesired remnant polarization, subsequently posing challenges in obtaining ideal antiferroelectricity and understanding their intrinsic electrical behavior. Here, atomistic models for controllable antiferroelectric-ferroelectric phase transition pathways are unveiled along specific crystallographic directions. Guided by the anisotropic phase transition and orientation design, we achieved ideal antiferroelectricity with square double hysteresis loop, large saturated polarization (~60 {\mu}C/cm2), near-zero remnant polarization, fast response time (~75 ns), and near-fatigue-free performance (~10^10 cycles) in (111)P-oriented PbZrO3 epitaxial thin films. Moreover, a bipolar and frequency-independent digital electrostrain (~0.83%) were demonstrated in this architype antiferroelectric system. In-situ X-ray diffraction studies further reveal that the large digital electrostrain results from intrinsic field-induced antiferroelectric-ferroelectric structural transition. This work demonstrates the anisotropic phase transition mechanism and ideal antiferroelectricity with large digital electrostrain in antiferroelectric thin films, offering a new avenue for applications of antiferroelectricity in nanoelectromechanical systems.</description>

      <title>Efficient spin-orbit torque driven magnetization switching of GdFe using phosphorus-implanted platinum layers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.11796</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.11796v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The capability of the spin-orbit torque (SOT) generated via phenomena such as the spin Hall effect in heavy metals, in switching the magnetization of an adjacent magnetic material, has been studied extensively over the last decade. The efficiency of SOT generation is commonly quantified in terms of the spin Hall angle {\theta}_SH. In this work, we demonstrate experimentally that implanting platinum (Pt) with phosphorus (P), resulting in Pt (P) d, where d denotes the implantation dose, increases {\theta}_SH by a factor of 7, from 0.06 (d = 0) to 0.43 (d = 10*10^16 ions/cm^2). The enhanced {\theta}_SH, along with factors such as perpendicular magnetic anisotropy and resistivity, lead to reduction of the critical current density for switching the perpendicular magnetization of ferrimagnetic rare earth-transition metal alloy Gd26Fe74, by a factor of nearly 27, from 4.0*1011 A/m^2 (d = 0) to 1.5*10^10 A/m^2 (d = 10*10^16 ions/cm^2). Further, the switching current density at zero thermal fluctuations and thermal stability factor were evaluated and found to be 2.0*10^10 A/m^2 and 61.4 (d = 10*10^16 ions/cm^2), with the latter being sufficiently above the required threshold for commercial memory applications. Our results suggest that Pt (P) could be a strong candidate in realizing efficient SOT driven magnetization switching leading to the development of improved memory and logic devices in the future.</description>

Abstract: The stability of hydrogenated monolayer graphene was investigated via X-ray photoemission spectroscopy (XPS) for two different environmental conditions: ultra-high vacuum (UHV) and ambient pressure. The study is carried out by measuring the C 1s line shape evolution for two hydrogenated samples one kept in the UHV chamber and the other progressively exposed to air. In particular, the $sp^3$ relative intensity in the C 1s core-level spectrum, represented by the area ratio $\frac{sp^3}{sp^2+sp^3}$, was used as a marker for the hydrogenation-level and it resulted to vary by (4 $\pm$ 2)$\%$ in UHV after four months. Thus, a long-term stability of hydrogenated monolayer graphene was found, that indicates this material as a good candidate for hydrogen (or tritium) storage as long as it is kept in vacuum. On the other hand, the C 1s spectrum of the sample exposed to air shows a significant oxidation. A rapid growth up to saturation of the carbon oxides was observed with a time constant $\tau$ = 1.8 $\pm$ 0.2 hours. Finally, the re-exposure of the oxidised sample to atomic hydrogen was found to be an effective method for the recovery of hydrogenated graphene. This process was studied by carrying out both XPS and electron energy loss spectroscopy, the latter exploited to observe the CH stretching mode as a direct footprint of re-hydrogenation.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2504.11861v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This work presents a comprehensive study on the aging behavior of 18650-type lithium-ion batteries, focusing on the uneven intercalation of lithium ions during fast charging processes. It introduces a novel approach using color visual recognition technology to analyze color changes in the graphite anode, indicative of lithiation levels. The study employs X-ray diffraction (XRD) and Distribution of Relaxation Time (DRT) techniques to validate and analyze the observations. The study emphasizes the significance of electrode impedance, the positioning of battery tabs, and electrolyte distribution in influencing the aging dynamics of lithium-ion batteries. Furthermore, the paper presents an innovative impedance Transport-Line Model, specifically developed to capture the evolution of polarization impedance over time. This model offers a deeper understanding of the internal mechanisms driving battery aging, providing valuable insights for the design and optimization of lithium-ion batteries. The research represents a significant contribution to the field, shedding light on the complex aging processes in lithium-ion batteries, particularly under the conditions of fast charging. This could lead to improved battery performance, longevity, and safety, which are critical for the wide range of applications that depend on these energy storage systems.</description>

      <title>Unified Multipole Bott Indices for Non-Hermitian Skin Effect in Different Orders</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.12017</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.12017v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Non-Hermitian systems exhibit a distinctive phenomenon known as the non-Hermitian skin effect, where an extensive number of eigenstates become localized at the boundaries of a lattice with open boundaries. While the spectral winding number under periodic boundary conditions is a well-established topological indicator for predicting the skin effect in one-dimensional non-Hermitian systems, a suitable topological invariant to diagnose higher-order skin effects remains elusive. In this Letter, we propose a unified non-Hermitian multipole characterization framework that generalizes the concept of spectral winding to higher-order skin effects. Specifically, we develop a set of non-Hermitian multipole Bott indices capable of diagnosing skin effects of different orders. Our approach provides a comprehensive understanding of both first- and higher-order skin effects in non-Hermitian systems, offering new perspectives for exploring topological phenomena in non-Hermitian systems.</description>

      <title>Effect of pressure, doping and magnetism on electronic structure and phonon dispersion of FeSe</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.12043</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.12043v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a Density Functional Theory (DFT) based first-principles study on iron chalcogenides superconductor FeSe, systematically investigating pressure and doping induced modifications to its electronic, magnetic, and lattice dynamical properties. Our constrained-DFT calculations in striped antiferromagnetic and staggered dimer phase reveal a non-trivial dependence of the electronic structure on the local magnetic moment at all pressures. Sulpher (S) and tellurium (Te) doping exert opposing effects on the electronic structure, attributable to their contrasting chemical pressure effects (negative for S, positive for Te). Lattice dynamics calculations divulge distinct dependence of different phonon modes on local magnetic moment in different magnetic phases. We identify pressure and magnetic moment-dependent dynamical instability in certain magnetic phases, underscoring the intricate interplay of structural, electronic, and magnetic properties in this system. Investigation of spin-phonon coupling for different phonon modes shows the presence of strong magneto-elastic coupling in FeSe with pressure distinctly affecting prominent optical phonon modes -- pure iron derived $B_{1g}$ and pure selenium derived $A_{1g}$. A clear indication of the change in spin-phonon coupling with pressure is visible, especially for the $B_{1g}$ mode.</description>

      <title>Interface, bulk and surface structure of heteroepitaxial altermagnetic {\alpha}-MnTe films grown on GaAs(111)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.12126</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.12126v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Epitaxial MnTe films have recently seen a spur of research into their altermagnetic semiconducting properties. However, those properties may be extremely sensitive to structural and chemical modifications. We report a detailed investigation of the synthesis of the altermagnet {\alpha}-MnTe on GaAs(111) which reveals the bulk defect structure of this material, the mechanism by which it releases strain from the underlying substrate and the impact of oxidation on its surface. X-ray diffraction measurements show that {\alpha}-MnTe layers with thicknesses spanning 45nm to 640nm acquire lattice parameters different from bulk mostly due to thermal strain caused by the substrate rather than strain from the lattice mismatch. Through high resolution transmission electron microscopy (TEM) measurement, we then unveil a misfit dislocation array at the interface, revealing the mechanism by which lattice strain is relaxed. TEM also reveals a stacking fault in the bulk, occurring along a glide plane parallel to the interface. The combination of TEM with polarized neutron reflectometry measurements finally reveals the impact of oxidation on the chemistry of the surface of uncapped MnTe. Our findings highlight the subtle role of epitaxy in altering the structure of {\alpha}-MnTe providing potential opportunities to tune the altermagnetic properties of this material.</description>

      <title>On the effective magnetostrictive properties of anisotropic magneto-active elastomers in the small-deformation limit</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.12271</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.12271v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Magneto-active elastomers (MAEs) are composite materials comprising an elastomer matrix with embedded magnetic particles, endowing the composite with coupled effective magneto-mechanical responses. It is widely reported that anisotropic MAEs exhibit much stronger magneto-mechanical coupling than isotropic MAEs. However, most efforts to model effective magneto-mechanical properties of MAEs via homogenization focused on isotropic microstructures or those with large separations between particles, to use analytical solutions. In this work, we introduce a periodic homogenization approach to compute effective magneto-mechanical properties of anisotropic MAEs, and analyze microstructural features that enhance the magneto-mechanical coupling. Using the finite element method, we numerically determine the effect of particle shape, gap, and voids on the effective stiffness, permeability, and magneto-mechanical coupling tensors for chain-like periodic microstructures. Using insights gained from the full-field simulations, we derive an analytical expression for the magneto-mechanical coupling in the chain direction, in terms of the volume fraction, gap size, and properties of the matrix and particles. Results show that the overall magnetostriction of anisotropic MAEs is most sensitive to the gap between particles and the waviness of the particle chains, with smaller gap sizes and straighter chains yielding higher overall magnetostriction. Simulations also show that while isotropic MAEs elongate in a uniform magnetic field, anisotropic MAEs contract with much larger strain amplitudes, a result of the attractive forces between particles being much stronger in anisotropic MAEs than in isotropic MAEs. Results provide fundamental insights into the mechanisms that govern magneto-mechanical coupling in anisotropic MAEs, and constitute a toolbox of homogenized MAE material properties.</description>

      <title>A square skyrmion lattice in multi-orbital $f$-electron systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.11765</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.11765v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We report the emergence of a square-shaped skyrmion lattice in multi-orbital $f$-electron systems with easy-axis magnetic anisotropy on a centrosymmetric square lattice. By performing mean-field calculations for an effective localized model consisting of two Kramers doublets, we construct the low-temperature phase diagram in a static external magnetic field. Consequently, we find that a square-shaped skyrmion lattice with the skyrmion number of one appears in the intermediate-field region when the crystal field splitting between the two doublets is small. Furthermore, we identify another double-$Q$ state with a nonzero net scalar chirality at zero- and low-field regions, which is attributed to the help of the multi-orbital degree of freedom. Our results offer another route to search for skyrmion-hosting materials in centrosymmetric $f$-electron tetragonal systems with multi-orbital degrees of freedom, e.g., Ce-based compounds. This contrasts with conventional other $f$-electron systems hosting skyrmion lattices, such as Gd- and Eu-based compounds without orbital angular momentum.</description>

      <title>Instability of the critical Ngai's coupling and two-boson mechanism in metals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.11523</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.11523v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the properties of a Fermi liquid coupled to a quantum critical boson via the two-boson interaction known as Ngai's coupling. We find that the original quantum critical point is generally unstable, resulting in a finite-momentum spatially modulated state unless two conditions are satisfied: (i) the critical boson is polar and transverse, and (ii) the ratio of the Fermi velocity to the transverse-boson velocity is sufficiently large. If these conditions hold and the uniform state remains stable, we demonstrate that the system enters a strong-coupling regime below a certain energy scale. In this regime, we discuss a self-consistent solution at criticality in two-dimensional systems and show that the critical boson field develops a nontrivial anomalous dimension, $\eta=1/2$. Our findings highlight the significant role of two-boson coupling in critical theories, challenging the conventional view that its effects are subdominant to linear coupling.</description>

      <title>Probing Quantum Anomalous Hall States in Twisted Bilayer WSe2 via Attractive Polaron Spectroscopy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.11530</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.11530v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Moir\'e superlattices in semiconductors are predicted to exhibit a rich variety of interaction-induced topological states. However, experimental demonstrations of such topological states, apart from MoTe2 superlattices, have remained scarce. Here, we report the first optical detection of quantum anomalous Hall (QAH) states in twisted WSe2 homobilayer (tWSe2). Specifically, we employ polarization-resolved attractive polaron spectroscopy on a dual-gated, 2 degree tWSe2 and observe direct signatures of spontaneous time-reversal symmetry breaking at hole filling {\nu} = 1. Together with a Chern number (C) measurement via Streda formula analysis, we identify this magnetized state as a topological state, characterized by C = 1. Furthermore, we demonstrate that these topological and magnetic properties are tunable via a finite displacement field, between a QAH ferromagnetic state and an antiferromagnetic state. Our findings position tWSe2 as a highly versatile, stable, and optically addressable platform for investigating topological order and strong correlations in two-dimensional landscapes.</description>

      <title>Dynamical electronic correlation and chiral magnetism in van der Waals magnet Fe4GeTe2</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.11563</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.11563v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Among the quasi-2D van der Waals magnetic systems, Fe4GeTe2 imprints a profound impact due to its near-room temperature ferromagnetic behaviour and the complex magnetothermal phase diagram exhibiting multiple phase transformations, as observed from magnetization and magnetotransport measurements. A complete analysis of these phase transformations in the light of electronic correlation and its impact on the underlying magnetic interactions remain unattended in the existing literature. Using first-principles methodologies, incorporating the dynamical nature of electron correlation, we have analysed the interplay of the direction of magnetization in the easy-plane and easy-axis manner with the underlying crystal symmetry, which reveals the opening of a pseudogap feature beyond the spin-reorientation transition (SRT) temperature. The impact of dynamical correlation on the calculated magnetic circular dichroism and x-ray absorption spectrum of the L-edge of the Fe atoms compared well with the existing experimental observations. The calculated intersite Heisenberg exchange interactions display a complicated nature, depending upon the pairwise interactions among the two inequivalent Fe sites, indicating a RKKY-like behaviour of the magnetic interactions. We noted the existence of significant anisotropic and antisymmetric exchanges interactions, resulting into a chirality in the magnetic behaviour of the system. Subsequent investigation of the dynamical aspects of magnetism in Fe4GeTe2 and the respective magnetothermal phase diagram reveal that the dynamical nature of spins and the decoupling of the magnetic properties for both sites of Fe is crucial to explain all the experimentally observed phase transformations.</description>

      <title>Uncertainty Quantification in Multiscale Modeling of Polymer Composite Materials Using Physically Recurrent Neural Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.11625</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.11625v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This study investigates whether Physically Recurrent Neural Networks (PRNNs), a recent surrogate model for heterogeneous materials, trained on a micromodel with fixed material parameters, can maintain accuracy for varying material properties without retraining, and propagate uncertainty in a multiscale framework. Unlike conventional RNNs, where parameter changes require training or explicit inclusion of material properties as extra input features, PRNNs embeds material models in their material layer that allow for modification of material parameters after training. When adjusting material properties dynamically according to the input during testing, PRNN shows high accuracy across a wide range of parameters. Therefore the surrogate can be applied to multiscale uncertainty quantification (UQ). Compared to the full-order simulations on an overly coarse mesh, the PRNN-driven model reduces simulation time by over 7000 times while accurately capturing highly nonlinear evolution of the probability density for the macroscopic response as a result of a given distribution for microscale material parameters. A PRNN-driven UQ is demonstrated on a more accurate finer mesh that would be computationally infeasible with the full-order model.</description>

      <title>Infrared Imaging of Photochromic Contrast in Thiazolothiazole-Embedded Polymer Films</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.11690v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The increasing demand for optical technologies with dynamic spectral control has driven interest in chromogenic materials, particularly for applications in tunable infrared metasurfaces. Phase-change materials such as vanadium dioxide and germanium-antimony-tellurium, for instance, have been widely used in the infrared regime. However, their reliance on thermal and electrical tuning introduces challenges such as high power consumption, limited emissivity tuning, and slow modulation speeds. Photochromic materials may offer an alternative approach to dynamic infrared metasurfaces, potentially overcoming these limitations through rapid, light-induced changes in optical properties. This manuscript explores the potential of thiazolothiazole-embedded polymers, known for their reversible photochromic transitions and strong infrared absorption changes, for tunable infrared metasurfaces. The material exhibits low absorption and a strong photochromic contrast in the spectral range from 1500 cm-1 to 1700 cm-1, making it suitable for dynamic infrared light control. This manuscript reports on infrared imaging experiments demonstrating photochromic contrast in thiazolothiazole-embedded polymer and thereby provides compelling evidence for their potential applications for dynamic infrared metasurfaces.</description>

      <title>Gas-solid Reaction Dynamics on Li$_6$PS$_5$Cl Surfaces: A Case Study of the Influence of CO$_2$ and CO$_2$/O$_2$ Atmospheres Using AIMD and MLFF Simulations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.11762</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.11762v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In recent years, rapid progress has been made in solid-state lithium batteries. Among various technologies, coating the surface of electrodes or electrolytes has proven to be an effective method to enhance interfacial stability and improve battery cycling performance. Recent experimental studies showed that gas-solid reactions offer a convenient approach to form modified coating layers on the solid electrolyte. Here, we performed computational simulations to investigate this surface reaction process. Specifically, we simulated the gas-solid reactions of Li$_6$PS$_5$Cl(LPSC) solid-state electrolytes in pure CO$_2$ and in mixed CO$_2$/O$_2$ atmospheres using ab-initio molecular dynamics (AIMD) and machine-learning force fields (MLFF)-accelerated molecular dynamics (MD) approaches. In the former case, LPSC surfaces primarily form Li$_2$CO$_2$S because it is difficult to dissociate another oxygen atom from the second CO$_2$ molecule. While in CO$_2$/O$_2$ mixed atmosphere, O$_2$ molecules preferentially adsorb onto LPSC, which supplies oxygen sites for subsequent CO$_2$ adsorption to form carbonate -CO$_3$ units. This reaction pathway ultimately generates an interfacial product dominated by Li$_2$CO$_3$. These coatings exhibit distinct electronic and ionic conductivity characteristics, allowing the possibility to control coating compositions and configurations by adjusting the gas-solid reactions. Key criteria for applying this strategy are extracted from the current research.</description>

      <title>Refractive Index, Its Chromatic Disper-sion, and Thermal Coefficients of Four Less Common Glycols</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.11819</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.11819v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We report comprehensive measurements of the refractive index as a function of wavelength and temperature for four less commonly studied glycols: pentaethylene glycol, hexaethylene glycol, dipropylene glycol (mixture of isomers), and tripropylene glycol. The measurements cover the spectral range of 390-1070 nm and temperatures from 1{\deg}C to 45{\deg}C. The data were modeled using a two-pole Sellmeier equation, with temperature dependence captured by wavelength-dependent thermal coefficients. The resulting fit parameters are provided in tabulated form. Experimental uncertainties in refractive index, wavelength, and temperature were rigorously evaluated and incorporated into the analysis. The influence of sample purity - including residual water content and manufacturer-reported impurities - was assessed and accounted for in the uncertainty estimates. To our knowledge, this is the first dataset to systematically characterize both chromatic dispersion and thermal variation of the refractive index for these glycols over such a broad spectral and temperature range. The validated fitting equations and parameters are suitable for use in optical modeling, materials characterization, and related applications. All raw data are available in a publicly accessible repository.</description>

      <title>Understanding the evolution of the magnetic ground state in Ba$_4$NaRu$_3$O$_{12}$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.11863</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.11863v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We report a comprehensive investigation of the quadruple perovskite Ba$_4$NaRu$_3$O$_{12}$, in which we discover a robust spin-lattice coupled ground state characterized by a long-range antiferromagnetic ordering at $T_N \sim$ 257 K. The system's unique structural motif of three symmetrically distinct magnetic ions, including Ru dimers separated by non-magnetic layers, is intimately correlated with its magnetic behavior, as evidenced by temperature-dependent diffraction measurements and specific heat data. The powder neutron diffraction patterns at 13 K showed that the spins within the dimers are antiparallel, leading to a net zero moment contribution and a staggered arrangement of the triangular layers formed by the Ru moments within the corner-shared octahedra along the $c$-axis. The low-temperature specific heat revealed an extra boson peak contribution from optical modes with a maximum vibrational energy of $\sim$55cm$^{-1}$. The charge transport exhibited variable-range hopping (VRH) behaviour below $T_N$, with a stronger energy-dependence than expected from the Efros-Shklovskii model, suggesting the presence of multiparticle correlation effects.</description>

      <title>Epstein zeta method for many-body lattice sums</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.11989v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Many-body interactions arise naturally in the perturbative treatment of classical and quantum many-body systems and play a crucial role in the description of condensed matter systems. In the case of three-body interactions, the Axilrod-Teller-Muto (ATM) potential is highly relevant for the quantitative prediction of material properties. The computation of the resulting energies in d-dimensional lattice systems is challenging, as a high-dimensional lattice sum needs to be evaluated to high precision. This work solves this long-standing issue. We present an efficiently computable representation of many-body lattice sums in terms of singular integrals over products of Epstein zeta functions. For three-body interactions in 3D, this approach reduces the runtime for computing the ATM lattice sum from weeks to minutes. Our approach further extends to a broad class of n-body lattice sums. We demonstrate that the computational cost of our method only increases linearly with n, evading the exponential increase in complexity of direct summation. The evaluation of 51-body interactions on a two-dimensional lattice, corresponding to a 100-dimensional sum, can be performed within seconds on a laptop. We discuss techniques for computing the arising singular integrals and compare the accuracy of our results against computable benchmarks, achieving full precision for exponents greater than the system dimension. Finally, we apply our method to study the stability of a three-dimensional lattice system with Lennard-Jones two-body interactions under the inclusion of an ATM three-body term at finite pressure, finding a transition from the face-centered-cubic to the body-centered-cubic lattice structure with increasing ATM coupling strength. This work establishes the mathematical foundation for an ongoing investigation into the influence of many-body interactions on the stability of matter.</description>

      <title>Giant Exciton Transport in hBN/2D-Perovskite Heterostructures</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.12024v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Two-dimensional perovskites, such as Ruddlesden-Popper perovskites, exhibit outstanding optical properties and high exciton binding energies but are highly susceptible to degradation under photo- and electron-beam exposure. To overcome this limitation, we encapsulate the perovskites with mechanically exfoliated hexagonal boron nitride flakes, forming hexagonal boron nitride/perovskite heterostructures. Cathodoluminescence spectroscopy reveals that these heterostructures exhibit significantly reduced electron-beam-induced degradation, enhanced luminescence intensity, a narrower emission bandwidth, and an extended exciton decay time. Moreover, leveraging the scanning capability of our fiber-based cathodoluminescence spectroscopy technique, we demonstrate ultra-long-range exciton transport over distances of approximately 150 micrometers, attributed to exciton-defect coupling. This exciton-defect interaction not only enhances luminescence but also highlights the potential of hexagonal boron nitride/perovskite heterostructures as hybrid van-der-Waals systems with long-range exciton transport and slow radiative decay rates, paving the way for robust and efficient optoelectronic applications.</description>

      <title>Magnetic Pair Distribution Function and Half Polarized Neutron Powder Diffraction at the HB-2A Powder Diffractometer</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.12107</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.12107v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Local magnetic order and anisotropy are often central for understanding fundamental behavior and emergent functional properties in quantum materials and beyond. Advances in neutron powder diffraction experiments and analysis tools now allow for quantitative determination. We demonstrate this here with complementary total neutron scattering and polarized neutron measurements on the HB-2A neutron powder diffractometer at the High Flux Isotope Reactor (HFIR). In recent years, magnetic pair distribution function (mPDF) analysis has emerged as a powerful technique for probing local magnetic spin ordering of magnetic materials. This method can be broadly applied to any magnetic material but is particularly effective for studying systems with short-range magnetic order, such as materials with reduced dimensionality, geometrically frustrated magnets, thermoelectrics, multiferroics, and correlated paramagnets. Magnetic anisotropy often underpins the short-range order adopted. Half-polarized neutron powder diffraction (pNPD) can be used to determine the local susceptibility tensor on the magnetic sites to quantify the magnetic anisotropy. Combining the techniques of mPDF and pNPD can therefore provide valuable insights into local magnetic behavior. A series of measurements optimized for these techniques are presented as exemplar cases focused on frustrated materials where short-range order dominates, these include measurements to ultra-low temperature (&lt;100 mK) not typically accessible for such experiments.</description>

      <title>Characterisation of single microdischarges during plasma electrolytic oxidation of aluminium and titanium</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.12139v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Plasma electrolytic oxidation (PEO) is a technique used to create oxide-ceramic coatings on lightweight metals, such as aluminium, magnesium, and titanium. PEO is known for producing coatings with high corrosion resistance and strong adhesion to the substrate. The process involves generating short-lived microdischarges on the material surface through anodic dielectric breakdown in a conductive aqueous solution. To investigate single microdischarges during PEO, a single microdischarge setup was developed, where the active anode surface is reduced to the tip of a wire with a diameter of 1 mm. In this work the focus is on the effect of electrolyte concentration, anode material, and electrical parameters on the microdischarges. The electrolyte is composed of distilled water with varying concentrations of potassium hydroxide (0.5 - 4 g/l). High-speed optical measurements are conducted to gain insights into the formation and temporal evolution of individual microdischarges and the induced gas bubble formation. Optical emission spectroscopy is used to estimate surface and electron temperatures by fitting Bremsstrahlung and Planck's law to the continuum spectrum of the microdischarges. To evaluate the impact of the microdischarges on coating morphology, the resulting oxide layers on the metal tips are analysed using scanning electron microscopy. The study demonstrates that microdischarge behaviour is significantly influenced by the substrate material, treatment time, and electrolyte concentration, all of which impact the coating morphology. Under the conditions studied in this work, aluminium exhibits longer microdischarge and bubble lifetimes, with fewer cracks on the top layer of the coating, whereas titanium showed faster, shorter-lived bubbles due to more rapid microdischarge events.</description>

      <title>Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya Interaction and Dipole-Exchange Curvature Effects on the Spin-Wave Spectra of Magnetic Nanotubes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.12219</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.12219v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This work explores spin-wave dynamics in magnetic nanotubes, focusing on the influence of the Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interaction and curvature. The study uses analytical methods to examine how these factors influence the emergence of nonreciprocity and azimuthal standing waves in nanotubes with longitudinal magnetization along the axis or with a vortex-like magnetization. The interplay between exchange, Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya, and dipolar couplings in determining the chirality of spin waves is discussed. When the magnetization is saturated along an axis, the spin waves propagating along it are symmetric under the inversion of the wave vector. However, magnetochirality, mainly driven by exchange and Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya couplings, is observed in the azimuthal standing modes. In the vortex state, frequency nonreciprocity occurs for waves propagating along the tube, while the azimuthal modes remain reciprocal. For positive Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interaction, and depending on the helicity of the vortex, the asymmetry induced by the dipolar interaction is reinforced, whereas a negative coupling opposes this asymmetry. The influence of radial anisotropy is also examined. It is found that radial anisotropy reduces the frequency of the modes and shifts the dispersion minimum to a finite wave vector in the vortex state. The properties of modes near zero frequency offer insight into the emergence of chiral magnetic textures.</description>

      <title>Projectively implemented altermagnetism in an exactly solvable quantum spin liquid</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.12298v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Altermagnets are a new class of symmetry-compensated magnets with large spin splittings. Here, we show that the notion of altermagnetism extends beyond the realm of Landau-type order: we study exactly solvable $\mathbb{Z}_2$ quantum spin(-orbital) liquids (QSL), which simultaneously support magnetic long-range order as well as fractionalization and $\mathbb{Z}_2$ topological order. Our symmetry analysis reveals that in this model three distinct types of ``fractionalized altermagnets (AM$^*$)'' may emerge, which can be distinguished by their residual symmetries. Importantly, the fractionalized excitations of these states carry an emergent $\mathbb{Z}_2$ gauge charge, which implies that they transform \emph{projectively} under symmetry operations. Consequently, we show that ``altermagnetic spin splittings'' are now encoded in a momentum-dependent particle-hole asymmetry of the fermionic parton bands. We discuss consequences for experimental observables such as dynamical spin structure factors and (nonlinear) thermal and spin transport.</description>

      <title>Understanding spin textures in PT-broken systems through universal symmetry-constrained rules</title>

      <description>arXiv:2312.02425v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The current understanding of spin-polarization phenomena in crystals relies heavily on the development of specific k.p Hamiltonians. A more fundamental and symmetry-driven understanding, based solely on crystalline symmetries, remains largely incomplete. In this work, we develop a universal theory consisting of five symmetry-constrained rules to capture the key framework of diverse spin textures (STs) in PT-broken systems. These rules comprehensively classify spatial operations and their combinations with anti-unitary operation T in symmetry-preserved k-invariant subspaces. The theory allows us to address puzzling STs and facilitates the ab initio design of unconventional STs in spin-orbit coupled crystals. Key examples include the identification of vertex-like and windmill-like STs in materials with Dn and Cnv point groups, extending beyond the currently known Radial and Rashba STs. By integrating different types of antiferromagnetic configurations, we also achieve radial STs and the Dresselhaus effect in centrosymmetric systems, challenging the long-standing assumption that these effects exist solely in non-centrosymmetric systems. When combined with topological band theory, we further propose that symmetry-constrained three-dimensional persistent STs can widely exist in two types of non-symmorphic crystals, effectively resolving the ongoing debate regarding their existence.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.10910v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We introduce a program named KPROJ that unfolds the electronic and phononic band structure of materials modeled by supercells. The program is based on the $\textit{k}$-projection method, which projects the wavefunction of the supercell onto the ${\textbf{k}}$-points in the Brillouin zone of the artificial primitive cell. It allows for obtaining an effective "local" band structure by performing partial integration over the wavefunctions, e.g., the unfolded band structure with layer-projection for interfaces and the weighted band structure in the vacuum for slabs. The layer projection is accelerated by a scheme that combines the Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) and the inverse FFT algorithms. It is now interfaced with a few first-principles codes based on plane waves such as VASP, Quantum Espresso, and ABINIT. In addition, it also has interfaces with ABACUS, a first-principles simulation package based on numerical atomic basis sets, and PHONOPY, a program for phonon calculations.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.13140v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Altermagnets, which exhibit spin-split electronic bands without net magnetization, provide an appealing platform for exploring unconventional spin and ferroic physics. Through symmetry analyses and first-principles calculations, we show that monolayer \(\mathrm{VOX_2}\) (\(\mathrm{X = Cl, Br, I}\)) is a two-dimensional (2D) ferroelectric altermagnet (FEAM). The spin splitting in its electronic band structure can be precisely tuned by ferroelectric polarization and magnetic order, accompanied by a giant magnetoelectric coupling coefficient. Owing to the absence of inversion symmetry, this material also exhibits pronounced nonlinear optical responses. The altermagnetic \(\mathrm{VOI_2}\) monolayer show an exceptionally large spin shift current of up to \(330.072\,\mu\mathrm{A}/\mathrm{V}^2\), which is switchable by reversing the magnetic order. These results uncover a strong interplay between magnetic and ferroelectric orders, offering a route toward electrically and magnetically tunable nonlinear spin photocurrents in 2D multiferroic systems.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.19520v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Titanium dioxide (TiO2) is a key material in optoelectronic and energy conversion technologies, including solar cells and photocatalysis. However, integrating TiO2 into flexible or temperature-sensitive devices requires deposition techniques that avoid high-temperature processing while maintaining control over both phase composition and crystallinity. In this work, we demonstrate the synthesis of nanocrystalline TiO2 thin films using High Power Impulse Magnetron Sputtering (HiPIMS) at nearroom temperature. By systematically varying total pressure and oxygen flow, we achieve tunable anatase to rutile phase ratios and control over crystalline quality, as evidenced by Raman and photoluminescence trends. The observed optical trends in both refractive index and emission are directly linked to the underlying structural evolution, with compositional analysis verifying stoichiometric consistency across all deposition conditions. Our findings establish HiPIMS as a powerful low temperature method for tailoring TiO2 thin films and enabling their application in flexible photovoltaics, photoelectrochemical water splitting, and other energy-related systems.</description>

      <title>Mechanical Amorphization of Glass-Forming Systems Induced by Oscillatory Deformation: The Energy Absorption and Efficiency Control</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.07798v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The kinetic process of mechanical amorphization plays a central role in tailoring material properties. Therefore, a quantitative understanding of how this process depends on loading parameters is critical for optimizing mechanical amorphization and tuning material performance. In this study, we employ molecular dynamics simulations to investigate oscillatory deformation-induced amorphization in three glass-forming intermetallic systems, addressing two unresolved challenges: (1) the relationship between amorphization efficiency and mechanical loading, and (2) energy absorption dynamics during crystal-to-amorphous (CTA) transitions. Our results demonstrate a decoupling between amorphization efficiency--governed by work rate and described by an effective temperature model--and energy absorption, which adheres to the Herschel-Bulkley constitutive relation. Crucially, the melting enthalpy emerges as a key determinant of the energy barrier, establishing a thermodynamic analogy between mechanical amorphization and thermally induced melting. This relationship provides a universally applicable metric to quantify amorphization kinetics. By unifying material properties and loading conditions, this work establishes a predictive framework for controlling amorphization processes. These findings advance the fundamental understanding of deformation-driven phase transitions and offer practical guidelines for designing materials with tailored properties for ultrafast fabrication, ball milling, and advanced mechanical processing techniques.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.18212v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present a study of the construction and spatial properties of localized Wannier orbitals in large supercells of insulating solids using plane waves as the underlying basis. The Pipek-Mezey (PM) functional in combination with intrinsic atomic orbitals (IAOs) as projectors is employed, resulting in so-called intrinsic bond orbitals (IBOs). Independent of the bonding type and band gap, a correlation between orbital spreads and geometric properties is observed. As a result, comparable sparsity patterns of the Hartree-Fock exchange matrix are found across all considered bulk 3D materials, exhibiting covalent bonds, polar covalent bonds, and ionic bonds. Recognizing the considerable computational effort required to construct localized Wannier orbitals for large periodic simulation cells, we address the performance and scaling of different solvers for the localization problem. This includes the Broyden-Fletcher-Goldfarb-Shanno (BFGS), Conjugate-Gradient (CG), Steepest Ascent (SA) as well as the Direct Inversion in the Iterative Subspace (DIIS) method. Each algorithm performs a Riemannian optimization under unitary matrix constraint, efficiently reaching the optimum in the "curved parameter space" on geodesics. We hereby complement the quantum chemistry and materials science literature with an introduction to this topic along with key references. The solvers have been implemented both within the Vienna Ab initio Simulation Package (VASP) and as a standalone open-source software package. Furthermore, we observe that the construction of Wannier orbitals for supercells of metal oxides presents a significant challenge, requiring approximately one order of magnitude more iteration steps than other systems studied.</description>

      <title>Efficient Generation of Spin Currents in Altermagnets via Magnon Drag</title>

Abstract: Altermagnets, a recently identified class of magnetic materials, possess a spin-split Fermi surface that results in the so-called spin splitter effect, enabling the generation of a spin current transverse to the injection direction and whose polarization lies along the N\'eel vector. In this study, we investigate how magnons interact with electrons in an altermagnetic metal. We find that while the electron-magnon interaction does not perturb the magnon dispersion, a charge current flowing in the material can induce a transverse magnon spin current, analogous to the electronic spin splitter effect. This spin current possesses both electronic and magnonic characteristics, i.e., a chemical potential dependence and a strong temperature dependence. This effect realizes the efficient generation of spin currents via magnons without depending on the material's spin-orbit coupling.</description>

      <title>Is fixed-node diffusion quantum Monte Carlo reproducible?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.12950</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.12950v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Fixed-node diffusion quantum Monte Carlo (FN-DMC) is a widely-trusted many-body method for solving the Schr\"{o}dinger equation, known for its reliable predictions of material and molecular properties. Furthermore, its excellent scalability with system complexity and near-perfect utilization of computational power makes FN-DMC ideally positioned to leverage new advances in computing to address increasingly complex scientific problems. Even though the method is widely used as a computational gold standard, reproducibility across the numerous FN-DMC code implementations has yet to be demonstrated. This difficulty stems from the diverse array of DMC algorithms and trial wave functions, compounded by the method's inherent stochastic nature. This study represents a community-wide effort to address the titular question, affirming that: Yes, FN-DMC is reproducible (when handled with care). Using the water-methane dimer as the canonical test case, we compare results from eleven different FN-DMC codes and show that the approximations to treat the non-locality of pseudopotentials are the primary source of the discrepancies between them. In particular, we demonstrate that, for the same choice of determinantal component in the trial wave function, reliable and reproducible predictions can be achieved by employing the T-move (TM), the determinant locality approximation (DLA), or the determinant T-move (DTM) schemes, while the older locality approximation (LA) leads to considerable variability in results. This work lays the foundation to establish accurate and reproducible FN-DMC estimates for all future studies across applications in materials science, physics, chemistry, and biology.</description>
