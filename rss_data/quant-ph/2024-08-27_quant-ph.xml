      <title>Quantum Information Scrambling and Entanglement: An Elegant Mathematical Connection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.13286</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.13286v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Studying the behavior of quantum information scrambling in various quantum systems is an active area of research. Recently, Sharma et al. [K.K. Sharma, V.P Gerdt, Quantum Inf. Process 20, 195 (2021)] have shown the mathematical connection between quantum information scrambling (QIS) and bipartite entanglement in non-thermal states. In the present work, we elegantly generalize this mathematical connection and study such connections in X-states, non-maximally entangled Bell states, and Werner states</description>

      <title>QuCLEAR: Clifford Extraction and Absorption for Significant Reduction in Quantum Circuit Size</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.13316</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.13316v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum computing carries significant potential for addressing practical problems. However, currently available quantum devices suffer from noisy quantum gates, which degrade the fidelity of executed quantum circuits. Therefore, quantum circuit optimization is crucial for obtaining useful results. In this paper, we present QuCLEAR, a compilation framework designed to optimize quantum circuits. QuCLEAR significantly reduces both the two-qubit gate count and the circuit depth through two novel optimization steps. First, we introduce the concept of Clifford Extraction, which extracts Clifford subcircuits to the end of the circuit while optimizing the gates. Second, since Clifford circuits are classically simulatable, we propose Clifford Absorption, which efficiently processes the extracted Clifford subcircuits classically. We demonstrate our framework on quantum simulation circuits, which have wide-ranging applications in quantum chemistry simulation, many-body physics, and combinatorial optimization problems. Near-term algorithms such as VQE and QAOA also fall within this category. Experimental results across various benchmarks show that QuCLEAR achieves up to a $77.7\%$ reduction in CNOT gate count and up to an $84.1\%$ reduction in entangling depth compared to state-of-the-art methods.</description>

      <title>Benchmarking the algorithmic reach of a high-Q cavity qudit</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.13317</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.13317v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: High-coherence cavity resonators are excellent resources for encoding quantum information in higher-dimensional Hilbert spaces, moving beyond traditional qubit-based platforms. A natural strategy is to use the Fock basis to encode information in qudits. One can perform quantum operations on the cavity mode qudit by coupling the system to a non-linear ancillary transmon qubit. However, the performance of the cavity-transmon device is limited by the noisy transmons. It is, therefore, important to develop practical benchmarking tools for these qudit systems in an algorithm-agnostic manner. We gauge the performance of these qudit platforms using sampling tests such as the Heavy Output Generation (HOG) test as well as the linear Cross-Entropy Benchmark (XEB), by way of simulations of such a system subject to realistic dominant noise channels. We use selective number-dependent arbitrary phase and unconditional displacement gates as our universal gateset. Our results show that contemporary transmons comfortably enable controlling a few tens of Fock levels of a cavity mode. This framework allows benchmarking even higher dimensional qudits as those become accessible with improved transmons.</description>

      <title>Rate Coefficients for Rotational State-to-State Transitions in H$_2$O + H$_2$ Collisions as Predicted by Mixed Quantum/Classical Theory (MQCT)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.13339</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.13339v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A new database of collisional rate coefficients for transitions between the rotational states of H$_2$O collided with H$_2$ background gas is developed. The goal is to expand over the other existing databases in terms of the rotational states of water (200 states are included here) and the rotational states of hydrogen (10 states). All four symmetries of ortho and para water combined with ortho, and para hydrogen are considered.The mixed quantum/classical theory of inelastic scattering implemented in the code MQCT is employed. A detailed comparison with previous databases is conducted to ensure that this approximate method is sufficiently accurate. Integration over collision energies, summation over the final states of H$_2$ and averaging over the initial states of H$_2$ is carried out to provide state-to-state, effective, and thermal rate coefficients in a broad range of temperatures.The rate coefficients for collisions with highly excited H$_2$ molecules are presented for the first time. It is found that rate coefficients for rotational transitions in H$_2$O molecules grow with the rotational excitation of H$_2$ projectiles and exceed those of the ground state H$_2$, roughly, by a factor of 2. These data enable more accurate description of water molecules in high-temperature environments, where the hydrogen molecules of background gas are rotationally excited, and the H$_2$O + H$_2$ collision energy is high. The rate coefficients presented here are expected to be accurate up to the temperature of $\sim$ 2000 K.</description>

      <title>Ancillary entangling Floquet kicks for accelerating quantum algorithms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.13345</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.13345v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum simulation with adiabatic annealing can provide insight into difficult problems that are impossible to study with classical computers. However, it deteriorates when the systems scale up due to the shrinkage of the excitation gap and thus places an annealing rate bottleneck for high success probability. Here, we accelerate quantum simulation using digital multi-qubit gates that entangle primary system qubits with the ancillary qubits. The practical benefits originate from tuning the ancillary gauge degrees of freedom to enhance the quantum algorithm's original functionality in the system subspace. For simple but nontrivial short-ranged, infinite long-ranged transverse-field Ising models, and the hydrogen molecule model after qubit encoding, we show improvement in the time to solution by one hundred percent but with higher accuracy through exact state-vector numerical simulation in a digital-analog setting. The findings are further supported by time-averaged Hamiltonian theory.</description>

      <title>High fidelity quantum state tomography of electron-$^{14}$N nuclear hybrid spin register in diamond using Rabi oscillations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.13349</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.13349v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We report on a new quantum state characterisation method, which we call Rabi-based Quantum State Tomography (RQST), that we have validated on single-qubit quantum states, in particular on the electron and nuclear spins of a single nitrogen-vacancy (NV) centre in diamond, demonstrating high fidelities. The difference of RQST with conventional tomography methods is in the implementation of rotation operators and construction of density matrix from the measured data sets. We demonstrate efficient quantum state control of the electron spin at room temperature with an average fidelity of 0.995 over more than 40 measurements on different states on the Bloch sphere with a maximum fidelity of 0.99992. Also, we apply the methodology to the dark NV nuclear spin state. The state is read via the electron spin using the C-NOT two-qubit entanglement gate and demonstrate fidelities of the same order.</description>

      <title>QAdaPrune: Adaptive Parameter Pruning For Training Variational Quantum Circuits</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.13352</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.13352v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the present noisy intermediate scale quantum computing era, there is a critical need to devise methods for the efficient implementation of gate-based variational quantum circuits. This ensures that a range of proposed applications can be deployed on real quantum hardware. The efficiency of quantum circuit is desired both in the number of trainable gates and the depth of the overall circuit. The major concern of barren plateaus has made this need for efficiency even more acute. The problem of efficient quantum circuit realization has been extensively studied in the literature to reduce gate complexity and circuit depth. Another important approach is to design a method to reduce the \emph{parameter complexity} in a variational quantum circuit. Existing methods include hyperparameter-based parameter pruning which introduces an additional challenge of finding the best hyperparameters for different applications. In this paper, we present \emph{QAdaPrune} - an adaptive parameter pruning algorithm that automatically determines the threshold and then intelligently prunes the redundant and non-performing parameters. We show that the resulting sparse parameter sets yield quantum circuits that perform comparably to the unpruned quantum circuits and in some cases may enhance trainability of the circuits even if the original quantum circuit gets stuck in a barren plateau.\\ \noindent{\bf Reproducibility}: The source code and data are available at \url{https://github.com/aicaffeinelife/QAdaPrune.git}</description>

      <title>Fundamental limits for realising quantum processes in spacetime</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.13387</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.13387v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Understanding the interface between quantum and relativistic theories is crucial for fundamental and practical advances, especially given that key physical concepts such as causality take different forms in these theories. Bell's no-go theorem reveals limits on classical processes, arising from relativistic causality principles. Considering whether similar fundamental limits exist on quantum processes, we derive no-go theorems for quantum experiments realisable in classical background spacetimes. We account for general processes allowed by quantum theory, including those with indefinite causal order (ICO), which have also been the subject of recent experiments. Our first theorem implies that realisations of ICO processes that do not violate relativistic causality must involve the non-localization of systems in spacetime. The second theorem shows that for any such realisation of an ICO process, there exists a more fine-grained description in terms of a definite and acyclic causal order process. This enables a general reconciliation of quantum and relativistic notions of causality and, in particular, applies to experimental realisations of the quantum switch, a prominent ICO process. By showing what is impossible to achieve in classical spacetimes, these no-go results also offer insights into how causality and information processing may differ in future quantum experiments in relativistic regimes beyond classical spacetimes.</description>

      <title>ReCon: Reconfiguring Analog Rydberg Atom Quantum Computers for Quantum Generative Adversarial Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.13389</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.13389v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum computing has shown theoretical promise of speedup in several machine learning tasks, including generative tasks using generative adversarial networks (GANs). While quantum computers have been implemented with different types of technologies, recently, analog Rydberg atom quantum computers have been demonstrated to have desirable properties such as reconfigurable qubit (quantum bit) positions and multi-qubit operations. To leverage the properties of this technology, we propose ReCon, the first work to implement quantum GANs on analog Rydberg atom quantum computers. Our evaluation using simulations and real-computer executions shows 33% better quality (measured using Frechet Inception Distance (FID)) in generated images than the state-of-the-art technique implemented on superconducting-qubit technology.</description>

      <title>Ultracoherent GHz Diamond Spin-Mechanical Lamb Wave Resonators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.13405</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.13405v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We report the development of an all-optical approach that excites the fundamental compression mode in a diamond Lamb wave resonator with an optical gradient force and detects the induced vibrations via strain coupling to a silicon vacancy center, specifically, via phonon sidebands in the optical excitation spectrum of the silicon vacancy. Sideband optical interferometry has also been used for the detection of the in-plane mechanical vibrations, for which conventional optical interferometry is not effective. These experiments demonstrate a GHz fundamental compression mode with a Q-factor &gt;10^7 at temperatures near 7 K, providing a promising platform for reaching the quantum regime of spin mechanics, especially phononic cavity QED of electron spins.</description>

      <title>Operational work fluctuation theorem for open quantum systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.13417</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.13417v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The classical Jarzynski equality establishes an exact relation between the stochastic work performed on a system driven out of thermal equilibrium and the free energy difference in a corresponding quasi-static process. This fluctuation theorem bears experimental relevance, as it enables the determination of the free energy difference through the measurement of externally applied work in a nonequilibrium process. In the quantum case, the Jarzynski equality only holds if the measurement procedure of the stochastic work is drastically changed: it is replaced by a so-called two-point measurement (TPM) scheme that requires the knowledge of the initial and final Hamiltonian and therefore lacks the predictive power for the free energy difference that the classical Jarzynski equation is known for. Here, we propose a quantum {{fluctuation theorem}} that is valid for externally measurable quantum work determined during the driving protocol. In contrast to the TPM case, the theorem also applies to open quantum systems and the scenario can be realized without knowing the system Hamiltonian. Our fluctuation theorem comes in the form of an inequality and therefore only yields bounds to the true free energy difference. The inequality is saturated in the quasiclassical case of vanishing energy coherences at the beginning and at the end of the protocol. Thus, there is a clear quantum disadvantage.</description>

Abstract: We have established the method of characterizing the unitary design generated by a symmetric local random circuit. Concretely, we have shown that the necessary and sufficient condition for the circuit forming an approximate t-design is given by simple integer optimization for general symmetry and locality. By using the result, we explicitly give the maximal order of unitary design under the $\mathbb{Z}_2$, U(1), and SU(2) symmetries for general locality. This work reveals the relation between the fundamental notions of symmetry and locality in terms of randomness.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2408.13479v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Drug discovery and development is a highly complex and costly endeavor, typically requiring over a decade and substantial financial investment to bring a new drug to market. Traditional computer-aided drug design (CADD) has made significant progress in accelerating this process, but the development of quantum computing offers potential due to its unique capabilities. This paper discusses the integration of quantum computing into drug discovery and development, focusing on how quantum technologies might accelerate and enhance various stages of the drug development cycle. Specifically, we explore the application of quantum computing in addressing challenges related to drug discovery, such as molecular simulation and the prediction of drug-target interactions, as well as the optimization of clinical trial outcomes. By leveraging the inherent capabilities of quantum computing, we might be able to reduce the time and cost associated with bringing new drugs to market, ultimately benefiting public health.</description>

      <title>Quantum Illumination Advantage for Classification Among an Arbitrary Library of Targets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.13489</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.13489v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum illumination (QI) is the task of querying a scene using a transmitter probe whose quantum state is entangled with a reference beam retained in ideal storage, followed by optimally detecting the target-returned light together with the stored reference, to make decisions on characteristics of targets at stand-off range, at precision that exceeds what is achievable with a classical transmitter of the same brightness and otherwise identical conditions. Using tools from perturbation theory, we show that in the limit of low transmitter brightness, high loss, and high thermal background, there is a factor of four improvement in the Chernoff exponent of the error probability in discriminating any number of apriori-known reflective targets when using a Gaussian-state entangled QI probe, over using classical coherent-state illumination (CI). While this advantage was known for detecting the presence or absence of a target, it had not been proven for the generalized task of discriminating between arbitrary target libraries. In proving our result, we derive simple general analytic expressions for the lowest-order asymptotic expansions of the quantum Chernoff exponents for QI and CI in terms of the signal brightness, loss, thermal noise, and the modal expansion coefficients of the target-reflected light's radiant exitance profiles when separated by a spatial mode sorter after entering the entrance pupil of the receiver's aperture.</description>

      <title>Robust optimal control for a systematic error in the control amplitude of transmon qubits</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.13554</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.13554v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the era of Noisy Intermediate-Scale Quantum computing as well as in error correcting circuits, physical qubits coherence time and high fidelity gates are essential to the functioning of quantum computers. In this paper, we demonstrate theoretically and experimentally, that pulses designed by optimization can be used to counteract the loss of fidelity due to a control amplitude error of the transmon qubit. We analyze the control landscape obtained by robust optimal control and find it to depend on the error range, namely the solutions can get trapped in the basin of attraction of sub-optimal solutions. Robust controls are found for different error values and are compared to an incoherent loss of fidelity mechanism due to a finite relaxation rate. The controls are tested on the IBMQ's qubit and found to demonstrate resilience against significant $\sim 10\%$ errors.</description>

      <title>Quantized Embedding Approaches for Collective Strong Coupling -- Connecting ab initio and macroscopic QED to Simple Models in Polaritonics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.13570</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.13570v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Collective light-matter interactions have been used to control chemistry and energy transfer, yet accessible approaches that combine ab initio methodology with large many-body quantum optical systems are missing due to the fast increase in computational cost for explicit simulations. We introduce an accessible ab initio quantum embedding concept for many-body quantum optical systems that allows to treat the collective coupling of molecular many-body systems effectively in the spirit of macroscopic QED while keeping the rigor of ab initio quantum chemistry for the molecular structure. Our approach fully includes the quantum fluctuations of the polaritonic field and yet remains much simpler and more intuitive than complex embedding approaches such as dynamical mean-field theory. We illustrate the underlying assumptions by comparison to the Tavis--Cummings model. The intuitive application of the quantized embedding approach and its transparent limitations offer a practical framework for the field of ab initio polaritonic chemistry to describe collective effects in realistic molecular ensembles.</description>

      <title>Complexity of Quantum Charged Particle in External Magnetic Field</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.13577</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.13577v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we investigate the circuit complexity of a quantum charged particle in an external magnetic field. Utilizing the Nielsen approach, we determine the complexity of thermofield double states as functions of time, temperature, and cyclotron frequency. We analyze both the complexity and the amplitude of its oscillations across various parameter values, and reveal that these results cannot be derived as a limit of the harmonic oscillator case. Finally, we calculate the rate of complexity and show that it obeys the Lloyd bound.</description>

      <title>Engineering biphoton spectral wavefunction in a silicon micro-ring resonator with split resonances</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.13590</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.13590v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Frequency-time is a degree of freedom suitable for photonic high-dimensional entanglement, with advantages such as compatibility with single-mode devices and insensitivity to dispersion. The engineering control of the frequency-time amplitude of a photon's electric field has been demonstrated on platforms with second-order optical nonlinearity. For integrated photonic platforms with only third-order optical nonlinearity, the engineered generation of the state remains unexplored. Here, we demonstrate a cavity-enhanced photon-pair source on the silicon-on-insulator (SOI) platform that can generate both separable states and controllable entangled states in the frequency domain without post-manipulation. By choosing different resonance combinations and employing on-chip optical field differentiation, we achieve independent control over two functions that affect the joint spectral intensity (JSI) of the state. A semi-analytical model is derived to simulate the biphoton spectral wavefunction in the presence of resonance splitting and pump differentiation, and its parameters can be fully determined through fitting-based parameter extraction from the resonator's measured linear response. The measured spectral purity for the separable state is $95.5\pm 1.2\%$, while the measured JSIs for the entangled states show two- or four-peaked functions in two-dimensional frequency space. The experiments and simulations demonstrate the capacity to manipulate the frequency-domain wavefunction in a silicon-based device, which is promising for applications like quantum information processing using pulsed temporal-mode encoding or long-distance quantum key distribution.</description>

      <title>Unconditionally secure key distribution without quantum channel</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.13602</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.13602v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Key distribution plays a fundamental role in cryptography. Currently, the quantum scheme stands as the only known method for achieving unconditionally secure key distribution. This method has been demonstrated over distances of 508 and 1002 kilometers in the measurement-device-independent and twin-field configurations, respectively. However, quantum key distribution faces transmission distance issues and numerous side channel attacks since the basic physical picture requires the use of quantum channels between users. Even when quantum repeater and quantum constellation are used, commercializing quantum cryptography on a large scale remains unattainable due to the considerable expense and significant technical hurdles associated with establishing a global quantum network and facilitating mobile quantum communication. Here, by discovering the provable quantum one-way function, we propose another key distribution scheme with unconditional security, named probability key distribution, that promises users between any two distances to generate a fixed and high secret key rate. There are no quantum channels for exchanging quantum signals between two legitimate users. Non-local entangled states can be generated, identified and measured in the equivalent virtual protocol and can be used to extract secret keys. We anticipate that this discovery presents a paradigm shift in achieving unconditionally secure cryptography, thereby facilitating its widespread application on a global scale.</description>

      <title>Reverse quantum annealing assisted by forward annealing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.13603</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.13603v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum annealers conventionally use forward annealing to generate heuristic solutions. Reverse annealing can potentially generate better solutions but necessitates an appropriate initial state. Ways to find such states are generally unknown or highly problem dependent, offer limited success, and severely restrict the scope of reverse annealing. We use a general method that improves the overall solution quality and quantity by feeding reverse annealing with low-quality solutions obtained from forward annealing. An experimental demonstration of solving the graph coloring problem using the D-Wave quantum annealers shows that our method is able to convert invalid solutions obtained from forward annealing to at least one valid solution obtained after assisted reverse annealing for $57\%$ of $459$ random Erd\H{o}s-R\'enyi graphs. Our method significantly outperforms random initial states, obtains more unique solutions on average, and widens the applicability of reverse annealing. Although the average number of valid solutions obtained drops exponentially with the problem size, a scaling analysis for the graph coloring problem shows that our method effectively extends the computational reach of conventional forward annealing using reverse annealing.</description>

      <title>Generalized one-way function and its application</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.13613</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.13613v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: One-way functions are fundamental to classical cryptography and their existence remains a longstanding problem in computational complexity theory. Recently, a provable quantum one-way function has been identified, which maintains its one-wayness even with unlimited computational resources. Here, we extend the mathematical definition of functions to construct a generalized one-way function by virtually measuring the qubit of provable quantum one-way function and randomly assigning the corresponding measurement outcomes with identical probability. Remarkably, using this generalized one-way function, we have developed an unconditionally secure key distribution protocol based solely on classical data processing, which can then utilized for secure encryption and signature. Our work highlights the importance of information in characterizing quantum systems and the physical significance of the density matrix. We demonstrate that probability theory and randomness are effective tools for countering adversaries with unlimited computational capabilities.</description>

      <title>Quantum error correction below the surface code threshold</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.13687</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.13687v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum error correction provides a path to reach practical quantum computing by combining multiple physical qubits into a logical qubit, where the logical error rate is suppressed exponentially as more qubits are added. However, this exponential suppression only occurs if the physical error rate is below a critical threshold. In this work, we present two surface code memories operating below this threshold: a distance-7 code and a distance-5 code integrated with a real-time decoder. The logical error rate of our larger quantum memory is suppressed by a factor of $\Lambda$ = 2.14 $\pm$ 0.02 when increasing the code distance by two, culminating in a 101-qubit distance-7 code with 0.143% $\pm$ 0.003% error per cycle of error correction. This logical memory is also beyond break-even, exceeding its best physical qubit's lifetime by a factor of 2.4 $\pm$ 0.3. We maintain below-threshold performance when decoding in real time, achieving an average decoder latency of 63 $\mu$s at distance-5 up to a million cycles, with a cycle time of 1.1 $\mu$s. To probe the limits of our error-correction performance, we run repetition codes up to distance-29 and find that logical performance is limited by rare correlated error events occurring approximately once every hour, or 3 $\times$ 10$^9$ cycles. Our results present device performance that, if scaled, could realize the operational requirements of large scale fault-tolerant quantum algorithms.</description>

      <title>Verifiable cloud-based variational quantum algorithms</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.13713v2 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Variational quantum algorithms (VQAs) have shown potential for quantum advantage with noisy intermediate-scale quantum (NISQ) devices for quantum machine learning (QML). However, given the high cost and limited availability of quantum resources, delegating VQAs via cloud networks is a more practical solution for clients with limited quantum capabilities. Recently, Shingu et al.[Physical Review A, 105, 022603 (2022)] proposed a variational secure cloud quantum computing protocol, utilizing ancilla-driven quantum computation (ADQC) for cloud-based VQAs with minimal quantum resource consumption. However, their protocol lacks verifiability, which exposes it to potential malicious behaviors by the server. Additionally, channel loss requires frequent re-delegation as the size of the delegated variational circuit grows, complicating verification due to increased circuit complexity. This paper introduces a new protocol to address these challenges and enhance both verifiability and tolerance to channel loss in cloud-based VQAs.</description>

      <title>Estimating quantum amplitudes can be exponentially improved</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.13721</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.13721v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Estimating quantum amplitudes is a fundamental task in quantum computing and serves as a core subroutine in numerous quantum algorithms. In this work, we present a novel algorithmic framework for estimating quantum amplitudes by transforming pure states into their matrix forms and encoding them into density matrices and unitary operators. Our framework presents two specific estimation protocols, achieving the standard quantum limit $\epsilon^{-2}$ and the Heisenberg limit $\epsilon^{-1}$, respectively. Our approach significantly reduces the complexity of estimation when states exhibit specific entanglement properties. We also introduce a new technique called channel block encoding for preparing density matrices, providing optimal constructions for gate-based quantum circuits and Hamiltonian simulations. The framework yields considerable advancements contingent on circuit depth or simulation time. A minimum of superpolynomial improvement can be achieved when the depth or the time is within the range of $\mathcal{O}(\text{poly}\log(n))$. Moreover, in certain extreme cases, an exponential improvement can be realized. Based on our results, various complexity-theoretic implications are discussed.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2408.13817v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Absorption estimation, the base of spectroscopy, is crucial for probing the composition and dynamics of matter. Conventional methods of estimation rely on coherent laser sources, and in turn suffer from inherent limitations in estimating weak absorption. Here we propose a new measurement strategy with correlated photons to determine the weak absorption by distinguishing the output with and without photons, dubbed as the on-off measurement. Our implementation within the strategy allows the estimation precision to reach the ultimate quantum limit. We demonstrate that absorption spectroscopy that incorporates quantum correlations is capable of estimating weak absorption down to a single-photon level, even in noisy environments, achieving a precision comparable to that obtained through several hundred photons in conventional absorption spectroscopy. By introducing the quantum correlations, our work avoids the occurrence of light-induced damage while breaking the classical inherent limitations in spectroscopy.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2408.13880v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we prove the equivalence between sampling advice, i.e., advice in the form of a training set, and classical advice. Specifically, our main result demonstrates that BPP/samp is equal to P/poly. Additionally, we delve into the analysis of these relationships under the constraint of a fixed distribution. Notably, we show that under such circumstances, the equality does not hold. This result remains valid when considering quantum advice and a quantum generalization of the training set. Finally, leveraging the insights gained from these proofs, we identify sufficient and necessary complexity assumptions for the existence of concept classes that exhibit a quantum learning speed-up in the worst-case scenario, i.e., when accurate results are required for all inputs.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2408.13919v2 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we propose a novel framework for multimodal contrastive learning utilizing a quantum encoder to integrate EEG (electroencephalogram) and image data. This groundbreaking attempt explores the integration of quantum encoders within the traditional multimodal learning framework. By leveraging the unique properties of quantum computing, our method enhances the representation learning capabilities, providing a robust framework for analyzing time series and visual information concurrently. We demonstrate that the quantum encoder effectively captures intricate patterns within EEG signals and image features, facilitating improved contrastive learning across modalities.

      <title>Near-symmetric multiport beam splitting for high-NOON state preparation on nonlocal metasurface</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.14002</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.14002v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Polarization beam splitting (BS) has been implemented on gradient metasurface with local response for entanglement manipulation and state reconstruction. To realize more degrees of light modulation, nonlocal modes, manifested as wavelength and momentum selectivity, should be applied into metasurface BS. Here, we demonstrate that single nonlocal phase gradient metasurface(NPGM) can function as a series of independent near-symmetric multiport BS,constructed by its momentum-polarization mode subspaces.Then, using any of above BS with simultaneous multiphoton interference, high-photon NOON states are prepared with high success probability and fidelity. For example,four-mode four-photon NOON state is obtained with 34.8% success probability and fidelity of 99.9%, greatly higher than those previously reported.With unique capability of multiphoton interference, this multiport BS on single NPGM can be directly used in the on-chip quantum photonics. Also, the efficient generation of high-photon NOON states with above BS has potential applications in quantum precision measurement.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2408.14011v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present proper genuine multipartite entanglement (GME) measures for arbitrary multipartite and dimensional systems. By using the volume of concurrence regular polygonal pyramid we first derive the GME measure of four-partite quantum systems. From our measure it is verified that the GHZ state is more entangled than the W state. Then we study the GME measure for multipartite quantum states in arbitrary dimensions. A well defined GME measure is constructed based on the volume of the concurrence regular polygonal pyramid. Detailed example shows that our measure can characterize better the genuine multipartite entanglements.</description>

      <title>Chiral cat state generation via the Sagnac-Fizeau effect</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.14029</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.14029v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Schr\"{o}dinger cat states are a kind of significant quantum resource in quantum physics and quantum information science. Here we propose a proposal for generating chiral cat states in a spinning resonator supporting both the clockwise (CW) and counterclockwise (CCW) traveling modes, which are dispersively coupled to a two-level atom. The physical mechanism for the chiral cat-state generation is based on the Sagnac-Fizeau effect. Concretely, when the resonator is rotating, the CW and CCW modes have different frequency detuning with respect to the atomic transition frequency, and hence the atomic-state-dependent rotating angular velocities for the CW and CCW modes in phase space are different. This mode-dependent evolution leads to the chirality in the state generation. By choosing proper system parameters, we achieve the separate generation of the Schr\"{o}dinger cat states and coherent states in the two traveling modes. We also investigate quantum coherence properties of the generated states by examining their Wigner functions. In addition, the influence of the system dissipations on the state generation in the open-system case is investigated. Our work will provide some insights into the development of chiral optical devices and nonreciprocal photonics physics.</description>

      <title>Quantum state transfer between superconducting cavities via exchange-free interactions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.14076</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.14076v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose and experimentally demonstrate a novel protocol for transferring quantum states between superconducting cavities using only continuous two-mode squeezing interactions, without exchange of photonic excitations between cavities. This approach conceptually resembles quantum teleportation, where quantum information is transferred between different nodes without directly transmitting carrier photons. In contrast to the discrete operations of entanglement and Bell-state measurement in teleportation, our scheme is symmetric and continuous. We experimentally realize coherent and bidirectional transfer of arbitrary quantum states, including bosonic quantum error correction codes. Our results offer new insights into the quantum state transfer and quantum teleportation. In particular, our demonstration validates a new approach to realize quantum transducers, and might find applications in a wide range of physical platforms.</description>

      <title>Quantum free-electron laser oscillator</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.14103</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.14103v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: If the quantum mechanical recoil of the electron due to its scattering from the undulator and laser fields dominates the dynamics, a regime of the free-electron laser emerges where quantum effects lead to a drastic change in the radiation properties. However, the large interaction length required for a single-pass quantum free-electron laser impedes the experimental realization. The quantum free-electron laser oscillator, proposed in the present article, is a possible scheme to resolve this issue. Here we show that this device features a photon statistics that is closer to a coherent state in comparison to existing classical free-electron lasers. The device can be even operated in such a way that a sub-Poissonian statistics is obtained. Beside the benefit of demonstrating this pure quantum effect, the narrowing of the photon distribution implies reduced intensity fluctuations of the emitted radiation, which in turn lead to decreased noise in imaging experiments or to an enhanced sensitivity in interferometric applications.</description>

      <title>Completely positive trace-preserving maps for higher-order unraveling of Lindblad master equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.14105</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.14105v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Theoretical tools used in processing continuous measurement records from real experiments to obtain quantum trajectories can easily lead to numerical errors due to a non-infinitesimal time resolution. In this work, we propose a systematic assessment of the accuracy of a map. We perform error analyses for diffusive quantum trajectories, based on single-time-step Kraus operators proposed in the literature, and find the orders in time increment, $\Delta t$, to which such operators satisfy the conditions for valid average quantum evolution (completely positive, convex-linear, and trace-preserving), and the orders to which they match the Lindblad solutions. Given these error analyses, we propose a Kraus operator that satisfies the valid average quantum evolution conditions and agrees with the Lindblad master equation, to second order in $\Delta t$, thus surpassing all other existing approaches. In order to test how well our proposed operator reproduces exact quantum trajectories, we analyze two examples of qubit measurement, where exact maps can be derived: a qubit subjected to a dispersive ($z$-basis) measurement and a fluorescence (dissipative) measurement. We show analytically that our proposed operator gives the smallest average trace distance to the exact quantum trajectories, compared to existing approaches.</description>

      <title>Dynamic compensation for pump-induced frequency shift in Kerr-cat qubit initialization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.14112</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.14112v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The noise-biased Kerr-cat qubit is an attractive candidate for fault-tolerant quantum computation; however, its initialization faces challenges due to the squeezing pump-induced frequency shift (PIFS). Here, we propose and demonstrate a dynamic compensation method to mitigate the effect of PIFS during the Kerr-cat qubit initialization. Utilizing a novel nonlinearity-engineered triple-loop SQUID device, we realize a stabilized Kerr-cat qubit and validate the advantages of the dynamic compensation method by improving the initialization fidelity from 57% to 78%, with a projected fidelity of 91% after excluding state preparation and measurement errors. Our results not only advance the practical implementation of Kerr-cat qubits, but also provide valuable insights into the fundamental adiabatic dynamics of these systems. This work paves the way for scalable quantum processors that leverage the bias-preserving properties of Kerr-cat qubits.</description>

      <title>Wigner current in multidimensional quantum billiards</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.14164</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.14164v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the present paper we derive the Wigner current of the particle in a multidimensional billiard - the compact region of space in which the particle moves freely. The calculation is based on proposed by us previously method of imposing boundary conditions by convolution of the free particle Wigner function with some time independent function, defined by the shape of the billiard. This method allowed to greatly simplify the general expression for the Wigner current, representing its $\mathbf{p}$-component as a surface integral of the product of the shifted free particle wave functions (the inverse Fourier transform of the free particle Wigner function). The results are also connect to an alternative approach, which takes into account the boundary conditions by adding the $\propto \delta'(x)$ term to the Hamiltonian. The latter is also generalized to the multidimensional case.</description>

      <title>Single-photon scattering in giant-atom topological-waveguide-QED systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.14178</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.14178v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The giant-atom topological-waveguide-QED systems have recently emerged as a promising platform for manipulating light-matter interactions. The combination of the multiple-point couplings and topological phase effect could lead to rich physical phenomena and effects. Here, we study single-photon scattering in a Su-Schrieffer-Heeger (SSH) waveguide coupled to either one or two two-level giant atoms. We assume that each giant atom is coupled to the waveguide via two coupling points, and hence there exist four and sixteen coupling configurations for the single-giant-atom case and two-giant-atom separate coupling case, respectively. By solving the single-photon scattering problem in the real space, we obtain the exact expressions of the single-photon scattering amplitudes. It is found that a single photon in the SSH waveguide can be completely reflected or transmitted by choosing proper coupling configurations, coupling-point distances, atomic resonance frequency, and dimerization parameter. In addition, under proper parameter conditions, the scattering spectra are periodically modulated by the coupling-point distances. We also find that the collective behavior of the two giant atoms can be adjusted by quantum interference effect and topological effect, and that the single-photon scattering spectra can exhibit the Lorentzian, super-Gaussian, electromagnetically induced transparency-like, and asymmetric Fano line shapes for some coupling configurations. This work will inspire the development of controllable single-photon devices based on the giant-atom topological-waveguide-QED systems.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2408.14201v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In quantum networks multipath entanglement purification (MEP) between a pair of source-destination nodes can substantially strengthen their entanglement connection. An efficient MEP strategy can therefore increase the size of the network region where bipartite entanglement based quantum information processing tasks can be implemented. Here, we analyse MEP in a general model of a quantum network and obtain design criteria for efficient MEP strategies. Further, by simulating two different MEP strategies, based on these criteria, on different underlying network topologies we explore how the topology determines the effectiveness of a fixed MEP strategy. Finally, we show that a careful choice of MEP strategy can make the entanglement connection strength between source-destination network nodes effectively independent of its topology. Our results can therefore provide a useful guide for the design of quantum networks and entanglement distribution protocols.</description>

      <title>Quantifying Deviations from Shortest Geodesic Paths together with Waste of Energy Resources for Quantum Evolutions on the Bloch Sphere</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.14230</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.14230v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In optimal quantum-mechanical evolutions, motion can occur along non-predetermined paths of shortest length in an optimal time. Alternatively, optimal evolutions can happen along predefined paths with no waste of energy resources and 100% speed efficiency. Unfortunately, realistic physical scenarios typically result in less-than-ideal evolutions. In this paper, we study different families of sub-optimal qubit Hamiltonians, both stationary and time-varying, for which the so-called geodesic efficiency and the speed efficiency of the corresponding quantum evolutions are less than one. Furthermore, after proposing an alternative hybrid efficiency measure constructed out of the two previously mentioned efficiency quantifiers, we provide illustrative examples where the average departures from time-optimality and 100% speed efficiency are globally captured over a limited time period. In particular, thanks to this hybrid measure, quantum evolutions are partitioned in four categories: Geodesic unwasteful, nongeodesic unwasteful, geodesic wasteful and, lastly, nongeodesic wasteful. Finally, we discuss Hamiltonians specified by magnetic field configurations, both stationary and nonstationary, yielding optimal hybrid efficiency (that it, both time-optimality and 100% speed efficiency) over a finite time interval.</description>

      <title>Curvature of Quantum Evolutions for Qubits in Time-Dependent Magnetic Fields</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.14233</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.14233v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the geometry of quantum-mechanical processes, the time-varying curvature coefficient of a quantum evolution is specified by the magnitude squared of the covariant derivative of the tangent vector to the state vector. In particular, the curvature coefficient measures the bending of the quantum curve traced out by a parallel-transported pure quantum state that evolves in a unitary fashion under a nonstationary Hamiltonian that specifies the Schr\"odinger evolution equation. In this paper, we present an exact analytical expression of the curvature of a quantum evolution for a two-level quantum system immersed in a time-dependent magnetic field. Specifically, we study the dynamics generated by a two-parameter nonstationary Hermitian Hamiltonian with unit speed efficiency. The two parameters specify the constant temporal rates of change of the polar and azimuthal angles used in the Bloch sphere representation of the evolving pure state. To better grasp the physical significance of the curvature coefficient, showing that the quantum curve is nongeodesic since the geodesic efficiency of the quantum evolution is strictly less than one and tuning the two Hamiltonian parameters, we compare the temporal behavior of the curvature coefficient with that of the speed and the acceleration of the evolution in projective Hilbert space. Furthermore, we compare the temporal profile of the curvature coefficient with that of the square of the ratio between the parallel and transverse magnetic field intensities. Finally, we discuss the challenges in extending our geometric approach to higher-dimensional quantum systems that evolve unitarily under an arbitrary time-dependent Hermitian Hamiltonian.</description>

      <title>Complexity of Quantum-Mechanical Evolutions from Probability Amplitudes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.14241</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.14241v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the complexity of both time-optimal and time sub-optimal quantum Hamiltonian evolutions connecting arbitrary source and a target states on the Bloch sphere equipped with the Fubini-Study metric. This investigation is performed in a number of steps. First, we describe each unitary Schr\"odinger quantum evolution by means of the path length, the geodesic efficiency, the speed efficiency, and the curvature coefficient of its corresponding dynamical trajectory linking the source state to the target state. Second, starting from a classical probabilistic setting where the so-called information geometric complexity can be employed to describe the complexity of entropic motion on curved statistical manifolds underlying the physics of systems when only partial knowledge about them is available, we transition into a deterministic quantum setting. In this context, after proposing a definition of the complexity of a quantum evolution, we present a notion of quantum complexity length scale. In particular, we discuss the physical significance of both quantities in terms of the accessed (i.e., partial) and accessible (i.e., total) parametric volumes of the regions on the Bloch sphere that specify the quantum mechanical evolution from the source to the target states. Fourth, after calculating the complexity measure and the complexity length scale for each one of the two quantum evolutions, we compare the behavior of our measures with that of the path length, the geodesic efficiency, the speed efficiency, and the curvature coefficient. We find that, in general, efficient quantum evolutions are less complex than inefficient evolutions. However, we also observe that complexity is more than length. Indeed, longer paths that are sufficiently bent can exhibit a behavior that is less complex than that of shorter paths with a smaller curvature coefficient.</description>

      <title>Bosonic Quantum Error Correction with Neutral Atoms in Optical Dipole Traps</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.14251</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.14251v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Bosonic quantum error correction codes encode logical qubits in the Hilbert space of one or multiple harmonic oscillators. A prominent class of bosonic codes are Gottesman-Kitaev-Preskill (GKP) codes of which implementations have been demonstrated with trapped ions and microwave cavities. In this work, we investigate theoretically the preparation and error correction of a GKP qubit in a vibrational mode of a neutral atom stored in an optical dipole trap. This platform has recently shown remarkable progress in simultaneously controlling the motional and electronic degrees of freedom of trapped atoms. The protocols we develop make use of motional states and, additionally, internal electronic states of the trapped atom to serve as an ancilla qubit. We compare optical tweezer arrays and optical lattices and find that the latter provide more flexible control over the confinement in the out-of-plane direction, which can be utilized to optimize the conditions for the implementation of GKP codes. Concretely, the different frequency scales that the harmonic oscillators in the axial and radial lattice directions exhibit and a small oscillator anharmonicity prove to be beneficial for robust encodings of GKP states. Finally, we underpin the experimental feasibility of the proposed protocols by numerically simulating the preparation of GKP qubits in optical lattices with realistic parameters.</description>

      <title>Theoretical framework for quantum associative memories</title>

Abstract: Associative memory refers to the ability to relate a memory with an input and targets the restoration of corrupted patterns. It has been intensively studied in classical physical systems, as in neural networks where an attractor dynamics settles on stable solutions. Several extensions to the quantum domain have been recently reported, displaying different features. In this work, we develop a comprehensive framework for a quantum associative memory based on open quantum system dynamics, which allows us to compare existing models, identify the theoretical prerequisites for performing associative memory tasks, and extend it in different forms. The map that achieves an exponential increase in the number of stored patterns with respect to classical systems is derived. We establish the crucial role of symmetries and dissipation in the operation of quantum associative memory. Our theoretical analysis demonstrates the feasibility of addressing both quantum and classical patterns, orthogonal and non-orthogonal memories, stationary and metastable operating regimes, and measurement-based outputs. Finally, this opens up new avenues for practical applications in quantum computing and machine learning, such as quantum error correction or quantum memories.</description>

      <title>All-microwave readout, spectroscopy, and dynamic polarization of individual nuclear spins in a crystal</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.14282v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Pushing the sensitivity of nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy to the single spin level would have a major impact in chemistry and biology and is the goal of intense research efforts. Individual nuclear spins have been detected via their hyperfine coupling to an individual electronic paramagnetic system, itself measured by optical or electrical means. These methods are however only applicable when suitable optical transitions or electron-spin-to-charge conversion mechanisms exist, and a more universal method is currently lacking. Here, we report spectroscopic measurements of individual $^{183}\mathrm{W}$ nuclear spins in a CaWO$_4$ crystal via their hyperfine interaction with a neighboring $\mathrm{Er}^{3+}$ ion detected by microwave photon counting at millikelvin temperatures. We observe real-time quantum jumps of the nuclear spin state, a proof of their individual nature. We perform single-spin ELDOR-detected NMR spectroscopy by microwave driving the zero- and double-quantum transitions of the $^{183}$W--Er$^{3+}$ coupled system. By repeated driving of these transitions, we also achieve single-spin solid-effect dynamical nuclear polarization. Relying exclusively on microwave driving and microwave detection, the methods reported here apply in principle to any nuclear spin coupled to a paramagnetic impurity, and therefore open the way to single-nuclear-spin spectroscopy in a large class of samples.</description>

      <title>Non-Iterative Disentangled Unitary Coupled-Cluster based on Lie-algebraic structure</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.14289</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.14289v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Due to their non-iterative nature, fixed Unitary Coupled-Cluster (UCC) ans\"atze are attractive for performing quantum chemistry Variational Quantum Eigensolver (VQE) computations as they avoid pre-circuit measurements on a quantum computer. However, achieving chemical accuracy for strongly correlated systems with UCC requires further inclusion of higher-order fermionic excitations beyond triples increasing circuit depth. We introduce $k$-NI-DUCC, a fixed and Non-iterative Disentangled Unitary Coupled-Cluster compact ansatz, based on specific $"k"$ sets of "qubit" excitations, eliminating the needs for fermionic-type excitations. These elements scale linearly ($\mathcal{O}(n)$) by leveraging Lie algebraic structures, with $n$ being the number of qubits. The key excitations are screened through specific selection criteria, including the enforcement of all symmetries, to ensure the construction of a robust set of generators. NI-DUCC employs $"k"$ products of the exponential of $\mathcal{O}(n)$- anti-Hermitian Pauli operators, where each operator has a length $p$. This results in a fewer two-qubit CNOT gates circuit, $\mathcal{O}(knp)$, suitable for hardware implementations. Tested on LiH, H$_6$ and BeH$_2$, NI-DUCC-VQE achieves both chemical accuracy and rapid convergence even for molecules deviating significantly from equilibrium. It is hardware-efficient, reaching the exact Full Configuration Interaction energy solution at specific layers, while reducing significantly the VQE optimization steps. While NI-DUCC-VQE effectively addresses the gradient measurement bottleneck of ADAPT-VQE-like iterative algorithms, the classical computational cost of constructing the $\mathcal{O}(n)$ set of excitations increases exponentially with the number of qubits. We provide a first implementation for constructing the generators' set able to handle up to 20 qubits and discuss the efficiency perspectives.</description>

      <title>Blueprint for NV center ensemble based magnetometer: precise diamond sensor material characterization</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.14318v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The nitrogen-vacancy (NV) center in diamond is a promising candidate for various quantum applications, such as quantum sensing. High sensitivity in NV-based magnetic sensing requires a diamond sample with a high density of NV centers and a long electron spin dephasing time. In this work, we propose a systematic measurement method for determining the electron spin dephasing time of NV center ensembles and analyze the contributions to the dephasing time from various sources, including NV-NV interactions, strain distribution, $^{13}C$ nuclear spin, and P1 electron spin. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our method on a series of high-performance diamond samples and provide a comprehensive understanding of dephasing sources, enabling the optimization of NV-based quantum sensing applications.</description>

      <title>True and apparent motion of gravitational-wave detector test masses</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.14341</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.14341v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Modern optomechanical systems employ increasingly sophisticated quantum-mechanical states of light to probe and manipulate mechanical motion. Squeezed states are now used routinely to enhance the sensitivity of gravitational-wave interferometers to small external forces, and they are also used in feedback-based trapping and damping experiments on the same interferometers to enhance the achievable cooling of the the phonon occupation number of the differential test mass mode (arXiv:2102.12665). In this latter context, an accurate accounting of the true test mass motion, incorporating all sources of loss, the effect of feedback control, and the influence of classical force and sensing noises, is paramount. We work within the two-photon formalism to provide such an accounting, which extends a physically motivated decomposition of the quantum-mechanical noise of the light field (arxiv:2105.12052). This decomposition provides insight, rooted in experimentally accessible parameters, into the optimal squeezed state that should be employed to achieve the lowest occupation number. We apply this formalism to current and possible future gravitational-wave interferometers, LIGO A+, LIGO Voyager, Cosmic Explorer (CE), and CE Voyager, finding that occupation numbers below 1 are possible over a frequency range comparable to the bandwidth of the trapped and cooled oscillator. We also discuss several technical issues in cooling experiments with gravitational-wave detectors.</description>

      <title>A Single-Ion Information Engine for Charging Quantum Battery</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.14373</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.14373v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Information engines produce mechanical work through measurement and adaptive control. For information engines, the principal challenge lies in how to store the generated work for subsequent utilization. Here, we report an experimental demonstration where quantized mechanical motion serves as a quantum battery and gets charged in repeated cycles by a single trapped-ion information engine. This is enabled by a key technological advancement in rapid state discrimination, allowing us to suppress measurement-induced disturbances. Consequently, we were able to obtain a charging efficiency over 50\% of the theoretical limit at the optimal temperature. The experimental results substantiate that this approach can render trapped ions a promising platform for microscopic information engines with potential applications in the future upon scaling up.</description>

      <title>Exponentially Reduced Circuit Depths Using Trotter Error Mitigation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.14385</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.14385v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Product formulae are a popular class of digital quantum simulation algorithms due to their conceptual simplicity, low overhead, and performance which often exceeds theoretical expectations. Recently, Richardson extrapolation and polynomial interpolation have been proposed to mitigate the Trotter error incurred by use of these formulae. This work provides an improved, rigorous analysis of these techniques for the task of calculating time-evolved expectation values. We demonstrate that, to achieve error $\epsilon$ in a simulation of time $T$ using a $p^\text{th}$-order product formula with extrapolation, circuits depths of $O\left(T^{1+1/p} \textrm{polylog}(1/\epsilon)\right)$ are sufficient -- an exponential improvement in the precision over product formulae alone. Furthermore, we achieve commutator scaling, improve the complexity with $T$, and do not require fractional implementations of Trotter steps. Our results provide a more accurate characterisation of the algorithmic error mitigation techniques currently proposed to reduce Trotter error.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2408.14439v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We show how to entangle the motion of optically levitated nanoparticles in distant optical tweezers. The scheme consists in coupling the inelastically scattered light of each particle into transmission lines and directing it towards the other particle. The interference between this light and the background field introduces an effective coupling between the two particles while simultaneously reducing the effect of recoil heating. We analyze the system dynamics, showing that both transient and conditional entanglement between remote particles can be achieved under realistic experimental conditions.</description>

      <title>Unitary Designs from Random Symmetric Quantum Circuits</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.14463</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.14463v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, we study distributions of unitaries generated by random quantum circuits that contain only gates respecting a symmetry. We develop a unified approach applicable to all symmetry groups and obtain an equation that determines the exact design properties of such distributions. It has been recently shown that the locality of gates imposes various constraints on the set of realizable unitaries, which in general, significantly depend on the symmetry under consideration. Generically, such constraints include restrictions on the relative phases between sectors with inequivalent irreducible representations of the symmetry. We call a set of symmetric gates semi-universal if they realize all unitaries that respect the symmetry, up to such restrictions. For instance, while in the case of Z_2, U(1), and SU(2) symmetries, 2-qubit gates are semi-universal on qubit systems, in the case of SU(d) symmetry with d\ge 3, semi-universality can be achieved only with 3-qudit gates. The failure of semi-universality implies that the distribution generated by the circuit is not even a 2-design for the Haar (uniform) distribution over the group of all unitaries respecting the symmetry. On the other hand, when semi-universality holds, under mild conditions on the gate set, which hold, e.g., in the case of U(1) and SU(2), the distribution of unitaries generated by the random circuit becomes a t-design for t growing polynomially with the number of qudits with a degree that is determined by the locality of gates. More generally, we present a simple linear equation that determines the maximum value of the integer t, for which the uniform distribution of unitaries generated by the circuits is a t-design, and solve this equation for various examples.</description>

Abstract: We propose that moments of time arise through the failed emergence of the temporal diffeomorphism as gauge symmetry, and that the passage of time is a continual process of an instantaneous state collapsing toward a gauge-invariant state. Unitarity and directedness of the resulting time evolution are demonstrated for a minisuperspace model of cosmology.</description>

      <title>Displacement Current in Classical and Quantum Systems</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.13268v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: It is certain that electrical properties-whether slow (sec) or fast (nsec), even optical (fsec)-are described by Maxwell's equations, and there are terms that depend on the rate of change of the electric and magnetic fields. In particular, Maxwell's equation for the curl of the magnetic field contains both the steady current and a term depending upon the temporal derivative of the electric displacement field. The latter is referred to as displacement current, and is generally believed to have been included originally by Maxwell himself, although there is evidence it was earlier considered by Kirchhoff. Maxwell's equations and Kirchoff's circuit laws both are important over the wide range of frequencies with which electronics traditionally deals. And, displacement current is an important contribution to these in both classical and quantum mechanics. Here, the development of displacement current, its importance in both classical and quantum mechanics, and some applications are provided to illustrate the fundamental role that it plays in the dynamics of a wide range of systems.</description>

      <title>Phonon-assisted Casimir interactions between piezoelectric materials</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.13368v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The strong coupling between electromagnetic field and lattice oscillation in piezoelectric materials gives rise to phonon polariton excitations. Such quasiparticles open up new directions in modulating the ubiquitous Casimir force. Here by utilizing the generalized Born-Huang hydrodynamics model, three types of phonons in piezoelectrics are studied: longitudinal optical phonon, transverse optical phonon and phonon polariton. The phonon-electromagnetic coupling results in a complex set of Fresnel reflection matrices which prevents the utilization of the standard Lifshitz approach for calculating Casimir forces in the imaginary frequency domain. Our calculations are based on an approach within real frequency and finite temperatures, through which various regimes of the Casimir interaction are examined. Our study shows that piezoelectrics emerge as a set of materials where this ubiquitous force can be controlled via phonon properties for the first time. The Casimir interaction appears as a suitable means to distinguish between different types of surface phonon polaritons associated with different structural piezoelectric polytypes.</description>

      <title>Electromagnetically-Induced-Transparency Cooling with a Tripod Structure in a Hyperfine Trapped Ion with Mixed-Species Crystals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.13407</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.13407v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Cooling of atomic motion is a crucial tool for many branches of atomic physics, ranging from fundamental physics explorations to quantum information and sensing. For trapped ions, electromagnetically-induced-transparency (EIT) cooling has received attention for the relative speed, low laser power requirements, and broad cooling bandwidth of the technique. However, in applications where the ion used for cooling has hyperfine structure to enable long coherence times, it is difficult to find a closed three-level system in which to perform standard EIT cooling. Here, we demonstrate successful EIT cooling on 25Mg+ by the addition of an extra laser frequency; this method can be applied to any ion with non-zero nuclear spin. Furthermore, we demonstrate simultaneous EIT cooling of all axial modes in mixed-species crystals 9Be+ - 25Mg+ and 9Be+ - 25Mg+ - 9Be+ through the 25Mg+ ion.</description>

      <title>Quantum Emission from Coupled Spin Pairs in Hexagonal Boron Nitride</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.13515</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.13515v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Optically addressable defect qubits in wide band gap materials are favorable candidates for room temperature quantum information processing. The two dimensional (2D) hexagonal boron nitride (hBN) is an attractive solid state platform with a great potential for hosting bright quantum emitters with quantum memories with leveraging the potential of 2D materials for realizing scalable preparation of defect qubits. Although, room temperature bright defect qubits have been recently reported in hBN but their microscopic origin, the nature of the optical transition as well as the optically detected magnetic resonance (ODMR) have been remained elusive. Here we connect the photostability and spectral diffusion of quantum emitters to donor-acceptor pairs (DAP) in hBN by means of ab initio calculations. We find that DAPs can exhibit ODMR signal for the acceptor counterpart of the defect pair with S = 1/2 ground state at non-zero magnetic fields depending on the donor partner. The donor-acceptor pair model and its transition mechanisms provide a recipe towards defect qubit identification and performance optimization in hBN for quantum applications.</description>

      <title>Grover Adaptive Search for Maximum Likelihood Detection of Generalized Spatial Modulation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.13531</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.13531v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose a quantum-assisted solution for the maximum likelihood detection (MLD) of generalized spatial modulation (GSM) signals. Specifically, the MLD of GSM is first formulated as a novel polynomial optimization problem, followed by the application of a quantum algorithm, namely, the Grover adaptive search. The performance in terms of query complexity of the proposed method is evaluated and compared to the classical alternative via a numerical analysis, which reveals that under fault-tolerant quantum computation, the proposed method outperforms the classical solution if the number of data symbols and the constellation size are relatively large.</description>

      <title>The St\v{r}eda Formula for Floquet Systems: Topological Invariants and Quantized Anomalies from Ces\`aro Summation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.13576</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.13576v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This work introduces a general theoretical framework, which expresses the topological invariants of two-dimensional Floquet systems in terms of tractable response functions: Building on the Sambe representation of periodically-driven systems, and inspired by the St\v{r}eda formula for static systems, we evaluate the flow of the unbounded Floquet density of states in response to a magnetic perturbation. This Floquet-St\v{r}eda response, which is a priori mathematically ill-defined, is regularized by means of a Ces\`aro summation method. As a key outcome of this approach, we relate all relevant Floquet winding numbers to simple band properties of the Floquet-Bloch Hamiltonian. These general relations indicate how the topological characterization of Floquet systems can be entirely deduced from the stroboscopic time-evolution of the driven system. Importantly, we identify two physically distinguishable contributions to the Floquet-St\v{r}eda response: a quantized flow of charge between the edge and the bulk of the system, and an 'anomalous' quantized flow of energy between the system and the driving field, which provides new insight on the physical origin of the anomalous edge states. As byproducts, our theory provides: a general relation between Floquet winding numbers and the orbital magnetization of Floquet-Bloch bands; a local marker for Floquet winding numbers, which allows to access Floquet topology in inhomogeneous samples; an experimental protocol to extract these Floquet winding numbers from density-measurements in the presence of an engineered bath; as well as general expressions for these topological invariants in terms of the magnetic response of the Floquet density of states, opening a route for the topological characterization of interacting Floquet systems.</description>

      <title>Full- and low-rank exponential Euler integrators for the Lindblad equation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.13601</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.13601v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Lindblad equation is a widely used quantum master equation to model the dynamical evolution of open quantum systems whose states are described by density matrices. These solution matrices are characterized by semi-positiveness and trace preserving properties, which must be guaranteed in any physically meaningful numerical simulation. In this paper, novel full- and low-rank exponential Euler integrators are developed for approximating the Lindblad equation that preserve positivity and trace unconditionally. Theoretical results are presented that provide sharp error estimates for the two classes of exponential integration methods. Results of numerical experiments are discussed that illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed schemes, beyond present state-of-the-art capabilities.</description>

      <title>Unusual energy spectra of matrix product states</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.13616</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.13616v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In the simulation of ground states of strongly-correlated quantum systems, the decomposition of an approximate solution into the exact eigenstates of the Hamiltonian -- the energy spectrum of the state -- determines crucial aspects of the simulation's performance. For example, in approaches based on imaginary-time evolution, the spectrum falls off exponentially with the energy, ensuring rapid convergence. Here we consider the energy spectra of approximate matrix product state ground states, such as those obtained with the density matrix renormalization group. Despite the high accuracy of these states, contributions to the spectra are roughly constant out to surprisingly high energy, with an increase in bond dimension reducing the amplitude but not the extent of these high-energy tails. The unusual spectra, which appear to be a general feature of compressed wavefunctions, have a strong effect on sampling-based methods, yielding large fluctuations. For example, estimating the energy variance using sampling performs much more poorly than one might expect. Bounding the most extreme samples makes the variance estimate much less noisy but introduces a strong bias. However, we find that this biased variance estimator is an excellent surrogate for the variance when extrapolating the ground-state energy, and this approach outperforms competing extrapolation methods in both accuracy and computational cost.</description>

      <title>Relationship between spinons and magnetic fields in a fractionalized state</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.13665</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.13665v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The 4d-electron trimer lattice Ba4Nb1-xRu3+xO12 is believed to feature a universal heavy spinon Fermi surface that underpins both a quantum spin liquid (QSL) and an adjacent heavy-fermion strange metal (HFSM), depending on Nb content; the itinerant spinons as heat carriers render the charge-insulating QSL a much better thermal conductor than the HFSM [1]. Here we report that application of a magnetic field up to 14 T surprisingly breaks the signature temperature-linearity of the heat capacity of both phases below 150 mK, inducing a rapid rise in the heat capacity by as much as 5000%, whereas the AC magnetic susceptibility and the electrical resistivity show little response up to 14 T in the same milli-Kelvin temperature range. Furthermore, the magnetic field readily suppresses the thermal conductivity, and more strongly with decreasing temperature below 4 K by up to 40%. All these complex thermal phenomena indicate a powerful simplifying principle: Application of a magnetic field adversely weakens the itineracy of spinons and eventually destroys it with decreasing temperature, leading to an unprecedented quantum state featuring the astonishing rise in the heat capacity, thus entropy in the most unlikely circumstances of milli-Kelvin temperatures and strong magnetic fields. We present and discuss possible explanations.</description>

      <title>The origins of noise in the Zeeman splitting of spin qubits in natural-silicon devices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.13707</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.13707v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We measure and analyze noise-induced energy-fluctuations of spin qubits defined in quantum dots made of isotopically natural silicon. Combining Ramsey, time-correlation of single-shot measurements, and CPMG experiments, we cover the qubit noise power spectrum over a frequency range of nine orders of magnitude without any gaps. We find that the low-frequency noise spectrum is similar across three different devices suggesting that it is dominated by the hyperfine coupling to nuclei. The effects of charge noise are smaller, but not negligible, and are device dependent as confirmed from the noise cross-correlations. We also observe differences to spectra reported in GaAs {[Phys. Rev. Lett. 118, 177702 (2017), Phys. Rev. Lett. 101, 236803 (2008)]}, which we attribute to the presence of the valley degree of freedom in silicon. Finally, we observe $T_2^*$ to increase upon increasing the external magnetic field, which we speculate is due to the increasing field-gradient of the micromagnet suppressing nuclear spin diffusion.</description>

      <title>Tunneling in a Lorenz-like model for an active wave-particle entity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.13761</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.13761v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Active wave-particle entities (WPEs) emerge as self-propelled oil droplets on the free surface of a vibrating oil bath. The particle (droplet) periodically imprints decaying waves on the liquid surface which in turn guide the particle motion, resulting in a two-way coupling between the particle and its self-generated waves. Such WPEs have been shown to exhibit hydrodynamic analogs of various quantum features. In this work, we theoretically and numerically explore a dynamical analog of tunneling by considering the setup of a one-dimensional WPE incident on an isolated Gaussian potential barrier. Our idealized model takes the form of a perturbed Lorenz system which we use to explore the dynamics and statistics of barrier crossing as a function of initial conditions and system parameters. Our work highlights that velocity fluctuations of the WPE at high memories that are rooted in non-equilibrium features of the Lorenz system, such as spiraling motion towards equilibrium points and transient chaos, give rise to - (i) sensitivity and unpredictability in barrier crossing, (ii) smooth variations in transmission probability as a function of system parameters, and (iii) wave-like features in the transmitted and reflected probability density profiles.</description>

      <title>Phonon-induced modification of polaritonic Rabi oscillations in the presence of the dark excitonic condensate</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.13882v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Optically inactive (dark) excitons are characterized by relatively long life time, and therefore are desirable candidates for realizing collective excitonic phases. However, a detection of their coherence by light is problematic. Here we propose a method for detecting a dark excitonic condensate. It relies on the interaction between excitons and phonons responsible for the interconversion between bright and dark excitons. As long as the dark condensate forms, the Rabi oscillations between photons and bright excitons can become strongly modified. The analysis is conducted in the limit of weak interaction, and the perspective for the case of the strong interaction leading to the polaronic effect is discussed.</description>

      <title>Measuring Chern-Simons level $k$ by braiding $SU(2)_k$ anyons</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.14188v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Chern-Simons theory in application to the quantum computing is actively developing at the present. However, most discussed are the questions of using materials with known parameters and building corresponding quantum gates and algorithms. In this paper we discuss opposite problem of finding Chern-Simons level $k$ in the unknown material. For this purpose, we use the previously derived braiding rules for Chern-Simons $SU(2)_k$ anyons. Using certain operations (turnarounds) on three anyons, one can measure probabilities of annihilation of pairs of anyons, which depend on the parameter of the theory. Therefore, Chern-Simons level $k$ can be found from such an experiment. It is implied that anyons additionally possess certain properties which are required for topological quantum computations.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2408.14221v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A fundamental paradigm in neuroscience is that cognitive functions -- such as perception, learning, memory, and locomotion -- are governed by the brain's structural organization. Yet, the theoretical principles explaining how the physical architecture of the nervous system shapes its function remain elusive. Here, we combine concepts from quantum statistical mechanics and graph C*-algebras to introduce a theoretical framework where functional states of a structural connectome emerge as thermal equilibrium states of the underlying directed network. These equilibrium states, defined from the Kubo-Martin-Schwinger states formalism (KMS states), quantify the relative contribution of each neuron to the information flow within the connectome. Using the prototypical connectome of the nematode {\em Caenorhabditis elegans}, we provide a comprehensive description of these KMS states, explore their functional implications, and establish the predicted functional network based on the nervous system's anatomical connectivity. Ultimately, we present a model for identifying the potential functional states of a detailed structural connectome and for conceptualizing the structure-function relationship.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2408.14391v2 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Gravity is derived from an entropic action coupling matter fields with geometry. The fundamental idea is to relate the metric of Lorentzian spacetime to a density matrix. The matter fields curve spacetime, defining a metric induced by the matter fields. The entropic action is the quantum relative entropy between the metric of spacetime and the metric induced by the matter fields. The modified Einstein equations obtained reduce to the Einstein equations in the regime of low coupling. To simplify the theory, exclusively scalar matter fields are considered. This theoretical framework can be extended in different directions, for instance by including fermionic matter fields and gauge fields. A canonical quantization of this field theory could bring new insights into quantum gravity.</description>

Abstract: The magnetic properties of hole quantum dots in Ge are sensitive to their shape due to the interplay between strong spin-orbit coupling and confinement. We show that the split-off band, surrounding SiGe layers, and hole-hole interactions have a strong influence on calculations of the effective $g$ factor of a lithographic quantum dot in a Ge/SiGe heterostructure. Comparing predictions from a model including these effects to raw magnetospectroscopy data, we apply maximum-likelihood estimation to infer the shape of a quantum dot with up to four holes. We expect that methods like this will be useful in assessing qubit-to-qubit variability critical to further scaling quantum computing technologies based on spins in semiconductors.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2408.14428v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the effects of integrability breaking on the relaxation dynamics of the (double) sine-Gordon model. Compared to previous studies, we apply an alternative viewpoint motivated by open-system physics by separating the phase field into homogeneous and inhomogeneous parts, describing a quantum pendulum (subsystem) and an interacting phononic bath (environment). To study the relaxation dynamics in the model, we perform quantum quenches using the mini-superspace-based truncated Hamiltonian approach developed recently and simulate the real-time evolution of various entanglement measures and the energy transfer between the subsystem and its environment. Our findings demonstrate that in the presence of integrability-breaking perturbations, the relaxation dynamics is substantially faster, signalled by the increase of entanglement and energy transfer between the quantum pendulum and the phonon bath.</description>

      <title>Thermodynamics and criticality of supersymmetric spin chains of Haldane-Shastry type</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.14444</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.14444v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We analyze the thermodynamics and criticality properties of four families of su$(m|n)$ supersymmetric spin chains of Haldane-Shastry (HS) type, related to both the $A_{N-1}$ and the $BC_N$ classical root systems. Using a known formula expressing the thermodynamic free energy per spin of these models in terms of the Perron (largest in modulus) eigenvalue of a suitable inhomogeneous transfer matrix, we prove a general result relating the su$(kp|kq)$ free energy with arbitrary $k=1,2,\dots$ to the su$(p|q)$ free energy. In this way we are able to evaluate the thermodynamic free energy per spin of several infinite families of supersymmetric HS-type chains, and study their thermodynamics. In particular, we show that in all cases the specific heat at constant volume features a single marked Schottky peak, which in some cases can be heuristically explained by approximating the model with a suitable multi-level system with equally spaced energies. We also study the critical behavior of the models under consideration, showing that the low-temperature behavior of their thermodynamic free energy per spin is the same as that of a $(1+1)$-dimensional conformal field theory with central charge $c=m+n/2-1$. However, using a motif-based description of the spectrum we prove that only the three families of su$(1|n)$ chains of type $A_{N-1}$ and the su$(m|n)$ HS chain of $BC_N$ type with $m=1,2,3$ (when the sign $\varepsilon_B$ in the Hamiltonian takes the value $-1$ in the latter case) are truly critical.</description>

      <title>Collective behavior in quantum interference: an alternative superposition principle</title>

Abstract: An interferometer in which all of its components are treated as quantum bodies is examined with the standard interpretation and with a model in which its uncoupled spatially separated components act collectively. These models utilize superposition principles that differ when applied to systems composed of three or more bodies. Interferometric disparities between them involving frequency shifts and recoil are shown to be difficult to measure. More pronounced discrepancies involve correlated interference. The collective model is shown to provide a missing connection between quantum and semiclassical theories. Scattering from an entangled state, which cannot be divided into disjoint parts, is discussed in relation to collective recoil. Collective scattering is shown to be a viable alternative to the standard model, thereby providing insight into constructing tests of the superposition principle in systems with three or more bodies.</description>

      <title>Operational Quantum Reference Frame Transformations</title>

Abstract: Quantum reference frames are needed in quantum theory for much the same reasons that reference frames are in classical theories: to manifest invariance in line with fundamental relativity principles and to provide a basis for the definition of observable quantities. Though around since the 1960s, and used in a wide range of applications, only recently has the means for transforming descriptions between different quantum reference frames been tackled in detail. In this work, we provide a general, operationally motivated framework for quantum reference frames and their transformations, holding for locally compact groups. The work is built around the notion of operational equivalence, in which quantum states that cannot be physically distinguished are identified. For example, we describe the collection of relative observables as a subspace of the algebra of invariants on the composite of system and frame, and from here the set of relative states is constructed through the identification of states which cannot be distinguished by relative observables. Through the notion of framed observables -- the formation of joint observables of system and frame -- of which the relative observables can be understood as examples, quantum reference frame transformations are then maps between equivalence classes of relative states which respect the framing. We give an explicit realisation in the setting that the initial frame admits a highly localized state with respect to the frame observable. The transformations are invertible exactly when the final frame also has such a localizability property. The procedure we present is in operational agreement with other recent inequivalent constructions on the domain of common applicability, but extends them in a number of ways, and weakens claims of entanglement generation through frame changes.</description>

      <title>Phase diagram of the three-dimensional subsystem toric code</title>

      <description>arXiv:2305.06389v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Subsystem quantum error-correcting codes typically involve measuring a sequence of non-commuting parity check operators. They can sometimes exhibit greater fault-tolerance than conventional subspace codes, which use commuting checks. However, unlike subspace codes, it is unclear if subsystem codes -- in particular their advantages -- can be understood in terms of ground state properties of a physical Hamiltonian. In this paper, we address this question for the three-dimensional subsystem toric code (3D STC), as recently constructed by Kubica and Vasmer [Nat. Comm. 13, 6272(2022)], which exhibits single-shot error correction (SSEC). Motivated by a conjectured relation between SSEC and thermal stability, we study the zero and finite temperature phases of an associated non-commuting Hamiltonian. By mapping the Hamiltonian model to a pair of 3D Z_2 gauge theories coupled by a kinetic constraint, we find various phases at zero temperature, all separated by first-order transitions: there are 3D toric code-like phases with deconfined point-like excitations in the bulk, and there are phases with a confined bulk supporting a 2D toric code on the surface when appropriate boundary conditions are chosen. The latter is similar to the surface topological order present in 3D STC. However, the similarities between the SSEC in 3D STC and the confined phases are only partial: they share the same sets of degrees of freedom, but they are governed by different dynamical rules. Instead, we argue that the process of SSEC can more suitably be associated with a path (rather than a point) in the zero-temperature phase diagram, a perspective which inspires alternative measurement sequences enabling SSEC. Moreover, since none of the above-mentioned phases survives at nonzero temperature, SSEC of the code does not imply thermal stability of the associated Hamiltonian phase.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2306.07342v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present the Virtual Quantum Device (VQD) platform, a system based on the QuEST quantum emulator. Through the use of VQDs, non-expert users can emulate specific quantum computers with detailed error models, bespoke gate sets and connectivities. The platform boasts an intuitive interface, powerful visualisation, and compatibility with high-performance computation for effective testing and optimisation of complex quantum algorithms or ideas across a range of quantum computing hardware. We create and explore five families of VQDs corresponding to trapped ions, nitrogen-vacancy-centres, neutral atom arrays, silicon quantum dot spins, and superconducting devices. Each is highly configurable through a set of tailored parameters. We showcase the key characteristics of each virtual device, providing practical examples of the tool's usefulness and highlighting each device's specific attributes. By offering user-friendly encapsulated descriptions of diverse quantum hardware, the VQD platform offers researchers the ability to rapidly explore algorithms and protocols in a realistic setting; meanwhile hardware experts can create their own VQDs to compare with their experiments.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2306.12343v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Smooth Csisz\'ar $f$-divergences can be expressed as integrals over so-called hockey stick divergences. This motivates a natural quantum generalization in terms of quantum Hockey stick divergences, which we explore here. Using this recipe, the Kullback-Leibler divergence generalises to the Umegaki relative entropy, in the integral form recently found by Frenkel. We find that the R\'enyi divergences defined via our new quantum $f$-divergences are not additive in general, but that their regularisations surprisingly yield the Petz R\'enyi divergence for $\alpha &lt; 1$ and the sandwiched R\'enyi divergence for $\alpha &gt; 1$, unifying these two important families of quantum R\'enyi divergences. Moreover, we find that the contraction coefficients for the new quantum $f$ divergences collapse for all $f$ that are operator convex, mimicking the classical behaviour and resolving some long-standing conjectures by Lesniewski and Ruskai. We derive various inequalities, including new reverse Pinsker inequalities with applications in differential privacy and explore various other applications of the new divergences.</description>

      <title>Moyal deformation of the classical arrival time</title>

      <description>arXiv:2309.00222v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The quantum time of arrival (TOA) problem requires the statistics of measured arrival times given only the initial state of a particle. Following the standard framework of quantum theory, the problem translates into finding an appropriate quantum image of the classical arrival time $\mathcal{T}_C(q,p)$, usually in operator form $\hat{\mathrm{T}}$. In this paper, we consider the problem anew within the phase space formulation of quantum mechanics. The resulting quantum image is a real-valued and time-reversal symmetric function $\mathcal{T}_M(q,p)$ in formal series of $\hbar^2$ with the classical arrival time as the leading term. It is obtained directly from the Moyal bracket relation with the system Hamiltonian and is hence interpreted as a Moyal deformation of the classical TOA. We investigate its properties and discuss how it bypasses the known obstructions to quantization by showing the isomorphism between $\mathcal{T}_M(q,p)$ and the rigged Hilbert space TOA operator constructed in [Eur. Phys. J. Plus \textbf{138}, 153 (2023)] which always satisfy the time-energy canonical commutation relation (TECCR) for arbitrary analytic potentials. We then examine TOA problems for a free particle and a quartic oscillator potential as examples.</description>

Abstract: Low-loss high-speed switches are an integral component of future photonic quantum technologies, with applications in state generation, multiplexing, and the implementation of quantum gates. Phase modulation is one method of achieving this switching, but existing optical phase modulators either achieve high bandwidth or low loss, but not both. We demonstrate fast ($100\,\mathrm{MHz}$ bandwidth), low-loss ($83\pm2\%$ transmission) phase shifting ($\Delta\phi = (0.90\pm0.05)\pi$) in a signal field, induced by a control field, and mediated by the two-photon $5S_{1/2} \rightarrow{} 5P_{3/2} \rightarrow{} 5D_{5/2}$ transition in $^{87}\text{Rb}$ vapour. We discuss routes to enhance both performance and scalability for application to a range of quantum and classical technologies.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2310.12838v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Self-testing is the task where spatially separated Alice and Bob cooperate to deduce the inner workings of untrusted quantum devices by interacting with them in a classical manner. We examine the task above where Alice and Bob do not trust each other which we call adversarial self-testing. We show that adversarial self-testing implies secure sampling -- a simpler task that we introduce where distrustful Alice and Bob wish to sample from a joint probability distribution with the guarantee that an honest party's marginal is not biased. By extending impossibility results in two-party quantum cryptography, we give a simple proof that both of these tasks are impossible in all but trivial settings.</description>

Abstract: We study the interplay between measurement-induced dynamics and conditional unitary evolution in quantum systems. We numerically and analytically investigate commuting random measurement and feedforward (MFF) processes, and find a sharp transition in their ability to generate entanglement negativity as the number of MFF channels varies. We also establish a direct connection between these findings and transitions induced by random dephasing from an environment with broken time-reversal symmetry. In one variant of the problem, we employ free probability theory to rigorously prove the transition's existence. Furthermore, these MFF processes have dynamic circuit representations that can be experimentally explored on current quantum computing platforms.</description>

      <title>Handbook for Efficiently Quantifying Robustness of Magic</title>

Abstract: The nonstabilizerness, or magic, is an essential quantum resource to perform universal quantum computation. Robustness of magic (RoM) in particular characterizes the degree of usefulness of a given quantum state for non-Clifford operation. While the mathematical formalism of RoM can be given in a concise manner, it is extremely challenging to determine the RoM in practice, since it involves superexponentially many pure stabilizer states. In this work, we present efficient novel algorithms to compute the RoM. The crucial technique is a subroutine that achieves the remarkable features in calculation of overlaps between pure stabilizer states: (i) the time complexity per each stabilizer is reduced exponentially, (ii) the space complexity is reduced superexponentially. Based on this subroutine, we present algorithms to compute the RoM for arbitrary states up to $n=7$ qubits on a laptop, while brute-force methods require a memory size of 86 TiB. As a byproduct, the proposed subroutine allows us to simulate the stabilizer fidelity up to $n=8$ qubits, for which naive methods require memory size of 86 PiB so that any state-of-the-art classical computer cannot execute the computation. We further propose novel algorithms that utilize the preknowledge on the structure of target quantum state such as the permutation symmetry of disentanglement, and numerically demonstrate our state-of-the-art results for copies of magic states and partially disentangled quantum states. The series of algorithms constitute a comprehensive ``handbook'' to scale up the computation of the RoM, and we envision that the proposed technique applies to the computation of other quantum resource measures as well.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2311.15580v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We demonstrate how motional degrees of freedom in optical tweezers can be used as quantum information carriers. To this end, we first implement a species-agnostic cooling mechanism via conversion of motional excitations into erasures -- errors with a known location -- reminiscent of Maxwell's demon thought experiment. We find that this cooling mechanism fundamentally outperforms idealized traditional sideband cooling, which we experimentally demonstrate in specific scenarios. By coherently manipulating the motional state, we perform mid-circuit readout and mid-circuit erasure detection via local shelving into motional superposition states. We finally entangle the motion of two atoms in separate tweezers, and utilize this to generate hyper-entanglement by preparing a simultaneous Bell state of motional and optical qubits. This work shows how controlling motion enriches the toolbox of quantum information processing with neutral atoms, and opens unique prospects for metrology enhanced by mid-circuit readout and a large class of quantum operations enabled via hyper-entanglement.</description>

      <title>Extracting topological orders of generalized Pauli stabilizer codes in two dimensions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2312.11170v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we introduce an algorithm for extracting topological data from translation invariant generalized Pauli stabilizer codes in two-dimensional systems, focusing on the analysis of anyon excitations and string operators. The algorithm applies to $\mathbb{Z}_d$ qudits, including instances where $d$ is a nonprime number. This capability allows the identification of topological orders that differ from the $\mathbb{Z}_d$ toric codes. It extends our understanding beyond the established theorem that Pauli stabilizer codes for $\mathbb{Z}_p$ qudits (with $p$ being a prime) are equivalent to finite copies of $\mathbb{Z}_p$ toric codes and trivial stabilizers. The algorithm is designed to determine all anyons and their string operators, enabling the computation of their fusion rules, topological spins, and braiding statistics. The method converts the identification of topological orders into computational tasks, including Gaussian elimination, the Hermite normal form, and the Smith normal form of truncated Laurent polynomials. Furthermore, the algorithm provides a systematic approach for studying quantum error-correcting codes. We apply it to various codes, such as self-dual CSS quantum codes modified from the 2d honeycomb color code and non-CSS quantum codes that contain the double semion topological order or the six-semion topological order.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2312.14087v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Generalized measurements, also called positive operator-valued measures (POVMs), can offer advantages over projective measurements in various quantum information tasks. Here, we realize a generalized measurement of one and two superconducting qubits with high fidelity and in a single experimental setting. To do so, we propose a hybrid method, the "Naimark-terminated binary tree," based on a hybridization of Naimark's dilation and binary tree techniques that leverages emerging hardware capabilities for mid-circuit measurements and feed-forward control. Furthermore, we showcase a highly effective use of approximate compiling to enhance POVM fidelity in noisy conditions. We argue that our hybrid method scales better toward larger system sizes than its constituent methods and demonstrate its advantage by performing detector tomography of symmetric, informationally complete POVM (SIC-POVM). Detector fidelity is further improved through a composite error mitigation strategy that incorporates twirling and a newly devised conditional readout error mitigation. Looking forward, we expect improvements in approximate compilation and hardware noise for dynamic circuits to enable generalized measurements of larger multi-qubit POVMs on superconducting qubits.</description>

      <title>Nonlocality enhanced precision in quantum polarimetry via entangled photons</title>

      <description>arXiv:2402.11932v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present a nonlocal quantum approach to polarimetry, leveraging the phenomenon of entanglement in photon pairs to enhance the precision in sample property determination. By employing two distinct channels, one containing the sample of interest and the other serving as a reference, we explore the conditions under which the inherent correlation between entangled photons can increase measurement sensitivity. Specifically, we calculate the quantum Fisher information (QFI) and compare the accuracy and sensitivity for the cases of single sample channel versus two channel quantum state tomography measurements. The theoretical results are verified by experimental analysis. Our theoretical and experimental framework demonstrates that the nonlocal strategy enables enhanced precision and accuracy in extracting information about sample characteristics more than the local measurements. Depending on the chosen estimators and noise channels present, theoretical and experimental results show that noise-induced bias decreases the precision for the estimated parameter. Such a quantum-enhanced nonlocal polarimetry holds promise for advancing diverse fields including material science, biomedical imaging, and remote sensing, via high-precision measurements through quantum entanglement.</description>

      <title>Progressive-Proximity Bit-Flipping for Decoding Surface Codes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.15924</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.15924v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Topological quantum codes, such as toric and surface codes, are excellent candidates for hardware implementation due to their robustness against errors and their local interactions between qubits. However, decoding these codes efficiently remains a challenge: existing decoders often fall short of meeting requirements such as having low computational complexity (ideally linear in the code's blocklength), low decoding latency, and low power consumption. In this paper we propose a novel bit-flipping (BF) decoder tailored for toric and surface codes. We introduce the proximity vector as a heuristic metric for flipping bits, and we develop a new subroutine for correcting degenerate multiple errors on adjacent qubits. Our algorithm has quadratic complexity growth and it can be efficiently implemented as it does not require operations on dynamic memories, as do state-of-art decoding algorithms such as minimum weight perfect matching or union find. The proposed decoder shows a decoding threshold of 7.5% for the 2D toric code and 7% for the rotated planar code over the binary symmetric channel.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2402.17831v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The transport of neutral atoms in Rydberg quantum computers is a crucial step of the initial arrangement of the grid as well as to the dynamic connectivity, recently successfully demonstrated. We study the application of optimal control and the quantum speed limit for the transport of neutral atoms in optical tweezers at finite temperatures and analyze how laser noise affects transport fidelity. Open-loop optimal control significantly enhances transport fidelity, achieving an improvement up to $89\%$ for the lowest analyzed temperature of $1\,\mu$K for a distance of three micrometers. Furthermore, we simulate how the transport fidelity behaves in release-and-capture measurements, which are realizable in the experiment to estimate transport efficiency and implement closed-loop optimal control.</description>

      <title>Wavepacket interference of two photons through a beam splitter: from temporal entanglement to wavepacket shaping</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.04432v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Quantum interferences based on beam splitting are widely used for entanglement. However, the quantitative measurement of the entanglement in terms of temporal modes and wavepacket shaping facilitated by this entanglement remain unexplored. Here we analytically study the interference of two photons with different temporal shapes through a beam splitter (BS), then propose its application in temporal entanglement and shaping of photons. The temporal entanglement described by Von Neumann entropy is determined by the splitting ratio of BS and temporal indistinguishability of input photons. We found that maximum mode entanglement can be achieved with a 50/50 BS configuration, enabling the generation of a Bell state encoded in temporal modes, independent of the exact form of the input photons. Then, detecting one of the entangled photons at a specific time enables the probabilistic shaping of the other photon. This process can shape the exponentially decaying (ED) wavepacket into the ED sine shapes, which can be further shaped into Gaussian shapes with fidelity exceeding 99\%. The temporal entanglement and shaping of photons based on interference may solve the shape mismatch issues in large-scale optical quantum networks.</description>

      <title>Multi-qubit Dynamical Decoupling for Enhanced Crosstalk Suppression</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.05391v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Dynamical decoupling (DD) is one of the simplest error suppression methods, aiming to enhance the coherence of qubits in open quantum systems. Moreover, DD has demonstrated effectiveness in reducing coherent crosstalk, one major error source in near-term quantum hardware, which manifests from two types of interactions. Static crosstalk exists in various hardware platforms, including superconductor and semiconductor qubits, by virtue of always-on qubit-qubit coupling. Additionally, driven crosstalk may occur as an unwanted drive term due to leakage from driven gates on other qubits. Here we explore a novel staggered DD protocol tailored for multi-qubit systems that suppresses the decoherence error and both types of coherent crosstalk. We develop two experimental setups -- an "idle-idle" experiment in which two pairs of qubits undergo free evolution simultaneously and a "driven-idle" experiment in which one pair is continuously driven during the free evolution of the other pair. These experiments are performed on an IBM Quantum superconducting processor and demonstrate the significant impact of the staggered DD protocol in suppressing both types of coherent crosstalk. When compared to the standard DD sequences from state-of-the-art methodologies with the application of X2 sequences, our staggered DD protocol enhances circuit fidelity by 19.7% and 8.5%, respectively, in addressing these two crosstalk types.</description>

      <title>Suppressing Correlated Noise in Quantum Computers via Context-Aware Compiling</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.06852v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Coherent errors, and especially those that occur in correlation among a set of qubits, are detrimental for large-scale quantum computing. Correlations in noise can occur as a result of spatial and temporal configurations of instructions executing on the quantum processor. In this paper, we perform a detailed experimental characterization of many of these error sources, and theoretically connect them to the physics of superconducting qubits and gate operations. Equipped with this knowledge, we devise compiler strategies to suppress these errors using dynamical decoupling or error compensation into the rest of the circuit. Importantly, these strategies are successful when the context at each layer of computation is taken into account: how qubits are connected, what crosstalk terms exist on the device, and what gates or idle periods occur in that layer. Our context-aware compiler thus suppresses some dominant sources of error, making further error mitigation or error correction substantially less expensive. For example, our experiments show an increase of 18.5\% in layer fidelity for a candidate 10-qubit circuit layer compared to context-unaware suppression. Owing to the exponential nature of error mitigation, these improvements due to error suppression translate to several orders of magnitude reduction of sampling overhead for a circuit consisting of a moderate number of layers.</description>

      <title>Geometric quantum discord of an arbitrary two-qudit state: the exact value and general upper bounds</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.09342v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The geometric quantum discord of a two-qudit state has been studied in many papers, however, its exact analytical value in the explicit form is known only for a general two-qubit state, a general qubit-qudit state and some special families of two-qudit states. Based on the general Bloch vectors formalism [J. Phys. A: Math. Theor. 54 195301 (2021)], we find the explicit exact analytical value of the geometric quantum discord for a general two-qudit state of an arbitrary dimension via the parameters of its correlation matrix and the Bloch vectors of its reduced states. This new general analytical result includes all the known exact results on the geometric quantum discord only as particular cases and proves rigorously that the lower bound on the geometric discord presented in [Phys. Rev. A 85, 024102 (2012)] constitutes its exact value for each two-qudit state. Moreover, our new general result allows us to find for an arbitrary two-qudit state, pure or mixed, the novel upper and lower bounds on its geometric quantum discord, expressed via the Hilbert space characteristics of this state.</description>

      <title>Non-Hermitian Fermi-Dirac Distribution in Persistent Current Transport</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.09569v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Persistent currents circulate continuously without requiring external power sources. Here, we extend their theory to include dissipation within the framework of non-Hermitian quantum Hamiltonians. Using Green's function formalism, we introduce a non-Hermitian Fermi-Dirac distribution and derive an analytical expression for the persistent current that relies solely on the complex spectrum. We apply our formula to two dissipative models supporting persistent currents: (i) a phase-biased superconducting-normal-superconducting junction; (ii) a normal ring threaded by a magnetic flux. We show that the persistent currents in both systems exhibit no anomalies at any emergent exceptional points, whose signatures are only discernible in the current susceptibility. We validate our findings by exact diagonalization and extend them to account for finite temperatures and interaction effects. Our formalism offers a general framework for computing quantum many-body observables of non-Hermitian systems in equilibrium, with potential extensions to non-equilibrium scenarios.</description>

      <title>Non-reciprocal dynamics and the non-Hermitian skin effect of repulsively bound pairs</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.10449v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the dynamics of a Bose-Hubbard model coupled to an engineered environment which in the non-interacting limit is described by the celebrated Hatano-Nelson model. At strong interactions, two bosons occupying the same site form a so-called repulsively bound pair, or doublon. Using tensor-network simulations, we clearly identify a distinct doublon lightcone and show that the doublon inherits non-reciprocity from that of single particles. Applying the idea of reservoir engineering at the level of doublons, we introduce a new set of dissipators and we analytically show that then the doublon dynamics are governed by the Hatano-Nelson model. This brings about an interaction-induced non-Hermitian skin effect and non-reciprocal doublon motion. Combining features of the two models we study, we show that single particles and doublons can be made to spread with opposite directionality, opening intriguing possibilities for the study of dynamics in interacting non-reciprocal models.</description>

      <title>A Novel Approach to Reduce Derivative Costs in Variational Quantum Algorithms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.02245</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.02245v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present a detailed numerical study of an alternative approach, named Quantum Non-Demolition Measurement (QNDM), to efficiently estimate the gradients or the Hessians of a quantum observable. This is a key step and a resource-demanding task when we want to minimize the cost function associated with a quantum observable. The statistical study of the error leads to further performance improvement with respect to the original proposal. In our detailed analysis, we account for all the resources needed to implement the QNDM approach with a fixed accuracy and compare them to the current state-of-the-art method. We find that the QNDM approach is more efficient, i.e. it needs fewer resources, in evaluating the derivatives of a cost function. These advantages are already clear in small dimensional systems and are likely to increase for practical implementations and more realistic situations. A significant outcome of our study is the implementation of the QNDM method in Python, provided in the supplementary material \cite{qndm_gradient}. Given that most Variational Quantum Algorithms can be formulated within this framework, our results can have significant implications in quantum optimization algorithms and make the QNDM approach a valuable alternative to implement Variational Quantum Algorithms on near-term quantum computers.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.05473v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This work presents an analysis of the evolution of perturbed Bell diagonal states using the equation of motion of steepest-entropy-ascent quantum thermodynamics (SEAQT), the Lindblad equation, and various measures of loss of entanglement. First, a brief derivation is presented showing that Bell diagonal states are stationary states that are not stable equilibrium states relative to the SEAQT equation of motion, highlighting the need for the development of perturbation methods to study the evolutions of nearby states. This contrasts with the Lindblad equation of motion for which only some of the Bell diagonal states are stationary. Next, two perturbation methods are presented. The first is a weighted-average method for perturbing bi-partite system states and the second is a general bi-partite method based on a set of unitary operations that are constrained to hold the system energy and system entropy constant. Sets of density operators are randomly generated with each method and the resulting time-varying characteristics of the system's entanglement are analyzed using the SEAQT and Lindblad frameworks. The findings reveal that the evolutions associated with the constrained perturbations accurately predict the loss of non-locality and align well with the measured concurrence. In addition, using the SEAQT framework, the deep connection between the thermodynamic states of the state evolution of the system and the loss of non-locality is quantitatively demonstrated.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.13563v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The preparation of mechanical quadrature-squeezed states holds significant importance in cavity optomechanics because the squeezed states have extensive applications in understanding fundamental quantum mechanics and exploiting modern quantum technology. Here, we propose a reliable scheme for generating mechanical quadrature squeezing in a typical cavity optomechanical system via seeking optimal cavity-field driving pulses using the gradient-descent algorithm. We realize strong quadrature squeezing in a mechanical resonator that exceeds the 3-dB steady-state limit, even with a thermal phonon occupancy of 100. Furthermore, the mechanical squeezing can be ultrarapidly created within one mechanical oscillation period. We also obtain the optimal pulsed drivings associated with the created mechanical squeezings and analyze the mechanism for mechanical squeezing generation. This paper will promote the application of optimal quantum control in quantum optics and quantum information science.</description>

      <title>Better Optimization of Variational Quantum Eigensolvers by Combining the Unitary Block Optimization Scheme with Classical Post-Processing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.19027</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.19027v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Variational Quantum Eigensolvers (VQE) are a promising approach for finding the classically intractable ground state of a Hamiltonian. The Unitary Block Optimization Scheme (UBOS) is a state-of-the-art VQE method which works by sweeping over gates and finding optimal parameters for each gate in the environment of other gates. UBOS improves the convergence time to the ground state by an order of magnitude over Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD). It nonetheless suffers in both rate of convergence and final converged energies in the face of highly noisy expectation values coming from shot noise. Here we develop two classical post-processing techniques which improve UBOS especially when measurements have large noise. Using Gaussian Process Regression (GPR), we generate artificial augmented data using original data from the quantum computer to reduce the overall error when solving for the improved parameters. Using Double Robust Optimization plus Rejection (DROPR), we prevent outlying data which are atypically noisy from resulting in a particularly erroneous single optimization step thereby increasing robustness against noisy measurements. Combining these techniques further reduces the final relative error that UBOS reaches by a factor of three without adding additional quantum measurement or sampling overhead. This work further demonstrates that developing techniques which use classical resources to post-process quantum measurement results can significantly improve VQE algorithms.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.00037v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Zero-noise extrapolation (ZNE) stands as the most widespread quantum error mitigation technique in order to aim the recovery of noise-free expectation values of observables of interest by means of Noisy Intermediate-Scale Quantum (NISQ) machines. Recently, Otten and Gray proposed a multidimensional generalization of polynomial ZNE for systems where there is not a tunable global noise source [Phys. Rev. A \textbf{99,} 012338 (2019)]. Specifically, the authors refer to multiqubit systems where each of the qubits experiences several noise processes with different rates, i.e. a non-identically distributed noise model. The authors proposed a hypersurface method for mitigating such noise, which is technically correct. While effective, the proposed method presents an unbearable experiment repetition overhead, making it impractical, at least from the perspective of quantum computing. In this comment, we show that the traditional extrapolation techniques can be applied for such non-identically distributed noise setting consisted of many different noise sources, implying that the measurement overhead is reduced considerably. For doing so, we clarify what it is meant by a tunable global noise source in the context of ZNE, concept that we consider important to be clarified for a correct understanding about how and why these methods work.</description>

Abstract: Most, if not all, photonic quantum computing (PQC) relies upon superconducting nanowire single-photon detectors (SNSPDs) based on niobium (Nb) operated at a temperature &lt; 4 K. This paper proposes and analyzes 300 K waveguide-integrated germanium-silicon (GeSi) single-photon avalanche diodes (SPADs) based on the recently demonstrated normal-incidence GeSi SPADs operated at room temperature, and shows that their performance is competitive against that of SNSPDs in a series of metrics for PQC with a reasonable time-gating window to resolve the issue of dark-count rate (DCR). These GeSi SPADs become photon-number-resolving avalanche diodes (PNRADs) by deploying a spatially-multiplexed M-fold-waveguide array of M GeSi SPADs. Using on-chip waveguided spontaneous four-wave mixing (SFWM) sources and waveguided field-programmable interferometer mesh (FPIM) circuits, together with the high-metric SPADs and PNRADs, high-performance quantum computing at room temperature is predicted for this PQC architecture.</description>

Abstract: A class of quantum resource theories, based on non-convex star-shape sets, presented in this work captures the key quantum properties that cannot be studied by standard convex theories. We provide operational interpretations for a resource of this class and demonstrate its advantage to improve performance of correlated quantum discrimination tasks and testing of quantum combs. Proposed techniques provide useful tools to describe quantum discord, total correlations in composite quantum systems and to estimate the degree of non-Markovianity of an analyzed quantum dynamics. Other applications include the problem of unistochasticity of a given bistochastic matrix, with relevance for quantization of classical dynamics and studies of violation of CP-symmetry in high energy physics. In all these cases, the non-linear witnesses introduced here outperform the standard linear witnesses. Importance of our findings for quantum information theory is also emphasized.</description>

      <title>Plaquette Models, Cellular Automata, and Measurement-induced Criticality</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.08286v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present a class of two-dimensional randomized plaquette models, where the multi-spin interaction term, referred to as the plaquette term, is replaced by a single-site spin term with a probability of $1-p$. By varying $p$, we observe a ground state phase transition, or equivalently, a phase transition of the symmetry operator. We find that as we vary $p$, the symmetry operator changes from being extensive to being localized in space. These models can be equivalently understood as 1+1D randomized cellular automaton dynamics, allowing the 2D transition to be interpreted as a 1+1D dynamical absorbing phase transition. In this paper, our primary focus is on the plaquette term with three or five-body interactions, where we explore the universality classes of the transitions. Specifically, for the model with five-body interaction, we demonstrate that it belongs to the same universality class as the measurement-induced entanglement phase transition observed in 1+1D Clifford dynamics, as well as the boundary entanglement transition of the 2D cluster state induced by random bulk Pauli measurements. This work establishes a connection between transitions in classical spin models, cellular automata, and hybrid random circuits.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.10685v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We propose a collision model to investigate the information dynamics of a system coupled to an environment with varying degrees of non-Markovianity. We control the degree of non-Markovianity by applying a depolarising channel to a fixed and rigid reservoir of qubits. We characterise the effect of the depolarising channel and apply the model to study the coherent transport of an excitation on a chain of three interacting qubits. We show how the system-environment coupling strength and the degree of non-Markovianity affect the process. Interestingly, in some cases a Markovian environment is preferable to enhance the coherent transport of the excitation.</description>

      <title>Simulating a Chern Insulator with C = $\pm$2 on Synthetic Floquet Lattice</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.11733v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The synthetic Floquet lattice, generated by multiple strong drives with mutually incommensurate frequencies, provides a powerful platform for the quantum simulation of topological phenomena. In this study, we propose a 4-band tight-binding model of the Chern insulator with a Chern number C = $\pm$2 by coupling two layers of the half-BHZ lattice and subsequently mapping it onto the Floquet lattice to simulate its topological properties. To determine the Chern number of our Floquet-version model, we extend the energy pumping method proposed by Martin et al. [Phys. Rev. X 7, 041008 (2017)] and the topological oscillation method introduced by Boyers et al. [Phys. Rev. Lett. 125, 160505 (2020)], followed by numerical simulations for both methodologies. The simulation results demonstrate the successful extraction of the Chern number using either of these methods, providing an excellent prediction of the phase diagram that closely aligns with the theoretical one derived from the original bilayer half-BHZ model. Finally, we briefly discuss a potential experimental implementation for our model. Our work demonstrates significant potential for simulating complex topological matter using quantum computing platforms, thereby paving the way for constructing a more universal simulator for non-interacting topological quantum states and advancing our understanding of these intriguing phenomena.</description>

      <title>Differential-phase-shift QKD with practical Mach-Zehnder interferometer</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.11760v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Differential-phase-shift (DPS) quantum key distribution stands as a promising protocol due to its simple implementation, which can be realized with a train of coherent pulses and a passive measurement unit. To implement the DPS protocol, it is crucial to establish security proofs incorporating practical imperfections in users' devices, however, existing security proofs make unrealistic assumptions on the measurement unit using a Mach-Zehnder interferometer. In this paper, we enhance the implementation security of the DPS protocol by incorporating a major imperfection in the measurement unit. Specifically, our proof enables us to use practical beam splitters with a known range of the transmittance rather than the one with exactly $50\%$, as was assumed in the existing security proofs. Our numerical simulations demonstrate that even with fluctuations of $\pm0.5\%$ in the transmittance from the ideal value, the key rate degrades only by a factor of 0.57. This result highlights the feasibility of the DPS protocol with practical measurement setups.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.08982v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The rapid evolution of artificial intelligence has driven interest in Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks for their effectiveness in processing sequential data. However, traditional LSTMs are limited by issues such as the vanishing gradient problem and high computational demands. Quantum computing offers a potential solution to these challenges, promising advancements in computational efficiency through the unique properties of qubits, such as superposition and entanglement. This paper presents a theoretical analysis and an implementation plan for a Quantum LSTM (qLSTM) model, which seeks to integrate quantum computing principles with traditional LSTM networks. While the proposed model aims to address the limitations of classical LSTMs, this study focuses primarily on the theoretical aspects and the implementation framework. The actual architecture and its practical effectiveness in enhancing sequential data processing remain to be developed and demonstrated in future work.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.13921v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate the sensing capacity of non-equilibrium dynamics in quantum systems exhibiting Bloch oscillations. By focusing on the resource efficiency of the probe, quantified by quantum Fisher information, we find different scaling behaviors in two different phases, namely localized and extended. Our results provide a quantitative ansatz for quantum Fisher information in terms of time, probe size, and the number of excitations. In the long-time regime, the quantum Fisher information is a quadratic function of time, touching the Heisenberg limit. The system size scaling drastically depends on the phase changing from super-Heisenberg scaling in the extended phase to size-independent behavior in the localized phase. Furthermore, increasing the number of excitations always enhances the precision of the probe, although, in the interacting systems the enhancement becomes less eminent than the non-interacting probes. This is due to the induced localization by increasing the interaction between the excitations.</description>

      <title>Covariant quantum field theory of tachyons is unphysical</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.14225v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Recently, Paczos et al. (Phys. Rev. D 110, 015006 (2024)) proposed a quantum field theory for free and interacting tachyon fields, which - unlike previous such attempts - is (claimed to be) covariant, have energy spectrum bounded from below, and Lorentz invariant (LI) vacuum. We show that the commutator of the proposed tachyon fields is not LI, and it violates microcausality except for tachyons moving with infinite speed. The proposed Feynman propagator (FP) is based on flawed analogy with QED and actually leads to unitarity violation. The actual FP, the two-point time-ordered correlation function, is neither LI nor a Green's function. Moreover, the potential for an interacting tachyon is shown to be unprotected from quantum corrections that generate tachyon self-interactions, which affects the stability of the tachyonic vacuum. Our analysis indicates that the proposed theory is not covariant, and that the tachyonic vacuum is likely unstable, indicating that superluminal observers are not physical. Therefore, the extended principle of relativity is void and cannot be used to derive nondeterministic description of Nature similar to quantum mechanics.</description>

Abstract: We study the estimation of relative entropy $D(\rho\|\sigma)$ when $\sigma$ is known. We show that the Cram\'{e}r-Rao type bound equals the relative varentropy. Our estimator attains the Cram\'{e}r-Rao type bound when the dimension $d$ is fixed. It also achieves the sample complexity $O(d^2)$ when the dimension $d$ increases. This sample complexity is optimal when $\sigma$ is the completely mixed state. Also, it has time complexity $O(d^6 \polylog d)$. Our proposed estimator unifiedly works under both settings.</description>

      <title>Hybrid Classical-Quantum Simulation of MaxCut using QAOA-in-QAOA</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.17383v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The Quantum approximate optimization algorithm (QAOA) is a leading hybrid classical-quantum algorithm for solving complex combinatorial optimization problems. QAOA-in-QAOA (QAOA^2) uses a divide-and-conquer heuristic to solve large-scale Maximum Cut (MaxCut) problems, where many subgraph problems can be solved in parallel. In this work, an implementation of the QAOA2 method for the scalable solution of the MaxCut problem is presented, based on the Classiq platform. The framework is executed on an HPE-Cray EX supercomputer by means of the Message Passing Interface (MPI) and the SLURM workload manager. The limits of the Goemans-Williamson (GW) algorithm as a purely classical alternative to QAOA are investigated to understand if QAOA^2 could benefit from solving certain sub-graphs classically. Results from large-scale simulations of up to 33 qubits are presented, showing the advantage of QAOA in certain cases and the efficiency of the implementation, as well as the adequacy of the workflow in the preparation of real quantum devices. For the considered graphs, the best choice for the sub-graphs does not significantly improve results and is still outperformed by GW.</description>

Abstract: We introduce a scheme to characterise a qudit T gate that has different noise than a set of Clifford gates. We developed our scheme through representation theory and ring theory to generalise non-Clifford interleaved benchmarking to qudit systems. By restricting to the qubit case, we recover the dihedral benchmarking scheme. Our characterisation scheme provides experimental physicists a practical method for characterising universal qudit gate sets and advances randomised benchmarking research by providing the characterisation of a complete qudit library.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2408.00935v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Multi-controlled (MC) unitary (U) gates are widely employed in quantum algorithms and circuits. Few state-of-the-art decompositions of MCU gates use non-elementary $C-R_x$ and $C-U^{1/2^{m-1}}$ gates resulting in a linear function for the depths of an implemented circuit on the number of these gates. Our approach is based on two generalizations of the multi-controlled X (MCX) gate that uses the quantum Fourier transform (QFT) comprised of Hadamard and controlled-phase gates. For the native gate set used in a genuine quantum computer, the decomposition of the controlled-phase gate is twice as less complex as $C-R_x$, which can result in an approximately double advantage of circuits derived from the QFT. The first generalization of QFT-MCX is based on altering the controlled gates acting on the target qubit. These gates are the most complex and are also used in the state-of-the-art circuits. The second generalization relies on the ZYZ decomposition and uses only one extended QFT-based circuit to implement the two multi-controlled X gates needed for the decomposition. Since the complexities of this circuit are approximately equal to the QFT-based MCX, our MCU implementation is more advanced than any known existing. The supremacy over the best-known optimized algorithm will be demonstrated by comparing transpiled circuits assembled for execution in a genuine quantum device. One may note that our implementations use approximately half the number of elementary gates compared to the most efficient one, potentially resulting in a smaller error. Additionally, we elaborated optimization steps to simplify the state-of-the-art linear-depth decomposition (LDD) MCU circuit to one of our implementations.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2408.01369v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Increasing the density of superconducting circuits requires compact components, however, superconductor-based capacitors typically perform worse as dimensions are reduced due to loss at surfaces and interfaces. Here, parallel plate capacitors composed of aluminum-contacted, crystalline silicon fins are shown to be a promising technology for use in superconducting circuits by evaluating the performance of lumped element resonators and transmon qubits. High aspect ratio Si-fin capacitors having widths below $300nm$ with an approximate total height of 3$\mu$m are fabricated using anisotropic wet etching of Si(110) substrates followed by aluminum metallization. The single-crystal Si capacitors are incorporated in lumped element resonators and transmons by shunting them with lithographically patterned aluminum inductors and conventional $Al/AlO_x/Al$ Josephson junctions respectively. Microwave characterization of these devices suggests state-of-the-art performance for superconducting parallel plate capacitors with low power internal quality factor of lumped element resonators greater than 500k and qubit $T_1$ times greater than 25$\mu$s. These results suggest that Si-Fins are a promising technology for applications that require low loss, compact, superconductor-based capacitors with minimal stray capacitance.</description>

      <title>Detecting Quantum and Classical Phase Transitions via Unsupervised Machine Learning of the Fisher Information Metric</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.03418v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The detection of quantum and classical phase transitions in the absence of an order parameter is possible using the Fisher information metric (FIM), also known as fidelity susceptibility. Here, we propose and investigate an unsupervised machine learning (ML) task: estimating the FIM given limited samples from a multivariate probability distribution of measurements made throughout the phase diagram. We utilize an unsupervised ML method called ClassiFIM (developed in a companion paper) to solve this task and demonstrate its empirical effectiveness in detecting both quantum and classical phase transitions using a variety of spin and fermionic models, for which we generate several publicly available datasets with accompanying ground-truth FIM. We find that ClassiFIM reliably detects both topological (e.g., XXZ chain) and dynamical (e.g., metal-insulator transition in Hubbard model) quantum phase transitions. We perform a detailed quantitative comparison with prior unsupervised ML methods for detecting quantum phase transitions. We demonstrate that ClassiFIM is competitive with these prior methods in terms of appropriate accuracy metrics while requiring significantly less resource-intensive training data compared to the original formulation of the prior methods. In particular, ClassiFIM only requires classical (single-basis) measurements. As part of our methodology development, we prove several theorems connecting the classical and quantum fidelity susceptibilities through equalities or bounds. We also significantly expand the existence conditions of the fidelity susceptibility, e.g., by relaxing standard differentiability conditions. These results may be of independent interest to the mathematical physics community.</description>

Abstract: High-rate quantum error correcting codes mitigate the imposing scale of fault-tolerant quantum computers but require the efficient generation of non-local many-body entanglement. We provide a linear-optical architecture with these properties, compatible with arbitrary codes and Gottesman-Kitaev-Preskill qubits on generic lattices, and featuring a natural way to leverage physical noise bias. Simulations involving hyperbolic surface codes, promising quantum low-density parity-check codes, reveal a threshold comparable to the 2D surface code at about a ten-fold improvement in encoding rate.</description>

      <title>Machine Learning Message-Passing for the Scalable Decoding of QLDPC Codes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.07038</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.07038v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present Astra, a novel and scalable decoder using graph neural networks. Our decoder works similarly to solving a Sudoku puzzle of constraints represented by the Tanner graph. In general, Quantum Low Density Parity Check (QLDPC) decoding is based on Belief Propagation (BP, a variant of message-passing) and requires time intensive post-processing methods such as Ordered Statistics Decoding (OSD). Without using any post-processing, Astra achieves higher thresholds and better logical error rates when compared to BP+OSD, both for surface codes trained up to distance 11 and Bivariate Bicycle (BB) codes trained up to distance 18. Moreover, we can successfully extrapolate the decoding functionality: we decode high distances (surface code up to distance 25 and BB code up to distance 34) by using decoders trained on lower distances. Astra+OSD is faster than BP+OSD. We show that with decreasing physical error rates, Astra+OSD makes progressively fewer calls to OSD when compared to BP+OSD, even in the context of extrapolated decoding. Astra(+OSD) achieves orders of magnitude lower logical error rates for BB codes compared to BP(+OSD). The source code is open-sourced at \url{https://github.com/arshpreetmaan/astra}.</description>

      <title>On the Constant Depth Implementation of Pauli Exponentials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.08265</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.08265v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We decompose for the first time, under the very restrictive linear nearest-neighbour connectivity, $Z\otimes Z \ldots \otimes Z$ exponentials of arbitrary length into circuits of constant depth using $\mathcal{O}(n)$ ancillae and two-body XX and ZZ interactions. Consequently, a similar method works for arbitrary Pauli exponentials. We prove the correctness of our approach, after introducing novel rewrite rules for circuits which benefit from qubit recycling. The decomposition has a wide variety of applications ranging from the efficient implementation of fault-tolerant lattice surgery computations, to expressing arbitrary stabilizer circuits via two-body interactions only, and to reducing the depth of NISQ computations, such as VQE.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2408.09088v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Shannon's perfect-secrecy theorem states that a perfect encryption system that yields zero information to the adversary must be a one-time pad (OTP) with the keys randomly generated and never reused. However, recently discovered exotic properties of quantum entanglement have motivated us to reconsider Shannon's theorem in the quantum regime. In this work we design a quantum encryption method that overcomes Shannon's theorem to achieve perfect secrecy with reusable keys. The mechanism used is fundamentally quantum, demonstrating subtle but critical differences in how information is processed in quantum versus classical systems.</description>

      <title>Quantum entanglement and non-Hermiticity in free-fermion systems</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.11652v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This topical review article reports rapid progress on the generalization and application of entanglement in non-Hermitian free-fermion quantum systems. We begin by examining the realization of non-Hermitian quantum systems through the Lindblad master equation, alongside a review of typical non-Hermitian free-fermion systems that exhibit unique features. A pedagogical discussion is provided on the relationship between entanglement quantities and the correlation matrix in Hermitian systems. Building on this foundation, we focus on how entanglement concepts are extended to non-Hermitian systems from their Hermitian free-fermion counterparts, with a review of the general properties that emerge. Finally, we highlight various concrete studies, demonstrating that entanglement entropy remains a powerful diagnostic tool for characterizing non-Hermitian physics. The entanglement spectrum also reflects the topological characteristics of non-Hermitian topological systems, while unique non-Hermitian entanglement behaviors are also discussed. The review is concluded with several future directions. Through this review, we hope to provide a useful guide for researchers who are interested in entanglement in non-Hermitian quantum systems.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2408.11666v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Single nitrogen vacancy (NV) centers in diamond have been used extensively for high-sensitivity nanoscale sensing, but conventional approaches use confocal microscopy to measure individual centers sequentially, limiting throughput and access to non-local physical properties. Here we design and implement a multiplexed NV sensing platform that allows us to read out many single NV centers simultaneously using a low-noise camera. Using this platform, we coherently manipulate and read out the spin states of hundreds of individual NV centers in parallel, achieving comparable magnetic field sensitivity to confocal measurements. We also implement a parallelized version of spin-to-charge-conversion readout for low NV center spin state readout noise and use it to demonstrate multiplexed covariance magnetometry, in which we measure six two-point magnetic field correlators from four NV centers simultaneously. The number of correlators we can measure is limited only by the available laser power, opening the door to massively multiplexed covariance magnetometry. Our platform significantly increases the throughput and broadens the applications of nanoscale sensing using diamond quantum sensors.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2204.01780v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Unifying quantum theory and gravity remains a fundamental challenge in physics. While most existing literature focuses on the ultraviolet (UV) modifications of quantum theory due to gravity, this work shows that generic infrared (IR) modifications arise when we describe quantum theory in curved spacetime. We explicitly demonstrate that the modifications to the position-momentum algebra are proportional to curvature invariants (such as the Ricci scalar and Kretschmann scalar). Our results, derived through a rigorous application of Dirac's quantization procedure, demonstrate that infrared effects in quantum systems can be axiomatically derived. We study particle dynamics in an arbitrary curved spacetime by embedding them in a higher-dimensional flat geometry. Our approach, which involves embedding particle dynamics in a higher-dimensional flat geometry and utilizing Dirac's quantization procedure, allows us to capture the dynamics of a particle in 4-dimensional curved spacetime through a modified position-momentum algebra. When applied to various spacetimes, this method reveals that the corrections due to the spacetime curvature are universal. We further compare our results with those derived using extended uncertainty principles. Finally, we discuss the implications of our work for black holes and entanglement.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2305.11448v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Both acoustics and electromagnetism represent measurable fields in terms of dynamical potential fields. Electromagnetic force-fields form a spacetime bivector that is represented by a dynamical energy-momentum 4-vector potential field. Acoustic pressure and velocity fields form an energy-momentum density 4-vector field that is represented by a dynamical action scalar potential field. Surprisingly, standard field theory analyses of spin angular momentum based on these traditional potential representations contradict recent experiments, which motivates a careful reassessment of both theories. We analyze extensions of both theories that use the full geometric structure of spacetime to respect essential symmetries enforced by vacuum wave propagation. The resulting extensions are geometrically complete and phase-invariant (i.e., dual-symmetric) formulations that span all five grades of spacetime, with dynamical potentials and measurable fields spanning complementary grades that are related by a spacetime vector derivative (i.e., the quantum Dirac operator). These complete representations correct the equations of motion, energy-momentum tensors, forces experienced by probes, Lagrangian densities, and allowed gauge freedoms, while making manifest the deep structural connections to relativistic quantum field theories. Finally, we discuss the implications of these corrections to experimental tests.</description>

      <title>Towards the "puzzle" of Chromium dimer Cr$_2$: predicting the Born-Oppenheimer rovibrational spectrum</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.03259</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.03259v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The experimentally-observed non-trivial electronic structure of the Cr$_2$ dimer has made the calculation of its potential energy curve a theoretical challenge in the last decades. By matching the perturbation theory at small internuclear distances $R$ and the multipole expansion at large distances $R$ (supposedly both of asymptotic nature), and by adding a few Rydberg-Klein-Rees (RKR) turning points, extracted from experimental data by Casey-Leopold (1993), the analytic form of the potential energy curve for the ground state $X^1\Sigma^+$ of the Cr$_2$ dimer is found for the first time for the whole range of internuclear distances $R$. This has the form of a two-point Pad\'e approximant and provides an accuracy of 3-4 decimal digits in 29 experimental vibrational energies. The resulting ground state $X^1\Sigma^+$ potential curve supports 19694 rovibrational states with a maximal vibrational number $\nu_\text{max}=104$ at zero angular momentum and with a maximal angular momentum $L_\text{max}=312$ with energies $&gt; 10^{-4}$ { hartree}, and additionally 218 weakly-bound states (close to the dissociation limit) with energies $&lt; 10^{-4}$ { hartree}.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2402.11802v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Strongly correlated impurities immersed in a Bose-Einstein condensate (BEC) can form a periodic structure of tightly localized single atoms due to competing inter- and intra-species interactions, leading to a self-organized pinned state. In this work, we show numerically that the impurities in the self-pinned state form a soliton-train, as a consequence of a BEC-mediated attractive self-interaction and ordering due to the exclusion principle. The dynamics of the impurities possess similar characteristics to bright matter-wave solitons as they appear in attractive BECs, however in the few impurities case, the detailed nature of collisions is determined by their quantum statistics.</description>

      <title>Scheme for braiding Majorana zero modes in vortices using an STT-matrix</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.18578</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.18578v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recently conducted experiments on two-dimensional topological superconductors have revealed various indications of Majorana zero modes (MZMs). However, progress in the manipulation of MZM braiding has been limited, impeding the realization of topological quantum computing. In this study, we propose a potential braiding scheme based on a spintronic device matrix. This scheme involves utilizing a matrix composed of spin-transfer torque devices (STT-matrix) alongside a two-dimensional topological superconductor material. By programming the ON/OFF states of the spintronic devices within the STT-matrix, it becomes possible to manipulate vortices hosting MZMs in the two-dimensional topological superconductor. To further investigate this concept, we construct a time-dependent Ginzburg-Landau model and perform numerical simulations to analyze vortex-driving dynamics, MZM braiding processes, and MZM fusion phenomena. Our findings demonstrate that this system exhibits high versatility and flexibility in manipulating vortices. With advancements in spintronic device technology, our proposed scheme offers a feasible and practical method for operating MZMs within vortices present in topological superconductors.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.08273v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The one-dimensional quantum breakdown model, which features spatially asymmetric fermionic interactions simulating the electrical breakdown phenomenon, exhibits an exponential U(1) symmetry and a variety of dynamical phases including many-body localization and quantum chaos with quantum scar states. We investigate the minimal quantum breakdown model with the minimal number of on-site fermion orbitals required for the interaction, and identify a large number of local conserved charges in the model. We then reveal a mapping between the minimal quantum breakdown model in certain charge sectors and a quantum link model which simulates the U(1) lattice gauge theory, and show that the local conserved charges map to the gauge symmetry generators. A special charge sector of the model further maps to the PXP model, which shows quantum many-body scars. This mapping unveils the rich dynamics in different Krylov subspaces characterized by different gauge configurations in the quantum breakdown model.</description>

      <title>Polyadic supersymmetry</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.02188v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We introduce a polyadic analog of supersymmetry by considering the polyadization procedure (proposed by the author) applied to the toy model of one-dimensional supersymmetric quantum mechanics. The supercharges are generalized to polyadic ones using the $n$-ary sigma matrices defined in earlier work. In this way, polyadic analogs of supercharges and Hamiltonians take the cyclic shift block matrix form, and they can describe multidegenerated quantum states in a way that is different from the $N$-extended and multigraded SQM. While constructing the corresponding supersymmetry as an $n$-ary Lie superalgebra ($n$ is the arity of the initial associative multiplication), we have found new brackets with a reduced arity of $2\leq m&lt;n$ and a related series of $m$-ary superalgebras (which is impossible for binary superalgebras). In the case of even reduced arity $m$ we obtain a tower of higher order (as differential operators) even Hamiltonians, while for $m$ odd we get a tower of higher order odd supercharges, and the corresponding algebra consists of the odd sector only.</description>

      <title>Second-order nonlocal shifts of scattered wave-packets: What can be measured by Goos-H\"anchen and Imbert-Fedorov effects ?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.00375</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.00375v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The scattering of wavepackets with arbitrary energy dispersion on surfaces has been analyzed. Expanding up to second order in scattering shifts, it is found that besides the known Goos-H\"anchen or Imbert-Fedorov spatial offset, as well as the Wigner delay time, new momentum and frequency shifts appear. Furthermore, the width of the scattered wave packet becomes modified as well, which can lead to a shrinking of pulses by multiple scattering. For a model of dielectric material characterized by a longitudinal and transverse dielectric function the shifts are calculated analytically. From the Goos-H\"anchen and Imbert-Fedorov shifts one can access the longitudinal and transversal dielectric function. Perfectly aligned crystal symmetry axes with respect to scattering beam shows no Imbert-Fedorov effect. It is found that the Goos-H\"anchen and Imbert-Fedorov effect are absent for homogeneous materials. Oppositely it is found that the Wigner delay time and the shrinking of the temporal pulse width allows to access the dielectric function independent on the beam geometry.</description>

      <title>Discovery and Application of the Two-Electron Quantum Theory of Glass States</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.08235v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The glass state problem stems from the failure described in terms of one-electron theory or atoms (molecules) as independent particles. In 2005, de Gennes proposed that the way to explain the glass transition in simple terms was to construct the cluster model of molecules in contact with all existing glass models and to refine the picture of the mean-field hard-sphere molecules (HSMs) in contact with each other. In the process of refining this picture, we discovered the two-electron quantum theory derived from the second solution of de Gennes n = 0, where the clustered contact of the two HSMs along the z-axis is the sequential emergence of the 16 z-direction interface excited quantum states of their coupled electron pair, the two HSMs suddenly overlap by 0.27% to form a magic-interface two-dimensional vector. The two coupled electron orbitals synchronously escaped the two HSMs 16 times, tangent to the magic interface 16 times, and 16 parallel repulsive electron pairs with an interval of 5.9987{\deg}, which is a clustered boson interaction between the two HSMs. This is the common origin of boson peaks in the glass state and electron pairing in the high-temperature superconductivity. Therefore, the collective behavior of electrons in the two-electron theory can unify the glass transition and the high-temperature superconducting transition. This paper is not only a complete theoretical statement on glass transition, but also a new interpretation of the theory of high-temperature superconductivity, which provides a new theoretical perspective in the search for room-temperature superconducting materials.</description>

Abstract: Non-Hermitian skin effects (NHSEs) have recently been investigated extensively at the single-particle level. When many-body interactions become dominant, novel non-Hermitian physical phenomena can emerge. In this work, we theoretically study NHSEs controlled by dissipation and interaction. We consider a 1D zigzag Bose-Hubbard lattice, subject to magnetic flux, staggered onsite single-particle loss, and uniform onsite two-particle loss. When the two-particle loss is small, two-body bound eigenstates (i.e., doublons) are all localized at the same boundary due to the interplay of the magnetic flux and staggered single-particle loss. While, for strong two-particle loss, the localization direction of doublons is unexpectedly reversed. This is attributed to the effective strong nonreciprocal hopping of doublons contributing from the virtual second-order and third-order hopping processes of particle pairs in combination with the magnetic flux, the strong two-particle loss, and the many-body interaction. Moreover, a two-particle gain can induce the same skin-localization of doublons, which can be utilized to dynamically observe the NHSE and its reversal of doublons controlled by interactions. Our results open up a new avenue for exploring novel non-Hermitian phenomena in many-body systems.</description>
