      <title>Low rank groups of Lie type acting point and line-primitively on finite generalised quadrangles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.03790</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.03790v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Suppose we have a finite thick generalised quadrangle whose automorphism group $G$ acts primitively on both the set of points and the set of lines. Then $G$ must be almost simple. In this paper, we show that $\operatorname{soc}(G)$ cannot be isomorphic to $\operatorname{Sz}(2^{2m+1})$ or $\operatorname{Ree}(3^{2m+1})$ where $m$ is a positive integer.</description>

      <title>Dimension quotients as boundary limits</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.03979</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.03979v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: For a functor from the category of free presentations of a group to the category of all groups we define the boundary limit as an image of the natural map from limit to colimit. We show that the fourth dimension quotient of a group can be naturally described as the boundary limit of a simply-defined functor.</description>

      <title>Element orders in extraspecial groups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.04141</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.04141v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: By using the structure and some properties of extraspecial and generalized/almost extraspecial $p$-groups, we explicitly determine the number of elements of specific orders in such groups. As a consequence, one may find the number of cyclic subgroups of any (generalized/almost) extraspecial group. For a finite group $G$, the ratio of the number of cyclic subgroups to the number of subgroups is called the cyclicity degree of $G$ and is denoted by $cdeg(G)$. We show that the set containing the cyclicity degrees of all finite groups is dense in $[0, 1]$. This is equivalent to giving an affirmative answer to the following question posed by T\'{o}th and T\u{a}rn\u{a}uceanu: ``For every $a\in [0, 1]$, does there exist a sequence $(G_n)_{n\geq 1}$ of finite groups such that $\displaystyle\lim_{n\to\infty} cdeg(G_n)=a$?". We show that such sequences are formed of finite direct products of extraspecial groups of a specific type.</description>

      <title>On left braces in which every subbrace is an ideal</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.04213</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.04213v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The aim of this paper is to introduce and study the class of all left braces in which every subbrace is an ideal. We call them Dedekind left braces. It is proved that every finite Dedekind left brace is centrally nilpotent. Structural results about Dedekind left braces and a complete description of those ones whose additive group is elementary abelian are also shown. As a consequence, every hypermultipermutational Dedekind left brace whose additive group is elementary abelian is multipermutational of level $2$. A new class of left braces, the extraspecial left braces, is introduced and plays a prominent role in our approach.</description>

      <title>Higher Kazhdan projections and delocalised $\ell^ 2$-Betti numbers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.03837</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.03837v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We provide an explicit description of the K-classes of higher Kazhdan projections in degrees greater than 0 for specific free product groups and Cartesian product groups. Employing this description, we obtain new calculations of Lott's delocalised $\ell^2$-Betti numbers. Notably, we establish the first non-vanishing results for infinite groups.</description>

      <title>Restricting Rational Modules to Frobenius Kernels</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.03973</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.03973v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Let $G$ be a connected reductive group over an algebraically closed field of characteristic $p&gt;0$. Given an indecomposable G-module $M$, one can ask when it remains indecomposable upon restriction to the Frobenius kernel $G_r$, and when its $G_r$-socle is simple (the latter being a strictly stronger condition than the former). In this paper, we investigate these questions for $G$ having an irreducible root system of type A. Using Schur functors and inverse Schur functors as our primary tools, we develop new methods of attacking these problems, and in the process obtain new results about classes of Weyl modules, induced modules, and tilting modules that remain indecomposable over $G_r$.</description>

      <title>On the Iwasawa theory of Cayley graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.04361</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.04361v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper explores Iwasawa theory from a graph theoretic perspective, focusing on the algebraic and combinatorial properties of Cayley graphs. Using representation theory, we analyze Iwasawa-theoretic invariants within $\mathbb{Z}_\ell$-towers of Cayley graphs, revealing connections between graph theory, number theory, and group theory. Key results include the factorization of associated Iwasawa polynomials and the decomposition of $\mu$- and $\lambda$-invariants. Additionally, we apply these insights to complete graphs, establishing conditions under which these invariants vanish.</description>

      <title>On the classification of product-quotient surfaces with $q=0$, $p_g=3$ and their canonical map</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.04425</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.04425v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this work we present new results to produce an algorithm that returns, for any fixed pair of natural integers $K^2$ and $\chi$, all regular surfaces $S$ of general type with self-intersection $K_S^2=K^2$ and Euler characteristic $\chi(\mathcal O_S)=\chi$, that are product-quotient surfaces. The key result we obtain is an algebraic characterization of all families of regular product-quotients surfaces, up to isomorphism, arising from a pair of $G$-coverings of $\mathbb P^1$. As a consequence of our work, we provide a classification of all regular product-quotient surfaces of general type with $23\leq K^2\leq 32$ and $\chi(\mathcal O_S)=4$. Furthermore, we study their canonical map and present several new examples of surfaces of general type with a high degree of the canonical map.</description>

      <title>Principal 2-blocks with wreathed defect groups up to splendid Morita equivalence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.13621</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.13621v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We classify principal $2$-blocks of finite groups $G$ with Sylow $2$-subgroups isomorphic to a wreathed $2$-group $C_{2^n}\wr C_2$ with $n\geq 2$ up to Morita equivalence and up to splendid Morita equivalence. As a consequence, we obtain that Puig's Finiteness Conjecture holds for such blocks. Furthermore, we obtain a classification of such groups modulo $O_{2'}(G)$, which is a pure group theoretical result and of independent interest. Methods previously applied to blocks of tame representation type are used. They are, however, further developed in order to deal with blocks of wild representation type.</description>

      <title>A Lie group analog for the Monster Lie algebra</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.11078</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.11078v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The Monster Lie algebra $\mathfrak{m}$, which admits an action of the Monster finite simple group $\mathbb{M}$, was introduced by Borcherds as part of his work on the Conway-Norton Monstrous Moonshine conjecture. Here we construct an analog $G(\frak m)$ of a Lie group, or Kac-Moody group, associated to $\frak m$. The group $G(\frak m)$ is given by generators and relations, analogous to the Tits construction of a Kac-Moody group. In the absence of local nilpotence of the adjoint representation of $\frak m$, we introduce the notion of pro-summability of an infinite sum of operators. We use this to construct a complete pro-unipotent group $\widehat{U}^+$ of automorphisms of a completion $\widehat{\mathfrak{m}}=\frak n^-\ \oplus\ \frak h\ \oplus\ \widehat{\frak n}^+$ of $\mathfrak{m}$, where $\widehat{\frak n}^+$ is the formal product of the positive root spaces of $\frak m$. The elements of $\widehat{U}^+$ are pro-summable infinite series with constant term 1. The group $\widehat{U}^+$ has a subgroup $\widehat{U}^+_{\text{im}}$, which is an analog of a complete unipotent group corresponding to the positive imaginary roots of $\frak m$. We construct analogs Exp:$\widehat{\mathfrak{n}}^+\to\widehat{U}^+$ and Ad:$\widehat{U}^+ \to Aut(\widehat{\frak{n}}^+)$ of the classical exponential map and adjoint representation. Although the group $G(\mathfrak m)$ is not a group of automorphisms, it contains the analog of a unipotent subgroup $U^+$, which conjecturally acts as automorphisms of $\widehat{\mathfrak{m}}$.
  We also construct groups of automorphisms of $\mathfrak{m}$, of certain $\mathfrak{gl}_2$ subalgebras of $\mathfrak{m}$, of the completion $\widehat{\mathfrak{m}}$ and of similar completions of $\frak m$ that are conjecturally identified with subgroups of $G(\mathfrak m)$.</description>

      <title>Milnor fibrations of arrangements with trivial algebraic monodromy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.03619</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.03619v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Each complex hyperplane arrangement gives rise to a Milnor fibration of its complement. Although the Betti numbers of the Milnor fiber $F$ can be expressed in terms of the jump loci for rank 1 local systems on the complement, explicit formulas are still lacking in full generality, even for $b_1(F)$. We study here the "generic" case (in which $b_1(F)$ is as small as possible), and look deeper into the algebraic topology of such Milnor fibrations with trivial algebraic monodromy. Our main focus is on the cohomology jump loci and the lower central series quotients of $\pi_1(F)$. In the process, we produce a pair of arrangements for which the respective Milnor fibers have the same Betti numbers, yet non-isomorphic fundamental groups: the difference is picked by the higher-depth characteristic varieties and by the Schur multipliers of the second nilpotent quotients.</description>
