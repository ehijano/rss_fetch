      <title>Physics-informed neural networks (PINNs) for numerical model error approximation and superresolution</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.09728</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.09728v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Numerical modeling errors are unavoidable in finite element analysis. The presence of model errors inherently reflects both model accuracy and uncertainty. To date there have been few methods for explicitly quantifying errors at points of interest (e.g. at finite element nodes). The lack of explicit model error approximators has been addressed recently with the emergence of machine learning (ML), which closes the loop between numerical model features/solutions and explicit model error approximations. In this paper, we propose physics-informed neural networks (PINNs) for simultaneous numerical model error approximation and superresolution. To test our approach, numerical data was generated using finite element simulations on a two-dimensional elastic plate with a central opening. Four- and eight-node quadrilateral elements were used in the discretization to represent the reduced-order and higher-order models, respectively. It was found that the developed PINNs effectively predict model errors in both x and y displacement fields with small differences between predictions and ground truth. Our findings demonstrate that the integration of physics-informed loss functions enables neural networks (NNs) to surpass a purely data-driven approach for approximating model errors.</description>

      <title>Optimal and parameter-free gradient minimization methods for convex and nonconvex optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.12139</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.12139v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We propose novel optimal and parameter-free algorithms for computing an approximate solution with small (projected) gradient norm. Specifically, for computing an approximate solution such that the norm of its (projected) gradient does not exceed $\varepsilon$, we obtain the following results: a) for the convex case, the total number of gradient evaluations is bounded by $O(1)\sqrt{L\|x_0 - x^*\|/\varepsilon}$, where $L$ is the Lipschitz constant of the gradient and $x^*$ is any optimal solution; b) for the strongly convex case, the total number of gradient evaluations is bounded by $O(1)\sqrt{L/\mu}\log(\|\nabla f(x_0)\|/\epsilon)$, where $\mu$ is the strong convexity modulus; and c) for the nonconvex case, the total number of gradient evaluations is bounded by $O(1)\sqrt{Ll}(f(x_0) - f(x^*))/\varepsilon^2$, where $l$ is the lower curvature constant. Our complexity results match the lower complexity bounds of the convex and strongly cases, and achieve the above best-known complexity bound for the nonconvex case for the first time in the literature. Our results can also be extended to problems with constraints and composite objectives. Moreover, for all the convex, strongly convex, and nonconvex cases, we propose parameter-free algorithms that do not require the input of any problem parameters or the convexity status of the problem. To the best of our knowledge, there do not exist such parameter-free methods before especially for the strongly convex and nonconvex cases. Since most regularity conditions (e.g., strong convexity and lower curvature) are imposed over a global scope, the corresponding problem parameters are notoriously difficult to estimate. However, gradient norm minimization equips us with a convenient tool to monitor the progress of algorithms and thus the ability to estimate such parameters in-situ.</description>
