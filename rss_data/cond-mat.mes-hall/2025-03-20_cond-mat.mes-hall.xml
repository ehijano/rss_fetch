      <title>Interaction-Induced Higher-Order Topological Insulator via Floquet Engineering</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.14516</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.14516v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Higher-order topological insulators have attracted significant interest in both static single-particle and many-body lattice systems. While periodically driven (Floquet) higher-order topological phases have been explored at the single-particle level, the role of interactions in such systems remains less understood. In this paper, we extend previous studies by investigating interaction-induced higher-order topological phases through Floquet engineering. To achieve this, we construct an extended Bose-Hubbard model on a square lattice subjected to periodic driving. We demonstrate the emergence of interaction-induced normal Floquet second-order topological corner states for doublons (i.e., bound boson pairs) from a trivial phase, which exhibit robustness against disorder. Notably, beyond the normal phase, we reveal an interaction-induced anomalous Floquet second-order topological phase, where in-gap corner states of doublons emerge within the $\pi/T$ gap ($T$ being the driving period). Our model, accessible with state-of-the-art ultracold atom techniques, provides a platform for realizing interaction-driven higher-order topological phases uniquely enabled by periodic driving, with no direct counterparts in static or single-particle systems.</description>

      <title>Floquet non-Abelian topological charges and edge states</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.14518</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.14518v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Non-Abelian topological insulators are characterized by matrix-valued, non-commuting topological charges with regard to more than one energy gap. Their descriptions go beyond the conventional topological band theory, in which an additive integer is endowed separately with each (degenerate group of) energy band(s). In this work, we reveal that Floquet (time-periodic) driving could not only enrich the topology and phase transitions of non-Abelian topological matter, but also induce bulk-edge correspondence unique to nonequilibrium setups. Using a one-dimensional (1D), three-band model as an illustrative example, we demonstrate that Floquet driving could reshuffle the phase diagram of the non-driven system, yielding both gapped and gapless Floquet band structures with non-Abelian topological charges. Moreover, by dynamically tuning the anomalous Floquet $\pi$-quasienergy gap, non-Abelian topological transitions inaccessible to static systems could arise, leading to much more complicated relations between non-Abelian topological charges and Floquet edge states. These discoveries put forth the periodic driving as a powerful scheme of engineering non-Abelian topological phases (NATPs) and incubating unique non-Abelian band topology beyond equilibrium.</description>

      <title>Robust strong-field theory model for ultrafast electron transport through metal-insulator-metal tunneling nanojunctions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.14531</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.14531v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Ultrafast science studies the dynamics of electrons in matter with extreme temporal precision, typically in the attosecond and femtosecond time domain. Recent experimental and theoretical progress has put metal-insulator-metal (MIM) tunneling nanojunctions in the spotlight of ultrafast science. Waveform-controlled laser fields can induce ultrafast currents in these junctions, opening the door to petahertz electronic operation and attosecond-scale scanning tunneling microscopy (STM). Inspired by our strong-field model for attosecond tunneling microscopy [Boyang Ma and Michael Kr\"uger, Phys. Rev. Lett. 133, 236901 (2024)], here we generalize our model to MIM nanojunctions. We introduce several refinements and corrections, accounting for the image potential inside the gap and boundary effects. Moreover, we also find that the Keldysh parameter alone is insufficient for describing the physics in thin MIM nanojunctions. We introduce a new parameter $\zeta$ that accounts for the effects of the limited size of the junction and provide several interpretations of the parameter that shed new light on the complex physics in the light-driven junction. Most strikingly, we find that for $\zeta &gt; 1$ photon-assisted tunneling is dominating the ultrafast electron transport across the junction, regardless of the value of the Keldysh parameter. Here one or more photons are absorbed and the electron undergoes static tunneling through the barrier. $\zeta &lt; 1$ is required for a regime in which the laser field and the Keldysh parameter dominate the transport. We also discuss the three-step model of electron transport across the nanojunction in the adiabatic regime, the energy cutoff of the transported electrons and the carrier-envelope phase control of the net current. Our theory model provides a rich toolbox for understanding and predicting the physics of ultrafast MIM nanojunctions.</description>

      <title>Terahertz radiation generation by laser-resonant excitation of terahertz surface magnetoplasmons on a graphene-n-InSb semiconductor interface</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.14532</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.14532v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose a method for the laser-excitation of terahertz surface magnetoplasmons via the linear mode conversion of terahertz radiation on a graphene sheet deposited on an n-type semiconductor in presence of an external magnetic field parallel to the semiconductor surface. An obliquely incident p-polarized laser beam interacting with the graphene n-InSb semiconductor surface, imparts linear oscillatory velocity to the free electrons. This oscillatory velocity couples with the modulated electron density to generate a linear current density, which resonantly excites terahertz surface magnetoplasmons. It is shown that the amplitude of terahertz surface magnetoplasmons wave can be tuned by adjusting the external magnetic field ($\text{B}_{0}$), the graphene's Fermi energy ($\text{E}_\text{F}$), the semiconductor's temperature (T), and the incident angle ($\theta$) of laser. This mechanism has the potential to enable the development of an actively tunable plasmonic device.</description>

      <title>Roadmap for Quantum Nanophotonics with Free Electrons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.14678</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.14678v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Over the past century, continuous advancements in electron microscopy have enabled the synthesis, control, and characterization of high-quality free-electron beams. These probes carry an evanescent electromagnetic field that can drive localized excitations and provide high-resolution information on material structures and their optical responses, currently reaching the sub-{\aa}ngstr\"om and few-meV regime. Moreover, combining free electrons with pulsed light sources in ultrafast electron microscopy adds temporal resolution in the sub-femtosecond range while offering enhanced control of the electron wave function. Beyond their exceptional capabilities for time-resolved spectromicroscopy, free electrons are emerging as powerful tools in quantum nanophotonics, on par with photons in their ability to carry and transfer quantum information, create entanglement within and with a specimen, and reveal previously inaccessible details on nanoscale quantum phenomena. This Roadmap outlines the current state of this rapidly evolving field, highlights key challenges and opportunities, and discusses future directions through a collection of topical sections prepared by leading experts.</description>

      <title>Non-equilibrium field theory with a temperature gradient: Thermal current in a nanowire</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.14775</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.14775v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A perturbative framework is developed within the standard non-equilibrium field theory techniques to incorporate a temperature gradient across a thermoelectric device. The framework uses a temperature-dependent pseudo-Hamiltonian generated from the exact density matrix in the presence of non-uniform temperatures. We develop a perturbation theory for small temperature gradients in long wires and obtain the non-linear thermal conductance as a function of temperature difference. The framework should be adaptable to more general cases of temperature inhomogeneities in either fermionic or bosonic systems.</description>

      <title>Temperature inhomogeneity in non-equilibrium field theory for electrons in a nanowire: thermodynamic and transport properties</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.14778</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.14778v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A nanowire with its two ends fixed at two different temperatures by external baths is the simplest example of a fermionic system with a temperature inhomogeneity, and could be an easy platform to study thermodynamic and transport properties of a boundary-driven open quantum system. Starting with a temperature-dependent pseudo free energy derived from an exact reduced density matrix and assuming a small temperature gradient $\gamma$ across the wire, we show within perturbation theory that electron dispersion relation and therefore the Fermi distribution becomes $\gamma$ and space coordinates dependent, leading to non-linear effects of the temperature inhomogeneity. In particular, we show that in the non-linear response regime, the Widemann-Franz Law for the ratio of thermal and electrical conductivities is generalized, and that the thermopower increases with increasing temperature gradient $\gamma$.</description>

      <title>Observation of thermally activated coherent magnon-magnon coupling in a magnonic hybrid system</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.14875</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.14875v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We experimentally demonstrate strong magnon-magnon coupling by thermal spin excitations in yttrium iron garnet/permalloy (YIG/Py) hybrid structures using microfocused Brillouin light scattering - an optical technique that enables the detection of zero-wavevector and higher-order wavevector spin waves in a broad frequency range. The thermally activated magnons in the bilayer lead to a hybrid excitation between magnon modes in the conductive Py layer with a wide wavevector range and the first perpendicular standing magnon modes in the insulating YIG layer, facilitated by strong interfacial exchange coupling. To further investigate this coupling, we compare the thermal magnon spectra with the results obtained from electrical excitation and detection methods, which primarily detect the uniform Py mode. The realization of coherent coupling between incoherent (thermal) magnons is important for advancing energy-efficient magnonic devices, particularly in classical as well as quantum spin-wave computing technologies.</description>

      <title>Data-driven Azimuthal RHEED construction for in-situ crystal growth characterization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.15339</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.15339v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Reflection High-Energy Electron Diffraction (RHEED) is a powerful tool to probe the surface reconstruction during MBE growth. However, raw RHEED patterns are difficult to interpret, especially when the wafer is rotating. A more accessible representation of the information is therefore the so-called Azimuthal RHEED (ARHEED), an angularly resolved plot of the electron diffraction pattern during a full wafer rotation. However, ARHEED requires precise information about the rotation angle as well as of the position of the specular spot of the electron beam. We present a Deep Learning technique to automatically construct the Azimuthal RHEED from bare RHEED images, requiring no further measurement equipment. We use two artificial neural networks: an image segmentation model to track the center of the specular spot and a regression model to determine the orientation of the crystal with respect to the incident electron beam of the RHEED system. Our technique enables accurate and real-time ARHEED construction on any growth chamber equipped with a RHEED system.</description>

      <title>Quasi-$\Phi_0$-periodic supercurrent at quantum Hall transitions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.15384</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.15384v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The combination of superconductivity and quantum Hall (QH) effect is regarded as a key milestone in advancing topological quantum computation in solid-state systems. Recent quantum interference studies suggest that QH edge states can effectively mediate a supercurrent across high-quality graphene weak links. In this work we report the observation of a supercurrent associated with transitions between adjacent QH plateaus, where transport paths develop within the compressible two-dimensional bulk. We employ a back-gated graphene Josephson junction, comprising high-mobility CVD-grown graphene encapsulated in hexagonal Boron Nitride (hBN) and contacted by Nb leads. Superconducting pockets are detected persisting beyond the QH onset, up to 2.4 T, hence approaching the upper critical field of the Nb contacts. We observe an approximate $\Phi_0=h/2e$ periodicity of the QH-supercurrent as a function of the magnetic field, indicating superconducting interference in a proximitized percolative phase. These results provide a promising experimental platform to investigate the transport regime of percolative supercurrents, leveraging the flexibility of van der Waals devices.</description>

      <title>Simulation of current-driven magnetisation switching in nanopillars with Perpendicular Shape Anisotropy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.15388</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.15388v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Perpendicular Shape Anisotropy Spin Transfer Torque Magnetic Random Access Memory (PSA-STT-MRAM) is a recent concept proposed to maintain the thermal stability of standard MRAM at small diameters, considering thick vertical pillars as the free layer. In order to explore the specific physics of PSA-STT-MRAMs expected in relation with their three-dimensional nature, we have performed simulations combining a micromagnetic model coupled self-consistently with spin-dependent transport equations. The 3D shape induces flower states at the upper and lower surfaces. Besides, the field-like component of STT is found to be larger than in standard MRAMs, suggesting that it needs to be considered. The combination of both effects leads to the excitation of high-order 3D ferromagnetic resonance modes, playing a key role in magnetisation reversal. These results highlight features of 3D nanomagnetic systems, largely disregarded so far, which need to be considered to optimise PSA-STT-MRAM to be a competitive solution for technological implementation.</description>

      <title>Spin squeezing in an ensemble of nitrogen-vacancy centers in diamond</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.14585</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.14585v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Spin squeezed states provide a seminal example of how the structure of quantum mechanical correlations can be controlled to produce metrologically useful entanglement. Such squeezed states have been demonstrated in a wide variety of artificial quantum systems ranging from atoms in optical cavities to trapped ion crystals. By contrast, despite their numerous advantages as practical sensors, spin ensembles in solid-state materials have yet to be controlled with sufficient precision to generate targeted entanglement such as spin squeezing. In this work, we present the first experimental demonstration of spin squeezing in a solid-state spin system. Our experiments are performed on a strongly-interacting ensemble of nitrogen-vacancy (NV) color centers in diamond at room temperature, and squeezing (-0.5 $\pm$ 0.1 dB) is generated by the native magnetic dipole-dipole interaction between NVs. In order to generate and detect squeezing in a solid-state spin system, we overcome a number of key challenges of broad experimental and theoretical interest. First, we develop a novel approach, using interaction-enabled noise spectroscopy, to characterize the quantum projection noise in our system without directly resolving the spin probability distribution. Second, noting that the random positioning of spin defects severely limits the generation of spin squeezing, we implement a pair of strategies aimed at isolating the dynamics of a relatively ordered sub-ensemble of NV centers. Our results open the door to entanglement-enhanced metrology using macroscopic ensembles of optically active spins in solids.</description>

      <title>Interacting non-Hermitian edge and cluster bursts on a digital quantum processor</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.14595</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.14595v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A lossy quantum system harboring the non-Hermitian skin effect can in certain conditions exhibit anomalously high loss at the boundaries of the system compared to the bulk, a phenomenon termed the non-Hermitian edge burst. We uncover interacting many-body extensions of the edge burst that are spatially extended and patterned, as well as cluster bursts that occur away from boundaries. Owing to the methodological difficulty and overhead of accurately realizing non-Hermitian dynamical evolution, much less tunable interactions, few experimental avenues in studying the single-particle edge burst have been reported to date and none for many-body variants. We overcome these roadblocks in this study, and present a realization of edge and cluster bursts in an interacting quantum ladder model on a superconducting quantum processor. We utilize a time-stepping algorithm, which implements time-evolution by non-Hermitian Hamiltonians by composing a linear combination of unitaries scheme and product formulae, to assess long-time behavior of the system. We observe signatures of the non-Hermitian edge burst on up to 64 unit cells, and detect the closing of the dissipative gap, a necessary condition for the edge burst, by probing the imaginary spectrum of the system. In suitable interacting regimes, we identify the emergence of spatial patterning and cluster bursts. Beyond establishing these generalized forms of edge burst phenomena, our study paves the way for digital quantum processors to be harnessed as a versatile platform for non-Hermitian condensed-matter physics.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.14614</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.14614v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce a systematic procedure based on optimal control theory to address the full counting statistics of particle transport in a stochastic system. Our approach enhances the performance of a Thouless pump in the non-adiabatic regime by simultaneously optimizing the average pumping rate while minimizing noise. We demonstrate our optimization procedure on a paradigmatic model for the electronic transport through a quantum dot, both in the limit of vanishing Coulomb interaction and in the interacting regime. Our method enables independent control of the moments associated with charge and spin transfer, allowing for the enhancement of spin current with minimal charge current or the independent tuning of spin and charge fluctuations. These results underscore the versatility of our approach, which can be applied to a broad class of stochastic systems.</description>

      <title>Comparison between PBE-D3, B3LYP, B3LYP-D3 and MP2 Methods for quantum mechanical calculations of polarizability and IR-NMR spectra in C24 isomers, including a novel isomer with D2d symmetry</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.14737v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We perform a comprehensive theoretical analysis of C24 isomers in the gaseous phase using the PBE-D3-cc-pVTZ,B3LYP-cc-pVTZ,B3LYP-D3-cc-pVTZ , MP2-6-31G methods.We consider the basis set cc-pVTZ for the MP2 method , carry out optimized (single point) calculations in three isomers (remaining two isomers when convergence was too time consuming) in order to reveal the potentiality of the method.We covered many properties,including geometry optimizations,chemical stability,polarizabilities,nuclear screening constants,Fermi(FE),gap(GE) , atomization energies(AE),thermodynamic analysis,reactivity index,IR, NMR.Calculations were performed for ring (D12h), sheet (D6h) , two cage (D6d,Oh) configurations. We proposed a new structure, the bracelet (D2d) arrangement, stable according to the PBE, B3LYP,B3LYPD3 methods, but a transition state by the MP2 method. Results consistently indicated the D6h isomer is the most stable one among the C24 isomers studied, while the D2d isomer was found to be the least stable.For the gap energy(GE), the B3LYP,B3LYP-D3 methods yielded higher values compared to the PBEs,with an average DFT (PBE, B3LYP) GE of 1.89eV,whereas the MP2 method showed a substantially higher GE value of 7.6 eV, representing an increase of approximately 0.75.The polarizabilities of the C24 isomers were found to be overestimated by the PBE,B3LYP,B3LYP-D3 methods when compared to the corresponding MP2 values.The PBE-D3 method produced higher polarizabilities for the C24 isomers in comparison to the B3LYP, B3LYP-D3, MP2 methods.The investigation confirms that the Oh (D12h) isomer has the smallest (largest) polarizability.The polarizability of D12h is notably affected by the selected DFT method, while that of Oh displays lower sensitivity but shares similarities with D6d.</description>

      <title>Steric Engineering of Exciton Fine Structure in 2D Perovskites</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.14762</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.14762v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A comprehensive study of excitonic properties of 2D layered perovskites is provided, with an emphasis on understanding and controlling the exciton fine structure. First, an overview of the optical properties is presented, discussing the challenges in determining the bandgap and exciton binding energies. Through magneto-optical spectroscopic measurements (up to B = 140 T), scaling laws are established for exciton binding energy as a function of the band gap and the diamagnetic coefficient. Using an in-plane magnetic field, the exciton fine structure for various 2D perovskites is examined to measure the energy splitting between the excitonic levels. The exciton fine structure and exchange interaction are correlated with structural parameters, employing an effective mass model, to highlight the role of steric effect on the exchange interaction. These findings reveal that lattice distortions, introduced by organic spacers, significantly influence the exchange interaction, driving a tunable energy spacing between dark and bright excitons. This unique feature of 2D perovskites, not present in other semiconductors, offers a novel tuning mechanism for exciton control, making these materials highly promising for efficient light emitters and advanced quantum technologies.</description>

      <title>Exciton Annihilation by Lanthanide Dopants: An Atomic Probe of Sub-Diffraction Exciton Diffusion in Ferromagnetic CrI3</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.14771</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.14771v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Excitons in two-dimensional (2D) magnetic van der Waals (vdW) materials offer unique windows into the properties of strongly correlated electrons. Their generation can be used to drive magnetic phase transitions, manipulate spins coherently, or access novel non-equilibrium regimes. Despite extensive investigation into the spin physics of CrI3, exciton dynamics in this archetypal magnetic 2D material remain underexplored. Here, we report the use of Yb3+ impurity point defects as exciton annihilators to probe exciton diffusion in CrI3. Variable-temperature photoluminescence (PL) measurements for a series of x% Yb3+:CrI3 samples reveal thermally activated Dexter-type site-to-site hopping of excitons, with low exciton diffusivity associated with strong electron-nuclear coupling. Using Monte Carlo modeling calibrated by the experimental data, diffusivities are found to be orders of magnitudes lower than in 2D vdW semiconductors. Exciton diffusion lengths (LD) are below ~3 nm at all temperatures, and thus well below the optical diffraction limit. These results have basic implications for the use of excitons to probe and manipulate their surroundings in this and related magnetic CrX3 materials.</description>

      <title>The nonlinear limit of Babinet's Principle</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.14773</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.14773v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Babinet's principle is a powerful tool for predicting the scattering behavior of planar structures where the solution for the complementary structure is already known. This makes it ubiquitous in the design of aperture antennas or metamaterials. Even for plasmonic nanostructures, a qualitative match of the behavior for complementary structures has been reported. Here, we discuss whether Babinet's principle can be extended to nonlinear scattering. We compare the third harmonic emission of plasmonic nanorods and complementary nanoslits by far field imaging and simulation. We find significantly different far field images, in agreement between experiment and simulation. We explain these differences by the higher spatial resolution at the third harmonic wavelength and by additional eddy currents in slits that are not present in rods. Within these limits, Babinet's principle can guide the design of inverted nonlinear plasmonic resonators, which promise to be more stable at high excitation power due to better thermal conductivity.</description>

      <title>Magneto-Raman effect in van der Waals layered two-dimensional CrSBr antiferromagnet</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.15298v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Magneto-Raman spectroscopy is applied to study spin-phonon coupling in the layered two-dimensional (2D) van der Waals antiferromagnet CrSBr. We report on the effects of temperature and external magnetic field on Raman-active phonons of $A_g$ symmetry in bulk and one-to-six-layer forms of CrSBr that are reflected by the Raman spectral patterns measured at different configurations of circularly polarized laser beam. The results of experimental investigations reveal that spin-spin and spin-phonon interactions play a significant role below the N\'{e}el temperature and are notably stronger in CrSBr monolayer than in bulk material. Spin-phonon coupling leads to the emergence of \textit{ new} phonon peaks at very low temperatures. Such effect is solely observed in one-to-six-layer CrSBr and is absent in its bulk form. Our experimental research is accompanied by \textit{ab initio} simulations of the Raman spectra of bulk and monolayer CrSBr that uncover correlations between intensities of Raman-active phonons and the arrangement of spin magnetic moments on Cr atoms. Comparative analysis of simulated and experimental Raman spectra suggests the most favored spin orientation in the CrSBr antiferromagnetic system.</description>

      <title>Two-qubit logic and teleportation with mobile spin qubits in silicon</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.15434</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.15434v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The scalability and power of quantum computing architectures depend critically on high-fidelity operations and robust and flexible qubit connectivity. In this respect, mobile qubits are particularly attractive as they enable dynamic and reconfigurable qubit arrays. This approach allows quantum processors to adapt their connectivity patterns during operation, implement different quantum error correction codes on the same hardware, and optimize resource utilization through dedicated functional zones for specific operations like measurement or entanglement generation. Such flexibility also relieves architectural constraints, as recently demonstrated in atomic systems based on trapped ions and neutral atoms manipulated with optical tweezers. In solid-state platforms, highly coherent shuttling of electron spins was recently reported. A key outstanding question is whether it may be possible to perform quantum gates directly on the mobile spins. In this work, we demonstrate two-qubit operations between two electron spins carried towards each other in separate traveling potential minima in a semiconductor device. We find that the interaction strength is highly tunable by their spatial separation, achieving an average two-qubit gate fidelity of about 99\%. Additionally, we implement conditional post-selected quantum state teleportation between spatially separated qubits with an average gate fidelity of 87\%, showcasing the potential of mobile spin qubits for non-local quantum information processing. We expect that operations on mobile qubits will become a universal feature of future large-scale semiconductor quantum processors.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2311.17160v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We demonstrate that Andreev modes that propagate along a transparent Josephson junction have a perfect transmission at the point where three junctions meet. The chirality and the number of quantized transmission channels is determined by the topology of the Fermi surface and the vorticity of the superconducting phase differences at the trijunction. We explain this chiral adiabatic transmission (CAT) as a consequence of the adiabatic evolution of the scattering modes both in momentum and real space. The dispersion relation of the junction then separates the scattering trajectories by introducing inaccessible regions of phase space. We expect that CAT is observable in nonlocal conductance and thermal transport measurements. Furthermore, because it does not rely on particle-hole symmetry, CAT is also possible to observe directly in metamaterials.</description>

Abstract: We study the Bisognano-Wichmann Hamiltonian for fractional quantum Hall states defined on a sphere and explore its relationship with the entanglement Hamiltonian associated to the state. We present results for several examples, namely the bosonic Laughlin state stabilized by contact two-body interactions and the bosonic Moore-Read state stabilized by either three- or two-body interactions. Our findings demonstrate that the Bisognano-Wichmann Hamiltonian provides a reliable approximation of the entanglement Hamiltonian as a fully-local operator that can be written without any prior knowledge of the specific state under consideration.</description>

      <title>Quantification of the heavy-hole--light-hole mixing in two-dimensional hole gases</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.16844</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.16844v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We theoretically investigate heavy-hole--light-hole mixing in two-dimensional hole gases (2DHG). We restrict our analysis to the zone center, appropriate for the low-density regime, which leads to a simple description, analytical results, and physical insights. We identify two different types of hole-Hamiltonian terms concerning mixing. The first type changes the direction of the pure spinors, without admixing light-hole components. It is efficient for Rabi driving the heavy-hole spin. The second type induces mixing and changes the eigenvalues of the $g$-tensor. We analyze several measures that characterize the mixing quantitatively in Ge, Si, and GaAs, namely the $g$-factor, the light-hole weight in the wave function, the off-diagonal matrix elements in the Hamiltonian, and the strength of the induced spin-orbit interaction. We identify the canonical coordinate frame associated with a generic spin-3/2 Hamiltonian with time-reversal symmetry (TRS). In this coordinate frame, the mixing is quantified by a single parameter, the mixing angle $\vartheta$. We interpret it as the canonical (coordinate-frame and Hamiltonian-basis independent) measure of the heavy-hole--light-hole mixing. All the investigated mixing measures are simple functions of $\vartheta$. As an illustration, we use our model to analyze heavy-hole spin qubit $g$-tensor, dephasing, relaxation, and Rabi frequencies, interpreting the arising effects as due to rotations of the canonical frame and changes of the mixing angle $\vartheta$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2408.01241v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Leveraging advanced semiconductor manufacturing promises potential for scaling up silicon-based quantum processors. In this context, control and readout of individual spin qubits have been shown on devices manufactured on 300 mm wafer metal-oxide-semiconductor (MOS) processes, yet quantum processors require two-qubit interactions to operate. Here, we use a 300 mm natural silicon MOS process customized for spin qubits and demonstrate coherent control of two electron spins using the spin-spin exchange interaction, which forms the basis for entangling gates such as $\sqrt{\text{SWAP}}$. We observe gate dephasing times of up to $T_2^{*}\approx500$ ns and a gate quality factor of $10$. For readout, we introduce a novel dispersive readout technique, the radio-frequency electron cascade, that simplifies the qubits unit cell while providing high gain. We achieve a $74\%$ singlet-triplet readout fidelity in $8~\mu$s integration time, the highest-performing dispersive readout demonstration on a planar MOS process. The combination of sensitive dispersive readout with industrial-grade manufacturing marks a crucial step towards the large-scale integration of silicon quantum processors.</description>

      <title>Interplay between evanescent scattering modes and finite dispersion in superconducting junctions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.07035v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Superconducting junctions are essential building blocks for quantum hardware, and their fundamental behaviour remains a highly active research field. The behaviour of generic junctions is conveniently described by Beenakker's determinant formula, linking the subgap energy spectrum to the scattering matrix characterising the junction. In particular, the gap closing between bound and continuum states in short junctions follows from unitarity of the scattering matrix, and thus, from probability conservation. In this work, we critically reassess two assumptions: that scattering in short junctions is approximately energy-independent and dominated by planar channels. We argue that strongly energy-dependant scattering follows from finite dispersion of the conductor electrons even when they spend little time within the scattering region, and show that evanescent modes play a central role when cross-channel scattering is important. By generalising Beenakker's equation and performing a mapping to an effective Hamiltonian, we show that the gap closing is linked to a chiral symmetry. While finite energy dependence in the scattering breaks the chiral symmetry, we show two distinct mechanisms preserving the gap closing, each connected to new types of constraints on energy-dependant scattering matrices beyond unitarity. If the dispersive mode is planar, the gap closing is still preserved through a time-dependant probability conservation analysis of the scattering process. If the dispersive channel is evanescent, we derive a constraint which, notably, cannot follow from probability conservation. We thus demonstrate that Andreev physics reveal a much wider variety of properties of normal-metal scattering than commonly expected. We expect that our findings will have an impact on the dissipative behaviour of driven junctions, and offer a new perspective on fundamental properties of scattering matrices.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.13642v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Molecular electronics and other technologies whose components comprise individual molecules have been pursued for half a century because the molecular scale represents the limit of miniaturisation of objects whose structure is tuneable for function. Despite the promise, practical progress has been hindered by the lack of methodologies for directed assembly of arbitrary structures applicable at the molecular scale. DNA nanotechnology is an emerging framework that uses programmed synthetic oligomers to encode the design of self-assembling structures with atomic precision at the nanoscale.
  Here, we leverage DNA-directed self-assembly to construct single-molecule electrical transport devices in high yield, precisely positioning a metal-porphyrin between two 60 nm gold nanoparticles. Following deposition on SiO2 substrates, we image and establish electrical contact via established nanofabrication techniques. Each step of the process has a high probability of success and we demonstrate device yields dramatically better than is possible using conventional approaches. Our approach is inherently scalable and adaptable to devices incorporating multiple heterogenous functional molecular components, finally offering a realistic framework for the realisation of classical and quantum molecular technologies.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.13651v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: MnBi$_2$Te$_4$ (MBT) is an ideal platform for studying the interplay between magnetism and topology. Many exotic topological phenomena, such as the quantum anomalous Hall effect and the axion insulator, have been observed in few-layer MBT. A key feature in MBT is the emergence of the surface exchange gap, which lies in the milli-electron-volt range (1 THz corresponds to 4.14 meV). This makes THz spectroscopy a powerful tool to probe the associated topological physics. In this study, we report the THz spectra of Faraday and Kerr rotations in MBT thin films grown by molecular beam epitaxy. By varying the external magnetic field, we observe three magnetic states: the antiferromagnetic state, the canted antiferromagnetic state, and the ferromagnetic state. Our terahertz results show a quantized Hall state under 6 T in both 6 SL and 7 SL samples without gate voltage. These findings provide new insights into the magneto-terahertz properties of MBT and its potential for topological spintronic applications.</description>

      <title>Quantum transport in the presence of a chiral molecular potential</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.14124v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate quantum transport in a two-dimensional electron system coupled to a chiral molecular potential, demonstrating how molecular chirality and orientation affect charge and spin transport properties. We propose a minimal model for realizing true chiral symmetry breaking on a magnetized surface, with a crucial role played by the tilt angle of the molecular dipole with respect to the surface. For non-zero tilting, we show that the Hall response exhibits clear signatures of chirality-induced effects, both in charge and spin-resolved observables. Concerning the former, tilted enantiomers produce asymmetric Hall conductances and, even more remarkably, the persistence of this feature in the absence of spin-orbit coupling (SOC) signals how the enantiospecific charge response results from electron scattering off the molecular potential. Concerning spin-resolved observables where SOC plays a relevant role, we reveal that chiral symmetry breaking is crucial in enabling spin-flipping processes.</description>

      <title>Nature of Andreev bound states in Josephson junctions of triple-point semimetals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.15350</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.15350v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study superconductor-barrier-superconductor (S-B-S) Josephson junctions constructed out of two-dimensional and three-dimensional triple-point semimetals, which feature a threefold degeneracy at a single nodal point. We assume a weak and homogeneous s-wave pairing in each superconducting region, and a potential difference is applied across a piece of normal-state semimetal to create the barrier region. We compute the wavefunctions of the Andreev bound states (ABSs), considering the thin-barrier limit. The appropriate boundary conditions at the S-B and B-S junctions allow us to compute the discrete energy eigenvalues $\pm |\varepsilon| $ of the ABSs. We get two distinct solutions for $|\varepsilon| $. This result differs from that in graphene and Weyl semimetals, where one obtains only one solution for $|\varepsilon| $. The multifold nature of the triple-point fermions is responsible for this difference. We also illustrate the behaviour of the Josephson current flowing across the S-B-S junction.</description>

      <title>Nanoscale Domain Wall Dynamics in Micromagnetic Structures with Weak Perpendicular Anisotropy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.14172</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.14172v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Time-resolved pump-probe soft X-ray ptychography and Scanning Transmission X-ray Microscopy (STXM) were employed to study the magnetic domain wall dynamics in microstructures of permalloy (Ni$_{81}$Fe$_{19}$; Py) with a weak growth-induced perpendicular magnetic anisotropy. The X-ray magnetic circular dichroism (XMCD) images of a micrometer-sized Py square (160 nm thickness) and an elliptical disk (80 nm thickness) show flux-closure patterns with domain walls that fall into alternating out-of-plane (OOP) magnetization states precipitated by the perpendicular anisotropy, which is a precursor of the nucleation of stripe domains at higher thicknesses. An oscillating magnetic field at frequencies from tens of MHz to GHz and up to 4 mT magnitude excited dynamic modes in the domain walls along with the vortex core gyration. The domain wall dynamics include the translation of inversion points of the OOP magnetization and nucleation of one-dimensional spin waves.</description>

      <title>Many-Body Open Quantum Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.10300</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.10300v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: These Lecture Notes discuss the recent theoretical advances in the understanding of open quantum many-body physics in platforms where both dissipative and coherent processes can be tuned and controlled to a high degree. We start by reviewing the theoretical frameworks and methods used to describe and tackle open quantum many-body systems. We then discuss the use of dissipative processes to engineer many-body stationary states with desired properties and the emergence of dissipative phase transitions arising out of the competition between coherent evolution and dissipation. We review the dynamics of open quantum many body systems in the presence of correlated many-body dissipative processes, such as heating and many-body losses. Finally we provide a different perspective on open quantum many-body systems by looking at stochastic quantum trajectories, relevant for the case in which the environment represents a monitoring device, and the associated measurement-induced phase transitions.</description>

      <title>A Jellium Model for the Anomalous Hall Crystal</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.12704</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.12704v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The jellium model is a paradigmatic problem in condensed matter physics, exhibiting a phase transition between metallic and Wigner crystal phases. However, its vanishing Berry curvature makes it ill-suited for studying recent experimental platforms that combine strong interactions with nontrivial quantum geometry. These experiments inspired the anomalous Hall crystal (AHC) -- a topological variant of the Wigner crystal. The AHC spontaneously breaks continuous translation symmetry but has a nonzero Chern number. In this work, we introduce $\lambda-$jellium, a minimal extension of the two-dimensional jellium model. Its Berry curvature distribution is controlled by a single parameter, $\lambda$, where $\lambda=0$ corresponds to the standard jellium model. This setup facilitates the systematic exploration of Berry curvature's impact on electron crystallization. The phase diagram of this model, established using self-consistent Hartree Fock calculations, reveals several interesting features: (i) The AHC phase occupies a large region of the phase diagram. (ii) Two distinct Wigner crystal phases, the latter enabled by quantum geometry, and two distinct Fermi liquid phases are present. (iii) A continuous phase transition separates the AHC and one of the WC phases. (iv) In some parts of the AHC phase, the lattice geometry is non-triangular, unlike in the classical Wigner crystal. In addition to elucidating the physics of correlated electrons with nonzero Berry curvature, we expect that the simplicity of the model makes it an excellent starting point for more advanced numerical methods.</description>
