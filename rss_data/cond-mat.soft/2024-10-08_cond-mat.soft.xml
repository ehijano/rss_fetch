      <title>Pulling apart the mechanisms that lead to jammed knitted fabrics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.03940</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.03940v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the mechanical behavior of jammed knitted fabrics, where geometric confinement leads to an initially stiff mechanical response that softens into low stiffness behavior with additional applied stress. We show that the jammed regime is distinguished by changes in yarn geometry and contact rearrangement that must occur to allow the individual stitches to stretch. These rearrangements allow for the relaxation of high residual contact forces that are present within jammed fabric, altering the low-strain response. We demonstrate that fabric jamming can be induced or reduced by changing either the constituent yarn or the fabric manufacturing parameters. Analysis of experimental samples shows that changing the "stitch size" in manufacturing affects both the in situ yarn radius and the length of yarn per stitch, both of which affect jamming.</description>

      <title>Liquid crystal skyrmions as elastic multipoles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.03967</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.03967v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Solitons in liquid crystals are spatially localised stable configuration of the liquid crystal orientational order parameter that exhibit emergent particle-like properties such as mutual interaction, translational motion and reconfigurable self-asembling behaviour in oscillating electric fields. Understanding solitons' out-of-equilibrium interactions remains a significant challenge. In this study, we present a minimalist model capable to address this challenge. We derive analytically elastic multipole interaction potentials between two solitons assuming two dimensional LC configurations. We determine the soliton's elastic dipole and quadrupole moments based on the equilibrium director textures obtained as minimizers of the Frank-Oseen free energy functional. Incorporating the time dependence of the soliton's multipole moments in response to electric field oscillations, we carry out particle-based simulations that demonstrate the formation of soliton chains and two dimensional clusters by varying the amplitude and/or the frequency of the electric field, in agreement with experiments. The presented formalism may serve as a benchmark model for future theoretical developments incorporating, e.g. higher order elastic multipoles or/and many body interactions.</description>

      <title>Neutral polymer conformations with attractive bridging crowder interactions: role of crowder size</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.04113</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.04113v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Extensive molecular dynamics simulations were conducted to explore the conformational phase diagram of a neutral polymer in the presence of attractive crowders of varying sizes. For weakly self-attractive polymers, larger crowders induce a transition from an extended state to a bridging-crowder-induced collapse (CB phase) at lower polymer-crowder interaction strengths. Similarly, for strongly self-attractive polymers, a transition from a crowder-excluded collapse (CI phase) to the CB phase occurs with larger crowders and stronger polymer-crowder attraction. The simulations reveal that the collapsed states in both weakly and strongly self-attractive polymers are identical when small bridging crowders are involved. Near the transition threshold for weakly self-attractive polymers, increasing crowder size leads to complex transitions, including collapse, extension, and re-collapse. Additionally, a confined collapse (CC phase) is observed, where the polymer is confined to interstitial spaces among large crowders. Strongly self-attractive polymers show similar transitions, but only with smaller crowders, as larger crowders suppress these changes. These findings underscore the crucial influence of crowder size on the conformational behavior of neutral polymers, especially under varying degrees of polymer-crowder interaction.</description>

      <title>Long-range angular correlations of particle displacements at a plastic-to-elastic transition in jammed amorphous solids</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.04138</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.04138v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Understanding how a flow turns into an amorphous solid is a fundamental challenge in statistical physics, during which no apparent structural ordering appears. In the athermal limit, the two states are connected by a well-defined jamming transition, near which the solid is marginally stable. A recent mechanical response screening theory proposes an additional transition above jamming, called a plastic-to-elastic transition here, separating anomalous and quasi-elastic mechanical behavior. Through numerical inflation simulations in two dimensions, we show that the onsets of long-range radial and angular correlations of particle displacements decouple, occurring respectively at the jamming and plastic-to-elastic transitions. The latter is characterized by a power-law diverging correlation angle and a power-law spectrum of the displacements along a circle. This work establishes two-step transitions on the mechanical properties during ``decompression melting'' of an athermal over-jammed amorphous solid, reminiscent of the two-step structural melting of a crystal in two dimensions. In contradistinction with the latter, the plastic-to-elastic transition exists also in three dimensions.</description>

      <title>Electronic interactions of a new quatertiophene-based surfactants atliquid/gas interface</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.04145</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.04145v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We report the synthesis of a new functional molecule, a quater-tiophene based surfactant, which can both adsorb at the water / gas interface (surface active molecule) and aggregates through pi-pi stacking interactions. We assess then the ability of this molecule to create these functionalities at interfaces. This interfacial functional aggregation, characterized here in situ for the first time, is probed thanks to Langmuir trough experiments and spectrometric ellipsometry. These results open some new routes for the design of new water based opto-electronic devices.</description>

      <title>Conceptualization and Implementation of a Faster Than Real Time Simulation Tool for Ionic Material and System Modeling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.04310</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.04310v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Soft ionic circuitry is formed from ionic polymers and has enabled advances in soft robotic control, biological interfacing, and bio-inspired circuitry. Ionic circuits have intrinsic non-linearities, memory, and semiconducting behaviors, all enabled by the variety of charge carriers and materials that compose them. These intrinsic properties mean that traditional circuit models either fail to capture the behavior of ionic circuits or are too computationally expensive. In order to realize their potential, design tools are needed that are accurate enough to predict the performance of ionic circuit designs, flexible enough to build circuits piece by piece, and efficient enough to iterate quickly. Here, we develop a lumped element model that meets all these requirements; modeling the motion of each charge carrier throughout the system while keeping the hierarchical design, element reuse, and computational efficiency of equivalent circuit modeling. We demonstrate that our model fits the behavior of individual ionic devices and also predicts the behavior of larger circuits created by combining smaller devices together. In the process, we show how existing devices are often limited by ion leakage and demonstrate that device performance can be improved by tuning the backbone charge and thickness of the charged polymers. Finally, we use our tool to design a fully ionic power supply, sensor, control system, and actuator for a soft robot that changes its motion in response to the salt in its environment.</description>

      <title>Self-consistent electrostatic formalism of bulk electrolytes based on the asymmetric treatment of the short- and long-range ion interactions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.04556</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.04556v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We predict the thermodynamic behavior of bulk electrolytes from an ionic Hard-Core (HC) size-augmented self-consistent formalism incorporating asymmetrically the short- and long-range ion interactions via their virial and cumulant treatment, respectively. The characteristic splitting length separating these two ranges is obtained from a variational equation solved together with the Schwinger-Dyson (SD) equations. Via comparison with simulation results from the literature, we show that the asymmetric treatment of the distinct interaction ranges extends significantly the validity regime of our previously developed purely cumulant-level Debye-Huckel (DH) theory. Namely, for monovalent solutions with typical ion sizes, the present formalism can accurately predict mutually the HC-dominated liquid pressure and the electrostatic correlation-driven internal energies up to molar concentrations. We evaluate as well the screening length of the liquid and investigate the deviations of the intermolecular interaction range from the DH length. We show that in fair agreement with simulations and experiments, our theory can also reproduce the overscreening and underscreening effects occurring respectively in mono- and multivalent electrolytes.</description>

      <title>3D printed mesoporous superconductors with periodic order on three length scales and enhanced properties via block copolymer directed self-assembly</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.04569</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.04569v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Solution-based soft matter self-assembly (SA) promises unique materials properties from approaches including additive manufacturing/three-dimensional (3D) printing. We report direct ink writing derived, hierarchically porous transition metal nitride superconductors (SCs) and precursor oxides, structure-directed by Pluronics-family block copolymer (BCP) SA and heat treated in various environments. SCs with periodic lattices on three length scales show record nanoconfinement-induced upper critical field enhancements correlated with BCP molar mass, attaining values of 50 T for NbN and 8.1 T for non-optimized TiN samples, the first mapping of a tailorable SC property onto a macromolecular parameter. They reach surface areas above 120 m$^2$/g, the highest reported for compound SCs to date. Embedded printing enables the first BCP directed mesoporous non-self-supporting helical SCs. Results suggest that additive manufacturing may open pathways to mesoporous SCs with not only a variety of macroscopic form factors but enhanced properties from intrinsic, SA-derived mesostructures with substantial academic and technological promise.</description>

      <title>Phase segregation lubricates paste extrusion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.04593</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.04593v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Extrusion is a critical process in the manufacturing of various organic materials, including animal feed, human food, pharmaceuticals, and biomass for bioenergy. During extrusion, a dense particle-fluid mixture, or paste, is pushed through a narrow channel under high pressure. Despite its widespread use, many questions remain about how particle-fluid interactions and frictional forces at the wall influence high-pressure paste flow, particularly whether laboratory-scale findings translate to more complex industrial settings. Here, we quantify for the first time how a micrometer thin fluid lubrication layer emerges from particle-fluid interactions during the extrusion of organic biomass, controlling friction at the paste-channel interface. This lubrication layer forms through a pressure-induced phase segregation process and is significantly thinner than the particle size, affecting their contact dynamics, making friction at the interface tunable. Our results reveal how the thickness of the lubrication layer is influenced by paste composition, enhancing our fundamental understanding of phase segregation during industrial extrusion processes and offering potential pathways for reducing energy consumption and product failure in the industrial material production.</description>

      <title>Solute dispersion in pre-turbulent confined active nematics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.04629</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.04629v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the dispersion of solutes in active nematic fluids confined in narrow channels based on simulations of nematohydrodynamics. The study focuses on two pre-turbulent regimes: oscillatory flow, with net mass flux, and dancing flow, without net flux. Our findings reveal that the longitudinal dispersion of solutes, in both regimes, is determined by the second moments of the longitudinal and transverse components of the velocity field and proportional to the activity, suggesting a common mechanism for dispersion in these distinct flows. Finally, we found that the dispersion coefficient may increase up to one order of magnitude with respect to molecular diffusion in the dancing flow regime and that it is also enhanced in oscillatory flows, with potential for applications in natural biological environments and engineered devices.</description>

      <title>Dislocations and Fibrations: The Topological Structure of Knotted Smectic Defects</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.04670</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.04670v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, we investigate the topological properties of knotted defects in smectic liquid crystals. Our story begins with screw dislocations, whose radial surface structure can be smoothly accommodated on $S^3$ for fibred knots by using the corresponding knot fibration. To understand how a smectic texture may take on a screw dislocation in the shape of a knot without a fibration, we study first knotted edge defects. Unlike screw defects, knotted edge dislocations force singular points in the system for any non-trivial knot. We provide a lower bound on the number of such point defects required for a given edge dislocation knot and draw an analogy between the point defect structure of knotted edge dislocations and that of focal conic domains. By showing that edge dislocations, too, are sensitive to knot fibredness, we reinterpret the so-called Morse-Novikov points required for non-fibred screw dislocation knots as analogous smectic defects. Our methods are then applied to $+1/2$ and negative-charge disclinations in the smectic phase, furthering the analogy between knotted smectic defects and focal conic domains and uncovering an intricate relationship between point and line defects in smectic liquid crystals. The connection between smectic defects and knot theory not only unravels the uniquely topological knotting of smectic defects but also provides a mathematical and experimental playground for modern questions in knot and Morse-Novikov theory.</description>

      <title>Atomistic analysis of nematic phase transition in 4-cyano-4$^{\prime}$-$n$-alkyl biphenyl liquid crystals: Sampling for the first-order phase transition and the free-energy decomposition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.04718</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.04718v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Molecular dynamics (MD) simulations were conducted using the generalized replica exchange method (gREM) on the 4-cyano-4$^{\prime}$-$n$-alkylbiphenyl ($n$CB) system with $n=5$, 6, 7, and 8, which exhibits a nematic-isotropic (NI) phase transition. Sampling near the phase transition temperature in systems undergoing first-order phase transitions, such as the NI phase transition, is demanding due to the substantial energy gap between the two phases. To address this, gREM, specifically designed for first-order phase transitions, was utilized to enhance sampling near the NI phase transition temperature. Free-energy calculations based on the energy representation (ER) theory were employed to characterize the NI phase transition. ER evaluates the insertion free energy of $n$CB molecule for both nematic and isotropic phases, revealing a change in the temperature dependence across the NI phase transition. Further decomposition into intermolecular interaction energetic and entropic terms shows quantitatively the balance between these contributions at the NI phase transition temperature.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.04829v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Droplets on rough surfaces can exhibit various stationary states that are crucial for designing hydrophobic materials and enabling directional liquid transport. Here we introduce a phase-field saddle dynamics method to construct the solution landscape of wetting transition and directional transport on pillared substrates. By applying this method, we reveal the full range of Cassie-Baxter and Wenzel states, along with the complete wetting transition paths. We further elucidate the mechanisms of directional droplet transport on both hydrophobic and hydrophilic surfaces, demonstrating how surface design can influence directional movement.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.04890v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The mechanisms of electrostatic interactions between two charged dielectric spheres inside a polarizable medium have been investigated, in terms of hypothetical effective dipoles that depict how the positive and negative charge in each particle are separated. Our findings, which revealed that it is possible for polarization-induced opposite-charge repulsion to occur at short interparticle separations if the dielectric constant of the medium is greater than the dielectric constants of both spheres, provide insights into the physics of charge separation behind such counterintuitive behaviour.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.04100v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: An optimal microswimmer with a given geometry has a surface velocity profile that minimizes energy dissipation for a given swimming speed. An axisymmetric swimmer can be puller-, pusher-, or neutral-type depending on the sign of the stresslet strength. We numerically investigate the type of optimal surface-driven active microswimmers using a minimum dissipation theorem for optimum microswimmers. We examine the hydrodynamic resistance and stresslet strength with nonlinear dependence on various deformation modes. The results show that microswimmers with fore-and-aft symmetry exhibit neutral-type behavior, while asymmetrical geometries exhibit pusher-, puller-type or neutral-type behavior, depending on the dominant deformation mode and the nonlinear dependence of the stresslet for an optimum microswimmer on deformation mode and amplitude.</description>

      <title>Thickness-dependent conductivity of nanometric semiconductor thin films</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.04116</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.04116v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The miniaturization of electronic devices has led to the prominence, in technological applications, of semiconductor thin films that are only a few nanomenters thick. In spite of intense research, the thickness-dependent resistivity or conductivity of semiconductor thin films is not understood at a fundamental physical level. We develop a theory based on quantum confinement which yields the dependence of the concentration of intrinsic carriers on the film thickness. The theory predicts that the resistivity $\rho$, in the 1-10 nm thickness range, increases exponentially as $\rho \sim \exp(const/L^{1/2})$ upon decreasing the film thickness $L$. This law is able to reproduce the remarkable increase in resistivity observed experimentally in Si thin films, whereas the effect of surface scattering (Fuchs-Sondheimer theory) alone cannot explain the data when the film thickness is lower than 10 nm.</description>

      <title>Flexible framework of computing binding free energy using the energy representation theory of solution</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.04423</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.04423v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Host-guest binding plays a crucial role in the functionality of various systems, and its efficiency is often quantified using the binding free energy, which represents the free-energy difference between the bound and dissociated states. Here, we propose a methodology to compute the binding free energy based on the energy representation (ER) theory of solution that enables us to evaluate the free-energy difference between the systems of interest with the molecular dynamics (MD) simulations. Unlike the other free-energy methods, such as the Bennett acceptance ratio (BAR), the ER theory does not require the MD simulations for hypothetical intermediate states connecting the systems of interest, leading to reduced computational costs. By constructing the thermodynamic cycle of the binding process that is suitable for the ER theory, a robust calculation of the binding free energy is realized. We apply the present method to the self-association of \textit{N}-methylacetamide (NMA) in different solvents and the binding of aspirin to $\beta$-cyclodextrin (CD) in water. In the former case, the present method estimates that the binding free energy decreases as the solvent polarity decreases. This trend is consistent with the experimental finding. For the latter system, the binding free energies for the two representative CD-aspirin bound complexes, primary (P) and secondary (S) complexes, are estimated to be $-5.12\pm 0.09$ and $-4.97\pm 0.06~\mathrm{kcalmol^{-1}}$, respectively. These values are satisfactorily close to those from the BAR method [$-4.6\pm 0.2$ and $-4.4\pm 0.2\mathrm{kcal~mol^{-1}}$ for P and S, respectively]. Furthermore, the interaction-energy component analysis reveals that the van der Waals interaction between aspirin and CD dominantly contributes to the stabilization of the bound complexes, that is in harmony with the well-known binding mechanism in the CD systems.</description>

      <title>Spotting structural defects in crystals from the topology of vibrational modes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.04720</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.04720v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Because of the inevitably disordered background, structural defects are not well-defined concepts in amorphous solids. In order to overcome this difficulty, it has been recently proposed that topological defects can be still identified in the pattern of vibrational modes, by looking at the corresponding eigenvector field at low frequency. Moreover, it has been verified that these defects strongly correlate with the location of soft spots in glasses, that are the regions more prone to plastic rearrangements. Here, we show that the topology of vibrational modes predicts the location of structural defects in crystals as well, including the cases of dislocations, disclinations and Eshelby inclusions. Our results suggest that in crystalline solids topological defects in the vibrational modes are directly connected to the well-established structural defects governing plastic deformations and present characteristics very similar to those observed in amorphous solids.</description>

      <title>The interplay between topography and contact line pinning mechanisms on flat and superhydrophobic surfaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.04914</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.04914v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Wettability of a surface depends on both surface chemistry and topography. To move a three-phase contact line, a de-pinning force needs to be applied, which is of practical importance in various applications. However, a unified understanding and description of the de-pinning force on both flat and superhydrophobic surfaces is still lacking. This study aims to bridge the existing gap in our understanding of the three-phase contact line pinning on flat and microstructured superhydrophobic surfaces. The findings indicate that a general model, based on two different pinning mechanisms, can describe the pinning force on both flat and microstructured surfaces. We compare the general model against experimental data from literature, as well as our experiments on flat and microstructured surfaces coated with a liquid-like layer of grafted polymer chains. While this theoretical framework can be useful for designing micro-engineered surfaces on which the contact line behaviour is important, it also provides a potential experimental strategy to distinguish the contribution of defects from that of molecular re-orientation to contact line pinning on a given solid material.</description>

      <title>Deformation dynamics of an oil droplet into a crescent shape during intermittent motion</title>

Abstract: A paraffin droplet containing camphor and oil red O (dye) floating on the water surface shows spontaneous motion and deformation generated by the surface tension gradient around the droplet. We focused on the intermittent motion with a pronounced deformation into a crescent shape observed at specific concentrations of camphor and oil red O. We quantitatively analyzed the time changes in the droplet deformation and investigated the role of the oil red O by measuring the time-dependent paraffin/water interfacial tension with the pendant drop method. The observed effect can be explained by the active role of the oil red O molecules at the paraffin/water interface. The interfacial tension decreases gradually after the interface formation, allowing for the dynamic deformation of the droplet. The combination of the decrease in interfacial tension and the reduction in driving force related to camphor outflow generates intermittent motion with dynamic deformation into a crescent shape.</description>

      <title>Measuring Absolute Velocities from Non-Equilibrium Oscillations via Single-Detector 3D Dynamic Light Scattering</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.02217v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Single-detector 3D dynamic light scattering (3D-DLS) emerges as a reliable technique to determine the drift velocity of out-of-equilibrium colloidal particles. In particular, our investigation reveals the appearance of oscillations of a well-defined frequency in the autocorrelation function of the scattered intensity when particles are immersed in a medium exposed to thermally induced convection. These oscillations arise as a consequence of the directed motion of particles due to the convective motion of the fluid. The experimental results obtained for different colloidal systems are corroborated by a theoretical model and thoroughly validated with fluid dynamics and Brownian dynamics simulations. The excellent agreement between experimental, theoretical and simulation data allows us to provide a solid and comprehensive explanation of the observed physical phenomena. This study via advanced dynamic light scattering (DLS) technique offers insights into the field of non-equilibrium particle dynamics, applicable not only to colloidal suspension affected by steady-state diffusion-convection but also to other non-equilibrium situations, such as systems driven by external fields (gravitational, electric or magnetic fields, among others).</description>

      <title>Activity-induced phase transition and coarsening dynamics in dry apolar active nematics</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.11642v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Using the Lebwohl-Lasher interaction for reciprocal local alignment, we present a comprehensive phase diagram for a dry, apolar, active nematic system using its stochastic \new{off-lattice} dynamics. \new{The nematic-isotropic transition in this system is first-order and occurs alongside a fluctuation-dominated phase separation.} Our phase diagram identifies three distinct regions based on activity and orientational noise relative to alignment strength: a homogeneous isotropic phase, a nematic phase with giant density fluctuations, and a coexistence region. Using mean-field analysis and hydrodynamic theory, we demonstrate that reciprocal interactions lead to a density fluctuation-induced first-order transition and derive a phase boundary consistent with numerical results. Quenching from the isotropic to nematic phase reveals coarsening dynamics where nematic ordering precedes particle clustering. Both the nematic and density fields exhibit similar scaling behaviors, exhibiting dynamic exponents $z_S \approx 2.5$ and $z_\rho \approx 2.34$, consistently falling within the range of 2 and 3.</description>

      <title>Cell theories for the chiral crystal phase of hard equilateral triangles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.06895</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.06895v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We derive several versions of the cell theory for a crystal phase of hard equilateral triangles. To that purpose we analytically calculated the free area of a frozen oriented or freely rotating particle inside the cavity formed by its neighbours in a chiral configuration of their orientations. From the most successful versions of the theory we predict an equation of state which, despite being derived from a crystal configuration of particles, describes very reasonably the equation of state of the 6-atic liquid-crystal phase at packing fractions not very close from the isotropic-6-atic bifurcation. Also, the same equation of state performs well when compared to that from MC simulations for the stable crystal phase. The agreement can even be improved by selecting adequate values for the angle of chirality.Despite the success of two of the versions of the theory for the pressure, we show that the free-energy is an increasing function of the angle of chirality, implying that the most stable phase is the achiral phase. Furthermore, we show that possible clustering effects, such as the formation of perfect chiral hexagonal clusters, which in turn crystallize into an hexagonal lattice, cannot explain the presence of the chirality observed in simulations.</description>

      <title>Windmill droplets. Optically induced rotation of biphase oil-in-water droplets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.18539</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.18539v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In the field of microdroplet manipulation, optical tweezers have been used to form and grow droplets, to transport them, or to measure forces between droplet pairs. However, the exploration of out-of-equilibrium phenomena in optically trapped droplets remains largely uncharted. Here, we report the rotation of biphasic droplets fabricated by co-emulsifying two immiscible liquids (i.e., hydrocarbon and fluorocarbon oils) with a refractive index mismatch in water. When trapped, droplets of a specific geometry rotate around the axis of the laser beam, in what appears to be a dissipative, out-of-equilibrium phenomenon. The rotational frequency, obtained from image analysis is stable and proportional to the beam power. Remarkably, droplets that do not interact with the trapping beam can also be rotated indirectly. This is achieved by positioning the droplets at the center of a circular arrangement of multiple, sequentially activated traps. In this case, the droplet orients towards the location of the active trap by a mechanism yet to be understood. Altogether, our results demonstrate out-from-equilibrium phenomenology in optically trapped biphase droplets, which could inspire the development of devices based on them (e.g., optically induced mixing, etc.). In addition, they may shed light on fundamental principles of optical manipulation of asymmetric particles.</description>

      <title>Condensates in aggregation processes with input: A new power law and intermittency</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.09827</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.09827v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Large-mass condensates, which coexist with a power-law-decaying distribution in the one-dimensional Takayasu model of mass aggregation with input, were recently found in numerical simulations. Here we establish the occurrence of condensates by analyzing exact recursions for finite systems, and further show that they have a strong effect on the properties of the system. In the steady state of a large but finite system, there is a single condensate, whose random movement through the system leads to a reorganization of the mass profile on a macroscopic scale. A scaling analysis of the mean mass and standard deviation at different distances from the condensate leads to the surprising conclusion that the mass distribution on a macroscopic number of sites around the condensate follows a power-law decay with an exponent 5/3, while further-away sites show the customary Takayasu exponent 4/3, with a crossover in between. Finally, the exit of condensates from a system with open boundaries has a strong effect on the temporal fluctuations of the total mass in the steady state. Their departure is followed by a build-up of mass and subsequent departures, leading to strong intermittency, established through a divergence of the flatness as the scaled time approaches zero.</description>
