      <title>Wavelength calibration and spectral sensitivity correction of luminescence measurements for dosimetry applications: method comparison tested on the IR-RF of K-feldspar</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.07991</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.07991v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Spectroscopic investigations provide important insights into the composition of luminescence emissions relevant to trapped-charge dating of sediments. Accurate wavelength calibration and a correction for the wavelength-dependent detection efficiency of the spectrometer system are crucial to ensure the correct spectrum interpretation and allow for its comparison with those obtained from other systems. However, to achieve an accurate detection efficiency correction, it is necessary to obtain the device-specific spectral response function (SRF). Here, we compare two SRF approximation methods by using either a calibration lamp of known irradiance or calculating the product of efficiency curves provided by the manufacturers of all known optical elements. We discuss the results using radiofluorescence (RF) measurements of two K-feldspar samples as an example. Feldspar infra-red (IR) RF spectra are known to be composed of several overlapping emissions, whose variation with sample mineralogy is still poorly understood and requires more extensive investigations. We find that both methods of sensitivity correction yield broadly similar results. However, the observed differences can alter a spectrum's interpretation. For example, we observe that after peak deconvolution the maximum signal wavelength of the IR-RF peak used for dating applications differs by ~3-13 nm between the two methods, depending on sample and diffraction grating. We recommend using calibration lamps to determine a device's SRF but highlight the need to consider issues such as higher-order signals in the choice of filters to establish the SRF's reliable wavelength range. Additionally, we find that a simple and inexpensive fluorescent white light yields an acceptable wavelength calibration comparable to that obtained from a specialized light source.</description>

      <title>General theory of moving Fabry-Perot</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.08176</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.08176v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In a follow-up effort to our prior report on the optical transmission of a moving Fabry-Perot \cite{Pyvovar}, this work seeks to establish a general framework that describes the transmission and reflection properties of a Fabry-Perot interferometer when key components in its operation system, including the light source, the detector and the interferometer itself, have relative motions against each other along their common optical axis. Our analysis indicates that these movements result in various new factors in the transmission and reflection coefficients, which all find their roots in the Doppler effect. As a demonstration of its potential application, the new theory is applied to the Pound-Drever-Hall frequency-locking technique. It is shown that velocity-induced frequency modulations are effectively added to the laser frequency due to the motions, and such excess frequency noise can be impactful in certain applications.</description>

      <title>Design and Fabrication of Ultrahigh Q Chip-Based Silica WGM Micro-resonators for Single-Atom Cavity-QED</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.08257</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.08257v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Of the many applications of whispering-gallery mode (WGM) microresonators, Single-atom cavity-QED poses the most extreme demands on mode-volume and quality factor. Here we present a model-based procedure for the fabrication of small mode-volume ultrahigh Q silica WGM microresonators of varying geometries, from toroidal to micro-spheres. We experimentally demonstrate WGM resonators with ultra-high qualities as high as $1.7\times 10^8$ at 780nm. We present a theoretical model that allows tailoring the recipe to attain the desired geometry of the fabricated WGM microresonators.</description>

      <title>A Stress Induced Source of Phonon Bursts and Quasiparticle Poisoning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2208.02790</link>
      <description>arXiv:2208.02790v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The performance of superconducting qubits is degraded by a poorly characterized set of energy sources breaking the Cooper pairs responsible for superconductivity, creating a condition often called ``quasiparticle poisoning". Both superconducting qubits and low threshold dark matter calorimeters have observed excess bursts of quasiparticles or phonons that decrease in rate with time. Here, we show that a silicon crystal glued to its holder exhibits a rate of low-energy phonon events that is more than two orders of magnitude larger than in a functionally identical crystal suspended from its holder in a low-stress state. The excess phonon event rate in the glued crystal decreases with time since cooldown, consistent with a source of phonon bursts which contributes to quasiparticle poisoning in quantum circuits and the low-energy events observed in cryogenic calorimeters. We argue that relaxation of thermally induced stress between the glue and crystal is the source of these events.</description>

      <title>A method to observe field-region oxide charge and inter-electrode isolation from $CV$-characteristics of $n$-on-$p$ devices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.04365</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.04365v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: $N$-on-$p$ silicon sensors will be utilized in the Compact Muon Solenoid (CMS) detector's tracker and High Granularity Calorimeter (HGCAL) in the High Luminosity upgrade of the Large Hadron Collider (HL-LHC). Among their several advantages in terms of radiation hardness over the traditional $p$-on-$n$ sensors in the extreme radiation environment of the HL-LHC are electron collection instead of holes and overlapping maxima of weighting and electric fields at the charge-collecting electrodes. The disadvantage of the multi-channel SiO$_2$-passivated $n$-on-$p$ sensors is the generation of an inversion layer under the Si/SiO$_2$-interface by a positive interface-oxide-charge ($N_\textrm{ox}$) that at high densities can compromise the position resolution by creating a conduction channel between the electrodes. This issue is typically addressed by including additional isolation implants ($p$-stop, $p$-spray) between $n^+$-electrodes. Focusing on the guard-ring regions of $n$-on-$p$ sensors where no isolation implants are applied between the electrodes, a capacitance-voltage ($CV$) characterization study of both 6-inch wafer test diodes and 8-inch HGCAL prototype and pre-series sensors showed a distinct threshold voltage ($V_\textrm{th,iso}$) in the $CV$-characteristics of a biased $n^+$-electrode when its enclosing guard-ring was left floating. When reproduced by simulations, the measured $V_\textrm{th,iso}$ was found to contain information on the field-region $N_\textrm{ox}$ and indicate the threshold where the two electrodes become electrically isolated by the influence of the reverse bias voltage. Together with previous studies on the inter-electrode isolation of irradiated $n$-on-$p$ sensors, the results indicate that position sensitive $n$-on-$p$ sensors without isolation implants may be feasible in future HEP experiments.</description>

      <title>Resistance standards with calculable, nearly negligible AC-DC difference at frequencies up to 2 MHz for the calibration of precision LCR meters</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.17805</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.17805v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We have developed novel impedance standards based on thin-film surface-mount-device (SMD) resistors. Due to the small dimensions of such resistors, the quantities determining their frequency dependence are very small and can be either measured or numerically calculated. A series connection of thin-film SMD resistors allows us to further improve the DC and the AC properties. The nominal resistance value of our application is 12.906 kohm but other values are just as possible. At frequencies up to 2 MHz, the calculated frequency dependence amounts to only a few parts per million of the DC value, which is about four orders of magnitude smaller than for all conventional calculable AC-DC resistors having a similar nominal DC value. To measure the frequency dependence, we use a precision inductance-capacitance-resistance (LCR) meter at frequencies up to 2 MHz that has a reproducibility of a few parts per million but a systematic uncertainty which is specified by the manufacturer to increase from 300 parts per million in the lower frequency range to 3000 parts per million at 2 MHz. Measurements of two very different SMD-based resistance standards allow verification of the model calculation as well as the calibration of the precision LCR meter, both with a relative uncertainty of a few parts per million in the whole frequency range. This boost in precision enables new applications in this frequency range such as the verification of conventional calculable resistance standards, the calibration of impedance standards, and future measurements of the quantum Hall resistance.</description>
