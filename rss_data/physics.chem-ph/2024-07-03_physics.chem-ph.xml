      <title>Time-Dependent Density Functional Theory Simulation for Analyzing Neutralization Process of Hydrogen Ion Injected onto Tungsten Surfaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.02849</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.02849v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We have performed time-dependent density functional theory simulations for the neutralization process of a hydrogen ion injected at 100eV onto the (110) surface of tungsten material. We have also proposed a method for evaluating the detection probability of electrons in a small region. This probability is interpreted as that of detecting hydrogen in each state: positive ion, neutral atom, and negative ion. As a result, the probabilities of detecting hydrogen after a collision as a positive ion, neutral atom, and negative ion were approximately 30 percent, 50 percent, and 20 percent, respectively.</description>

      <title>Open quantum dynamics with variational non-Gaussian states and the truncated Wigner approximation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.02617</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.02617v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a framework for simulating the open dynamics of spin-boson systems by combing variational non-Gaussian states with a quantum trajectories approach. We apply this method to a generic spin-boson Hamiltonian that has both Tavis-Cummings and Holstein type couplings, and which has broad applications to a variety of quantum simulation platforms, polaritonic physics, and quantum chemistry. Additionally, we discuss how the recently developed truncated Wigner approximation for open quantum systems can be applied to the same Hamiltonian. We benchmark the performance of both methods and identify the regimes where each method is best suited to. Finally we discuss strategies to improve each technique.</description>

      <title>Diffusion of individual nanoparticles in cylindrical diatom frustule</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.03028</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.03028v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Diatoms are characterised by silica cell walls (frustules), which have highly ordered micro-/nano-structures. As the synthesis of such structures remains challenging, diatom frustules offer a promissing alternative to conventional porous particles in micro-/nano-engineering. In particular, for applications in drag deliverly systems, biosensors, and filters, an understanding of particle motion inside diatoms is of great impotance. In this study, we investigated nanoparticle (NP) motions inside diatom frustules using the single particle tracking (SPT) method. For these measruements, the diameter of the NP was about one-tenth smaller than that of the frustule. Inside the frustule, the diffusion motions of the NPs were suppressed, but this suppression was weakened near the exit of the frustule. Moreover, diffusion anisotropy between the axial and radial directions of the frustule was observed. This anisotropy is difficult to detect with ensemble methods; thus, the SPT method is a powerful approach for investigating NP motions in frustules.</description>

      <title>Controlling Plasmonic Catalysis via Strong Coupling with Electromagnetic Resonators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.03191</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.03191v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Plasmonic excitations decay within femtoseconds, leaving non-thermal (often referred to as "hot") charge carriers behind that can be injected into molecular structures to trigger chemical reactions that are otherwise out of reach -- a process known as plasmonic catalysis. In this Letter, we demonstrate that strong coupling between resonator structures and plasmonic nanoparticles can be used to control the spectral overlap between the plasmonic excitation energy and the charge injection energy into nearby molecules. Our atomistic description couples real-time density-functional theory self-consistently to Maxwell's equations via the radiation-reaction potential. Control over the resonator provides then an additional knob for non-intrusively enhancing plasmonic catalysis and dynamically reacting to deterioration of the catalyst -- a new facet of modern catalysis.</description>

      <title>Picosecond lifetimes of hydrogen bonds in the halide perovskite CH$_3$NH$_3$PbBr$_3$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.03244</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.03244v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The structures and properties of organic-inorganic perovskites are influenced by the hydrogen bonding between the organic cations and the inorganic octahedral networks. This study explores the dynamics of hydrogen bonds in CH$_3$NH$_3$PbBr$_3$ across a temperature range from 70 K to 350 K, using molecular dynamics simulations with machine-learning force fields. The results indicate that the lifetime of hydrogen bonds decreases with increasing temperature from 7.6 ps (70 K) to 0.16 ps (350 K), exhibiting Arrhenius-type behaviour. The geometric conditions for hydrogen bonding, which include bond lengths and angles, maintain consistency across the full temperature range. The relevance of hydrogen bonds for the vibrational states of the material is also evidenced through a detailed analysis of the vibrational power spectra, demonstrating their significant effect on the physical properties for this class of perovskites.</description>

      <title>Memory Kernel Coupling Theory: Obtain Time Correlation Function from Higher-order Moments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.01923</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.01923v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Dynamical observables can often be described by time correlation functions (TCFs). However, efficiently calculating TCFs for complex quantum systems is a significant challenge, which generally requires solving the full dynamics of the systems. This Letter presents the memory kernel coupling theory (MKCT), a general formalism for evaluating TCFs. The MKCT builds upon Mori's memory kernel formalism for TCFs. Our theory further decomposes the memory kernel into auxiliary kernels. Rapid decay of auxiliary kernels allows us to truncate the coupled equations of motion with high accuracy. Notably, only higher-order moments are sufficient as the input for obtaining TCFs. While this formalism is general, we carry out the numerical demonstration for a typical open quantum system--the spin-boson model.</description>

      <title>Enantiospecificity in NMR Enabled by Chirality-Induced Spin Selectivity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.00861</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.00861v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Spin polarization in chiral molecules is a magnetic molecular response associated with electron transport and enantioselective bond polarization that occurs even in the absence of an external magnetic field. An unexpected finding by Santos and co-workers reported enantiospecific NMR responses in solid-state cross-polarization (CP) experiments, suggesting a possible additional contribution to the indirect nuclear spin-spin coupling in chiral molecules induced by bond polarization in the presence of spin-orbit coupling. Herein we provide a theoretical treatment for this phenomenon, presenting an effective spin-Hamiltonian for helical molecules like DNA and density functional theory (DFT) results on amino acids that confirm the dependence of J-couplings on the choice of enantiomer. The connection between nuclear spin dynamics and chirality could offer insights for molecular sensing and quantum information sciences. These results establish NMR as a potential tool for chiral discrimination without external agents.</description>
