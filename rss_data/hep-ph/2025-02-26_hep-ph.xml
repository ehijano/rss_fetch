      <title>Determining the Density of the Sun with Neutrinos</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.17546</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.17546v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The discovery of solar neutrinos confirmed that the inner workings of the Sun generally match our theoretical understanding of the fusion process. Solar neutrinos have also played a role in discovering that neutrinos have mass and that they oscillate. We combine the latest solar neutrino data along with other oscillation data from reactors to determine the Sun's density profile. We derive constraints given the current data and show the anticipated improvements with more reactor neutrino data from JUNO constraining the true oscillation parameters and more solar neutrino data from DUNE which should provide a crucial measurement of $hep$ neutrinos.</description>

      <title>Vector Spaces for Dark Matter (VSDM): Fast Direct Detection Calculations with Python and Julia</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.17547</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.17547v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Anisotropic target materials are promising candidates for dark matter direct detection experiments, providing a directional sensitivity that can be used to distinguish a dark matter (DM) signal from the various Standard Model backgrounds. In this paper we introduce the Julia and Python implementations of \emph{Vector Spaces for Dark Matter} (VSDM), which handle the difficult scattering rate computation for these rotating, three-dimensional response functions by calculating a partial rate matrix for every combination of DM velocity distribution, material response function, and particle DM properties.</description>

      <title>Collinear Approximations for LHC Cross Sections: Factorization and Resummation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.17548</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.17548v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We explore a factorization theorem for color singlet production cross sections at the LHC in the limit of additional radiation becoming collinear to the direction of either of the colliding protons. The resulting formula approximates the cross section as a function of the Born variables of the color singlet final state, specifically its mass and rapidity. We analyze the quality of this approximation and study its limitations at the example of gluon-fusion Higgs boson production and Drell-Yan production through next-to-next-to-leading order in QCD perturbation theory. Furthermore, we resum logarithms enhanced in the collinear limit to next-to-next-to-next-to-leading logarithmic accuracy for our two example processes. We conclude that this framework of collinear approximation is a natural successor to the threshold approximation and resummation for inclusive and differential observables in color-neutral processes.</description>

      <title>Emergent Hydrodynamic Mode on SU(2) Plaquette Chains and Quantum Simulation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.17551</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.17551v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We search for emergent hydrodynamic modes in real-time Hamiltonian dynamics of $2+1$-dimensional SU(2) lattice gauge theory on a quasi one dimensional plaquette chain, by numerically computing symmetric correlation functions of energy densities on lattice sizes of about $20$ with the local Hilbert space truncated at $j_{\rm max}=\frac{1}{2}$. Due to the Umklapp processes, we only find a mode for energy diffusion. The symmetric correlator exhibits transport peak near zero frequency with a width proportional to momentum squared at small momentum, when the system is fully quantum ergodic, as indicated by the eigenenergy level statistics. This transport peak leads to a power-law $t^{-\frac{1}{2}}$ decay of the symmetric correlator at late time, also known as the long-time tail, as well as diffusion-like spreading in position space. We also introduce a quantum algorithm for computing the symmetric correlator on a quantum computer and find it gives results consistent with exact diagonalization when tested on the IBM emulator. Finally we discuss the future prospect of searching for the sound modes.</description>

      <title>Real-time simulation of jet energy loss and entropy production in high-energy scattering with matter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.17558</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.17558v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In analogy to high-energy nuclear scattering experiments, we study a real-time scattering process between a propagating state and a dense target in $1+1$-d massive QED. In our setup, we identify three distinct regimes that qualitatively characterize the evolution: for a dilute medium, the incoming probe state evolves nearly ballistically; in an intermediate setting, it traverses the matter, locally exciting it; and for dense targets, one approaches a black-disk limit, where the matter acts as a strong wall potential. We find evidence that the probe's energy loss rate scales linearly with the path length in the medium, and we study how the entanglement entropy reveals the mixing between the probe and medium states. With the goal of one day replicating high-energy nuclear experiments in quantum devices, we briefly discuss how the current tensor network-based simulations can be translated to a quantum simulator.</description>

      <title>Single pion resonant production in BSM scenarios: cross sections and form factors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.17573</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.17573v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a comprehensive theoretical framework describing single pion resonant production through inelastic dark fermion-nucleon interactions mediated by resonances in the GeV-scale regime. Building upon the Rein-Sehgal approach, we derive differential cross sections for processes in which an incoming dark fermion scatters off a nucleon, exciting a resonance that subsequently decays into a nucleon and a pion. Our formulation accommodates various mediator types-namely, dark photons with vector and axial couplings, as well as scalar and pseudoscalar mediators-thereby extending the conventional approach that Rein, Sehgal and Berger performed for neutrino interactions. Transition form factors for the nucleon-to-resonance conversion are computed using the relativistic harmonic-oscillator quark model from Feynman, Kislinger and Ravndal, while a Breit-Wigner prescription is employed to incorporate finite resonance widths. This framework offers a robust tool for interpreting experimental data in dark sector and matter searches and represents a contribution to elucidate the role of resonances in GeV-scale phenomenology.</description>

      <title>Listening for ultra-heavy dark matter with underwater acoustic detectors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.17593</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.17593v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Ultra-heavy dark matter is a class of candidates for which direct detection experiments are ineffective due to the suppressed dark matter flux. We explore the potential of large underwater acoustic arrays, developed for ultra-high energy neutrino detection, to detect ultra-heavy dark matter. As ultra-heavy dark matter traverses seawater, it deposits energy through nuclear scattering, generating thermo-acoustic waves detectable by hydrophones. We derive the dark matter-induced acoustic pressure wave from first principles and characterise attenuation effects, including frequency-dependent modifications due to viscous and chemical relaxation effects in seawater, providing an improved framework for signal modelling. Our sensitivity analysis for a hypothetical 100 cubic kilometre hydrophone array in the Mediterranean Sea shows that such an array could probe unexplored regions of parameter space for ultra-heavy dark matter, with sensitivity to both spin-independent and spin-dependent interactions. Our results establish acoustic detection as a promising dark matter search method, paving the way for analysing existing hydrophone data and guiding future detector designs.</description>

      <title>Unraveling particle dark matter with Physics-Informed Neural Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.17597</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.17597v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We parametrically solve the Boltzmann equations governing freeze-in dark matter (DM) in alternative cosmologies with Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs), a mesh-free method. Through inverse PINNs, using a single DM experimental point -- observed relic density -- we determine the physical attributes of the theory, namely power-law cosmologies, inspired by braneworld scenarios, and particle interaction cross sections. The expansion of the Universe in such alternative cosmologies has been parameterized through a switch-like function reproducing the Hubble law at later times. Without loss of generality, we model more realistically this transition with a smooth function. We predict a distinct pair-wise relationship between power-law exponent and particle interactions: for a given cosmology with negative (positive) exponent, smaller (larger) cross sections are required to reproduce the data. Lastly, via Bayesian methods, we quantify the epistemic uncertainty of theoretical parameters found in inverse problems.</description>

      <title>Resummation for $s$-channel single-top production</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.17631</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.17631v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: I present results for $s$-channel single-top-quark production using soft-gluon resummation. I show that the soft-gluon corrections provide the dominant contribution to the QCD corrections, and that they approximate very well the exact results through NNLO. Furthermore, approximate N$^3$LO corrections are computed. The calculation treats the final-state $b$-quarks as massless but I also show how to extend the formalism to the case of massive $b$-quarks. The higher-order corrections are large at LHC energies and they improve the theoretical accuracy.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2502.17743v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Exclusive $J/\psi$ production is investigated in proton-proton ultraperipheral collisions within GPD approach. Three
  sets gluon density are used in the calculations of $J/\psi$ production. The survival factors and equivalent photon approximation are applied to predict
  the $J/\psi$ photoproduction in proton-proton ultraperipheral collisions. The GPD model predictions give a good agreement with the experimental data
  at LHCb. The exclusive $J/\psi$ production at RHIC and NICA proton-proton ultraperipheral
  collisions are performed. These predictions of GPD approach can be employed to estimate the $J/\psi$ cross sections
  in future proton-proton collisions.</description>

      <title>Fragmentation functions of charged hadrons at next-to-next-to-leading order and constraints on proton PDFs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.17837</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.17837v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present the first global analysis of fragmentation functions (FFs) for light charged hadrons ($\pi^{\pm}$, $K^{\pm}$) at full next-to-next-to-leading order in Quantum Chromodynamics (QCD), incorporating world data from both single-inclusive electron-positron annihilation and semi-inclusive deep-inelastic scattering. The collinear factorization has been tested with low-momentum-transfer data and has demonstrated success at high hadron momenta. Additionally, we perform a joint determination of both parton distribution functions (PDFs) and FFs. Our findings indicate that the current global data on hadron production favor a reduced asymmetry in the strange (anti-) quark PDFs, as compared to the asymmetry predicted by state-of-the-art PDFs derived from inclusive data.</description>

      <title>Five-body systems with Bethe-Salpeter equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.17944</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.17944v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We extend the Bethe-Salpeter formalism to systems made of five valence particles. Restricting ourselves to two-body interactions, we derive the subtraction terms necessary to prevent overcounting. We solve the five-body Bethe-Salpeter equation numerically for a system of five scalar particles interacting by a scalar exchange boson. To make the calculations tractable, we implement properties of the permutation group S5 and construct an approximation based on intermediate two- and three-body poles. We extract the five-body ground and excited states along with the spectra obtained from the two-, three-, and four-body equations. In the limit of a massless exchange particle, the two-, three, four- and five-body states coexist within a certain range of the coupling strength, whereas for heavier exchange particles the five-body system becomes Borromean. Our study serves as a building block for the calculation of pentaquark properties using functional methods.</description>

      <title>Constraints on asymmetric production of long-lived scalars at the Large Hadron Collider</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.18021</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.18021v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Searches for pair-produced long-lived particles (LLPs) at the LHC commonly operate under the assumption that the two LLPs are identical. In this paper we entertain the possibility that the targeted final states are, instead, induced by a LLP pair with different masses and/or lifetimes. We propose a simple and intuitively-parametrised toy model in order to study such asymmetric production of LLPs. Using the recasting material of a recent search for displaced jets by the ATLAS collaboration, we demonstrate that we can set constraints on the production cross-section times branching fraction into jets for a variety of asymmetric LLP and mediator mass combinations.</description>

      <title>Unified neutrino mixing and approximate $\mu$-$\tau$ reflection symmetry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.18029</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.18029v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the phenomenology of a unified neutrino mixing framework, which serves as the origin of well-known neutrino mixing schemes such as the tribimaximal mixing (TBM), bimaximal mixing (BM), golden ratio mixing (GRM) and hexagonal mixing (HM). Our analysis reveals that the predicted sum of neutrino masses derived from an approximate $\mu$-$\tau$ reflection symmetric flavor neutrino mass matrix based on the unified neutrino mixing with an inverted mass ordering, is excluded from DESI2024 and Supernova Ia luminosity distance data. This conclusion implies that TBM, BM, GRM, and HM, under an approximate $\mu$-$\tau$ reflection symmetry with an inverted mass ordering of neutrinos, are also excluded from observations.</description>

Abstract: We discuss general criteria that could guide us in applying quantum algorithms/computers to problems in high-energy physics. We then discuss the particular example of parton showers with quantum interference. We summarize the basic ideas behind the classical and quantum parton shower Monte Carlo algorithms and highlight the importance of quantum/classical hybrid algorithms. Our finding in quantum parton showers could serve as a useful case study for further exploration of quantum algorithms/computers in high-energy physics.</description>

      <title>Lepton flavor violating decays $l_j\rightarrow l_i\gamma$, $l_j \rightarrow 3l_i$ and $\mu\rightarrow e+ q\bar q$ in the N-B-LSSM</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.18130</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.18130v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The N-B-LSSM is an extension of the minimal supersymmetric standard model (MSSM) with the addition of three singlet new Higgs superfields and right-handed neutrinos, whose local gauge group is $SU(3)_C\times SU(2)_L\times U(1)_Y\times U(1)_{B-L}$. In the N-B-LSSM, we study lepton flavor violating decays $l_j\rightarrow l_i\gamma$, $l_j \rightarrow 3l_i$ and $\mu\rightarrow e+ q\bar q$ $(j=\tau,\mu,~i=\mu,e$ and $i\neq j)$. Based on the current experimental limitations, we carry out detailed parameter scanning and numerical calculations to analyse the effects of different sensitive parameters on lepton flavor violation (LFV) in the N-B-LSSM. The numerical results show that the non-diagonal elements involving the initial and final leptons are main sensitive parameters and LFV sources. This work can provide a strong basis for exploring new physics (NP) beyond the Standard Model (SM).</description>

      <description>arXiv:2502.18175v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We demonstrate that measurements of Coherent Elastic Neutrino-Nucleus Scattering (CE$\nu$NS) at spallation sources are valuable probes of muon-decay physics. Using COHERENT data we derive the first direct constraint on the Michel parameters governing the $\bar\nu_\mu$ energy distribution. We also discuss future sensitivities and assess the implications for the Lorentz structure of the interactions mediating muon decay.</description>

      <title>Constraints on Lorentz invariance violation in neutrino sector from the ultra-high-energy event KM3-230213A</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.18256</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.18256v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Lorentz invariance is a fundamental symmetry of spacetime and serves as the cornerstone of modern physics, supporting the constancy of the speed of light. A crucial implication of this principle is that no particle can propagate faster than this universal speed limit. In this study, we present a stringent neutrino-based test of Lorentz invariance, utilizing the highest-energy neutrino ever detected, known as event KM3-230213A. The detection of this neutrino, with measured energy of approximately 220 PeV, allows us to establish a lower bound on the scale of second-order Lorentz invariance violation, quantified as \(\Lambda_2&gt;5.0\times 10^{19}\) GeV at 90 \% confidence level.</description>

      <title>Exploring sub-GeV dark matter via $s$-wave, $p$-wave, and resonance annihilation with CMB data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.18263</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.18263v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We revisit constraints on sub-GeV dark matter (DM) annihilation via $s$-wave, $p$-wave, and resonance processes using current and future CMB data from Planck, FIRAS, and upcoming experiments as LiteBird, CMB-S4, PRISTINE, and PIXIE. For $s$-wave annihilation, we provide updated limits for both $e^{+}e^{-}$ and $\pi\pi$ channels, with the profile likelihood method yielding stronger constraints than marginal posterior method. In the $p$-wave case, we comprehensively conduct a model-independent inequality for the 95\% upper limits from FIRAS, PRISTINE, and PIXIE, with future experiments expected to surpass current BBN limits. For resonance annihilation, we report -- for the first time -- the $95\%$ upper limits on the decay branching ratio of the mediator particle, when resonances peak during the recombination epoch. Overall, our study highlights the complementary strengths of $\mu$-distortion and CMB anisotropies in probing sub-GeV DM annihilation.</description>

      <title>On the momentum space structure of the quark propagator</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.18335</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.18335v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The structure of the quark propagator in momentum space is explored taking into account non-perturbative QCD dynamics constraints for the quark spectral densities derived previously. We assume that the scalar and vector component of the quark propagator share a simple pole but not its residuum, together with other structures. Furthermore, a connection between the poles of the quark propagator and the zeros of the quark wave function $Z(p^2)$ is established. Asymptotic scaling laws for the representation of the quark propagator, after removing the shared pole, are also derived. The confrontation of our results with lattice data for the full QCD quark propagator data are in good agreement. Exploring the link with the lattice data and looking at the Bethe-Salpeter vertex and amplitude, in the chiral limit, we are able to provide estimations for these quantities, for $f_\pi$ and for the shared pole mass. The pole mass reproduces the constituent quark mass used in the quark models.</description>

      <title>Rotational stability of magnetic field in rotating quark-gluon plasma</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.18354</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.18354v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Relaxation of the magnetic field in rigidly rotating quark-gluon plasma is studied. It is shown that the infrared modes satisfying $k &lt; |m|\Omega$ and $k&lt; |m\pm 1|\Omega$, where integer $m$ is the projection of the orbital angular momentum along the rotating axis and $\Omega$ is the angular velocity, are unstable. The instability onset time and the magnetic field growth rate are computed for a standard initial profile of the magnetic field. Given the present phenomenological values of $\Omega$ and electrical conductivity $\sigma$ the instability is not expected to be a significant factor in the field's time evolution.</description>

      <title>The $D_{s1}(2460) \to D_s \pi^+ \pi^- $ decay from a $D_{s1}$ molecular perspective</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.18401</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.18401v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We conduct a theoretical study of the $ D_{s1}(2460) \to D_s \pi^+ \pi^- $ decay from the perspective that the $D_{s1}$ is a molecular state, built mostly from the $D^* K$ and $D_s^* \eta$ components. The $D^*$ and $D_s^*$ mesons are allowed to decay into two pseudoscalars, with one of them merging with the other pseudoscalar that forms the $D_{s1}$ state, ultimately leading to the $\pi^+ \pi^- D_s$ final state. This results in a triangle diagram mechanism where all theoretical ingredients are well-known, leading to a free parameter framework. We evaluate the mass distributions of particle pairs and find good agreement with the experimental distributions of a recent LHCb experiment, providing strong support to the molecular picture of the $D_{s1}(2460)$ state. We also discuss the role played by the scalar mesons $f_0(500)$ and $f_0(980)$, at odds with the interpretation of the experimental analysis.</description>

      <title>Maximal Magic for Two-qubit States</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.17550</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.17550v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Magic is a quantum resource essential for universal quantum computation and represents the deviation of quantum states from those that can be simulated efficiently using classical algorithms. Using the Stabilizer R\'enyi Entropy (SRE), we investigate two-qubit states with maximal magic, which are most distinct from classical simulability, and provide strong numerical evidence that the maximal second order SRE is $\log (16/7)\approx 0.827$, establishing a tighter bound than the prior $\log(5/2)\approx 0.916$. We identity 480 states saturating the new bound, which turn out to be the fiducial states for the mutually unbiased bases (MUBs) generated by the orbits of the Weyl-Heisenberg (WH) group, and conjecture that WH-MUBs are the maximal magic states for $n$-qubit, when $n\neq 1$ and 3. We also reveal a striking interplay between magic and entanglement: the entanglement of maximal magic states is restricted to two possible values, $1/2$ and $1/\sqrt{2}$, as quantified by the concurrence; none is maximally entangled.</description>

      <title>Effects of spacetime geometry on neutrino oscillation inside a Core-Collapse Supernova</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.17570</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.17570v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Neutrinos are excellent probes of the inner structures of supernovas. However, an understanding of their dynamics remains incomplete, which is crucial for properly interpreting the detector data. The huge matter density inside a core-collapse supernova affects the self-coupling of the neutrinos through a geometrical four-fermion interaction induced by spacetime torsion generated by the fermions themselves. For normal mass hierarchy, the effect is negligible; for inverted mass hierarchy however, we find that the gravitational coupling can significantly alter the flavor dynamics. The possibility of constraining the said interactions through the relative abundance of different flavors of the neutrinos is discussed.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2502.17634v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The role of radiative corrections in low energy nuclear physics is beginning to receive more scrutiny. We examine the impact of these corrections for the deuteron charge form factor and the radiative capture process $np \to d \gamma$ through the velocity renormalization group. In both cases, we find percent level shifts in the relevant observables after evolving the subtraction velocity to the typical velocity of nucleons in the bound state. This suggests that electromagnetic corrections constitute a non-negligible source of uncertainty in existing few-body calculations.</description>

      <title>Dynamical evolution of critical fluctuations with second-order baryon diffusion coupled to chiral condensate</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.17791</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.17791v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We develop a dynamical model to describe critical fluctuations in heavy-ion collisions, incorporating the baryon diffusion current and chiral condensate as dynamical degrees of freedom, to address their nontrivial scale separation. The model couples fluctuations of the chiral condensate $\sigma$ with baryon density fluctuations $n$ and the diffusion current $\nu$ based on a second-order diffusion equation with a finite relaxation time of the baryon diffusion $\tau_\mathrm{R}$. We analyze the spacetime evolution and these correlation functions of the fluctuations in one-dimensionally expanding background. We confirm that an appropriate relaxation time $\tau_\mathrm{R}$ ensures causality. We show that propagating waves with finite $\tau_\mathrm{R}$ split into two modes at the critical temperature due to a rapid change of kinetic coefficients. In the correlation functions, we find that dynamical $\sigma$ blurs the structure and peak around the critical temperature. With finite $\tau_\mathrm{R}$, the effect of the critical fluctuations persists longer into the later stages of the evolution. These findings suggest importance of dynamical effects of the chiral condensate and baryon diffusion current in identifying critical-point signals in heavy-ion collisions, where the scale separation is nontrivial.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2502.17948v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Millisecond pulsars, representing the older neutron star population, are believed to have undergone a prolonged period of dark matter accumulation, resulting in a higher dark matter content. Their extreme rotation makes them unique laboratories for studying rapidly rotating neutron stars admixed with dark matter. In this work, we model uniformly rotating neutron stars with a dark matter component that rotates independently from the baryon matter, allowing for the investigation of both co-rotating and counter-rotating scenarios. We examine the impact of dark matter rotation on the macroscopic properties of neutron stars, including the mass-radius relation, the mass-shedding Keplerian limit, and moments of inertia, for various dark matter particle masses and total fractions, considering both core and halo distributions. Our findings provide a more comprehensive understanding of how dark matter influences the equilibrium properties of rotating neutron stars, offering new insights into the astrophysical implications of self-interacting dark matter.</description>

      <title>Two- and three-meson scattering amplitudes with physical quark masses from lattice QCD</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.17976</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.17976v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study systems of two and three mesons composed of pions and kaons at maximal isospin using four CLS ensembles with $a\approx 0.063\;$fm, including one with approximately physical quark masses. Using the stochastic Laplacian-Heaviside method, we determine the energy spectrum of these systems including many levels in different momentum frames and irreducible representations. Using the relativistic two- and three-body finite-volume formalism, we constrain the two and three-meson K matrices, including not only the leading $s$ wave, but also $p$ and $d$ waves. By solving the three-body integral equations, we determine, for the first time, the physical-point scattering amplitudes for $3\pi^+$, $3K^+$, $\pi^+\pi^+ K^+$ and $K^+ K^+ \pi^+$ systems. These are determined for total angular momentum $J^P=0^-$, $1^+$, and $2^-$. We also obtain accurate results for $2\pi^+$, $\pi^+ K^+$, and $2K^+$ phase shifts. We compare our results to Chiral Perturbation Theory, and to phenomenological fits.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2502.17993v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Machine learning is rapidly making its pathway across all of the natural sciences, including physical sciences. The rate at which ML is impacting non-scientific disciplines is incomparable to that in the physical sciences. This is partly due to the uninterpretable nature of deep neural networks. Symbolic machine learning stands as an equal and complementary partner to numerical machine learning in speeding up scientific discovery in physics. This perspective discusses the main differences between the ML and scientific approaches. It stresses the need to develop and apply symbolic machine learning to physics problems equally, in parallel to numerical machine learning, because of the dual nature of physics research.</description>

      <title>WIMP Dark Matter Search using a 3.1 tonne $\times$ year Exposure of the XENONnT Experiment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.18005</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.18005v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We report on a search for weakly interacting massive particle (WIMP) dark matter (DM) via elastic DM-xenon-nucleus interactions in the XENONnT experiment. We combine datasets from the first and second science campaigns resulting in a total exposure of $3.1\;\text{tonne}\times\text{year}$. In a blind analysis of nuclear recoil events with energies above $3.8\,\mathrm{keV_{NR}}$, we find no significant excess above background. We set new upper limits on the spin-independent WIMP-nucleon scattering cross-section for WIMP masses above $10\,\mathrm{GeV}/c^2$ with a minimum of $1.7\,\times\,10^{-47}\,\mathrm{cm^2}$ at $90\,\%$ confidence level for a WIMP mass of $30\,\mathrm{GeV}/c^2$. We achieve a best median sensitivity of $1.4\,\times\,10^{-47}\,\mathrm{cm^2}$ for a $41\,\mathrm{GeV}/c^2$ WIMP. Compared to the result from the first XENONnT science dataset, we improve our sensitivity by a factor of up to 1.8.</description>

      <title>Bispectrum at NLO in single field inflation: conservation and squeezed limit</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.18187</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.18187v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In a recent paper, we computed the bispectrum of primordial density perturbations in CMB to second order in the slow-roll parameters of single field inflation, and found logarithmic infrared contributions that diverge in both large physical distances and squeezed limit where one momentum vanishes. In this work, we provide an independent test of the result by checking its conservation and the validity of the consistency relation between the squeezed limit of the bispectrum and the square of the power spectrum. Despite the violation of the main assumption for its general proofs which is the finiteness of the relevant observables in these limits, we find that the identity continues to hold in the vicinity of the squeezed limit and large time.</description>

      <title>Primordial black holes as cosmic expansion accelerators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.18352</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.18352v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose a novel and natural mechanism for cosmic acceleration driven by primordial black holes (PBHs) exhibiting repulsive behavior. Using a new ``Swiss Cheese'' cosmological approach, we demonstrate that this cosmic acceleration mechanism is a general phenomenon by examining three regular black hole spacetimes - namely the Hayward, Bardeen and Dymnikova spacetimes - as well as the singular de Sitter-Schwarzschild spacetime. Interestingly, by matching these black hole spacetimes with an isotropic and homogeneous expanding Universe, we obtain a phase of cosmic acceleration that ends at an energy scale characteristic to the black hole parameters or due to black hole evaporation. This cosmic acceleration mechanism can be relevant either to an inflationary phase with a graceful exit and reheating or to an early dark energy type of contribution pertinent to the Hubble tension. Remarkably, we find that ultra-light PBHs with masses $m&lt;5\times 10^8\mathrm{g}$ dominating the energy content of the Univese before Big Bang Nucleosynthesis, can drive a successful inflationary expansion era without the use of an inflaton field. Additionally, PBHs with masses $m \sim 10^{12}\mathrm{g}$ and abundances $0.107 &lt; \Omega^\mathrm{eq}_\mathrm{PBH}&lt; 0.5$, slightly before matter-radiation equality, can produce a substantial amount of early dark energy, helping to alleviate the $H_0$ tension.</description>

      <title>Reconstructing early universe evolution with gravitational waves from supercooled phase transitions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.18436</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.18436v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study gravitational waves from supercooled cosmological first-order phase transitions. If such a transition is followed by inefficient reheating, the evolution history of the universe is modified by a period of early matter domination. This leaves an imprint on the predicted gravitational-wave spectra. Using Fisher analysis we show the parameter space in reach of upcoming gravitational wave observatories where reheating can be probed due to its impact on the stochastic background produced by the transition. We use both the simplified geometric parametrisation and the thermodynamical one explicitly including the decay rate of the field undergoing the transition as a parameter determining the spectrum. We show the expansion history following the transition can be probed provided the transition is very strong which is naturally realised in classically scale invariant models generically predicting supercooling. Moreover, in such a scenario the decay rate of the scalar undergoing the phase transition, a parameter most likely inaccessible to accelerators, can be determined through the spectrum analysis.</description>

      <title>Determination of Majorana type-phases from the time evolution of lepton numbers</title>

      <description>arXiv:2212.00142v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We have investigated an approach for determining the Majorana type-phases using the time evolution of lepton family numbers.We show how the second-order time derivative of the expectation values for the lepton family numbers depends on the sum of the Majorana type-phases. Furthermore,others have connected the Majorana type-phases to the orientation of unitary triangles for the PMNS matrix, and the usual Majorana phases. Theoretically,this allows for the extraction of the orientation of the triangles and the Majorana phases from lepton family numbers. We study three example situations. First, how to extract the Majorana type-phases and the lightest neutrino mass for three massive neutrinos, and when a neutrino is massless. Second,the determination of the Majorana phase and the lightest neutrino mass for a two generation toy model.Third, simplified realizations of the type I seesaw model with two gauge singlet neutrinos and two families of lepton doublets.We calculate how the Majorana phases and Majorana type-phases are related to CP violation for leptogenesis at high energies. At first,the effective Majorana mass matrix is parametrized with real and positive diagonal elements. In this basis, the phase of the off-diagonal elements are related to the CP violating phases in the PMNS matrix. We explicitly show the relation between the single Majorana phase and the phase of the effective Majorana mass matrix for the toy model with two generations of active neutrinos. Then for the model with two gauge singlet neutrinos and two families of lepton doublets, we study the effective Majorana mass matrix generated by the seesaw model.In that model,we can show how the Majorana phase at low energy is related to the two CP violating phases of the seesaw matrix.That relation between the phases depends on the lepton number asymmetries of the heavy Majorana neutrinos decays for the toy models.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2308.09206v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We show that the conditions allowing for a spontaneous breaking of the $U(1)_Y$ hypercharge gauge symmetry of the Standard Model (SM) in the early Universe are generically present in extensions of the SM addressing the generation of light neutrino masses via radiative contributions. In such scenarios, the breaking of (hyper)charge at high-temperatures yields new possibilities for explaining the observed matter-antimatter asymmetry of the Universe. Considering for concreteness the Zee-Babu radiative neutrino mass generation model, we show that a period of hypercharge breaking prior to the electroweak phase transition could allow for successful baryogenesis via a non-conventional leptogenesis mechanism, based on the presence of charge-breaking masses for the SM leptons in the early Universe.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.07066v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Self-Supervised Learning (SSL) is at the core of training modern large machine learning models, providing a scheme for learning powerful representations that can be used in a variety of downstream tasks. However, SSL strategies must be adapted to the type of training data and downstream tasks required. We propose RS3L ("Re-simulation-based self-supervised representation learning"), a novel simulation-based SSL strategy that employs a method of re-simulation to drive data augmentation for contrastive learning in the physical sciences, particularly, in fields that rely on stochastic simulators. By intervening in the middle of the simulation process and re-running simulation components downstream of the intervention, we generate multiple realizations of an event, thus producing a set of augmentations covering all physics-driven variations available in the simulator. Using experiments from high-energy physics, we explore how this strategy may enable the development of a foundation model; we show how RS3L pre-training enables powerful performance in downstream tasks such as discrimination of a variety of objects and uncertainty mitigation. In addition to our results, we make the RS3L dataset publicly available for further studies on how to improve SSL strategies.</description>

      <title>Photon self-energy at all temperatures and densities in all of phase space</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.18466v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In an isotropic background comprised of free charges, the transverse and longitudinal modes of the photon acquire large corrections to their dispersion relations, described by the in-medium photon self-energy. Previous work has developed simple approximations that describe the propagation of on-shell photons in plasmas of varying temperatures and densities. However, off-shell excitations can also receive large medium-induced corrections, and the on-shell approximations have often been used in an effort to capture these effects. In this work we show that the off-shell self-energy can be qualitatively very different than the on-shell case. We develop analytic approximations that are accurate everywhere in phase space, especially in classical and degenerate plasmas. From these, we recover the on-shell expressions in the appropriate limit. Our expressions also reproduce the well-known Lindhard response function from solid-state physics for the longitudinal mode.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.01070v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The ultralight dark photon is one of intriguing dark matter candidates. The interaction between the visible photon and dark photon is introduced by the gauge kinetic mixing between the field strength tensors of the Abelian gauge groups in the Standard Model and dark sector. The relativistic electrodynamics was generalized to quantum electromagnetodynamics (QEMD) in the presence of both electric and magnetic charges. The photon is described by two four-potentials corresponding to two $U(1)$ gauge groups and satisfying non-trivial commutation relations. In this work, we construct the low-energy dark photon-photon interactions in the framework of QEMD and obtain new dark photon-photon kinetic mixings. The consequent field equations and the new Maxwell's equations are derived in this framework. We also investigate the detection strategies of dark photon as light dark matter as well as the generic kinetic mixings at haloscope experiments.</description>

      <title>The impact of data from future lepton colliders on light hadrons fragmentation functions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.10059</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.10059v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this work, we study the constraining power of future lepton colliders on fragmentation functions (FFs) to light charged hadrons from quarks and gluon in the framework of QCD collinear factorization. We perform analyses of FFs at NLO by including a wide range of pseudo--data from future lepton colliders, such as measurements on hadron multiplicities in the production of two jets and $W$ boson pairs, at various center of mass energies, and from hadronic decays of the Higgs boson, including both to heavy quarks and to gluons. The high luminosity and high energies of future lepton colliders allow for quark flavor separations and ensure a precise determination of FFs based solely on data from electron-positron collisions. We find that either the CEPC, FCC-$ee$ or ILC can significantly reduce the uncertainties of FFs in a wide kinematic range, compared to the NPC23 set obtained with a global analysis to current world data. We also discuss the impact of higher-order QCD corrections, and the potential constraints from measurements of three-jet production. Furthermore, we describe an update of the FMNLO program allowing for calculating hadron production cross sections at next-to-next-to-leading order in QCD, which is used in this study.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2408.00833v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We examine the prospect of observing genuine lepton number violating (LNV) signals at hadron colliders in the context of the Type II seesaw mechanism. The model features smoking gun signals involving same-sign di-leptons and jets that may be the primary observable channel in certain regions of the parameter space. The flavour composition of final-state charged leptons in the minimal model is related to the origin of neutrino masses and is correlated with other rare processes, such as neutrinoless double beta decay. We review existing collider limits and provide sensitivity estimates from LNV signals at upcoming runs of the LHC, for zero and non-zero mass splittings between the scalar triplet components.</description>

      <title>Relaxing Limits from Big Bang Nucleosynthesis on Heavy Neutral Leptons with Axion-like Particles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.06970</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.06970v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Heavy neutral leptons (HNLs) are constrained by requirements of Big Bang Nucleosynthesis (BBN) as their decays significantly impact the formation of the primordial elements. We propose here a model where the primary decay channel for the HNLs is to an axion-like particle (ALP) and a neutrino. Consequently, HNLs can decay earlier and evade the BBN bound for lower masses, provided the ALPs themselves decay considerably later. Further cosmological and astrophysical constraints limit severely the range of validity of the ALP properties. We find that a new parameter region opens up for HNLs with masses between 1 MeV and 1 GeV, and active-sterile neutrino mixing strengths between $10^{-9}$ and $10^{-6}$ that is consistent with constraints and can be probed in future searches. In such a scenario, current bounds as well as sensitivities of future direct HNL searches such as at NA62 and DUNE will be affected.</description>

      <title>QCD sum rule analysis of $0^{+}$ four-quark states</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.09847v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present a comprehensive QCD sum rules analysis at next-to-leading order for all types of $J^P=0^{+}$ four-quark states composed of $u$, $d$, and $s$ quarks. The eigenvectors of the renormalization matrix are chosen to be the renormalized four-quark operators, which can be equally interpreted as tetraquark or molecule operators. Meanwhile, the typical nonet masses given by bare tetraquark operators are lower than those given by bare molecule operators. Most of the nonet masses are around $1-2\text{GeV}$, and they can be interpreted as the $0^+$ mesons observed in experiments. We find a category of four-quark nonets with masses $\lesssim1\text{GeV}$, potentially corresponding to the light $0^+$ mesons $f_0(500)$, $K^*_0(700)$, $f_0(980)$, and $a_0(980)$. On the other hand, the possible 27-fold states are heavier than most of the nonets, with masses $\gtrsim 2\text{GeV}$. The main uncertainty arises from the factorization of high-dimensional condensates, which usually underestimates their values. To address this, we introduce deviation factors for the dimension-6, -8, and -10 condensates, and vary them over a wide range to obtain conservative estimates of the $0^+$ four-quark state masses. Some general properties of the $0^+$ light four-quark states can be derived that do not rely on precise numerical values. We also find that the ambiguity in the factorization of the dimension-8 condensate can introduce a larger discrepancy than previously estimated. As a byproduct, we propose a simple trick for renormalizing multi-quark operators at the one-loop level.</description>

Abstract: We extend our nonperturbative essentially relativistic approach, elaborated previously, to perform an approximate estimation of the size of pi0 meson. We present detailed argumentation for choosing the mass mean square radius (MSR) for this purpose. Its value calculated in our approach, using three model quark-antiquark wave functions in pion, is (0.5-0.53) fm. The neutral-pion electromagnetic form factor is zero in accordance with the charge-conjugation symmetry. We demonstrate ambiguities encountered when using standard definitions of mechanical MSR for the size. We discuss MSRs obtained in various approaches and their comparison with each other and with our results.</description>

      <title>Precise predictions for the QCD axion contribution to dark radiation with full phase-space evolution</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.18186</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.18186v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We compute the QCD axion contribution to the energy density of dark radiation, parameterized by $\Delta N_{\rm eff}$, by solving Boltzmann equations for the momentum distribution functions including the effects of quantum statistics for all particles involved in the axion production processes. This approach gives precise prediction for $\Delta N_{\rm eff}$ independently on whether axions are produced via freeze-out or freeze-in. We focus on axions produced via flavor-conserving and flavor-violating interactions with leptons. Our precise predictions for $\Delta N_{\rm eff}$ can differ from those assuming thermal shape for the momentum distribution functions, as commonly done in the literature, by more than the experimental precision of future Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) observations. Current lower limits on the axion couplings from Planck constraints on $\Delta N_{\rm eff}$ are also affected by our precise computation which, in particular, results in a strongly relaxed bound on flavor-violating axion couplings to tau lepton and muon or electron.</description>

      <title>Remarks on strong phase shifts in weak nonleptonic baryon decays</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.02170</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.02170v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A sizable strong-interaction phase shift in weak two-body nonleptonic baryon decay would enhance the possibility of discovering charge-conjugation parity ($CP$) violation in the baryon sector, which might help in the quest for understanding the matter-antimatter asymmetry in the universe. Over the past 60 years, empirical analyses involving different types of instruments, including fixed-target experiments and $e^+e^-$ colliders, have indicated that the phase shifts in nonleptonic hyperon decays are relatively small, below order ten degrees in size. A large phase shift, however, has been observed by BESIII in the decay of a charmed baryon into a hyperon and kaon, $\Lambda_c^+\to \Xi^0K^+$. In various experimental and theoretical studies on hyperon, charmed-baryon, and bottomed-baryon decays, different conventions have been adopted for defining the strong phases. It is important to be aware of this situation when obtaining global averages from different measurements and applying the results to future investigations on $CP$ violation among baryons. This paper gives an overview of the conventions employed in the literature for the strong phases and suggests a unified parameterization form applicable to the different alternatives. Numerical results under the unified parameterization form are also provided, which can serve as useful inputs to further pursuits of baryon $CP$ violation.</description>

      <title>High-energy cLFV at $\mu$TRISTAN: HNL extensions of the Standard Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.04331</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.04331v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Within the context of heavy neutral lepton (HNL) extensions of the Standard Model, we compute the cross-sections for $\mu^+ e^-\to \ell_\alpha^+\ell_\beta^-$ scattering, as well as several angular observables. In particular, we investigate the future sensitivity of a $\mu$TRISTAN collider in discovering such charged lepton flavour violating processes and the potential constraining power of these searches on the parameter space of HNL models. Our results show that while low-energy probes of $\mu-e$ flavour violation do offer the most promising potential, the prospects for $e\tau$ and $\mu\tau$ flavour violation searches at $\mu$TRISTAN can exceed those of related low-energy probes (as well as flavour violating $Z$-pole processes at FCC-ee) by several orders of magnitude.</description>

      <title>Unpolarized valence GPDs and form factors of pion in the modified chiral quark model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.13322</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.13322v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We calculate the valence generalized parton distribution functions (GPDs) of pion at zero skewness applying a theoretical approach in which the valence GPDs are related to valence quark distribution functions, directly. To this end, we use the results of modified chiral quark model ($\chi QM$) for the valence quark distributions of pion obtained in our previous work. We also determine the electromagnetic and gravitational form factors of pion and compare the results of our theoretical model for valence GPDs and form factors of pion with the results of some other models and available experimental data.</description>

      <title>Taming flavour violation in the Inverse Seesaw</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.13696</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.13696v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The Inverse Seesaw mechanism remains one of the most attractive explanations for the lightness of neutrino masses, allowing for natural low-scale realisations. We consider the prospects of a simple extension via 3 generations of sterile fermions - the so called ISS(3,3) - in what concerns numerous lepton flavour observables. In order to facilitate a connection between the Lagrangian parameters and low-energy data, we systematically develop new parametrisations of the Yukawa couplings. Relying on these new parametrisations to explore the parameter space, we discuss the complementary role of charged lepton flavour violation searches in dedicated facilities, as well as in lepton colliders (FCC-ee and $\mu$TRISTAN). Our results reveal the strong synergy of the different indirect searches in probing the distinct flavour sectors of the model. In particular, we show that in the absence of radiative decays $\ell_\alpha\to\ell_\beta\gamma$, sizeable rates for $Z$-penguin dominated observables could hint at a non-trivially mixed and non-degenerate heavy spectrum.</description>

      <title>Transverse momentum dependent factorisation in the target fragmentation region at small $x$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.02634</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.02634v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider the differential cross-section for single-inclusive jet production with transverse momentum $P_\perp$ in Deep Inelastic Scattering (DIS) at small Bjorken $x_{\rm Bj}$, mediated by a virtual photon with virtuality $Q^2$. Unlike most studies at small $x$, which focus on particle production in the current fragmentation region, we investigate the kinematic regime where the jet is produced in the target fragmentation hemisphere of the Breit frame, and with $P_\perp \ll Q$. For a longitudinally polarised photon, we demonstrate that this cross-section is not power suppressed in $P_\perp/Q$ and we derive a factorised expression in terms of transverse momentum dependent (TMD) quark and gluon jet fracture functions. Our formula, valid at next-to-leading order in $\alpha_s$ at small $x$, is akin to the Altarelli-Martinelli identity for the longitudinal DIS structure function. Numerical estimates show that the TMD quark jet fracture function is the most sensitive to saturation effects in large nuclei.</description>

      <title>Bell Inequalities and Quantum Correlations in $H \rightarrow ZZ \rightarrow 2e\,2\mu$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.03219</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.03219v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate quantum correlations in Higgs-boson decays $\bigl(H \rightarrow ZZ^* \rightarrow 2e\,2\mu\bigr)$ using CMS open data at $\sqrt{s}$ = 8 TeV, incorporating realistic detector effects. By reconstructing the polarization density matrix of the two-boson system and evaluating the Collins-Gisin-Linden-Massar-Popescu (CGLMP) Bell operator $I_3$, we quantify entanglement in the $ZZ$ state. Our analysis yields an $I_3$ value of $2.152 \pm 0.003$ for signal events $\bigl(H \rightarrow ZZ^*\bigr)$, indicating the presence of quantum entanglement. The non-resonant continuum background events $\bigl(pp \rightarrow ZZ\bigr)$ yield $I_3 = 1.158 \pm 0.012$, suggesting the absence of quantum correlations. These results demonstrate the feasibility of testing fundamental quantum mechanics at high energy colliders.</description>

      <title>Influence of dark matter on the structure of strange quark stars in one-fluid model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.16317</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.16317v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This work studies the influence of scalar dark matter on the structural properties of strange quark stars (SQS) within a one-fluid framework, considering Yukawa interactions between dark matter and quark matter. Contributions from perturbative QCD, Yukawa interaction between scalar dark matter and quarks, and Bose-Einstein condensation of dark matter are included in the model. We first determine the allowable range of Yukawa interaction coupling by imposing the stability condition for strange quark matter (SQM). Using this range, we derive the equation of state (EOS) for different fractions of dark matter within the total pressure of SQS. These fractions are constrained by the tidal deformability limit from GW170817. The presence of dark matter alters the EOS, leading to changes in the mass-radius relationship, tidal deformability, and stability of SQS. We demonstrate that increasing the mass of dark matter softens the EOS, whereas higher fractions of dark matter lead to stiffer EOSs. We also explore the reasons behind this behavior. Our EOSs not only describe massive objects, such as PSR J0952-0607 and PSR J2215+5135, but also satisfy the tidal deformability constraint from GW170817. These results reveal that incorporating dark matter modifies the EOS, enabling the support of higher stellar masses while maintaining consistency with observational data.</description>

      <title>Effects of Superradiance in Active Galactic Nuclei</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.09955</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.09955v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A supermassive black hole (SMBH) at the core of an active galactic nucleus (AGN) provides room for the elusive ultra-light scalar particles (ULSP) to be produced through a phenomenon called \textit{superradiance}. This phenomenon produces a cloud of scalar particles around the black hole by draining its spin angular momentum. In this work, we present a study of the superradiant instability due to a scalar field in the vicinity of the central SMBH in an AGN. We begin by showing that the time-evolution of the gravitational coupling $\alpha$ in a realistic ambiance created by the accretion disk around the SMBH in AGN leads to interesting consequences such as the amplified growth of the scalar cloud, enhancement of the gravitational wave emission rate, and appearance of higher modes of superradiance within the age of the Universe. We then explore the consequence of superradiance on the characteristics of the AGN. Using the Novikov-Thorne model for an accretion disk, we divide the full spectrum into three wavelength bands- X-ray ($10^{-4}-10^{-2}~\mu$m), UV (0.010-0.4~$\mu$m), and Vis-IR (0.4-100~$\mu$m) and observe sudden drops in the time-variations of the luminosities across these bands and Eddington ratio ($f_{\textrm{Edd}}$) with a characteristic timescale of superradiance. Using a uniform distribution of spin and mass of the SMBHs in AGNs, we demonstrate the appearance of depleted regions and accumulations along the boundaries of these regions in the planes of different band-luminosities and $f_{\textrm{Edd}}$. Finally, we discuss some possible signatures of superradiance that can be drawn from the observed time-variation of the AGN luminosities.</description>

      <title>One Loop Thermal Effective Action</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.14146</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.14146v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We compute the one loop effective action for a Quantum Field Theory at finite temperature, in the presence of background gauge fields, employing the Heat-Kernel method. This method enables us to compute the thermal corrections to the Wilson coefficients associated with effective operators up to arbitrary mass dimension, which emerge after integrating out heavy scalars and fermions from a generic UV theory. The Heat-Kernel coefficients are functions of non-zero background `electric', `magnetic' fields, and Polyakov loops. A major application of our formalism is the calculation of the finite temperature Coleman-Weinberg potential in effective theories, necessary for the study of phase transitions. A novel feature of this work is the systematic calculation of the dependence of Polyakov loops on the thermal factors of Heat-Kernel coefficients and the Coleman-Weinberg potential. We study the effect of Polyakov loop factors on phase transitions and comment on future directions in applications of the results derived in this work.</description>

      <title>Isolated Black Holes as Potential PeVatrons and Ultrahigh-energy Gamma-ray Sources</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.08136</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.08136v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The origin of PeV cosmic rays is a long-standing mystery, and ultrahigh-energy gamma-ray observations would play a crucial role in identifying it. Recently, LHAASO reported the discovery of ``dark'' gamma-ray sources that were detected above 100 TeV without any GeV--TeV gamma-ray counterparts. The origins of these dark gamma-ray sources are unknown. We propose isolated black holes (IBHs) wandering in molecular clouds as the origins of PeV cosmic rays and LHAASO dark sources. An IBH accretes surrounding dense gas, which forms a magnetically arrested disk (MAD) around the IBH. Magnetic reconnection in the MAD can accelerate cosmic-ray protons up to PeV energies. Cosmic-ray protons of GeV-TeV energies fall to the IBH, whereas cosmic-ray protons at sub-PeV energies can escape from the MAD, providing PeV CRs into the interstellar medium. The sub-PeV cosmic-ray protons interact with the surrounding molecular clouds, producing TeV-PeV gamma rays without emitting GeV-TeV gamma rays. This scenario can explain the dark sources detected by LHAASO. Taking into account the IBH and molecular cloud distributions in our Galaxy, we demonstrate that IBHs can provide a significant contribution to the PeV cosmic rays observed on Earth. Future gamma-ray detectors in the southern sky and neutrino detectors would provide a concrete test to our scenario.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2501.16472v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We revisit the problem of constructing a color superconducting phase in bottom-up holography. We introduce a model that describes the five-dimensional dynamics of a scalar field dual to a chiral symmetry breaking condensate, which is coupled to the RR 4-form. The coupling is given by a topological WZ term, which is elegantly responsible both for scalar condensation at high density, and color Higgsing in the condensed phase. This construction realizes both properties at finite density and Higgsing fraction.</description>

      <title>The role of the counterterms in the conservation of superhorizon curvature perturbations at one loop</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.12112v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recently, several papers have claimed that superhorizon curvature perturbations are not conserved at the one-loop level in single-field inflation models if there is a transient ultra-slow-roll period. In this work, we point out that the contributions from the counterterms were overlooked in the recent papers. We show that the counterterm contributions play a crucial role in canceling the one-loop power spectrum of superhorizon curvature perturbations in the comoving gauge.</description>
