      <title>Full vectorial field sensing using liquid crystal droplet arrays</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.08696</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.08696v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Obtaining the amplitude, phase, and polarization profiles of light beams is essential, with applications spanning metrology, microscopy, astronomy, and optical communication/computing technologies. However, most modern measurement approaches cannot retrieve these parameters easily, often relying on bulky and expensive hardware, or lacking the capability for single-shot sensing. Here, we introduce a compact, snapshot, low-cost, fully vectorial field sensor based on an inkjet-printed nematic liquid crystal droplet array to measure these properties. Polarization and intensity are measured via division-of-wavefront polarimetry, exploiting the droplets' spatially varying birefringence, while the phase is reconstructed by treating each droplet as a microlens in a Shack-Hartmann wavefront sensor configuration. To demonstrate the system's performance, we characterize aberrated dual-wavelength beams carrying distinct intensity, phase, and polarization information, confirming accurate retrieval of the optical field profiles for both spectral components.</description>

      <title>Ultrafast Pulse Retrieval from Partial FROG Traces Using Implicit Diffusion Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.08764</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.08764v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Ultrashort laser pulses enable attosecond-scale measurements and drive breakthroughs across science and technology, but their routine use hinges on reliable pulse characterization. Frequency-Resolved Optical Gating (FROG) is a leading solution, forming a spectrogram by scanning the delay between two pulse replicas and recording the nonlinear signal spectrum. In online settings, however, dense delay-frequency scans are costly or impractical-especially for long pulses, wavelength regimes with limited spectrometer coverage (e.g., UV), or hardware with coarse resolution, yielding severely undersampled FROG traces. Existing reconstruction methods struggle in this regime-iterative algorithms are computationally heavy, convolutional networks blur fine structure, and sequence models are unstable when inputs are discontinuous or sparse. We present a generative diffusion framework tailored to recover ultrafast pulse intensity and phase from incomplete FROG measurements. Our model infers missing spectro-temporal content with high fidelity, enabling accurate retrieval from aggressively downsampled inputs. On a simulated benchmark of FROG-pulse pairs, the diffusion approach surpasses strong CNN and Seq2Seq baselines in accuracy and stability while remaining efficient enough for near real-time deployment.</description>

      <title>Deep Learning Driven Enhancement of Optical Vortex Line Robustness in Atmospheric Turbulence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.08836</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.08836v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The stability of optical vortex structures in turbulent environments is critical for their applications in optical communication, quantum information, and structured light technologies. Although topological invariants, such as crossings and linking numbers, are fundamentally invariant, recent studies reveal that their observed values deteriorate considerably in turbulent conditions due to environmental effects. In this study, we introduce an alternative approach based on the geometric stability of three-dimensional singularity line shapes, demonstrating that shape-based tracing of singularities outperforms both topological and spectral methods in turbulence. To test this concept, we propose Flower Beams, a novel class of structured optical fields featuring controllable petal-like singularity morphologies. We construct an 81-element optical alphabet and classify these structures after turbulence using deep learning. Our findings reveal that shape-based tracing achieves classification accuracy exceeding 90% in the weaker turbulence regimes and remains highly competitive even in stronger turbulence, significantly outperforming spectral and topology-based approaches. Experimental results confirm that the predicted shape stability holds in real-world conditions. This study stablishes the shape of the singularities' lines as a scalable and resilient alternative for structured light tracing and transmission, opening new avenues for turbulence-robust-applications.</description>

      <title>Unraveling Geometric-phase at Conical Intersection by Cavity-enhanced Two-dimensional Electronic Spectroscopy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.08889</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.08889v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The geometric phase is a fundamental quantum mechanical phenomenon uniquely associated with conical intersections (CI) between potential energy surfaces and serves as a definitive signature of their presence. In this study, we propose a novel spectroscopic approach to directly detect the geometric phase using two-dimensional electronic spectroscopy (2DES) enhanced by strong light-matter interactions within an optical cavity. Focusing on a prototypical pentacene dimer undergoing singlet fission, we model the nonadiabatic wave packet dynamics as it evolves through a CI between electronically excited states. The optical cavity enables dynamic modulation of the coupling between the optical field and molecular vibrational modes, allowing precise control over the wave packet pathways. Importantly, we identify a cancellation in the spectral amplitude, arising from phase differences accumulated along different trajectories, which serves as a clear spectroscopic manifestation of the geometric phase (GP). This cavity-enhanced 2DES framework not only enables direct observation of GP effects but also offers a versatile platform for probing ultrafast nonadiabatic processes. Our results provide fundamental insights into topological effects in molecular dynamics and pave the way for experimental strategies in quantum control, photochemistry, and the design of advanced optoelectronic materials.</description>

      <title>Direct observation of room-temperature exciton condensation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.09187</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.09187v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Exciton condensation--an interaction-driven, macroscopically coherent paired-fermion state--offers the prospect for dissipationless energy transport in solids, akin to that in superconductivity. Although their light effective mass and strong Coulomb binding favour high transition temperatures, convincing demonstrations of pure-exciton condensation have hitherto been limited to cryogenic conditions. Here, we report the direct observation of quasi-equilibrium condensation of dark excitons in monolayer tungsten diselenide at 300 K and ambient pressure. We achieve this by creating nanoscale spacing-graded Stark traps to confine free excitons, setting the finite-size scale, non-resonant off-axis optical injection to control the local density-temperature trajectory, and employing surface plasmon polariton-enhanced microsphere-assisted microscopy to boost dark-exciton emission and directly image first-order spatial coherence with sub-diffraction resolution. We observe a sharp degeneracy threshold and a clear phase transition, evidenced by extended first-order spatial coherence with algebraic decay and a critical exponent consistent with the universal Berezinskii-Kosterlitz-Thouless criterion. Identical condensation signatures are observed in over 30 independent samples. Our work establishes a room-temperature excitonic platform for exploring strongly correlated many-body physics and advancing near-dissipationless, coherent quantum technologies.</description>

      <title>3D printed microfiber waveguide in C-shaped fiber for temperature and air pressure measurement</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.09288</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.09288v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this study, we propose a microfiber waveguide for temperature and air pressure measurement. To improve mechanical strength of the sensor, a C-shaped fiber is sandwiches between two single mode fibers (SMFs) by fusion splice. The microfiber waveguide is 3D printed between two SMFs to connect two fiber cores by two-photon polymerization technology. Due to multimode property of this printed waveguide, a Mach-Zehnder interferometer (MZI) is obtained. This sensor exhibits a high temperature sensitivity of 361 pm/{\deg}C at 25{\deg}C to 45{\deg}C and a high air pressure sensitivity of 55 pm/kPa from 300hpa to 1000hpa. The MZI sensor features significant advantages such as small size, high stability, and easy fabrication, without the need for complex post-processing, showing great potential and broad application prospects in many sensing applications.</description>

      <title>Influence of Modulation Frequency Stabilization on Spectral Noise of Electromagnetically Induced Transparency</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.09350</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.09350v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The conversion of the modulation signal from the coupling light to the probe light and the conversion of the additional phase noise from the coupling light to the amplitude noise of the probe light in the electromagnetically induced transparency (EIT) spectrum of the cesium atomic ladder type three level system were investigated by detecting the probe light output noise spectrum. It was demonstrated that frequency stabilization via external modulation can effectively avoid the transfer of modulation noise. In the experiment, two frequency stabilization methods external modulation transfer spectroscopy and internal modulation transfer spectroscopy were employed to achieve the frequency stabilization of the coupling light. The probe light noise spectra at the frequency stabilized output terminal and the detection output terminal were measured under both methods.</description>

      <title>Tutorial: A practical guide to the alignment of defocused spatial light modulators for fast diffractive neural networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.09440</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.09440v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The conjugation of multiple spatial light modulators (SLMs) enables the construction of optical diffractive neural networks (DNNs). To accelerate training, limited by the low refresh rate of SLMs, spatial multiplexing of the input data across different spatial channels is possible maximizing the number of available spatial degrees of freedom (DoFs). Precise alignment is required in order to ensure that the same physical operation is performed across each channel. We present a semi-automatic procedure for this experimentally challenging alignment resulting in a pixel-level conjugation. It is scalable to any number of SLMs and may be useful in wavefront shaping setups where precise conjugation of SLMs is required, e.g. for the control of optical waves in phase and amplitude. The resulting setup functions as an optical DNN able to process hundreds of inputs simultaneously, thereby reducing training times and experimental noise through spatial averaging. We further present a characterization of the setup and an alignment method.</description>

      <title>Modular multi-axis stepper motor driver with remote control for use in microscopy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.09456</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.09456v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Mechanical translation of samples along several axes is often required in microscopy, and automated positioning requires motorizing the translation stages. Stepper motors are commonly employed but require specialized driver electronics for reliable operation. Here we describe a low-cost, open-source controller design that drives several stepper motors and implements important safety features, such as monitoring of mechanical limit switches, stall detection, and protective software limits. If rotational encoders in the motors or linear encoders on the stages are available, the controller can monitor the stage position and correct it in a feedback loop. The stages can be controlled with serial commands via USB, or optionally from a remote control box that incorporates a joystick for real-time multi-axis speed control, rotary dials for fine axis positioning, and a display to indicate the stage positions. To ease adoption, we provide driver libraries in Python and C, a driver for the commonly used microscopy control software $\mu$Manager, and an example graphical user interface for calibration and testing.</description>

      <title>Depth-enhanced molecular imaging with two-photon oblique plane microscopy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.09462</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.09462v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: High-numerical-aperture (NA) oblique plane microscopy enables noninvasive fluorescence imaging of subcellular dynamics without requiring radical sample modification. However, performance degrades at depth in multicellular specimens as scattering and refractive-index heterogeneity raise out-of-focus background. We report a two-photon oblique plane microscope that improves resolution at depth by combining high-NA single-objective detection with multiphoton plane illumination. The microscope achieves $\sim\!300$ nm lateral and $\sim\!650$ nm axial resolution, with single-molecule sensitivity in vivo. Compared with two-photon point scanning, the lower illumination NA delivers an order of magnitude lower peak intensity, enabling $&gt;\!5\times$ faster volumetric acquisition (up to $3.25 \times 10^6$ voxels s$^{-1}$) with reduced photodamage. In multicellular contexts, near-infrared nonlinear excitation enhances contrast throughout the illumination depth by $\sim\!2\times$ and restores volumetric resolving power by $&gt;\!2\times$ relative to linear excitation. We demonstrate these capabilities through molecular imaging of epithelial tissue, stem-cell-derived gastruloids, and living fruit fly embryos, including multicolor transcription-factor dynamics, optogenetic subcellular control, and single-mRNA tracking, all using standard glass-based mounting.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2511.09522v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We report the generation of the fifth harmonic of Yb at 206 nm with pulse energies exceeding 16 $\mu$J and durations of approximately 100 fs at a repetition rate of 100 kHz. The deep ultraviolet pulses are produced using four-wave difference frequency mixing in a He-filled stretched hollow-core fiber, driven by a pump at 343 nm and seeded at 1030 nm. Guided by simulations, we carefully optimize the process, resulting in a conversion efficiency of $\sim$30% from the 343 nm pump beam.</description>

      <title>Super-resolution imaging of azimuthal features with illumination carrying OAM</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.09066</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.09066v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Super-resolution imaging refers to imaging techniques that surpass the Rayleigh resolution limit. One standard way to achieve super-resolution is by structuring the phase of the field illuminating the object. Although super-resolution techniques are already employed in commercial imaging devices, intense research efforts continue to enhance the resolution even further. In this work, we show that if the field illuminating the object is structured in the azimuthal coordinate--such as a field carrying orbital angular momentum (OAM)--the azimuthal features of the object can be imaged with enhanced imaging resolution. We experimentally demonstrate it with two objects, namely, an azimuthal double-slit and a Siemens star. We find that for a given azimuthal feature, there is an optimum OAM mode index of the illumination that gives the best imaging resolution. Super-resolution imaging of azimuthal feature can have important implications, especially for some biological objects that are known to have predominantly azimuthal features.</description>

      <title>PIC analysis of spatiotemporal THz emission from radial and longitudinal wakefields via copropagating chirped lasers in magnetized rippled plasma</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.09075</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.09075v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The excitation of radial and longitudinal wake-fields by two co-propagating chirped laser pulses in a rippled, magnetized plasma has been examined. This study aimed to clarify the spatiotemporal evolution of wake structures and assess their role in the generation of THz radiation. A Fourier-Bessel Particle-In-Cell (FBPIC) simulation framework, optimized for cylindrical geometries, has been employed to model the relativistic dynamics of plasma electrons under the combined influence of laser-induced ponderomotive forces and an external magnetic field. It has been shown that the beat frequency between the pulses modulates the ponderomotive force, driving nonlinear wake-field structures sustained by electron oscillations. Simulations performed with high spatial resolution have revealed that wake-field amplitude and coherence are strongly influenced by laser chirp, pulse duration, and plasma density. Distinct THz peaks have been identified in the Fourier-transformed spectra, with their amplitudes enhanced by resonant coupling between wake-field harmonics and the laser frequency modulation. Moreover, electron motion has been confined by the magnetic field, leading to improved energy gain and shaping of angular radiation patterns. These findings suggest that tailored laser and plasma configurations can be used to optimize energy transfer mechanisms, paving the way for more efficient wake-field usage and THz generation.</description>

      <title>Hydrodynamic PIC analysis of THz generation by two color laser in various plasma gases</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.09083</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.09083v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In the present study, a theoretical and PIC numerical investigation of THz emission driven by two color femtosecond laser fields in gaseous plasmas is conducted. The model is formulated in cylindrical coordinates to capture the inherent radial symmetry of laser plasma interactions. Starting from a hydrodynamic description of plasma electrons coupled with Maxwells equations, the nonlinear photocurrent dynamics that underpin the emission process is derived. The results reveal that the asymmetry induced by the superposition of the fundamental and second-harmonic fields plays a central role in breaking inversion symmetry, thereby generating a net directional current that radiates in the THz regime. Systematic analysis demonstrates that gas composition, ionization fraction, and the intensity ratio of the two fields strongly influence both the spectral characteristics and efficiency of THz radiation.</description>

Abstract: Quantum LiDAR offers noise resilience and stealth observation capabilities in low-light conditions. In prior demonstrations, the telescope pointing was raster-scanned, making the observation direction predictable from the pointing direction. However, while Quantum LiDAR can enable stealth observation, operational stealth is enhanced by inherently unpredictable beam steering. Here, we introduce a novel stealth beam steering method that is fundamentally immune to prediction. In a photon pair, the probe photon undergoes diffraction in an unpredictable direction at a grating due to wavelength randomness. The arrival time of the heralding photon, delayed by propagation through a dispersive medium, enables the determination of the probe photon's diffraction direction. Our method successfully detects multiple targets in parallel, demonstrating up to a 1000-fold enhancement in signal-to-noise ratio compared to classical LiDAR. This breakthrough establishes a new paradigm for quantum-enhanced sensing, with far-reaching implications for quantum metrology, secure communications, and beyond.</description>

      <title>Private Remote Phase Estimation over a Lossy Quantum Channel</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.09123</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.09123v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Private remote quantum sensing (PRQS) aims at estimating a parameter at a distant location by transmitting quantum states on an insecure quantum channel, limiting information leakage and disruption of the estimation itself from an adversary. Previous results highlighted that one can bound the estimation performance in terms of the observed noise. However, if no assumptions are placed on the channel model, such bounds are very loose and severely limit the estimation. We propose and analyse a PRQS using, for the first time to our knowledge, continuous-variable states in the single-user setting. Assuming a typical class of lossy attacks and employing tools from quantum communication, we calculate the true estimation error and privacy of our protocol, both in the asymptotic limit of many channel uses and in the finite-size regime. Our results show that a realistic channel-model assumption, which can be validated with measurement data, allows for a much tighter quantification of the estimation error and privacy for all practical purposes.</description>

      <title>Photothermal resistivity alignment of optical fibers to SNSPD</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.09498</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.09498v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We demonstrate a straightforward optoelectronic fiber alignment technique for superconducting nanowire single-photon detectors (SNSPDs) that exploits the temperature-dependent resistance of the nanowire under optical absorption. The target nanowire is illuminated via the fiber, and the local absorption of light heats the wire, causing a change in its resistivity. Scanning the fiber over the nanowire, the change in its resistivity is monitored by lock-in amplifier, mapping the spatial photothermal response correlated to absorption and coupling efficiency. The maximum of the response corresponds to optimal fiber-SNSPD alignment. This method allows for aligning the fiber to the center of the meander with sub-micron precision. The response is robust to variations in the angle and height of the fiber, providing an alternative or complement to fiber-to-chip alignment methods based on the back-reflection or transmission measurement.</description>

      <title>A Framework for Formulating Polychromatic Theories of Emission</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.01319</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.01319v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The emission of energy as electromagnetic radiation is ubiquitous, in particular because objects release thermal energy in the form of photons. Most theories of thermal radiation assume that the thermal emissions originate from a continuum of elementary monochromatic sources, uncorrelated to each other. The universality of thermal radiation motivates the consideration of theories that allow for more general kinds of elementary emissions. In here, we introduce a framework for formulating polychromatic theories of emission in the electromagnetic Hilbert space, whose computational side is based on the transition matrix, or T-matrix. Each photon is emitted as a coherent polychromatic pulse. The spectra of the different emitted pulses are derived using the natural resonance frequencies of the given finite-size object. Each resonance belongs to one of the orthogonal subspaces which decompose the absorption operator according to the symmetries of the object. Energy conservation in the steady-state is ensured by equalizing the absorption and emission of energy at each individual subspace. The framework can accommodate general illuminations, and produce emissions with frequencies that are much suppressed in or even absent from the illumination, resulting in different rates of emission and absorption of photons. This makes the framework suitable for describing other kinds of emissions, such as luminescence, in the Hilbert space.</description>

      <title>Theoretical Model of Microparticle-Assisted Super-Resolution Microscopy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.10268</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.10268v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present the first three-dimensional theoretical model of microparticle-assisted super-resolution imaging, enabling accurate simulation of virtual image formation. The model reveals that accounting for partial spatial coherence of illumination is a fundamental prerequisite for achieving superresolution. We also propose a novel illumination strategy based on suppressing the normal component of incident light, which enhances image contrast and resolution. It is shown that as the size of the object decreases, the optical resolution tends to the classical limit. An analytical estimate for the resolution criterion in microsphere-assisted imaging is presented. The results establish a consistent wave-optical framework that reproduces experimentally observed subwavelength imaging and clarifies the underlying physical mechanisms.</description>

      <title>Overcoming the indirect bandgap: efficient silicon emission via momentum-expanded photonic states</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.19001</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.19001v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Silicon's inherently indirect bandgap severely limits its radiative efficiency, posing a fundamental challenge to the development of practical silicon-based light sources. While strategies such as nanoscale confinement of electrons and holes (quantum dots), Mie resonators, and hybrid plasmonic structures have improved emission, they typically require complex fabrication workflows. Here, we demonstrate a conceptually distinct and scalable approach to enable light emission from a bulk silicon wafer by decorating its surface with gold or copper nanoparticles. Remarkably, the effect is nearly identical for Au and Cu, with particle size emerging as the dominant factor. We show that strong luminescence from the bulk wafer emerges only when the nanoparticle diameter is below 2 nm. We attribute this effect to the formation of spatially confined photonic states with broadened momentum distributions, which must enable diagonal, phonon-independent optical transitions that bypass the limitations imposed by silicon's indirect bandgap. This mechanism yields broadband emission across the visible and near-infrared spectrum, with quantum efficiencies comparable to direct bandgap semiconductors, representing a 10^5-fold increase in integrated spectral intensity. This discovery challenges the conventional understanding of silicon's optical constraints and opens a practical pathway toward high-performance silicon-based optical and optoelectronic components.</description>

      <title>Third Harmonic Upconverted Full-Stokes Imaging with High-Efficiency Germanium Metasurface from MWIR to SWIR</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.06214</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.06214v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Dielectric resonant metasurfaces can be utilized for efficient high harmonic generation, which has been explored here in this effort for a high-efficient Germanium metasurface for upconverted full-Stokes imaging at 1.33-micron wavelength by the third harmonic generation (THG) from the 4-micron fundamental wavelength. The internal TH conversion efficiency for the Ge film is about 1x10-5 % to 5.6x10-3 % and for the Ge-metasurface 1.5x10-4 % to 1.05x10-1 % for linearly polarized (LP) incidence, and 1.3x10-4 % to 6.1x10-2 % for circularly polarized (CP) incidence, for the optical intensity range 0.47 GW/cm2 to 16.8 GW/cm2 respectively. The effect of the Ge film height variation has been discussed and compared with transmission line theory for the nonlinear medium. The metasurface design pitch is suitably tuned for the anisotropic cross-triangles nanoantenna for analyzing the polarization states of the fundamental beam simultaneously. The effect of source intensity on TH conversion among the LP and CP states, flipping the nonlinear diffraction orders and incipient of new harmonics with intensity dependence and design limitations, has also been addressed. To my knowledge, with this type of metasurface design, this is the first approach for upconverted full-Stokes imaging. The benefit will be upconverted polarimetry of MWIR at SWIR, where uncooled efficient detectors are available for high-resolution thermal imaging. This efficient Ge-metasurface is exempt from TH transmission loss due to the size effect of assigning a phase gradient for polarization-dependent TH diffraction order generation and orthogonal transmission disparity. Integration of this type of metasurface for infrared image upconversion will open new possibilities for intense heat signature identification, especially for target recognition in next-generation infrared homing devices in surveillance and missile defense systems.</description>

      <title>A Compact Framework for Analyzing Asynchronous Entanglement Distribution in Quantum Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.22992</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.22992v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This work introduces a compact framework for analyzing asynchronous entanglement distribution protocols under realistic error models. We focus on two contemporary protocols: sequential, where entanglement is established one node at a time, and parallel, where all nodes attempt to generate entanglement simultaneously. We derive an analytical expression for the fidelity of distributed entangled states, showing that the fidelity depends only on the total time all qubits spend in memory, rather than the individual memory times for each qubit. This result distills the complex dynamics of entanglement distribution into a compact accessible form, providing an scalable tool for evaluating protocol efficiency. Using this lightweight framework, we analyze the performance of parallel and sequential protocols, demonstrating that parallel distribution consistently outperforms sequential and highlighting the potential of parallel protocols for practical quantum network implementations.</description>

      <title>Can Randomly Structured Metasurfaces Be Used for Quantum Tomography of High-Dimensional Spatial Qudits?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.08597</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.08597v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Reconstructing the density matrix of the quantum state of photons through a tomographically complete set of measurements, known as quantum state tomography, is an essential task in nearly all applications of quantum science and technology, from quantum sensing to quantum communications. Recent advances in optical metasurfaces enable the design of ultrathin nanostructured optical elements performing such state tomography tasks, promising greater simplicity, miniaturization, and scalability. However, reported metasurfaces on this goal were limited to a small Hilbert dimension, e.g., polarization qubits or spatial qudits with only a few states. When scaling up to higher-dimensional qudit tomography problems, especially those involving spatial qudits, a natural question arises: whether a metasurface with randomized nanostructures is sufficient to perform such qudit tomography, achieving optimal conditions. In this work, we attempt to answer this question through a set of numerical experiments with random metasurfaces, utilizing large-scale simulations of over 16,000 distinct metasurfaces each exceeding 200 wavelengths in size. We show that with sufficient redundancy in the number of detectors, random metasurfaces perform reasonably well in quantum photonic spatial qudit tomography encoded in Hermite-Gaussian states for up to approximately 10 states. Furthermore, we discuss additional considerations for optimizing metasurfaces in multiphoton cases. Our work opens a pathway toward computationally efficient, miniaturized, and error-tolerant quantum measurement platforms.</description>

      <title>Bistability of optical properties of cesium vapor due to collective interaction of alignment and orientation under strong spin exchange conditions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.10119</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.10119v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Hydrogen-like alkali atoms with a single valence electron are the most common objects in quantum optics and, at the same time, serve as essential tools of the field. Under conditions of optical pumping, strong spin-exchange and ultra-weak magnetic field (spin-exchange relaxation free mode, SERF), ensembles of such atoms in the gas phase can demonstrate not only the absence of spin-exchange relaxation, but also nonlinear collective effects. We present experimental evidence that the alignment, i.e. the quadrupole momentum, can not only be preserved under SERF conditions, but also coexist and interact with the orientation, i.e. the dipole momentum. We also show that this interaction leads to bistability: a small change in conditions can cause the medium to transition to a different steady state, an effect characterized by hysteresis. The combination of properties of this effect opens up a wide range of applications as optical keys or memory elements with a storage time of hundreds of seconds in tasks of quantum information and cryptography.</description>
