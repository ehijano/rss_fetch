      <title>Combining complex Langevin dynamics with score-based and energy-based diffusion models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.01328</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.01328v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Theories with a sign problem due to a complex action or Boltzmann weight can sometimes be numerically solved using a stochastic process in the complexified configuration space. However, the probability distribution effectively sampled by this complex Langevin process is not known a priori and notoriously hard to understand. In generative AI, diffusion models can learn distributions, or their log derivatives, from data. We explore the ability of diffusion models to learn the distributions sampled by a complex Langevin process, comparing score-based and energy-based diffusion models, and speculate about possible applications.</description>

      <title>Machine learning in lattice quantum gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.02159</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.02159v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Using numerical data coming from Monte Carlo simulations of four-dimensional Causal Dynamical Triangulations, we study how automated machine learning algorithms can be used to recognize transitions between different phases of quantum geometries observed in lattice quantum gravity. We tested seven supervised and seven unsupervised machine learning models and found that most of them were very successful in that task, even outperforming standard methods based on order parameters.</description>

      <title>Flux tubes in QCD at finite temperature</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.02177</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.02177v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present results for the chromo-electric field generated by a static quark-antiquark pair at finite temperature, in lattice QCD with 2+1 dynamical staggered fermions at physical quark masses. We investigate the evolution of the field as the temperature increases through and beyond the chiral transition. For all the temperatures considered we find clear evidence of a chromo-magnetic current and of a longitudinal nonperturbative chromo-electric field that stays almost uniform along the flux tube. In the high-temperature region the magnitude of the flux-tube field is determined by an effective string tension that decreases exponentially as the temperature increases, while the flux-tube width decreases according to an inverse-temperature law. Our results suggest that beyond the chiral pseudocritical temperature the quark-antiquark system can be characterized by a screened string tension.</description>

      <title>Semileptonic and nonleptonic weak decays of bottom baryons $\Omega^{(*)}_{b}$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.01429</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.01429v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present an investigation into the semileptonic and nonleptonic weak decays of bottom baryons $\Omega^{*}_{b}$ and $\Omega_{b}$ within the framework of three-point QCD sum rules. In the semileptonic sector, the $\Omega^{*}_b\rightarrow\Omega_c\ell\bar{\nu}_{\ell}$ and $\Omega_b\rightarrow\Omega^*_c\ell\bar{\nu}_{\ell}$ transitions are specifically considered. Utilizing the operator product expansion up to dimension six, the responsible form factors of these decays are obtained. The acquired form factors enable us to determine the decay widths in three leptonic channels. Branching ratios related to the $\Omega_{b}$ baryon semileptonic decays are also presented. These invariant form factors are subsequently employed as inputs to determine the nonleptonic weak decay widths in various modes with emitting a pseudoscalar or vector meson. An extensive investigation into all possible decay channels of bottom baryons provides valuable information for future experiments to examine the SM predictions, explores the new physics effects in heavy baryonic decays, and advances the understanding of the internal structure of heavy baryons.</description>

      <title>Singly heavy tetraquark resonant states with multiple strange quarks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.01505</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.01505v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We systematically investigate the S-wave singly heavy tetraquark systems containing two or three strange quarks, $Qs\bar{s}\bar{s}$, $Qn\bar{s}\bar{s}$ and $Qs\bar{s}\bar{n}\left( Q=c,b,n=u,d \right) $, within the constituent quark potential model. We solve the four-body Schr\"odinger equation using the Gaussian expansion method (GEM) and identify resonances via the complex scaling method (CSM). There are no bound states below the lowest two-meson thresholds. We obtain several compact resonances with $J^P=0^+,2^+$ in $Qs\bar{s}\bar{s}$, and $J^P=2^+$ in $Qn\bar{s}\bar{s}$ and $Qs\bar{s}\bar{n}$. The pole positions are mainly distributed around $7.0-7.2$ GeV (bottom) and $3.7-3.9$ GeV (charm), with widths from a few to several tens of MeV. These resonances decay into $D_s\eta ^\prime ,{D_{(s)}^*}\phi ,{D_s}^*K^*$ and $D_s^*\bar{K}^*$ (and their bottom counterparts), providing targets for future experimental searches.</description>

      <title>Addressing the sign-problem in Euclidean path integrals with radial basis function neural networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.01695</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.01695v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Solving interacting field theories at finite densities remains a numerically and conceptually challenging task, even with modern computational capabilities. In this paper, we propose a novel approach based on an expansion of the Euclidean path integrals using radial basis function neural networks, which allows the calculation of observables at finite densities and overcomes the sign problem in a numerically very efficient manner. The method is applied to an interacting complex scalar field theory at finite chemical potential in 3+1 dimensions, which exhibits both the sign problem and the silver blaze phenomenon, similar to QCD. The critical chemical potential at which phase transition occurs is estimated to be $\mu_c=1.17 \pm 0.018$, and the silver blaze problem is accurately described below $\mu_c$.</description>

      <title>Digital quantum simulation of many-body localization crossover in a disordered kicked Ising model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.01983</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.01983v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Simulating nonequilibrium dynamics of quantum many-body systems is one of the most promising applications of quantum computers. However, a faithful digital quantum simulation of the Hamiltonian evolution is very challenging in the present noisy quantum devices. Instead, nonequilibrium dynamics under the Floquet evolution realized by the Trotter decomposition of the Hamiltonian evolution with a large Trotter step size is considered to be a suitable problem for simulating in the present or near-term quantum devices. In this work, we propose simulating the many-body localization crossover as such a nonequilibrium problem in the disordered Floquet many-body systems. As a demonstration, we simulate the many-body localization crossover in a disordered kicked Ising model on a heavy-hex lattice using $60$ qubits from $156$ qubits available in the IBM Heron r2 superconducting qubit device named ibm\_fez. We compute out-of-time-ordered correlators as an indicator of the many-body localization crossover. From the late-time behavior of out-of-time-ordered correlators, we locate the quantum chaotic and many-body localized regimes as a function of the disorder strength. The validity of the results is confirmed by comparing two independent error mitigation methods, that is, the operator renormalization method and zero-noise extrapolation.</description>

      <title>Fully charm tetraquark production at hadronic collisions with gluon radiation effects</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.02085</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.02085v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We have completed the first complete next-to-leading order QCD calculation for the fully charm tetraquark state. By resumming over various gluon radiation effects, we have improved the precision of their hadroproduction cross-section to the order of ${\cal O}(\alpha_s^5)$. Through symmetry analysis, we investigated the possible quark configurations of the fully charm tetraquark and expanded its states in the color symmetry-antisymmetry basis. By combining LHCb data on the total cross section of the exotic hadron X(6900) and CMS measurements of its spin-parity, we extracted the non-perturbative but universal long-distance matrix elements. In the end, the rapidity and transverse momentum distributions are predicted, which await further experimental verification.</description>

      <title>Gradient and Hessian-Based Temperature Estimator in Lattice Gauge Theories: A Diagnostic Tool for Stability and Consistency in Numerical Simulations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.05595</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.05595v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present a field configuration-based temperature estimator in lattice gauge theories, constructed from the gradient and Hessian of the Euclidean action. Adapted from geometric formulations of entropy in classical statistical mechanics, this estimator provides a gauge-invariant, non-kinetic diagnostic of thermodynamic consistency in Monte Carlo simulations. We validate the method in compact U(1) lattice gauge theories across one, two, and four dimensions, comparing the estimated configurational temperature with the conventional temperature set by the temporal extent of the lattice. Our results show that the estimator accurately reproduces the input temperature and remains robust across a range of lattice volumes and coupling strengths. The temperature estimator offers a general-purpose diagnostic for lattice field theory simulations, with potential applications to non-Abelian theories, anisotropic lattices, and real-time monitoring in hybrid Monte Carlo algorithms.</description>

      <title>Partonic distribution functions and amplitudes using tensor network methods</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.09738</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.09738v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Calculations of the parton distribution function (PDF) and distribution amplitude (DA) are highly relevant to core experimental programs as they provide non-perturbative inputs to inclusive and exclusive processes, respectively. Direct computation of the PDFs and DAs remains challenging because they are non-perturbative quantities defined as light-cone correlators of quark and gluon fields, and are therefore inherently time-dependent. In this work, we use a uniform quantum strategy based on tensor network simulation techniques to directly extract these hadronic quantities from first principles using the matrix product state of the hadrons in the same setup. We present exemplary numerical calculations with the Nambu-Jona-Lasinio model in 1+1 dimensions and compare with available exact diagonalization and quantum circuit simulation results. Using tensor networks, we evaluate the PDF and DA at various strong couplings in the large-qubit limit, which is consistent with expectations at perturbative and non-relativistic limits.</description>

      <title>Emergence of the polydeterminant in QCD</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.15617</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.15617v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A generalization of the determinant appears in particle physics in effective Lagrangian interaction terms that model the chiral anomaly in Quantum Chromodynamics (PRD 97 (2018) 9, 091901 PRD 109 (2024) 7, L071502), in particular in connection to mesons. This \textit{polydeterminant function}, known in the mathematical literature as a mixed discriminant, associates $N$ distinct $N\times N$ complex matrices into a complex number and reduces to the usual determinant when all matrices are taken as equal. Here, we explore the main properties of the polydeterminant applied to (quantum) fields by using a formalism and a language close to high-energy physics approaches. We discuss its use as a tool to write down novel chiral anomalous Lagrangian terms and present an explicit illustrative model for mesons. Finally, the extension of the polydeterminant as a function of tensors is shown.</description>

      <title>Semileptonic decays of doubly charmed (bottom) baryons to single heavy baryons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.17030</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.17030v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate the semileptonic decays of baryons containing double charm or double bottom quarks, focusing on their transitions to single heavy baryons through three-point QCD sum rule framework. In our calculations, we take into account nonperturbative operators with mass dimensions up to five. We calculate the form factors associated with these decays, emphasizing the vector and axial-vector transition currents in the corresponding amplitude. By applying fitting functions for the form factors based on the squared momentum transfer, we derive predictions for decay widths and branching ratios in their possible lepton channels. These findings offer valuable insights for experimentalists exploring semileptonic decays of doubly charm or bottom baryons. Perhaps they can be validated in upcoming experiments like LHCb. These investigations contribute to a deeper understanding of the decay mechanisms in these baryonic channels.</description>
