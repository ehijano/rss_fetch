      <title>DualEquiNet: A Dual-Space Hierarchical Equivariant Network for Large Biomolecules</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.19862</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.19862v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Geometric graph neural networks (GNNs) that respect E(3) symmetries have achieved strong performance on small molecule modeling, but they face scalability and expressiveness challenges when applied to large biomolecules such as RNA and proteins. These systems require models that can simultaneously capture fine-grained atomic interactions, long-range dependencies across spatially distant components, and biologically relevant hierarchical structure, such as atoms forming residues, which in turn form higher-order domains. Existing geometric GNNs, which typically operate exclusively in either Euclidean or Spherical Harmonics space, are limited in their ability to capture both the fine-scale atomic details and the long-range, symmetry-aware dependencies required for modeling the multi-scale structure of large biomolecules. We introduce DualEquiNet, a Dual-Space Hierarchical Equivariant Network that constructs complementary representations in both Euclidean and Spherical Harmonics spaces to capture local geometry and global symmetry-aware features. DualEquiNet employs bidirectional cross-space message passing and a novel Cross-Space Interaction Pooling mechanism to hierarchically aggregate atomic features into biologically meaningful units, such as residues, enabling efficient and expressive multi-scale modeling for large biomolecular systems. DualEquiNet achieves state-of-the-art performance on multiple existing benchmarks for RNA property prediction and protein modeling, and outperforms prior methods on two newly introduced 3D structural benchmarks demonstrating its broad effectiveness across a range of large biomolecule modeling tasks.</description>

      <title>Scalable and Cost-Efficient de Novo Template-Based Molecular Generation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.19865</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.19865v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Template-based molecular generation offers a promising avenue for drug design by ensuring generated compounds are synthetically accessible through predefined reaction templates and building blocks. In this work, we tackle three core challenges in template-based GFlowNets: (1) minimizing synthesis cost, (2) scaling to large building block libraries, and (3) effectively utilizing small fragment sets. We propose \textbf{Recursive Cost Guidance}, a backward policy framework that employs auxiliary machine learning models to approximate synthesis cost and viability. This guidance steers generation toward low-cost synthesis pathways, significantly enhancing cost-efficiency, molecular diversity, and quality, especially when paired with an \textbf{Exploitation Penalty} that balances the trade-off between exploration and exploitation. To enhance performance in smaller building block libraries, we develop a \textbf{Dynamic Library} mechanism that reuses intermediate high-reward states to construct full synthesis trees. Our approach establishes state-of-the-art results in template-based molecular generation.</description>

      <title>ProCaliper: functional and structural analysis, visualization, and annotation of proteins</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.19961</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.19961v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Understanding protein function at the molecular level requires connecting residue-level annotations with physical and structural properties. This can be cumbersome and error-prone when functional annotation, computation of physico-chemical properties, and structure visualization are separated. To address this, we introduce ProCaliper, an open-source Python library for computing and visualizing physico-chemical properties of proteins. It can retrieve annotation and structure data from UniProt and AlphaFold databases, compute residue-level properties such as charge, solvent accessibility, and protonation state, and interactively visualize the results of these computations along with user-supplied residue-level data. Additionally, ProCaliper incorporates functional and structural information to construct and optionally sparsify networks that encode the distance between residues and/or annotated functional sites or regions. The package ProCaliper and its source code, along with the code used to generate the figures in this manuscript, are freely available at https://github.com/PNNL-Predictive-Phenomics/ProCaliper.</description>

      <title>Modelling Statistics of Polypeptides in Emissions from Smokers Near Ocean Ridges</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.20052</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.20052v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We have previously shown in model studies that rapid quenches of systems of monomers interacting to form polymer chains can fix nonequilibrium chemistries which could lead to the origin of life. We suggested that such quenching processes might have occurred at very high rates on early earth, giving an efficient mechanism for natural sorting through enormous numbers of nonequilibrium chemistries from which those most likely to lead to life could be naturally selected. Taking account of kinetic barriers, we found good agreement between laboratory quenching experiments on solutions of amino acids and the resulting model. We also made a preliminary comparison between reported data on polypeptides sampled from emissions from smokers near ocean ridges and our model. However that previous model assumed that the concentrations of all monomeric amino acids in the medium were the same whereas that is not the case in samples taken from ocean smokers. Here we take account of the heterogeneous concentrations of the amino acid monomers in the medium in the analysis of the smoker data and compare the results with the data on polypeptide concentrations found in the samples taken by a submersible in the Marianna Trough. Results are consistent with the hypothesis that smokers were the source of large and extremely diverse number of polypeptides in thermal disequilibrium which could incubate processes leading to life.</description>

      <title>PocketVina Enables Scalable and Highly Accurate Physically Valid Docking through Multi-Pocket Conditioning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.20043</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.20043v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Sampling physically valid ligand-binding poses remains a major challenge in molecular docking, particularly for unseen or structurally diverse targets. We introduce PocketVina, a fast and memory-efficient, search-based docking framework that combines pocket prediction with systematic multi-pocket exploration. We evaluate PocketVina across four established benchmarks--PDBbind2020 (timesplit and unseen), DockGen, Astex, and PoseBusters--and observe consistently strong performance in sampling physically valid docking poses. PocketVina achieves state-of-the-art performance when jointly considering ligand RMSD and physical validity (PB-valid), while remaining competitive with deep learning-based approaches in terms of RMSD alone, particularly on structurally diverse and previously unseen targets. PocketVina also maintains state-of-the-art physically valid docking accuracy across ligands with varying degrees of flexibility. We further introduce TargetDock-AI, a benchmarking dataset we curated, consisting of over 500000 protein-ligand pairs, and a partition of the dataset labeled with PubChem activity annotations. On this large-scale dataset, PocketVina successfully discriminates active from inactive targets, outperforming a deep learning baseline while requiring significantly less GPU memory and runtime. PocketVina offers a robust and scalable docking strategy that requires no task-specific training and runs efficiently on standard GPUs, making it well-suited for high-throughput virtual screening and structure-based drug discovery.</description>

      <title>Protein FID: Improved Evaluation of Protein Structure Generative Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.08041</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.08041v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Protein structure generative models have seen a recent surge of interest, but meaningfully evaluating them computationally is an active area of research. While current metrics have driven useful progress, they do not capture how well models sample the design space represented by the training data. We argue for a protein Frechet Inception Distance (FID) metric to supplement current evaluations with a measure of distributional similarity in a semantically meaningful latent space. Our FID behaves desirably under protein structure perturbations and correctly recapitulates similarities between protein samples: it correlates with optimal transport distances and recovers FoldSeek clusters and the CATH hierarchy. Evaluating current protein structure generative models with FID shows that they fall short of modeling the distribution of PDB proteins.</description>

      <title>Efficient high-resolution refinement in cryo-EM with stochastic gradient descent</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.16100</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.16100v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Electron cryomicroscopy (cryo-EM) is an imaging technique widely used in structural biology to determine the three-dimensional structure of biological molecules from noisy two-dimensional projections with unknown orientations. As the typical pipeline involves processing large amounts of data, efficient algorithms are crucial for fast and reliable results. The stochastic gradient descent (SGD) algorithm has been used to improve the speed of ab initio reconstruction, which results in a first, low-resolution estimation of the volume representing the molecule of interest, but has yet to be applied successfully in the high-resolution regime, where expectation-maximization algorithms achieve state-of-the-art results, at a high computational cost. In this article, we investigate the conditioning of the optimization problem and show that the large condition number prevents the successful application of gradient descent-based methods at high resolution. Our results include a theoretical analysis of the condition number of the optimization problem in a simplified setting where the individual projection directions are known, an algorithm based on computing a diagonal preconditioner using Hutchinson's diagonal estimator, and numerical experiments showing the improvement in the convergence speed when using the estimated preconditioner with SGD. The preconditioned SGD approach can potentially enable a simple and unified approach to ab initio reconstruction and high-resolution refinement with faster convergence speed and higher flexibility, and our results are a promising step in this direction.</description>
