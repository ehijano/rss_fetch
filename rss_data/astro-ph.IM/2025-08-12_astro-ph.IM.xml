      <title>tilepy: Smart Scheduling for Multi-Messenger Astronomy from Earth to Orbit</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.07824</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.07824v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The rise of direct detection of gravitational waves (GWs) started a new era in multi-messenger astrophysics. Like GWs, many other astrophysical transient sources suffer from poor localization, which can span tens to thousands of square degrees in the sky. Moreover, as the detection horizon for these transients widens and the detection rate increases, current electromagnetic follow-up facilities require tools to optimize the follow-up of poorly localized events and save valuable telescope time for their time-domain astrophysics programs. We present \texttt{tilepy}, a Python library, and a tool to optimize the follow-up of poorly localized transient events. \texttt{tilepy} is used for GWs as well as other poorly localized events such as gamma-ray bursts detected by Fermi-GBM and neutrino candidates from IceCube. \texttt{tilepy} has also been optimized to integrate smoothly with multiple ground-based observatories operating individually or simultaneously with diverse observational configurations. In this contribution, we introduce the latest developments from \texttt{tilepy}, mainly the ability to operate with space-based observatories while taking into consideration factors such as Earth, Sun, and Moon occultation and South Atlantic Anomaly passage. We present innovations to the platform, handling a variety of field of view shapes, the possibility of optimizing observation scheduling with artificial intelligence tools and examples of its use on transient astrophysical events.</description>

      <title>AugerPrime: Status and first results</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.08056</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.08056v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: With the knowledge and statistical precision derived from two decades of measurement, the Pierre Auger Observatory has significantly deepened our understanding of ultra-high-energy cosmic rays while unearthing an increasingly complex astrophysical landscape and exposing tensions with hadronic interaction models. The field now demands the mass of individual cosmic-ray primaries as an observable with an exposure that only the 3000-square-kilometer surface array of the Observatory can provide. Access to the primary mass hinges on the disentanglement of the electromagnetic and muonic components of extensive air showers. To achieve this, scintillator and radio detectors have been installed atop each existing water-Cherenkov detector of the surface array, whose dynamic range has also been enhanced through the installation of small-area PMTs. Additionally, the timing and signal resolution of all detector stations have been improved through upgraded station electronics, and underground muon counters have been installed in a region of the array with denser spacing. As the commissioning of the final components of AugerPrime reaches its conclusion and the enhanced array comes fully online, we present the realization of its design, its performance, and the first results from this now multi-hybrid observatory.</description>

      <title>Flight masks of the Roman Space Telescope Coronagraph Instrument</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.08063</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.08063v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Over the past two decades, thousands of confirmed exoplanets have been detected. The next major challenge is to characterize these other worlds and their stellar systems. Much information on the composition and formation of exoplanets and circumstellar debris disks can only be achieved via direct imaging. Direct imaging is challenging because of the small angular separations (&lt; 1 arcsec) and high star-to-planet flux ratios such as ~1e9 for a Jupiter analog or ~1e10 for an Earth analog in the visible. Atmospheric turbulence prohibits reaching such high flux ratios on the ground, so observations must be made above the Earth's atmosphere. The Nancy Grace Roman Space Telescope (Roman), planned to launch in late 2026, will be the first space-based observatory to demonstrate high-contrast imaging with active wavefront control using its Coronagraph Instrument. The instrument's main purpose is to mature the various technologies needed for a future flagship mission to image and characterize Earth-like exoplanets. These technologies include two high-actuator-count deformable mirrors, photon-counting detectors, two complementary wavefront sensing and control loops, and two different coronagraph types. In this paper, we describe the complete set of flight masks in the Roman Coronagraph Instrument, their intended combinations, and how they were laid out, fabricated, and measured.</description>

      <title>Hybrid Approaches for Black Hole Spin Estimation: From Classical Spectroscopy to Physics-Informed Machine Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.06506</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.06506v2 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The measurement of black hole spin is considered one of the key problems in relativistic astrophysics. Existing methods, such as continuum fitting, X-ray reflection spectroscopy and quasi-periodic oscillation analysis, have systematic limitations in accuracy, interpretability and scalability. In this work, a hybrid approach is proposed in which theoretical models based on the Teukolsky formalism are integrated with Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs). A PINN model is developed to solve the linearized spin problem in the scalar case, with physical constraints directly embedded into the training process. Annotated data are not required; instead, the model is trained using the differential operator and boundary conditions as supervision. It is demonstrated that the PINN converges reliably, with residual loss values below 1e-7 and a root mean squared error (RMSE) of the order of 1e-6 (final approx 5.4 x 1e-8). Benchmarking results indicate that the proposed method outperforms both classical and data-driven machine learning approaches in terms of AUC and sensitivity, while also exhibiting superior interpretability, generalizability and adherence to physical principles, with moderate computational cost. Potential extensions include integration with general relativistic magnetohydrodynamics (GRMHD) solvers and application to real observational data. These findings support the viability of physics-based machine learning as a robust framework for accurate and interpretable black hole spin estimation.</description>

      <title>Benchmarking Deep Learning-Based Object Detection Models on Feature Deficient Astrophotography Imagery Dataset</title>

      <description>arXiv:2508.06537v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Object detection models are typically trained on datasets like ImageNet, COCO, and PASCAL VOC, which focus on everyday objects. However, these lack signal sparsity found in non-commercial domains. MobilTelesco, a smartphone-based astrophotography dataset, addresses this by providing sparse night-sky images. We benchmark several detection models on it, highlighting challenges under feature-deficient conditions.</description>

      <title>Reconstruction of Solar EUV Irradiance Using CaII K Images and SOHO/SEM Data with Bayesian Deep Learning and Uncertainty Quantification</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.07065</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.07065v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Solar extreme ultraviolet (EUV) irradiance plays a crucial role in heating the Earth's ionosphere, thermosphere, and mesosphere, affecting atmospheric dynamics over varying time scales. Although significant effort has been spent studying short-term EUV variations from solar transient events, there is little work to explore the long-term evolution of the EUV flux over multiple solar cycles. Continuous EUV flux measurements have only been available since 1995, leaving significant gaps in earlier data. In this study, we propose a Bayesian deep learning model, named SEMNet, to fill the gaps. We validate our approach by applying SEMNet to construct SOHO/SEM EUV flux measurements in the period between 1998 and 2014 using CaII K images from the Precision Solar Photometric Telescope. We then extend SEMNet through transfer learning to reconstruct solar EUV irradiance in the period between 1950 and 1960 using CaII K images from the Kodaikanal Solar Observatory. Experimental results show that SEMNet provides reliable predictions along with uncertainty bounds, demonstrating the feasibility of CaII K images as a robust proxy for long-term EUV fluxes. These findings contribute to a better understanding of solar influences on Earth's climate over extended periods.</description>

      <title>A tunable Monte Carlo method for mixing correlated-k opacities. PRAS: polynomial reconstruction and sampling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.07072</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.07072v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Accurately accounting for mixed-gas opacities is critical for radiative-transfer (RT) calculations in sub-stellar atmospheres. To produce the total k-coefficients of an arbitrary mixture of gases and their associated volume mixing ratios (VMRs), several methods are applied in the literature with various levels of overall accuracy and ease of computation. We propose a simple, tunable random overlap method, polynomial reconstruction and sampling (PRAS). PRAS is a Monte Carlo-based technique, sampling polynomial approximations of the opacity cumulative distribution function (CDF) in a wavelength band for each species requiring mixing. The method enables control over the end accuracy of the opacity mixture through choices in CDF fitting and number of random samples used in the mixing scheme. We find PRAS is typically as accurate, or more accurate, than other methods at recovering individual, pre-mixed k-coefficients. In an emission spectrum comparison test, PRAS, even with a small number of samples (100), is within ~2% of the reference 16+16 Legendre quadrature node random overlap with resorting and rebinning (RORR) results, and is typically more accurate than the 4+4 and 8+8 Legendre node schemes. In the vertical flux and heating rate tests, we also find that PRAS is generally more accurate than other schemes, and an improvement over the adaptive equivalent extinction (AEE) method. Overall, our current tests show PRAS is a generally viable alternative for the calculation of randomly overlapped opacities, especially in scenarios where increased accuracy of the RT calculation is required and when larger numbers of quadrature points are used. PRAS may therefore provide a benefit in performance and accuracy for high-precision retrieval modelling of JWST data.</description>

      <title>Solar Flux Atlases: The new HARPS-N Quiet Sun Benchmark and Ca II H &amp; K Lines Continuum Normalisation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.07912</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.07912v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Context. Solar flux atlases observe the spatially integrated light from the Sun, treating it as a star. They are fundamental tools for gaining insight into the composition of the Sun and other stars, and are utilized as reference material for a wide range of solar applications such as stellar chemical abundances, atmospheric physics, stellar activity, and radial velocity signals. Aims. We provide a detailed comparison of solar activity in some of the well-known solar atlases against the new High Accuracy Radial velocity Planet Searcher for the Northern hemisphere (HARPS-N) Quiet Sun (QS) and measured activity (MA) atlases that are published, for the first time, in this work. Methods. Ten of the widely used individual spectral lines from each flux atlas were selected to compare solar activity using three methods: 1) Equivalent Widths 2) Activity number, a novel activity measure which we introduce in this work. 3) Bisectors and radial velocity. Results. The significantly smaller activity measured in the MA atlas compared to the other atlases, relative to the QS atlas, underscores the dominance of instrumental effects over solar activity in their impact on spectral lines, which cannot be corrected through simple line convolution to match resolutions of other atlases. Additionally, our investigation unexpectedly revealed a substantial intensity shift in the Ca ii H &amp; K lines of other atlases compared to our HARPS-N atlases, likely caused by assumptions in normalisation techniques used in the early Kitt Peak atlases. Conclusions. With an average spot number of zero, our QS atlas is well suited to serve as an absolute benchmark atlas representative of solar minimum for the visible spectrum that other atlases can be compared against. Our recommendations are 1) publication of a detailed log along with the observations, to include exact dates and indications of solar activity...</description>

      <title>Virtual Observatory and machine learning for the study of low-mass objects in photometric and spectroscopic surveys</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.07998</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.07998v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Low-mass objects are ubiquitous in our Galaxy. Their low temperature provides them with complex atmospheres characterised by the presence of strong molecular absorption bands which, together with their faintness, have made their accurate characterisation a great challenge for astronomers over the last decades. M dwarfs account for 75% of the census of stars within 10 pc of the Sun, and their suitability as targets in the search for Earth-like planets has led many research groups to focus on the study of these objects, which is crucial for the understanding of the structure and kinematics of our Galaxy. Very low-mass stars and substellar objects with spectral types M7 or later, including the extended L, T, and Y spectral types, constitute the domain of ultracool dwarfs. The study of these objects, discovered definitively in 1995, is key for understanding the boundary between stellar and substellar objects and promises to experience a quantum leap thanks to the characteristics of new-generation surveys such as Euclid or LSST.
  Data analysis in the field of observational astronomy has undergone a paradigm shift during the last decades driven by an exponential growth in the volume and complexity of available data. In this revolution, the Virtual Observatory has become a cornerstone providing a system that fosters interoperability between astronomical archives around the world. In response to this growth in data complexity, the astronomical community has increasingly adopted machine learning techniques for the development of scalable, automated solutions.
  This thesis explores the discovery and characterisation of M dwarfs and ultracool dwarfs, using data-driven approaches supported by Virtual Observatory technologies and protocols. We rely on a variety of machine and deep learning techniques to develop flexible methodologies aimed at advancing our understanding of low-mass objects.</description>

      <title>Adaptive Online Emulation for Accelerating Complex Physical Simulations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.08012</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.08012v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Complex physical simulations often require trade-offs between model fidelity and computational feasibility. We introduce Adaptive Online Emulation (AOE), which dynamically learns neural network surrogates during simulation execution to accelerate expensive components. Unlike existing methods requiring extensive offline training, AOE uses Online Sequential Extreme Learning Machines (OS-ELMs) to continuously adapt emulators along the actual simulation trajectory. We employ a numerically stable variant of the OS-ELM using cumulative sufficient statistics to avoid matrix inversion instabilities. AOE integrates with time-stepping frameworks through a three-phase strategy balancing data collection, updates, and surrogate usage, while requiring orders of magnitude less training data than conventional surrogate approaches. Demonstrated on a 1D atmospheric model of exoplanet GJ1214b, AOE achieves 11.1 times speedup (91% time reduction) across 200,000 timesteps while maintaining accuracy, potentially making previously intractable high-fidelity time-stepping simulations computationally feasible.</description>

      <title>Mitigating incoherent excess variance in high-redshift 21-cm observations with multi-output cross Gaussian process regression</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.08235</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.08235v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Systematic effects that limit the achievable sensitivity of current low-frequency radio telescopes to the 21-cm signal are among the foremost challenges in observational 21-cm cosmology. The standard approach to retrieving the 21-cm signal from radio interferometric data separates it from bright astrophysical foregrounds by exploiting their spectrally smooth nature, in contrast to the finer spectral structure of the 21-cm signal. Contaminants exhibiting rapid frequency fluctuations, on the other hand, are difficult to separate from the 21-cm signal using standard techniques, and the power from these contaminants contributes to low-level systematics that can limit our ability to detect the 21-cm signal. Many of these low-level systematics are incoherent across multiple nights of observation, resulting in an incoherent excess variance above the thermal noise sensitivity of the instrument. In this paper, we develop a method called cross-GPR (cross covariance Gaussian process regression) that exploits the incoherence of these systematics to separate them from the 21-cm signal, which remains coherent across multiple nights of observation. We first develop and demonstrate the technique on synthetic signals in a general setting, and then apply it to gridded interferometric visibility cubes. We perform realistic simulations of visibility cubes containing foregrounds, 21-cm signal, noise, and incoherent systematics. The simulations show that the method can successfully separate and subtract incoherent contributions to the excess variance, and its advantages over standard techniques become more evident when the spectral behavior of the contaminants resembles that of the 21-cm signal. Simulations performed on a variety of 21-cm signal shapes also reveal that the cross-GPR approach can subtract incoherent contributions to the excess variance, without suppressing the 21-cm signal.</description>

      <title>Classifying the unknown: discovering novel gravitational-wave detector glitches using similarity learning</title>

      <description>arXiv:1903.04058v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The observation of gravitational waves from compact binary coalescences by LIGO and Virgo has begun a new era in astronomy. A critical challenge in making detections is determining whether loud transient features in the data are caused by gravitational waves or by instrumental or environmental sources. The citizen-science project Gravity Spy has been demonstrated as an efficient infrastructure for classifying known types of noise transients (glitches) through a combination of data analysis performed by both citizen volunteers and machine learning. We present the next iteration of this project, using similarity indices to empower citizen scientists to create large data sets of unknown transients, which can then be used to facilitate supervised machine-learning characterization. This new evolution aims to alleviate a persistent challenge that plagues both citizen-science and instrumental detector work: the ability to build large samples of relatively rare events. Using two families of transient noise that appeared unexpectedly during LIGO's second observing run (O2), we demonstrate the impact that the similarity indices could have had on finding these new glitch types in the Gravity Spy program.</description>

Abstract: We present measurements and simulations of the polarization purity of leaky lens-antenna coupled microwave Kinetic Inductance Detectors (KIDs) at 1.5 THz. We find the integrated cross-polarization level to be at -21.5 dB for 1 f\#$\lambda$ spatial sampling. The measurements agree well with the theoretical description which is based on a combination of in-transmission simulation of the antenna feed, and an in-reception analysis of the antenna-KID system. Combined with the measured noise equivalent power of 5--7$\times$10$^{-20}$ W/$\sqrt{\mathrm{Hz}}$, these detectors are excellent candidates for large scale and high performance imaging polarimetric instruments.</description>

      <title>AI-Enhanced Self-Triggering for Extensive Air Showers: Performance and FPGA Feasibility</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.21198</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.21198v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Autonomous self-triggering for radio detection of extensive air showers remains challenging in realistic environments dominated by strong and variable radio-frequency interference. Traditional radio-array operations rely on external particle-detector triggers, limiting sensitivity and increasing system complexity. In this work, I present a proof-of-principle study demonstrating that deep-learning-based triggering can operate in such high-noise conditions and can be implemented within the strict latency constraints of large-scale radio observatories. Using measured high-interference noise traces combined with simulated cosmic-ray pulses, a fully convolutional network classifier was trained and optimised for robust separation of signals from background at MHz-scale trigger-trial rates. The trained model was quantised with HLS4ML to fixed-point precision and synthesised using Vitis HLS for multiple FPGA targets. The quantised implementation preserves the floating-point model performance (AUC_float = 0.997, AUC_quant = 0.996) while achieving microsecond-scale inference latencies. These results show that modern FPGA-based AI inference, enabled by high-level synthesis, can provide low-latency, radio-only triggering for next-generation cosmic-ray observatories, potentially removing the need for external trigger systems and reducing array complexity.</description>

      <title>The Great Observatories: A Triumph of the Human Spirit</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.09735v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In January of 1985, more than 40 years ago, a group of astronomers met with NASA officials to map out the future of NASA space astronomy. Their efforts led to the Great Observatories program, linking four powerful space telescopes to study the heavens in four regions of the spectrum. The successful launch and operation of the Spitzer Space Telescope in the Fall of 2003 completed the launch of the Great Observatories, almost 20 years after the program was formulated, and two of the Observatories, Hubble and Chandra, continue to operate very productively. The scientific and public education results of the Great Observatories are well-known. Here we emphasize that fulfilling the extraordinary vision of the Great Observatories was a triumph of human ingenuity, dedication, and determination.</description>

      <title>CLARA: A Modular Framework for Unsupervised Transit Detection Using TESS Light Curves</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.04722</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.04722v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present CLARA, a modular framework for unsupervised transit detection in TESS light curves, leveraging Unsupervised Random Forests (URFs) trained on synthetic datasets and guided by morphological similarity analysis. This work addresses two core questions: (a) How does the design of synthetic training sets affect the performance and generalization of URFs across independent TESS sectors? (b) Do URF anomaly scores correlate with genuine astrophysical phenomena, enabling effective identification and clustering of transit-like signals? We investigate these questions through a two-part study focused on (1) detection performance optimization, and (2) the physical interpretability of anomalies. In Part I, we introduce three URF model variants tuned via alpha-controlled scoring objectives, and evaluate their generalization across five TESS sectors. This large-scale test involved scoring 384,000 individual light curves (128,000 light curves per alpha variant), revealing stable, interpretable differences between recall-optimized, precision-optimized, and balanced models. In Part II, our optimized clustering (DPMM Cluster 2) yields a 14.04% detection rate (16 confirmed transits among 114 candidates) from the first five TESS SPOC sectors. This reflects a substantial enrichment over baseline rates: 0.4569% for the full TESS-SPOC project candidate set (7658 candidates across 1.68 million light curves), and 0.2650% for the FFI-based SPOC sample (7658 candidates across 2.89 million light curves;). All computations were performed on a personal, CPU-only desktop with an Intel Core i3-8100 processor and 32 GB RAM, using parallelized scoring and classification routines across four physical cores. CLARA processed over 87,000 TESS SPOC light curves (Sectors 1-5) without GPU acceleration in Part-II.</description>

      <title>Checking the Empirical Relations with the Current Localized Fast Radio Bursts</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.12983</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.12983v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Although fast radio bursts (FRBs) were discovered more than a decade ago, and they have been one of the active fields in astronomy and cosmology, their origins are still unknown. An interesting topic closely related to the origins of FRBs is their classifications. Different classes of FRBs require different physical mechanisms. If some empirical relations are found for different classes of FRBs, they might justify the classifications scenario and help us to reveal the physical mechanisms behind. On the other hand, FRBs are actually a promising probe for cosmology, since their redshifts could be $z\sim 3$ or even higher. Similar to the cosmology of type Ia supernovae (SNIa) or Gamma-ray bursts (GRBs), some empirical relations might also play an important role in the FRB cosmology. In the literature, some new classifications of FRBs different from repeaters and non-repeaters were proposed recently. In particular, it was suggested to classify FRBs into the ones associated with old or young stellar populations, and some empirical relations have also been found for them, respectively. One of these empirical relations (namely $L_\nu-E$ relation) without dispersion measure (DM) has been used to calibrate FRBs as standard candles for cosmology. This shows the potential of the new classification and the empirical relations for FRBs. Nowadays, more than 50 FRBs have been well localized, and hence their redshifts $z$ are observationally known. So, it is of interest to check the empirical relations with the actual data of current localized FRBs. We find that many empirical relations still hold, and in particular the one used to calibrate FRBs as standard candles for cosmology stands firm. This is beneficial to the FRB cosmology.</description>

      <title>Rigorous analytic solution to the gravitational-wave overlapping event rates</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.05218v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In the era of the next-generation gravitational-wave detectors, signal overlaps will become prevalent due to high detection rate and long signal duration, posing significant challenges to data analysis. While effective algorithms are being developed, there still lacks an integrated understanding on the statistical properties for the population of overlapping compact-binary-coalescence signals. For the first time, in order to aid rapid and robust estimation, we rigorously derive and establish analytical expressions for the expectation and variance for the number of overlapping events. This framework is highly extensible, allowing analytical calculation for more complicated scenarios, such as multi-signal overlaps, overlaps between different types of sources, and source-dependent thresholds. We also mathematically prove that the time difference between events in a single observation run is described by the beta distribution, offering an analytical prior reference for Bayesian analysis.</description>

      <title>Searching for continuous gravitational waves from highly deformed compact objects with DECIGO</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.03748</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.03748v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Searches for continuous gravitational waves from isolated compact objects and those in binary systems aim to detect non-axisymmetric, deformed neutron stars at particular locations in the Galaxy or all-sky. However, a large fraction of known pulsars have rotational frequencies that lie outside the audio frequency band, rendering current detectors insensitive to these pulsars. In this work, we show that DECIGO, a future space-based deci-hertz gravitational-wave interferometer, will be sensitive to severely deformed compact objects, e.g. hybrid stars, neutron stars, or magnetars. We estimate the number of possible compact objects that could be detected with such high deformations, both via their individual continuous gravitational-wave emission and the stochastic gravitational-wave background created by a superposition of gravitational waves from the $\sim 10^8$ compact objects in the Galaxy. Furthermore, we show that the existence of such compact objects could be probed across a wide parameter space at a fraction of the computational cost of current searches for isolated compact objects and those in binary systems. For known pulsars, we will be able to both beat the spin-down limit and probe the Brans-Dicke modified theory of gravity parameter $\zeta&lt;1$ for approximately 85% of known pulsars with $f_{\rm gw}&lt;10$ Hz, the latter of which is currently only possible for $O(10)$ pulsars. DECIGO will thus open a new window to probe highly deformed compact objects and over half of the known pulsars, both of which are currently inaccessible to ground-based detectors.</description>

      <title>Polka-dotted Stars: a Hierarchical Model for Mapping Stellar Surfaces Using Occultation Light Curves and the Case of TOI-3884</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.21852</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.21852v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present StarryStarryProcess, a novel hierarchical Bayesian framework for mapping stellar surfaces using exoplanet transit light curves. While previous methods relied solely on stellar rotational light curves -- which contain limited information about spot properties -- our approach leverages planetary transits as probes of stellar surfaces. When a planet crosses a spot during transit, it creates a distinctive change in the light curve that directly reveals spot properties. Our model integrates planetary transit modeling with stellar variability analysis by combining the spherical harmonic surface map representation from starry, the probabilistic approach to spot properties of StarryProcess, and a comprehensive transit model that accounts for spot-crossing events during transits. We demonstrate through synthetic data experiments that our model successfully recovers spot distributions, stellar orientation, and spot physical properties. We extend the framework to handle evolving stellar surfaces through time-dependent modeling. Applying our method to TESS observations of TOI-3884, we find evidence for high-latitude spot concentrations and significant spin-orbit misalignment. The transit-based approach overcomes fundamental limitations of previous models by providing constraints on spot properties that would remain hidden in the null space of rotational light curves alone. This methodology enables more accurate exoplanet characterization by disentangling stellar activity due to starspots from planetary signals while simultaneously providing insights into stellar magnetic activity patterns.

      <title>Detecting Modeling Bias with Continuous Time Flow Models on Weak Lensing Maps</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.00632v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Simulation-based inference provides a powerful framework for extracting rich information from nonlinear scales in current and upcoming cosmological surveys, and ensuring its robustness requires stringent validation of forward models. In this work, we recast forward model validation as an out-of-distribution (OoD) detection problem within the framework of machine learning (ML)-based simulation-based inference (SBI). We employ probability density as the metric for OoD detection, and compare various density estimation techniques, demonstrating that field-level probability density estimation via continuous time flow models (CTFM) significantly outperforms feature-level approaches that combine scattering transform (ST) or convolutional neural networks (CNN) with normalizing flows (NFs), as well as NF-based field-level estimators, as quantified by the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUROC). Our analysis shows that CTFM not only excels in detecting OoD samples but also provides a robust metric for model selection. Additionally, we verified CTFM maintains consistent efficacy across different cosmologies while mitigating the inductive biases inherent in NF architectures. Although our proof-of-concept study employs simplified forward modeling and noise settings, our framework establishes a promising pathway for identifying unknown systematics in the cosmology datasets.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2506.23595v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present a new method to search for gravitational waves from quasinormal modes in the ringdowns of the remnants of the mergers of the binary black hole systems. The method is based on maximum likelihood estimation. We derive a time-domain matched-filtering statistic that can be used to search for any number of modes in the data. The parameters of the modes can be estimated and the modes present in the data can be reconstructed. We perform Monte Carlo simulations of the method by injecting the quasinormal mode waveforms to noise. We analyze performance of the method for searches of quasinormal modes in the advanced detectors data like LIGO and Virgo, in the third generation of detectors like Einstein Telescope and Cosmic Explorer and in the space detector LISA data. We analyze ringdown of publicly available GW190521 event and we compare our results with analysis by other methods.</description>

      <title>The Rosetta Stone Project. II. The correlation between star formation efficiency and L/M indicator for the evolutionary stages of star-forming clumps in post-processed radiative magnetohydrodynamics simulations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.09936</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.09936v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Context. The evolution of massive star-forming clumps that are progenitors of high-mass young stellar objects are often classified based on a variety of observational indicators ranging from near-infrared to radio wavelengths. Among them, the ratio of the bolometric luminosity to the mass of their envelope, $L/M$, has been observationally diagnosed as a good indicator for the evolutionary classification of parsec-scale star-forming clumps in the Galaxy.
  Aims. We developed the Rosetta Stone project$\unicode{x2013}$an end-to-end framework designed to enable an accurate comparison between simulations and observations for investigating the formation and evolution of massive clumps. In this study, we calibrate the $L/M$ indicator in relation to the star formation efficiency (SFE) and the clump age, as derived from our suite of simulations.
  Methods. We performed multi-wavelength radiative transfer post-processing of radiative magnetohydrodynamics (RMHD) simulations of the collapse of star-forming clumps fragmenting into protostars. We generated synthetic observations to obtain far-infrared emission from $70$ to $500\,\mu$m, as was done in the Hi-GAL survey, and at $24\,\mu$m in the MIPSGAL survey, which were then used to build the spectral energy distributions (SEDs) and estimate the $L/M$ parameter. An additional $1.3\,$mm wavelength in ALMA Band 6 was also produced for the comparison with observational data. We applied observational techniques$\unicode{x2013}$commonly employed by observers$\unicode{x2013}$to the synthetic data in order to derive the corresponding physical parameters.
  Results. We find a correlation between $L/M$ and the SFE, with a power-law form $L/M\propto {\rm SFE}^{1.20^{+0.02}_{-0.02}}$. This correlation is independent of the mass of the clumps and the choice of initial conditions of the simulations in which they formed.
