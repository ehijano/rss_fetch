      <title>Graph-theoretical estimates of the diameters of the Rubik's Cube groups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.12961</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.12961v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A strict lower bound for the diameter of a symmetric graph is proposed, which is calculable with the order ($n$) and other local parameters of the graph such as the degree, even girth $g$ ($\geq 4$), and number of cycles of length $g$ passing through a vertex, which are easily determined by inspecting a small portion of the graph (unless the girth is large). It is applied to the symmetric Cayley graphs of the Rubik's Cube groups of various sizes and metrics, yielding reasonably tight lower bounds, which range from 60% to 77% of the correct diameters of large-$n$ graphs.</description>

      <title>The Demazure product extended to biwords</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.13165</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.13165v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The symmetric group $\mathfrak{S}_n$ (and more generally, any Coxeter group) admits an associative operation known as the Demazure product. In this paper, we first extend the Demazure product to the (infinite) set of all biwords on $\{1, \ldots, n\}$, or equivalently, the set of all $n \times n$ nonnegative integer matrices. We define this product diagrammatically, via braid-like graphs we call kelp beds, since they significantly generalize the seaweeds introduced by Tiskin (2015). Our motivation for this extended Demazure product arises from optimization theory, in particular the semigroup of all $(n+1) \times (n+1)$ simple nonnegative integer Monge matrices equipped with the distance (i.e., min-plus) product. As our main result, we show that this semigroup of Monge matrices is isomorphic to the semigroup of biwords equipped with the extended Demazure product. We exploit this isomorphism to write down generating functions for the growth series of the Monge matrices with respect to certain natural matrix norms.</description>

      <title>Solution Numbers for Eight Blocks to Madness Puzzle</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.13208</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.13208v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The 30 MacMahon colored cubes have each face painted with one of six colors and every color appears on at least one face. One puzzle involving these cubes is to create a $2\times2\times2$ model with eight distinct MacMahon cubes to recreate a larger version with the external coloring of a specified target cube, also a MacMahon cube, and touching interior faces are the same color. J.H. Conway is credited with arranging the cubes in a $6\times6$ tableau that gives a solution to this puzzle. In fact, the particular set of eight cubes that solves this puzzle can be arranged in exactly \textit{two} distinct ways to solve the puzzle. We study a less restrictive puzzle without requiring interior face matching. We describe solutions to the $2\times2\times2$ puzzle and the number of distinct solutions attainable for a collection of eight cubes. Additionally, given a collection of eight MacMahon cubes, we study the number of target cubes that can be built in a $2\times2\times2$ model. We calculate the distribution of the number of cubes that can be built over all collections of eight cubes (the maximum number is five) and provide a complete characterization of the collections that can build five distinct cubes. Furthermore, we identify nine new sets of twelve cubes, called Minimum Universal sets, from which all 30 cubes can be built.</description>

      <title>An extended generalization of RSK correspondence via $A$ type quiver representations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.13581</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.13581v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $\lambda=(\lambda_1 \geqslant \ldots \geqslant \lambda_k &gt; 0)$. For any $c$ Coxeter element of $\mathfrak{S}_{\lambda_1+k-1}$, we construct a bijection from fillings of $\lambda$ to reverse plane partitions. We recover two previous generalizations of the Robinson--Schensted--Knuth correspondence for particular choices of Coxeter element depending on $\lambda$: one based on the work of, among others, Burge, Hillman, Grassl, Knuth, and uniformly presented by Gansner; the other developed by Garver, Partrias, and Thomas, and independently by Dauvergne, called Scrambled RSK. Our results in this paper develop the combinatorial consequence of our previous work of type $A_{\lambda_1+k}$ quivers.</description>

      <title>Rigidity of symmetric frameworks with non-free group actions on the vertices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.13612</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.13612v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: For plane frameworks with reflection or rotational symmetries, where the group action is not necessarily free on the vertex set, we introduce a phase-symmetric orbit rigidity matrix for each irreducible representation of the group. We then use these generalised orbit rigidity matrices to provide necessary conditions for infinitesimal rigidity for frameworks that are symmetric with a cyclic group that acts freely or non-freely on the vertices. Moreover, for the reflection, the half-turn, and the three-fold rotational group in the plane, we establish complete combinatorial characterisations of symmetry-generic infinitesimally rigid frameworks. This extends well-known characterisations for these groups to the case when the group action is not necessarily free on the vertices. The presence of vertices that are fixed by non-trivial group elements requires the introduction of generalised versions of group-labelled quotient graphs leads to more refined types of combinatorial sparsity counts for characterising symmetry-generic infinitesimal rigidity.</description>

      <title>Sum of Consecutive Terms of Pell and Related Sequences</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.12868</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.12868v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study new identities related to the sums of adjacent terms in the Pell sequence, defined by $P_{n} := 2P_{n-1}+P_{n-2}$ for $ n\geq 2$ and $P_{0}=0, P_{1}=1$, and generalize these identities for many similar sequences. We prove that the sum of $N&gt;1$ consecutive Pell numbers is a fixed integer multiple of another Pell number if and only if $4\mid N$. We consider the generalized Pell $(k,i)$-numbers defined by $p(n) :=\ 2p(n-1)+p(n-k-1) $ for $n\geq k+1$, with $p(0)=p(1)=\cdots =p(i)=0$ and $p(i+1)=\cdots = p(k)=1$ for $0\leq i\leq k-1$, and prove that the sum of $N=2k+2$ consecutive terms is a fixed integer multiple of another term in the sequence. We also prove that for the generalized Pell $(k,k-1)$-numbers such a relation does not exist when $N$ and $k$ are odd. We give analogous results for the Fibonacci and other related second-order recursive sequences.</description>

      <title>The Two-loop MHV Momentum Amplituhedron from Fibrations of Fibrations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.12906</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.12906v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recently, a new approach to computing the canonical forms of the momentum amplituhedron in dual-momentum space was proposed by the authors. These are relevant for the integrands of scattering amplitudes in planar N=4 super-Yang-Mills. At one-loop the idea was to view the set of all loop momenta, which we refer to as the one-loop fiber geometry, as a fibration over the tree-level kinematic data. This led to the notion of tree-level chambers, subsets of the tree-level kinematic space for which the combinatorial structure of the one-loop fiber remains unchanged, that allowed for a novel representation of the one-loop integrand. The goal of this paper is to extend these ideas to two loops for MHV integrands. Our approach will be to view the geometry accessed by the second loop momentum, similarly referred to as the two-loop fiber geometry, as a fibration over both the one-loop kinematic data and the position of the first loop momentum in the one-loop fiber. This will lead to the notion of one-loop chambers, subsets of the one-loop fibers for which the combinatorial structure of the two-loop fiber remains unchanged. We will characterise the full set of one-loop chambers and their corresponding two-loop fibers and present formulae for their canonical forms. Ultimately, this will result in a new formula for the two-loop MHV integrand written as a fibration of fibration.</description>

      <title>A threshold for relative hyperbolicity in random right-angled Coxeter groups</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.12959v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider the random right-angled Coxeter group whose presentation graph is an Erdos-Renyi random graph on n vertices with edge probability p=p(n). We establish that p=1/\sqrt{n} is a threshold for relative hyperbolicity of the random right-angled Coxeter group . As a key step in the proof, we determine the minimal number of pairs of generators that must commute in a right-angled Coxeter group which is not relatively hyperbolic, a result which is of independent interest.</description>

Abstract: The Demazure operator associated to a simple reflection satisfies the twisted Leibniz rule. In this paper we introduce a generalization of the twisted Leibniz rule for the Demazure operator associated to any atomic double coset. We prove that this atomic Leibniz rule is equivalent to a polynomial forcing property for singular Soergel bimodules.</description>

      <title>Entropy factorization via curvature</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.13457</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.13457v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We develop a new framework for establishing approximate factorization of entropy on arbitrary probability spaces, using a geometric notion known as non-negative sectional curvature. The resulting estimates are equivalent to entropy subadditivity and generalized Brascamp-Lieb inequalities, and provide a sharp modified log-Sobolev inequality for the Gibbs sampler of several particle systems in both continuous and discrete settings. The method allows us to obtain simple proofs of known results, as well as some new inequalities. We illustrate this through various applications, including discrete Gaussian free fields on arbitrary networks, the down-up walk on uniform $n$-sets, the uniform measure over permutations, and the uniform measure on the unit sphere in $\R^n$. Our method also yields a simple, coupling-based proof of the celebrated logarithmic Sobolev inequality for Langevin diffusions in a convex potential, which is one of the most emblematic applications of the Bakry-\'Emery criterion.</description>

Abstract: In the first part of the paper, we prove a mirror symmetry isomorphism between integral tropical homology groups of a pair of mirror tropical Calabi-Yau hypersurfaces. We then apply this isomorphism to prove that a primitive patchworking of a central triangulation of a reflexive polytope gives a connected real Calabi-Yau hypersurface if and only if the corresponding divisor class on the mirror is not zero.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2206.01469v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In the present paper we investigate the faithfulness of certain linear representations of groups of automorphisms of a graph $X$ in the group of symmetries of the Jacobian of $X$. As a consequence we show that if a $3$-edge-connected graph $X$ admits a nonabelian semiregular group of automorphims, then the Jacobian of $X$ cannot be cyclic. In particular, Cayley graphs of degree at least three arising from nonabelian groups have non-cyclic Jacobians. While the size of the Jacobian of $X$ is well-understood - it is equal to the number of spanning trees of $X$ - the combinatorial interpretation of the rank of Jacobian of a graph is unknown. Our paper presents a contribution in this direction.</description>

      <title>ABC(T)-graphs: an axiomatic characterization of the median procedure in graphs with connected and G$^2$-connected medians</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2206.03587</link>
      <description>arXiv:2206.03587v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The median function is a location/consensus function that maps any profile $\pi$ (a finite multiset of vertices) to the set of vertices that minimize the distance sum to vertices from $\pi$. The median function satisfies several simple axioms: Anonymity (A), Betweeness (B), and Consistency (C). McMorris, Mulder, Novick and Powers (2015) defined the ABC-problem for consensus functions on graphs as the problem of characterizing the graphs (called, ABC-graphs) for which the unique consensus function satisfying the axioms (A), (B), and (C) is the median function.
  In this paper, we show that modular graphs with $G^2$-connected medians (in particular, bipartite Helly graphs) are ABC-graphs. On the other hand, the addition of some simple local axioms satisfied by the median function in all graphs (axioms (T), and (T$_2$)) enables us to show that all graphs with connected median (comprising Helly graphs, median graphs, basis graphs of matroids and even $\Delta$-matroids) are ABCT-graphs and that benzenoid graphs are ABCT$_2$-graphs. McMorris et al (2015) proved that the graphs satisfying the pairing property (called the intersecting-interval property in their paper) are ABC-graphs. We prove that graphs with the pairing property constitute a proper subclass of bipartite Helly graphs and we discuss the complexity status of the recognition problem of such graphs.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2301.13116v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper investigates big Ramsey degrees of unrestricted relational structures in (possibly) infinite languages. Despite significant progress in the study of big Ramsey degrees, the big Ramsey degrees of many classes of structures with finite small Ramsey degrees are still not well understood. We show that if there are only finitely many relations of every arity greater than one, then unrestricted relational structures have finite big Ramsey degrees, and give some evidence that this is tight. This is the first time finiteness of big Ramsey degrees has been established for a random structure in an infinite language. Our results represent an important step towards a better understanding of big Ramsey degrees for structures with relations of arity greater than two.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2307.10910v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider two different notions of graph colouring, namely, the $t$-periodic colouring for vertices that has been introduced in 1974 by Bondy and Simonovits, and the periodic colouring for oriented edges that has been recently introduced in the context of spectral theory of non-backtracking operators. For each of these two colourings, we introduce the corresponding colouring number which is given by maximising the possible number of colours. We first investigate these two new colouring numbers individually, and we then show that there is a deep relationship between them.</description>

      <title>$K_2$-Hamiltonian Graphs: II</title>

      <description>arXiv:2311.05262v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper we use theoretical and computational tools to continue our investigation of $K_2$-hamiltonian graphs, that is, graphs in which the removal of any pair of adjacent vertices yields a hamiltonian graph, and their interplay with $K_1$-hamiltonian graphs, that is, graphs in which every vertex-deleted subgraph is hamiltonian. Perhaps surprisingly, there exist graphs that are both $K_1$- and $K_2$-hamiltonian, yet non-hamiltonian, for example, the Petersen graph. Gr\"unbaum conjectured that every planar $K_1$-hamiltonian graph must itself be hamiltonian; Thomassen disproved this conjecture. Here we show that even planar graphs that are both $K_1$- and $K_2$-hamiltonian need not be hamiltonian, and that the number of such graphs grows at least exponentially. Motivated by results of Aldred, McKay, and Wormald, we determine for every integer $n$ that is not 14 or 17 whether there exists a $K_2$-hypohamiltonian, that is, non-hamiltonian and $K_2$-hamiltonian, graph of order $n$, and characterise all orders for which such cubic graphs and such snarks exist. We also describe the smallest cubic planar graph which is $K_2$-hypohamiltonian, as well as the smallest planar $K_2$-hypohamiltonian graph of girth $5$. We conclude with open problems and by correcting two inaccuracies from the first article.</description>

      <title>Generalized Quasikernels in Digraphs</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.07305v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Given a digraph $D$, we say that a set of vertices $Q\subseteq V(D)$ is a $q$-kernel if $Q$ is an independent set and if every vertex of $D$ can be reached from $Q$ by a path of length at most $q$. In this paper, we initiate the study of several extremal problems for $q$-kernels. For example, we introduce and make progress on (what turns out to be) a weak version of the Small Quasikernel Conjecture, namely that every digraph contains a $q$-kernel with $|N^+[Q]|\ge \frac{1}{2}|V(D)|$ for all $q\ge 2$.</description>

      <title>$IP$ rich ultrafilters and new partition regular equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.05542</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.05542v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In $1979$, using the theory of ultrafilters, N. Hindman proved that for every finite coloring of $\mathbb{N}$, there exists a color that contains both additive and multiplicative $IP$ sets. Later, in $1993$, V. Bergelson and N. Hindman found an elementary proof. In this article, we prove that the partial product of these two $IP$ sets also lies in the same color. As an immediate consequence, we have the equation $a+b=c\cdot d$ partition regular. This was a conjecture of P. Csikv\'{a}ri, K. Gyarmati, and A. S\'{a}rk\"{o}zy, which was solved by V. Bergelson and N. Hindman independently. In this article, we separately give a very short proof of this conjecture. Then we extend these results to the flavor of Rado systems.</description>

      <title>Tredoku Patterns</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.10752v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Donald A. Preece gave two talks in 2013, in which he introduced the notion of tredoku patterns. These are certain configurations of diamond-shaped tiles, inspired by the sukodu-like puzzle that appears in newspapers. Very sadly, Prof. Preece died in January 2014, before he was able to complete his work on this problem. This paper reconstructs his work, and settles (in the affirmative) the conjectures he proposed.</description>

      <title>Quantitative upper bounds on the Gromov-Hausdorff distance between spheres</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.11237</link>
      <description>arXiv:2309.11237v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The Gromov-Hausdorff distance between two metric spaces measures how far the spaces are from being isometric. It has played an important and longstanding role in geometry and shape comparison. More recently, it has been discovered that the Gromov-Hausdorff distance between unit spheres equipped with the geodesic metric has important connections to Borsuk-Ulam theorems and Vietoris-Rips complexes.
  We develop a discrete framework for obtaining upper bounds on the Gromov-Hausdorff distance between spheres, and provide the first quantitative bounds that apply to spheres of all possible pairs of dimensions. As a special case, we determine the exact Gromov-Hausdorff distance between the circle and any higher-dimensional sphere, and determine the asymptotic behavior of the distance from the 2-sphere to the $k$-sphere up to constants.</description>

      <title>Randomisation in the Josephus Problem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.18110</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.18110v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The Josephus problem is a well--studied elimination problem consisting in determining the position of the survivor after repeated applications of a deterministic rule removing one person at a time from a given group.
  A natural probabilistic variant of this process is introduced in this paper. More precisely, in this variant, the survivor is determined after performing a succession of Bernouilli trials with parameter $p$ designating each time the person to remove. When the number of participants tends to infinity, the main result characterises the limit distribution of the position of the survivor with an increasing degree of precision as the parameter approaches the unbiaised case $p=1/2$. Then, the convergence rate to the position of the survivor is obtained in the form of a Central-Limit Theorem.
  A number of other variants of the suggested probabilistic elimination process are also considered. They each admit a specific limit behavior which, in most cases, is stated in the form of an open problem.</description>

      <title>Probabilistic estimates of the diameters of the Rubik's Cube groups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.07337</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.07337v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The diameter of the Cayley graph of the Rubik's Cube group is the fewest number of turns needed to solve the Cube from any initial configurations. For the 2$\times$2$\times$2 Cube, the diameter is 11 in the half-turn metric, 14 in the quarter-turn metric, 19 in the semi-quarter-turn metric, and 10 in the bi-quarter-turn metric. For the 3$\times$3$\times$3 Cube, the diameter was determined by Rokicki et al. to be 20 in the half-turn metric and 26 in the quarter-turn metric. This study shows that a modified version of the coupon collector's problem in probabilistic theory can predict the diameters correctly for both 2$\times$2$\times$2 and 3$\times$3$\times$3 Cubes insofar as the quarter-turn metric is adopted. In the half-turn metric, the diameters are overestimated by one and two, respectively, for the 2$\times$2$\times$2 and 3$\times$3$\times$3 Cubes, whereas for the 2$\times$2$\times$2 Cube in the semi-quarter-turn and bi-quarter-turn metrics, they are overestimated by two and underestimated by one, respectively. Invoking the same probabilistic logic, the diameters of the 4$\times$4$\times$4 and 5$\times$5$\times$5 Cubes are predicted to be 48 (41) and 68 (58) in the quarter-turn (half-turn) metric, whose precise determinations are far beyond reach of classical supercomputing. It is shown that the probabilistically estimated diameter is approximated by $\ln N / \ln r + \ln N / r$, where $N$ is the number of configurations and $r$ is the branching ratio.</description>

      <title>Classification of Cellular Fake Surfaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.09439</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.09439v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Generic polyhedra are interesting mathematical objects to study in their own right. In this paper, we initialize a systematic study of two-dimensional generic polyhedra with an eye towards applications to low-dimensional topology, especially the Andrews-Curtis and Zeeman conjectures. After recalling the basic notions of generic polyhedra and fake surfaces, we derive some interesting properties of fake surfaces. Our main result is a complete classification of acyclic cellular fake surfaces up to complexity 4 and a classification of acyclic cellular fake surfaces without small disks of complexity 5. From this classification, we prove the contractibility conjecture for acyclic cellular fake surfaces of complexity 4, and the embedded disk conjecture up to complexity 5. We provide evidence for the conjectures that the probability of being a spine among fake surfaces is 0 and that every contractible fake surface has an embedded disk.</description>
