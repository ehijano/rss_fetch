      <title>On weak convergence of stochastic wave equation with colored noise on $\mathbb{R}$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.10326</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.10326v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we study the following stochastic wave equation on the real line $\partial_t^2 u_{\alpha}=\partial_x^2 u_{\alpha}+b\left(u_\alpha\right)+\sigma\left(u_\alpha\right)\eta_{\alpha}$. The noise $\eta_\alpha$ is white in time and colored in space with covariance structure $\mathbb{E}[\eta_\alpha(t,x)\eta_\alpha(s,y)]=\delta(t-s)f_\alpha(x-y)$ where $f_\alpha(x)\propto |x|^{-\alpha}$ is the Riesz kernel. We state the continuity of the solution $u_\alpha$ in terms of $\alpha$ for $\alpha\in (0,1)$ with respect to the convergence in law in the topology of continuous functions with uniform metric on compact sets. We also prove that the probability measure induced by $u_\alpha$ converges weakly to the one induced by the solution in the space-time white noise case as $\alpha$ goes to $1$.</description>

      <title>Random dynamics of solutions for three-dimensional stochastic globally modified Navier-Stokes equations on unbounded Poincar\'e domains</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.10426</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.10426v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this article, we propose a novel version of three-dimensional (3D) globally modified Navier-Stokes (GMNS) system introduced by [Caraballo et. al., Adv. Nonlinear Stud. (2006), 6:411-436], which is very significant from the perspective of deterministic as well as stochastic partial differential equations. Our focus is on examining a stochastic version of the suggested 3D GMNS equations that are perturbed by an infinite-dimensional additive noise. We can consider a rough additive noise (Lebesgue space valued) with this model, which is not appropriate to consider with the system presented in [Caraballo et. al., Adv. Nonlinear Stud. (2006), 6:411-436]. One of the technical problems associated with the rough noise is overcome by the use of the corresponding Cameron-Martin (or reproducing kernel Hilbert) space. This article aims to accomplish three objectives. Firstly, we establish the existence and uniqueness of weak solutions (in the analytic sense) of the underlying stochastic system using a Doss-Sussman transformation and a primary ingredient Minty-Browder technique. Secondly, we demonstrate the existence of random attractors for the underlying stochastic system in the natural space of square integrable divergence-free functions. Finally, we show the existence of an invariant measure for the underlying stochastic system for any viscosity coefficient $ \nu &gt; 0 $ and uniqueness of invariant measure for sufficiently large $\nu$ by using the exponential stability of solutions. A validation of the proposed version of 3D GMNS equations has also been discussed in the appendix by establishing that the sequence of weak solutions of 3D GMNS equations converges to a weak solution of 3D Navier-Stokes equations as the modification parameter goes to infinity.</description>

      <title>Convergence rate in the law of logarithm for negatively dependent random variables under sub-linear expectations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.10662</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.10662v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $\{X,X_n,n\ge 1\}$ be a sequence of identically distributed, negatively dependent (NA) random variables under sub-linear expectations, and denote $S_n=\sum_{i=1}^{n}X_i$, $n\ge 1$. Assume that $h(\cdot)$ is a positive non-decreasing function on $(0,\infty)$ fulfulling $\int_{1}^{\infty}(th(t))^{-1}\dif t=\infty$. Write $Lt=\ln \max\{\me,t\}$, $\psi(t)=\int_{1}^{t}(sh(s))^{-1}\dif s$, $t\ge 1$. In this sequel, we establish that $\sum_{n=1}^{\infty}(nh(n))^{-1}\vv\left\{|S_n|\ge (1+\varepsilon)\sigma\sqrt{2nL\psi(n)}\right\}&lt;\infty$, $\forall \varepsilon&gt;0$ if $\ee(X)=\ee(-X)=0$ and $\ee(X^2)=\sigma^2\in (0,\infty)$. The result generalizes that of NA random variables in probability space.</description>

      <title>A complete characterization of monotonicity equivalence for continuous-time Markov processes</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.10840v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Pra et al studied two notions of monotonicity for continuous-time Markov processes on a finite partially ordered set (poset), and conjectured that monotonicity equivalence holds for a poset of W-glued diamond when the poset has no acyclic extension. We prove their conjecture and provide a complete characterization of posets for monotonicity equivalence.</description>

      <title>Monotonicity equivalence and synchronizability for a system of probability distributions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.10896</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.10896v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A system $(P_\alpha: \alpha\in\mathcal{A})$ of probability distributions on a partially ordered set (poset) $\mathcal{S}$ indexed by another poset $\mathcal{A}$ can be realized by a system of $\mathcal{S}$-valued random variables $X_\alpha$'s marginally distributed as $P_\alpha$. It is called realizably monotone if $X_\alpha\le X_\beta$ in $\mathcal{S}$ whenever $\alpha\le\beta$ in $\mathcal{A}$. Such a system necessarily is stochastically monotone, that is, it satisfies $P_\alpha\preceq P_\beta$ in stochastic ordering whenever $\alpha \le \beta$. It has been known exactly when these notions of monotonicity are equivalent except for a certain subclass of acyclic posets, called Class W. In this paper we introduce inverse probability transforms and synchronizing bijections recursively when $\mathcal{S}$ is a poset of Class W and $\mathcal{A}$ is synchronizable, and validate monotonicity equivalence by constructing $(X_\alpha: \alpha\in\mathcal{A})$ explicitly. We also show that synchronizability is necessary for monotonicity equivalence when $\mathcal{S}$ is in Class W.</description>

      <title>Critical percolation on slabs with random columnar disorder</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.10927</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.10927v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We explore a bond percolation model on slabs $\mathbb{S}^+_k=\mathbb{Z}_+\times \mathbb{Z}_+\times\{0,\dots,k\}$ featuring one-dimensional inhomogeneities. In this context, a vertical column on the slab comprises the set of vertical edges projecting to the same vertex on $\mathbb{Z}_+\times\{0,\dots,k\}$. Columns are chosen based on the arrivals of a renewal process, where the tail distributions of inter-arrival times follow a power law with exponent $\alpha&gt;1$. Inhomogeneities are introduced as follows: vertical edges on selected columns are open (closed) with probability $q$ (respectively $1-q$), independently. Conversely, vertical edges within unselected columns and all horizontal edges are open (closed) with probability $p$ (respectively $1-p$). We prove that for all sufficiently large $\alpha$ (depending solely on $k$), the following assertion holds: if $q&gt;p_c(\mathbb{S}^+_k)$, then $p$ can be taken strictly smaller than $p_c(\mathbb{S}^+_k)$ in a manner that percolation still occurs.</description>

      <title>Stochastic Currents of Fractional Brownian Motion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.10936</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.10936v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: By using white noise analysis, we study the integral kernel $\xi(x)$, $x\in\mathbb{R}^{d}$, of stochastic currents corresponding to fractional Brownian motion with Hurst parameter $H\in(0,1)$. For $x\in\mathbb{R}^{d}\backslash\{0\}$ and $d\ge1$ we show that the kernel $\xi(x)$ is well-defined as a Hida distribution for all $H\in(0,1/2]$. For $x=0$ and $d=1$, $\xi(0)$ is a Hida distribution for all $H\in(0,1)$. For $d\ge2$, then $\xi(0)$ is a Hida distribution only for $H\in(0,1/d)$. To cover the case $H\in[1/d,1)$ we have to truncate the delta function so that $\xi^{(N)}(0)$ is a Hida distribution whenever $2N(H-1)+Hd&gt;1$.</description>

      <title>The Reverse Littlewood--Offord problem of Erd\H{o}s</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.11034</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.11034v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $\epsilon_{1},\ldots,\epsilon_{n}$ be a sequence of independent Rademacher random variables. We prove that there is a constant $c&gt;0$ such that for any unit vectors $v_1,\ldots,v_n\in \mathbb{R}^2$,
  $$\Pr\left[||\epsilon_1 v_1+\ldots+\epsilon_n v_n||_2 \leq \sqrt{2}\right]\geq \frac{c}{n}.$$
  This resolves the only remaining conjecture from the seminal paper of Erd\H{o}s on the Littlewood--Offord problem, and it is sharp both in the sense that the constant $\sqrt{2}$ cannot be reduced and that the magnitude $n^{-1}$ is best possible. We also prove polynomial bounds for the analogous problem in higher dimensions.</description>

      <title>$S$-transform in Finite Free Probability</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.09337</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.09337v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a simplified explanation of why free fractional convolution corresponds to the differentiation of polynomials, by finding how the finite free cumulants of a polynomial behave under differentiation. This approach allows us to understand the limiting behaviour of the coefficients $\widetilde{\mathsf{e}}_k(p_d)$ of $p_d$ when the degree $d$ tends to infinity and the empirical root distribution of $p_d$ has a limiting distribution $\mu$ on $[0,\infty)$. Specifically, we relate the asymptotic behaviour of the ratio of consecutive coefficients to Voiculescu's $S$-transform of $\mu$. This prompts us to define a new notion of finite $S$-transform, which converges to Voiculescu's $S$-transform in the large $d$ limit. It also satisfies several analogous properties to those of the $S$-transform in free probability, including multiplicativity and monotonicity. This new insight has several applications that strengthen the connection between free and finite free probability. Most notably, we generalize the approximation of $\boxtimes_d$ to $\boxtimes$ and prove a finite approximation of the Tucci--Haagerup--M\"oller limit theorem in free probability, conjectured by two of the authors. We also provide finite analogues of the free multiplicative Poisson law, the free max-convolution powers and some free stable laws.</description>

      <title>Constructive and consistent estimation of quadratic minimax</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.10218</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.10218v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider $k$ square integrable random variables $Y_1,...,Y_k$ and $k$ random (row) vectors of length $p$, $X_1,...,X_k$ such that $X_i(l)$ is square integrable for $1\le i\le k$ and $1\le l\le p$. No assumptions whatsoever are made of any relationship between the $X_i$:s and $Y_i$:s. We shall refer to each pairing of $X_i$ and $Y_i$ as an environment. We form the square risk functions $R_i(\beta)=\mathbb{E}\left[(Y_i-\beta X_i)^2\right]$ for every environment and consider $m$ affine combinations of these $k$ risk functions. Next, we define a parameter space $\Theta$ where we associate each point with a subset of the unique elements of the covariance matrix of $(X_i,Y_i)$ for an environment. Then we study estimation of the $\arg\min$-solution set of the maximum of a the $m$ affine combinations the of quadratic risk functions. We provide a constructive method for estimating the entire $\arg\min$-solution set which is consistent almost surely outside a zero set in $\Theta^k$. This method is computationally expensive, since it involves solving polynomials of general degree. To overcome this, we define another approximate estimator that also provides a consistent estimation of the solution set based on the bisection method, which is computationally much more efficient. We apply the method to worst risk minimization in the setting of structural equation models.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2408.10254v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Motivated by questions in quantum theory, we study Hilbert space valued Gaussian processes, and operator-valued kernels, i.e., kernels taking values in B(H) (= all bounded linear operators in a fixed Hilbert space H). We begin with a systematic study of p.d. B(H)-valued kernels and the associated of H-valued Gaussian processes, together with their correlation and transfer operators. In our consideration of B(H)-valued kernels, we drop the p.d. assumption. We show that input-output models can be computed for systems of signed kernels taking the precise form of realizability via associated transfer block matrices (of operators analogous to the realization transforms in systems theory), i.e., represented via 2\times2 operator valued block matrices. In the context of B(H)-valued kernels we present new results on regression with H-valued Gaussian processes.</description>

      <title>First return times on sparse random graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.10530</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.10530v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider random walks in the form of nearest-neighbor hopping on Erdos-Renyi random graphs of finite fixed mean degree c as the number of vertices N tends to infinity. In this regime, using statistical field theory methods, we develop an analytic theory of the first return time probability distribution. The problem turns out closely related to finding the spectrum of the normalized graph Laplacian that controls the continuum time version of the nearest-neighbor-hopping random walk. In the infinite graph limit, where loops are highly improbable, the returns operate in a manner qualitatively similar to c-regular trees, and the expressions for probabilities resemble those on random c-regular graphs. Because the vertex degrees are not exactly constant, however, the way c enters the formulas differs from the dependence on the graph degree of first return probabilities on random regular graphs.</description>

      <title>On the Approximability of Stationary Processes using the ARMA Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.10610</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.10610v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We identify certain gaps in the literature on the approximability of stationary random variables using the Autoregressive Moving Average (ARMA) model. To quantify approximability, we propose that an ARMA model be viewed as an approximation of a stationary random variable. We map these stationary random variables to Hardy space functions, and formulate a new function approximation problem that corresponds to random variable approximation, and thus to ARMA. Based on this Hardy space formulation we identify a class of stationary processes where approximation guarantees are feasible. We also identify an idealized stationary random process for which we conjecture that a good ARMA approximation is not possible. Next, we provide a constructive proof that Pad\'e approximations do not always correspond to the best ARMA approximation. Finally, we note that the spectral methods adopted in this paper can be seen as a generalization of unit root methods for stationary processes even when an ARMA model is not defined.</description>

Abstract: We consider the jump-diffusion risky asset model and study its conditional prediction laws. Next, we explain the conditional least square hedging strategy and calculate its closed form for the jump-diffusion model, considering the Black-Scholes framework with interpretations related to investor priorities and transaction costs. We investigate the explicit form of this result for the particular case of the European call option under transaction costs and formulate recursive hedging strategies. Finally, we present a decision tree, table of values, and figures to support our results.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2211.17175v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A Laplacian matrix is a real symmetric matrix whose row and column sums are zero. We investigate the limiting distribution of the largest eigenvalues of a Laplacian random matrix with Gaussian entries. Unlike many classical matrix ensembles, this random matrix model contains dependent entries. Our main results show that the extreme eigenvalues of this model exhibit Poisson statistics. In particular, after properly shifting and scaling, we show that the largest eigenvalue converges to the Gumbel distribution as the dimension of the matrix tends to infinity. While the largest diagonal entry is also shown to have Gumbel fluctuations, there is a rather surprising difference between its deterministic centering term and the centering term required for the largest eigenvalues.</description>

Abstract: The parabolic Airy line ensemble $\mathfrak A$ is a central limit object in the KPZ universality class and related areas. On any compact set $K = \{1, \dots, k\} \times [a, a + t]$, the law of the recentered ensemble $\mathfrak A - \mathfrak A(a)$ has a density $X_K$ with respect to the law of $k$ independent Brownian motions. We show that
  $$
  X_K(f) = \exp \left(-\textsf{S}(f) + o(\textsf{S}(f))\right)
  $$
  where $\textsf{S}$ is an explicit, tractable, non-negative function of $f$. We use this formula to show that $X_K$ is bounded above by a $K$-dependent constant, give a sharp estimate on the size of the set where $X_K &lt; \epsilon$ as $\epsilon \to 0$, and prove a large deviation principle for $\mathfrak A$. We also give density estimates that take into account the relative positions of the Airy lines, and prove sharp two-point tail bounds that are stronger than those for Brownian motion. These estimates are a key input in the classification of geodesic networks in the directed landscape. The paper is essentially self-contained, requiring only tail bounds on the Airy point process and the Brownian Gibbs property as inputs.</description>

      <title>A hierarchy of KPZ equation scaling limits arising from directed random walk models in random media</title>

      <description>arXiv:2401.06073v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider a generalized model of random walk in dynamical random environment, and we show that the multiplicative-noise stochastic heat equation (SHE) describes the fluctuations of the quenched density at a certain precise location in the tail. The distribution of transition kernels is fixed rather than changing under the diffusive rescaling of space-time, i.e., there is no critical tuning of the model parameters when scaling to the stochastic PDE limit. The proof is done by pushing the methods developed in [arxiv 2304.14279, arXiv 2311.09151] to their maximum, substantially weakening the assumptions and obtaining fairly sharp conditions under which one expects to see the SHE arise in a wide variety of random walk models in random media. In particular we are able to get rid of conditions such as nearest-neighbor interaction as well as spatial independence of quenched transition kernels. Moreover, we observe an entire hierarchy of moderate deviation exponents at which the SHE can be found, confirming a physics prediction of J. Hass.</description>

      <title>On time-dependent boundary crossing probabilities of diffusion processes as differentiable functionals of the boundary</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.16787</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.16787v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The paper analyses the sensitivity of the finite time horizon boundary non-crossing probability $F(g)$ of a general time-inhomogeneous diffusion process to perturbations of the boundary $g$. We prove that, for boundaries $g\in C^2,$ this probability is G\^ateaux differentiable in directions $h \in H \cup C^2$ and Fr\'echet-differentiable in directions $h \in H,$ where $H$ is the Cameron--Martin space, and derive a compact representation for the derivative of $F$. Our results allow one to approximate $F(g)$ using boundaries $\bar{g}$ that are close to $g$ and for which the computation of $F(\bar{g})$ is feasible. We also obtain auxiliary results of independent interest in both probability theory and PDE theory. These include: (i) an elegant probabilistic representation for the limit of the derivative with respect to $x$ of the boundary crossing probability when the process starts at point $(t,x)$ in the time-space domain and $x\uparrow g(t),$ and (ii) a Shiryaev--Yor type martingale representation for the indicator of the boundary non-crossing event for time-dependent boundaries.</description>

      <title>The directed landscape from Brownian motion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.00194</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.00194v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We define an almost sure bijection which constructs the directed landscape from a sequence of infinitely many independent Brownian motions. This is the analogue of the RSK correspondence in this setting. The Brownian motions arise as a marginal of the extended Busemann process for the directed landscape, and the inverse map gives an explicit and natural coupling where Brownian last passage percolation converges in probability to the directed landscape. We use this map to prove that the directed landscape on a strip can be reconstructed from the Airy line ensemble. Along the way, we describe two more new versions of RSK in the semi-discrete setting, build a general theory of sorting via Pitman operators, and construct extended Busemann processes for the directed landscape and Brownian last passage percolation.</description>

      <title>Exchangeable arrays and integrable systems for characteristic polynomials of random matrices</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.19233v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The joint moments of the derivatives of the characteristic polynomial of a random unitary matrix, and also a variant of the characteristic polynomial that is real on the unit circle, in the large matrix size limit, have been studied intensively in the past twenty five years, partly in relation to conjectural connections to the Riemann zeta-function and Hardy's function. We completely settle the most general version of the problem of convergence of these joint moments, after they are suitably rescaled, for an arbitrary number of derivatives and with arbitrary positive real exponents. Our approach relies on a hidden, higher-order exchangeable structure, that of an exchangeable array. Using these probabilistic techniques, we then give a combinatorial formula for the leading order coefficient in the asymptotics of the joint moments, when the power on the characteristic polynomial itself is a positive real number and the exponents of the derivatives are integers, in terms of a finite number of finite-dimensional integrals which are explicitly computable. Finally, we develop a method, based on a class of Hankel determinants shifted by partitions, that allows us to give an exact representation of all these joint moments, for finite matrix size, in terms of derivatives of Painlev\'e V transcendents, and then for the leading order coefficient in the large-matrix limit in terms of derivatives of solutions of the $\sigma$-Painlev\'e III' equation. Equivalently, we can represent all the joint moments of power sum linear statistics of a certain determinantal point process behind this problem in terms of derivatives of $\sigma$-Painlev\'e III' transcendents. This gives an efficient way to compute all these quantities explicitly. Our methods can be used to obtain analogous results for a number of other models sharing the same features.</description>

      <title>Projectivity revisited</title>

      <description>arXiv:2207.00625v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The behaviour of statistical relational representations across differently sized domains has become a focal area of research from both a modelling and a complexity viewpoint.Recently, projectivity of a family of distributions emerged as a key property, ensuring that marginal probabilities are independent of the domain size. However, the formalisation used currently assumes that the domain is characterised only by its size. This contribution extends the notion of projectivity from families of distributions indexed by domain size to functors taking extensional data from a database. This makes projectivity available for the large range of applications taking structured input. We transfer key known results on projective families of distributions to the new setting. This includes a characterisation of projective fragments in different statistical relational formalisms as well as a general representation theorem for projective families of distributions. Furthermore, we prove a correspondence between projectivity and distributions on countably infinite domains, which we use to unify and generalise earlier work on statistical relational representations in infinite domains. Finally, we use the extended notion of projectivity to define a further strengthening, which we call $\sigma$-projectivity, and which allows the use of the same representation in different modes while retaining projectivity.</description>

      <title>Survival of the flattest in the quasispecies model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.09221</link>
      <description>arXiv:2306.09221v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Viruses present an amazing genetic variability. An ensemble of infecting viruses, also called a viral quasispecies, is a cloud of mutants centered around a specific genotype. The simplest model of evolution, whose equilibrium state is described by the quasispecies equation, is the Moran--Kingman model. For the sharp peak landscape, we perform several exact computations and we derive several exact formulas. We obtain also an exact formula for the quasispecies distribution, involving a series and the mean fitness. A very simple formula for the mean Hamming distance is derived, which is exact and which do not require a specific asymptotic expansion (like sending the length of the macromolecules to $\infty$ or the mutation probability to $0$). We try also to extend these formulas to a general fitness landscape. We obtain an equation involving the covariance of the fitness and the Hamming class number in the quasispecies distribution. With the help of these formulas, we discuss the phenomenon of the error threshold and the notion of quasispecies. We recover the limiting quasipecies distribution in the long chain regime. We go beyond the sharp peak landscape and we consider fitness landscapes having finitely many peaks and a plateau--type landscape. We finally prove rigorously within this framework the possible occurrence of the survival of the flattest, a phenomenon which has been previously discovered by Wilke, Wang, Ofria, Lenski and Adami and which has been investigated in several works.</description>

      <title>Impact of a block structure on the Lotka-Volterra model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.09470</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.09470v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The Lotka-Volterra (LV) model is a simple, robust, and versatile model used to describe large interacting systems such as food webs or microbiomes. The model consists of $n$ coupled differential equations linking the abundances of $n$ different species. We consider a large random interaction matrix with independent entries and a block variance profile. The $i$th diagonal block represents the intra-community interaction in community $i$, while the off-diagonal blocks represent the inter-community interactions. The variance remains constant within each block, but may vary across blocks.
  We investigate the important case of two communities of interacting species, study how interactions affect their respective equilibrium. We also describe equilibrium with feasibility (i.e., whether there exists an equilibrium with all species at non-zero abundances) and the existence of an attrition phenomenon (some species may vanish) within each community.
  Information about the general case of $b$ communities ($b&gt; 2$) is provided in the appendix.</description>

      <title>On the strong Feller property of the heat equation on quantum graphs with Kirchoff noise</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.11866</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.11866v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We consider a so-called quantum graph with standard continuity and Kirchhoff vertex conditions where the Kirchhoff vertex condition is perturbed by Gaussian noise. We show that the quantum graph setting is very different from the classical one dimensional boundary noise setting, where the transition semigroup is known to be strong Feller, by giving examples and counterexamples to the strong Feller property. In particular, when the graph is a tree, and there is noise present in all but one of the terminal vertices, then the transition semigroup associated with the problem is strong Feller at any time $T&gt;0$. This turns out to be also a necessary condition for equilateral star graphs. We also comment on the existence and uniqueness of the invariant measure and the regularity of the solution.</description>

      <title>Multi-Dimensional Cohomological Phenomena in the Multiparametric Models of Random Simplicial Complexes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.02573</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.02573v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In the past two decades, extensive research has been conducted on the (co)homology of various models of random simplicial complexes. So far, it has always been examined merely as a list of groups. This paper expands upon this by describing both the ring structure and the Steenrod-algebra structure of the cohomology of the multiparametric models. For the lower model, we prove that the ring structure is always a.a.s trivial, while, for certain parameters, the Steenrod-algebra a.a.s acts non-trivially. This reveals that complex multi-dimensional topological structures appear as subcomplexes of this model. In contrast, we improve upon a result of Farber and Nowik, and assert that the cohomology of the upper multiparametric model is a.a.s concentrated in a single dimension.</description>

      <title>Subleading correction to the Asian options volatility in the Black-Scholes model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.05142</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.05142v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The short maturity limit $T\to 0$ for the implied volatility of an Asian option in the Black-Scholes model is determined by the large deviations property for the time-average of the geometric Brownian motion. In this note we derive the subleading $O(T)$ correction to this implied volatility, using an asymptotic expansion for the Hartman-Watson distribution. The result is used to compute subleading corrections to Asian options prices in a small maturity expansion, sharpening the leading order result obtained using large deviations theory. We demonstrate good numerical agreement with precise benchmarks for Asian options pricing in the Black-Scholes model.</description>
