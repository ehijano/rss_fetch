      <title>Identification of Basins of Attraction in the Local Universe</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.17261</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.17261v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Structure in the Universe is believed to have evolved out of quantum fluctuations seeded by inflation in the early Universe. These fluctuations lead to density perturbations that grow via gravitational instability into large cosmological structures. In the linear regime, the growth of structure is directly coupled to the velocity field since perturbations are amplified by attracting (and accelerating) matter. Surveys of galaxy redshifts and distances allow one to infer the underlying density and velocity fields. Here, assuming the LCDM standard model of cosmology and applying a Hamiltonian Monte-Carlo algorithm to the grouped Cosmicflows-4 (CF4) compilation of 38,000 groups of galaxies, the large scale structure of the Universe is reconstructed out to a redshift corresponding to about 30, 000 km/s. Our method provides a probabilistic assessment of the domains of gravitational potential minima: basins of attraction (BoA). Earlier Cosmicflows catalogs suggested the Milky Way Galaxy was associated with a BoA called Laniakea. Now with the newer CF4 data, there is a slight probabilistic preference for Laniakea to be part of the much larger Shapley BoA. The largest BoA recovered from the CF4 data is associated with the Sloan Great Wall with a volume within the sample of 15.5 10^6(Mpc/h)^3, which is more than twice the size of the second largest Shapley BoA.</description>

      <title>6x2pt: Forecasting gains from joint weak lensing and galaxy clustering analyses with spectroscopic-photometric galaxy cross-correlations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.17377</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.17377v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We explore the enhanced self-calibration of photometric galaxy redshift distributions, $n(z)$, through the combination of up to six two-point functions. Our $\rm 3\times2pt$ configuration is comprised of photometric shear, spectroscopic galaxy clustering, and spectroscopic-photometric galaxy-galaxy lensing (GGL). We further include spectroscopic-photometric cross-clustering; photometric GGL; and photometric auto-clustering, using the photometric shear sample as density tracer. We perform simulated likelihood forecasts of the cosmological and nuisance parameter constraints for Stage-III- and Stage-IV-like surveys. For the Stage-III-like case, we employ realistic but perturbed redshift distributions, and distinguish between "coherent" shifting in one direction, versus more internal scattering and full-shape errors. For perfectly known $n(z)$, a $\rm 6\times2pt$ analysis gains $\sim40\%$ in Figure of Merit (FoM) in the $S_8\equiv\sigma_8\sqrt{\Omega_{\rm m}/0.3}$ and $\Omega_{\rm m}$ plane relative to the $\rm 3\times2pt$ analysis. If untreated, coherent and incoherent redshift errors lead to inaccurate inferences of $S_8$ and $\Omega_{\rm m}$, respectively. Employing bin-wise scalar shifts $\delta{z}_i$ in the tomographic mean redshifts reduces cosmological parameter biases, with a $\rm 6x2pt$ analysis constraining the shift parameters with $2-4$ times the precision of a photometric $\rm 3^{ph}\times2pt$ analysis. For the Stage-IV-like survey, a $\rm 6\times2pt$ analysis doubles the FoM($\sigma_8{-}\Omega_{\rm m}$) compared to any $\rm 3\times2pt$ or $\rm 3^{ph}\times2pt$ analysis, and is only $8\%$ less constraining than if the $n(z)$ were perfectly known. A Gaussian mixture model for the $n(z)$ reduces mean-redshift errors and preserves the $n(z)$ shape. It also yields the most accurate and precise cosmological constraints for any $N\rm\times2pt$ configuration given $n(z)$ biases.</description>

      <title>Towards primordial gravitational waves and $n_s=1$ in light of BICEP/Keck, DESI BAO and Hubble tension</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.17879</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.17879v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent observational data seem to show a $\gtrsim 3\sigma$ evidence for an evolving dark energy (DE) against the cosmological constant, so the standard $\Lambda$CDM model. In this paper, we perform the search for the primordial gravitational waves with the potential pre-recombination solutions to the Hubble tension, using recent DESI baryon acoustic oscillation measurements combined with BICEP/Keck cosmic microwave background (CMB) B-mode polarization, Planck CMB and Pantheon supernova data, which reveal that the low bound of the tensor-to-scalar ratio $r$ is $&gt; 1.5\sigma$ non-zero with the bestfit $r_{0.05}\sim 0.01$ and the scalar spectral index $n_s= 1$ (both $|r_{0.05}-0.01|$ and $|n_s-1|\sim {\cal O} (0.001)$). In particular, we observe the unnoticed impact of CMB B-mode polarization data for constraining the nature of DE, which together with early dark energy solutions to the Hubble tension is calling for the return of post-recombination $\Lambda$CDM.</description>

      <title>Loosely coupled particles in warm inflation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.17927</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.17927v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Cosmological perturbations in warm inflation are conventionally described by an EFT. It consists of the inflaton field coupled to a radiation fluid and applies to energy scales of order Hubble $H$ and inflaton decay width $\gamma$, but well below temperature $T$. This EFT lacks a proper treatment of inflatons produced with energy $\sim T$. While the direct contribution of these ``UV inflatons'' to the super-horizon curvature perturbations is subdominant because of the cosmological redshift, for $\gamma \sim H$, their indirect contribution is potentially important -- by their effect on the equation of state, by being exchanged as long-lived intermediate states, and by sourcing gravitational waves with their sizable anisotropic stress. To include these effects, we add to the EFT the Boltzmann distribution of the gas of UV inflatons and compute some of the corrections.</description>

      <title>Simulation-Based Inference Benchmark for LSST Weak Lensing Cosmology</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.17975</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.17975v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Standard cosmological analysis, which relies on two-point statistics, fails to extract the full information of the data. This limits our ability to constrain with precision cosmological parameters. Thus, recent years have seen a paradigm shift from analytical likelihood-based to simulation-based inference. However, such methods require a large number of costly simulations. We focus on full-field inference, considered the optimal form of inference. Our objective is to benchmark several ways of conducting full-field inference to gain insight into the number of simulations required for each method. We make a distinction between explicit and implicit full-field inference. Moreover, as it is crucial for explicit full-field inference to use a differentiable forward model, we aim to discuss the advantages of having this property for the implicit approach. We use the sbi_lens package which provides a fast and differentiable log-normal forward model. This forward model enables us to compare explicit and implicit full-field inference with and without gradient. The former is achieved by sampling the forward model through the No U-Turns sampler. The latter starts by compressing the data into sufficient statistics and uses the Neural Likelihood Estimation algorithm and the one augmented with gradient. We perform a full-field analysis on LSST Y10 like weak lensing simulated mass maps. We show that explicit and implicit full-field inference yield consistent constraints. Explicit inference requires 630 000 simulations with our particular sampler corresponding to 400 independent samples. Implicit inference requires a maximum of 101 000 simulations split into 100 000 simulations to build sufficient statistics (this number is not fine tuned) and 1 000 simulations to perform inference. Additionally, we show that our way of exploiting the gradients does not significantly help implicit inference.</description>

      <title>Conformal Backreaction, Chiral and Conformal Anomalies in the Early Universe</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.18004</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.18004v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The backreaction of a conformal matter sector and its associated conformal anomaly on gravity can be systematically studied using the formalism of the anomaly effective action. This action, defined precisely in flat spacetime within ordinary quantum field theory, can be analyzed perturbatively in terms of external graviton insertions. The expansion coefficients correspond to correlation functions of the stress-energy tensor, which are renormalized through two key counterterms: the square of the Weyl tensor $(C^2)$ and the Gauss-Bonnet term $(E)$. Anomalous conformal Ward identities impose hierarchical constraints on this expansion, revealing that the anomaly's contribution arises from bilinear mixings of the form $R \Box^{-1} E$ and $R \Box^{-1} C^2$, supplemented by local Weyl-invariant terms. These mixings reflect the non-local structure of the anomaly. The precise form of the effective action, however, may vary depending on the regularization scheme used, with potential differences manifesting through additional Weyl-invariant terms. These actions encapsulate the breaking of Weyl invariance in the early universe, with implications that are particularly relevant during the inflationary epoch. For chiral and gravitational anomalies, we demonstrate that the corresponding effective actions exhibit similar structures, influencing the evolution of chiral asymmetries in the early universe plasma.</description>

      <title>The radio halo in PLCKESZ G171.94 $-$ 40.65: Beacon of merging activity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.18075</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.18075v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present the first multi-frequency analysis of the candidate ultra-steep spectrum radio halo in the galaxy cluster PLCKESZ G171.94$-$40.65, using the upgraded Giant Metrewave Radio telescope (uGMRT; 400 MHz), and Karl G. Jansky Very Large Array (JVLA; 1-2 GHz) observations. Our radio data have been complemented with archival \textit{Chandra} X-ray observations to provide a crucial insight into the complex intracluster medium (ICM) physics, happening at large scales. We detect the radio halo emission to the extent of $\sim$ 1.5 Mpc at 400 MHz, significantly larger than previously reported, along with five tailed galaxies in the central region. We also report the discovery of an unknown diffuse source 'U', at the cluster periphery, with an extent of 300 kpc. Using the available observations, we have found that the radio spectrum of the halo is well-fitted with a single power law, having a spectral index of $-1.36 \pm 0.05$, indicating that it is not an ultra-steep spectrum radio halo. Our low-resolution (25$''$) resolved spectral map shows an overall uniform spectral index, with some patches of fluctuations. The X-ray and radio surface brightness are morphologically co-spatial, with a slight extension along the northwest-southeast direction, seen in both maps. The radio and X-ray surface brightness indicates strong positive correlations, with sub-linear correlation slopes ($\sim$ 0.71). Multiple tailed galaxies and the radio halo indicate a high dynamical activity at the cluster central region.</description>

      <title>Tracing cosmic evolution through Weyl-Type f(Q,T) gravity model: theoretical analysis and observational validation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.17193</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.17193v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the cosmic evolution of the Universe across different cosmological epochs in exponential Weyl-type $f(Q, T)$ gravity model. The theoretical analysis involves a detailed dynamical system approach, where we define dimensionless variables and derive a system of linear differential equations to identify critical points corresponding to the radiation, matter and de Siter phase. The findings show the transition from deceleration to acceleration phase, with stable and unstable critical points characterizing different phases of the evolution. In the second approach, we validate the theoretical predictions by using observational data from Cosmic Chronometers ($CC$) and $Pantheon^+$ datasets. We constrain the Hubble parameter and subsequently analysed the other cosmological and geometrical parameters. In this approach also, the transition from deceleration to acceleration has been confirmed, with the equation of state (EoS) parameter approaching $\Lambda$CDM at late times. The further validate this, we present the behaviour of state finder pair. We obtain the age of the Universe $13.81$ Gyr according to $CC$ data and $13.96$ Gyr with the $Pantheon^+$ dataset. The model behaviour in both the approaches shows strong agreement in the late-time behavior of the Universe. The evolutionary behaviour of Hubble parameter and distance modulus, reinforcing the reliability of the Weyl-type $f(Q, T)$ gravity model in describing the expansion history of Universe.</description>

      <title>LensWatch: II. Improved Photometry and Time Delay Constraints on the Strongly-Lensed Type Ia Supernova 2022qmx ("SN Zwicky") with HST Template Observations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.17239</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.17239v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Strongly lensed supernovae (SNe) are a rare class of transient that can offer tight cosmological constraints that are complementary to methods from other astronomical events. We present a follow-up study of one recently-discovered strongly lensed SN, the quadruply-imaged Type Ia SN 2022qmx (aka, "SN Zwicky") at z = 0.3544. We measure updated, template-subtracted photometry for SN Zwicky and derive improved time delays and magnifications. This is possible because SNe are transient, fading away after reaching their peak brightness. Specifically, we measure point spread function (PSF) photometry for all four images of SN Zwicky in three Hubble Space Telescope WFC3/UVIS passbands (F475W, F625W, F814W) and one WFC3/IR passband (F160W), with template images taken $\sim 11$ months after the epoch in which the SN images appear. We find consistency to within $2\sigma$ between lens model predicted time delays ($\lesssim1$ day), and measured time delays with HST colors ($\lesssim2$ days), including the uncertainty from chromatic microlensing that may arise from stars in the lensing galaxy. The standardizable nature of SNe Ia allows us to estimate absolute magnifications for the four images, with images A and C being elevated in magnification compared to lens model predictions by about $6\sigma$ and $3\sigma$ respectively, confirming previous work. We show that millilensing or differential dust extinction is unable to explain these discrepancies and find evidence for the existence of microlensing in images A, C, and potentially D, that may contribute to the anomalous magnification.</description>

      <title>The Magellanic Clouds are very rare in the IllustrisTNG simulations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.17259</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.17259v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Large and Small Magellanic Cloud (LMC and SMC) form the closest interacting galactic system to the Milky Way, therewith providing a laboratory to test cosmological models in the local Universe. We quantify the likelihood for the Magellanic Clouds (MCs) to be observed within the $\Lambda$CDM model using hydrodynamical simulations of the IllustrisTNG project. The orbits of the MCs are constrained by proper motion measurements taken by the $Hubble~Space~Telescope$ and $Gaia$. The MCs have a mutual separation of $d_{\mathrm{MCs}}~=~24.5\,\mathrm{kpc}$ and a relative velocity of $v_{\mathrm{MCs}}~=~90.8\,\mathrm{km\,s^{-1}}$, implying a phase-space density of $f_{\mathrm{MCs,obs}}~\equiv~(d_{\mathrm{MCs}} \cdot v_{\mathrm{MCs}})^{-3}~=~9.10\times10^{-11}\,\mathrm{km^{-3}\,s^{3}\,kpc^{-3}}$. We select analogues to the MCs based on their stellar masses and distances in MW-like halos. None of the selected LMC analogues have a higher total mass and lower Galactocentric distance than the LMC, resulting in $&gt;3.75\sigma$ tension. We also find that the $f_{\mathrm{MCs}}$ distribution in the highest resolution TNG50 simulation is in $3.95\sigma$ tension with observations. Thus, a hierarchical clustering of two massive satellites like the MCs in a narrow phase-space volume is unlikely in $\Lambda$CDM, presumably because of short merger timescales due to dynamical friction between the overlapping dark matter halos. We show that group infall led by an LMC analogue cannot populate the Galactic disc of satellites (DoS), implying that the DoS and the MCs formed in physically unrelated ways in $\Lambda$CDM. Since the $20^\circ$ alignment of the LMC and DoS orbital poles has a likelihood of $P=0.030$ ($2.17\sigma$), adding this $\chi^2$ to that of $f_{\mathrm{MCs}}$ gives a combined likelihood of $P = 3.90\times10^{-5}$ ($4.11\sigma$).</description>

      <title>The cosmology of ultralight scalar dark matter coupled to right-handed neutrinos</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.17396</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.17396v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider ultralight scalar dark matter that couples to right-handed neutrinos. Due to the high density of neutrinos in the early universe, the background neutrino density dominates the dynamics of the scalar field, and qualitatively alters the field's cosmological evolution. This effect has not been included in previous literature, and changes the interpretation of cosmological data and its interplay with laboratory experiments. To illustrate these points a simplified model of a $1+1$ setup with a single scalar field is analyzed.
  We find that: {\it i}) The scalar field experiences an asymmetric potential and its energy density redshifts differently than ordinary matter. {\it ii}) Neutrino mass measurements at the CMB and oscillation experiments performed today complement one another (i.e., they constrain different regions of parameter space). {\it iii}) There exists potentially interesting cosmologies with either $O(1)$ variations in the dark matter density between the CMB and today, or $O(1)$ oscillations of neutrino mass.</description>

Abstract: We present the first comprehensive census of the satellite population around a Large Magellanic Cloud (LMC) stellar-mass galaxy, as part of the Magellanic Analog Dwarf Companions and Stellar Halos (MADCASH) survey. We have surveyed NGC 2403 (D=3.0 Mpc) with the Subaru/Hyper Suprime-Cam imager out to a projected radius of 90 kpc (with partial coverage extending out to ~110 kpc, or ~80% of the virial radius of NGC 2403), resolving stars in the uppermost ~2.5 mags of its red giant branch. By looking for stellar overdensities in the red giant branch spatial density map, we identify 149 satellite candidates, of which only the previously discovered MADCASH J074238+65201-dw is a bona fide dwarf, together with the more massive and disrupting satellite DDO 44. We carefully assess the completeness of our search via injection of artificial dwarf galaxies into the images, finding that we are reliably sensitive to candidates down to M_V ~ -7.5 mag (and somewhat sensitive to even fainter satellites). A comparison of the satellite luminosity function of NGC 2403 down to this magnitude limit to theoretical expectations shows overall good agreement. This is the first of a full sample of 11 Magellanic Cloud-mass host galaxies we will analyze, creating a statistical sample that will provide the first quantitative constraints on hierarchical models of galaxy formation around low-mass hosts.</description>

      <title>Using Convolutional Neural Networks to Search for Strongly Lensed Quasars in KiDS DR5</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.17471v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Gravitationally strongly lensed quasars (SL-QSO) offer invaluable insights into cosmological and astrophysical phenomena. With the data from ongoing and next-generation surveys, thousands of SL-QSO systems can be discovered expectedly, leading to unprecedented opportunities. However, the challenge lies in identifying SL-QSO from enormous datasets with high recall and purity in an automated and efficient manner. Hence, we developed a program based on a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) for finding SL-QSO from large-scale surveys and applied it to the Kilo-degree Survey Data Release 5 (KiDS DR5). Our approach involves three key stages: firstly, we pre-selected ten million bright objects (with $r$-band $\tt{MAG\_AUTO} &lt; 22$), excluding stars from the dataset; secondly, we established realistic training and test sets to train and fine-tune the CNN, resulting in the identification of 4195 machine candidates, and the false positive rate (FPR) of $\sim$1/2000 and recall of 0.8125 evaluated by using the real test set containing 16 confirmed lensed quasars; thirdly, human inspections were performed for further selections, and then 272 SL-QSO candidates were eventually found in total, including 16 high-score, 118 median-score, and 138 lower-score candidates, separately. Removing the systems already confirmed or identified in other papers, we end up with 229 SL-QSO candidates, including 7 high-score, 95 median-score, and 127 lower-score candidates, and the corresponding catalog is publicly available online.</description>

      <title>Constraining string cosmology with the gravitational-wave background using the NANOGrav 15-year data set</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.17846</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.17846v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The North American Nanohertz Observatory for Gravitational Waves (NANOGrav) collaboration has recently reported strong evidence for a signal at nanohertz, potentially the first detection of the stochastic gravitational-wave background (SGWB). We investigate whether the NANOGrav signal is consistent with the SGWB predicted by string cosmology models. By performing Bayesian parameter estimation on the NANOGrav 15-year data set, we constrain the key parameters of a string cosmology model: the frequency $f_s$ and the fractional energy density $\Omega_\mathrm{gw}^{s}$ of gravitational waves at the end of the dilaton-driven stage, and the Hubble parameter $H_r$ at the end of the string phase. Our analysis yields constraints of $f_s = 1.2^{+0.6}_{-0.6}\times 10^{-8} \mathrm{Hz}$ and $\Omega_\mathrm{gw}^{s} = 2.9^{+5.4}_{-2.3}\times 10^{-8}$, consistent with theoretical predictions from string cosmology. However, the current NANOGrav data is not sensitive to the $H_r$ parameter. We also compare the string cosmology model to a simple power-law model using Bayesian model selection, finding a Bayes factor of $2.2$ in favor of the string cosmology model. Our results demonstrate the potential of pulsar timing arrays to constrain cosmological models and study the early Universe.</description>

      <title>The importance of nuclear star clusters for massive black hole growth and nuclear star formation in simulated low-mass galaxies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.18096</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.18096v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Observed low-mass galaxies with nuclear star clusters (NSCs) can host accreting massive black holes (MBH). We present simulations of dwarf galaxies ($M_{\mathrm{baryon}} \sim 0.6 - 2.4 \times 10^8 \rm \, M_\odot$) at solar mass resolution ($0.5\rm \, M_\odot &lt; m_{\mathrm{gas}} &lt; 4 \rm \, M_\odot$) with a multi-phase interstellar medium (ISM) and investigate the impact of NSCs on MBH growth and nuclear star formation (SF). The Griffin simulation model includes non-equilibrium low temperature cooling, chemistry and the effect of HII regions and supernovae (SN) from massive stars. Individual stars are sampled down to 0.08 $\rm M_\odot$ and their non-softened gravitational interactions with MBHs are computed with the regularised Ketju integrator. MBHs with masses in the range of $10^2 - 10^5 \, \rm M_\odot$ are represented by accreting sink particles without feedback. We find that the presence of NSCs boost nuclear SF (i.e. NSC growth) and MBH accretion by funneling gas to the central few parsecs. Low-mass MBHs grow more rapidly on $\sim 600$ Myr timescales, exceeding their Eddington rates at peak accretion. MBH accretion and nuclear SF is episodic (i.e. leads to multiple stellar generations), coeval and regulated by SN explosions. On 40 - 60 Myr timescales the first SN of each episode terminates MBH accretion and nuclear SF. Without NSCs, low-mass MBHs do not grow and MBH accretion and reduced nuclear SF become irregular and uncorrelated. This study gives the first insights into the possible co-evolution of MBHs and NSCs in low-mass galaxies and highlights the importance of considering dense NSCs in galactic studies of MBH growth.</description>

      <title>Non-Parametric Analysis for the Dark Matter Density Evolution</title>

      <description>arXiv:2308.05165v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we investigate a potential departure in the standard dark matter density evolution law, $\rho_{dm} = \rho_{dm,0}(1+z)^3$. The method involves considering a deformed evolution model, denoted as $\rho_{dm} = \rho_{dm,0}(1+z)^3f(z)$, and searching the presence of any deviation ($f(z)\neq 1$). As one may see, $f(z)$ is a general function that parametrizes a possible digression from the standard law. We use data of baryon acoustic oscillations, type I Supernovae luminosity distances, and galaxy cluster gas mass fraction observations to reconstruct $f(z)$ through an approach that is not dependent on the cosmological model or the so-called Gaussian process regression. Unlike previous works, it enables us to investigate a possible deviation without using a specific function to describe it. We have obtained $f(z)=1$, the standard model scenario, within $2\sigma$ c.l. in all the considered cases.</description>

      <title>Constraints on Metastable Dark Energy Decaying into Dark Matter</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.04970v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We revisit the proposal that an energy transfer from dark energy into dark matter can be described in field theory by a first order phase transition. We analyze the model proposed in Ref. Abdalla et al. (2013), using updated constraints on the decay time of a metastable dark energy from the work of Ref. Shafieloo et al. (2018). The results of our analysis show no prospects for potentially observable signals that could distinguish this scenario. We also show that such model would not drive a complete transition to a dark matter dominated phase even in a distant future. Nevertheless, the model is not excluded by the latest data and we confirm that the mass of the dark matter particle that would result from such a process corresponds to an axion-like particle, which is currently one of the best motivated dark matter candidates. We argue that extensions to this model, possibly with additional couplings, still deserve further attention as it could provide an interesting and viable description for an interacting dark sector scenario based in a single scalar field.</description>

      <title>Tomographic redshift dipole: Testing the cosmological principle</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.14580v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The cosmological principle posits that the universe is statistically homogeneous and isotropic on large scales, implying all matter shares the same rest frame. This principle suggests that velocity estimates of our motion from various sources should agree with the cosmic microwave background (CMB) dipole's inferred velocity of 370 km/s. Yet, for over two decades, analyses of radio galaxy and quasar catalogs have found velocities at odds with the CMB dipole, with tensions up to 5$\sigma$. In a blind analysis of BOSS and eBOSS spectroscopic data from galaxies and quasars across $0.2&lt;z&lt;2.2$, we applied a novel dipole estimator for a tomographic approach, robustly correcting biases and quantifying uncertainties with realistic mock catalogs. Our findings with eBOSS data ($0.6&lt;z&lt;2.2$), indicating a velocity of $196^{+92}_{-79}$ km/s, demonstrate a $2\sigma$ agreement with the CMB dipole when considering the full 3D vector distribution and a 3-to-6$\sigma$ tension with previous number count studies. This result supports the cosmological principle, emphasizing the consistency of our motion with the CMB across vast cosmic distances. On the other hand, the BOSS data revealed potential unmodeled systematics; the estimator could not be minimized using the LOWZ set ($0.2&lt;z&lt;0.4$), and the CMASS set ($0.4&lt;z&lt;0.6$) presented results that pointed towards the southern hemisphere, conflicting with the CMB dipole. Addressing the disparities with earlier number count analyses and understanding possible systematics in spectroscopic measurements will be essential to further validate the cosmological principle.</description>

      <title>Forecast of CMB TB and EB correlations for AliCPT-1</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.19222v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The correlations between T, E modes and B modes in cosmic microwave background (CMB) radiation, which are expected to vanish under parity symmetry, have become a sensitive probe of the new physics beyond the standard model. In this paper, we forecast the estimation of TB and EB cross power spectra using NILC and cILC on AliCPT-1 simulations together with Planck HFI and WMAP K maps as ancillary data. We find that, NILC performs better than cILC on measuring TB and EB correlations in light of its lower uncertainties. In terms of the birefringence angle estimation without assuming systematic errors, the combination of CMB TB and EB spectra from NILC cleaned simulations could reach a sensitivity of $|\beta|&lt;0.058^\circ$ with 2$\sigma$ significance for the first observing season of AliCPT. Tripling the survey duration will improve this sensitivity to $|\beta|&lt;0.041^\circ$.</description>

      <title>A new diagnostic for the null test of dynamical dark energy in light of DESI 2024 and other BAO data</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.06618v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We introduce a new diagnostic for the null tests of dynamical dark energy alongside two other combined equivalent diagnostics. These diagnostics are useful, especially when we include anisotropic baryon acoustic oscillation (BAO) data in an analysis, to quantify the deviations from the standard $\Lambda$CDM model. We also consider another diagnostic for isotropic BAO observations. These null tests are independent of any late-time dark energy model or parametrization. With these diagnostics, we study the evidence for dynamical dark energy in light of Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument (DESI) 2024 data combined with cosmic microwave background (CMB) observations of the Planck 2018 mission and local $H_0$ measurements. We find no strong evidence for dynamical dark energy. The exclusion of the individual deviations at the effective redshift 0.51 of the DESI 2024 data makes the evidence even weaker. We get nearly similar results for other non-DESI BAO data. Both for DESI 2024 and other non-DESI BAO data, the evidence is almost independent of early-time physics. The evidence corresponding to the SHOES value of $H_0$ is higher than the corresponding tRGB value of $H_0$ for all combinations of data, but still not strong enough to reject the flat $\Lambda$CDM model.</description>

      <title>ELG Spectroscopic Systematics Analysis of the DESI Data Release 1</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.16657v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument (DESI) uses more than 2.4 million Emission Line Galaxies (ELGs) for 3D large-scale structure (LSS) analyses in its Data Release 1 (DR1). Such large statistics enable thorough research on systematic uncertainties. In this study, we focus on spectroscopic systematics of ELGs. The redshift success rate ($f_{\rm goodz}$) is the relative fraction of secure redshifts among all measurements. It depends on observing conditions, thus introduces non-cosmological variations to the LSS. We, therefore, develop the redshift failure weight ($w_{\rm zfail}$) and a per-fibre correction ($\eta_{\rm zfail}$) to mitigate these dependences. They have minor influences on the galaxy clustering. For ELGs with a secure redshift, there are two subtypes of systematics: 1) catastrophics (large) that only occur in a few samples; 2) redshift uncertainty (small) that exists for all samples. The catastrophics represent 0.26\% of the total DR1 ELGs, composed of the confusion between O\,\textsc{ii} and sky residuals, double objects, total catastrophics and others. We simulate the realistic 0.26\% catastrophics of DR1 ELGs, the hypothetical 1\% catastrophics, and the truncation of the contaminated $1.31&lt;z&lt;1.33$ in the \textsc{AbacusSummit} ELG mocks. Their $P_\ell$ show non-negligible bias from the uncontaminated mocks. But their influences on the redshift space distortions (RSD) parameters are smaller than $0.2\sigma$. The redshift uncertainty of \Yone ELGs is 8.5 km/s with a Lorentzian profile. The code for implementing the catastrophics and redshift uncertainty on mocks can be found in https://github.com/Jiaxi-Yu/modelling_spectro_sys.</description>

Abstract: We present an efficient technique for calculating the angular two-point correlation functions (or ``overlap reduction functions'') induced by gravitational waves in both the pulse arrival times of pulsars and in the angular deflections of distant sources. In the most general case, there are six auto- and cross-correlations for the pulse arrival times and the two components of the angular deflection. We provide results for spin-2 (i.e., general-relativistic) gravitational waves as well as the spin-1 modes that may arise in alternative-gravity theories. These calculations can be easily implemented for future analysis or study, and we provide code to do so.</description>

      <title>Interacting ultralight dark matter and dark energy and fits to cosmological data in a field theory approach</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.19284v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The description of dark matter as a pressure-less fluid and of dark energy as a cosmological constant, both minimally coupled to gravity, constitutes the basis of the concordance $\Lambda\text{CDM}$ model. However, the concordance model is based on using equations of motion directly for the fluids with constraints placed on their sources, and lacks an underlying Lagrangian. In this work, we propose a Lagrangian model of two spin zero fields describing dark energy and dark matter with an interaction term between the two along with self-interactions. We study the background evolution of the fields as well as their linear perturbations, suggesting an alternative to $\Lambda$CDM with dark matter and dark energy being fundamental dynamical fields. The parameters of the model are extracted using a Bayesian inference tool based on multiple cosmological data sets which include those of Planck (with lensing), BAO, Pantheon, SH0ES, and WiggleZ. Using these data, we set constraints on the dark matter mass and the interaction strengths. Furthermore, we find that the model is able to alleviate the Hubble tension for some data sets while also resolving the $S_8$ tension.</description>

      <title>A generalized method of constraining Warm Inflation with CMB data</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.06032v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A thorough MCMC analysis of any inflationary model against the current cosmological data is essential for assessing the validity of such a model as a viable inflationary model. Warm Inflation, producing both thermal and quantum fluctuations, yield a complex form of scalar power spectrum, which, in general, cannot be directly written as a function of the comoving wavenumber $k$, an essential step to incorporate the primordial spectra into CAMB to do an MCMC analysis through CosmoMC/Cobaya. In this paper, we devised an efficient generalized methodology to mould the WI power spectra as a function of $k$, without the need of slow-roll approximation of the inflationary dynamics. The methodology is directly applicable to any Warm Inflation model, including the ones with complex forms of the dissipative coefficient and the inflaton potential.</description>

      <title>Double-well Inflation: observational constraints and theoretical implications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.13918</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.13918v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We revisit the small field double-well inflationary model and investigate its observational viability in light of the current Cosmic Microwave Background data. In particular, considering scenarios with minimal and nonminimal coupling between the inflaton field and the Ricci scalar, we perform a Monte Carlo Markov chain analysis to probe the model's parameter space. We also investigate the consequences of the cosmological results in the canonical type-I seesaw mechanism context and obtain constraints on the vacuum expectation value of the inflaton field, together with the amplitude of the coupling to gravity in the nonminimal case. We employ a Bayesian procedure to compare the model's predictions with the Starobinsky inflationary scenario and find a strong statistical preference for the latter against the minimal and nonminimal coupled double-well scenario.</description>

      <title>Evaluating the galaxy formation histories predicted by a neural network in pure dark matter simulations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.16079</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.16079v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate a series of galaxy properties computed using the merger trees and environmental histories from dark matter only cosmological simulations, using the predictive semi-recurrent neural network outlined in Chittenden and Tojeiro (2023), and using stochastic improvements presented in our companion paper: Behera, Tojeiro and Chittenden (2024). We apply these methods to the dark matter only runs of the IllustrisTNG simulations to understand the effects of baryon removal, and to the gigaparsec-volume pure dark matter simulation Uchuu, to understand the effects of the lower resolution or alternative metrics for halo properties. We find that the machine learning model recovers accurate summary statistics derived from the predicted star formation and stellar metallicity histories, and correspondent spectroscopy and photometry. However, the inaccuracies of the model's application to dark simulations are substantial for low mass and slowly growing haloes. For these objects, the halo mass accretion rate is exaggerated due to the lack of stellar feedback, yet the formation of the halo can be severely limited by the absence of low mass progenitors in a low resolution simulation. Furthermore, differences in the structure and environment of higher mass haloes results in an overabundance of red, quenched galaxies. These results signify progress towards a machine learning model which builds high fidelity mocks based on a physical interpretation of the galaxy-halo connection, yet they illustrate the need to account for differences in halo properties and the resolution of the simulation.</description>

      <title>No evidence for anisotropy in galaxy spin directions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.06617</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.06617v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Modern cosmology rests on the cosmological principle, that on large enough scales the Universe is both homogeneous and isotropic. A corollary is that galaxies' spin vectors should be isotropically distributed on the sky. This has been challenged by multiple authors for over a decade, with claims to have detected a statistically significant dipole pattern of spins. We collect all publicly available datasets with spin classifications (binary Z-wise/S-wise), and analyse them for large-angle anisotropies ($\ell \le 2$). We perform each inference in both a Bayesian and frequentist fashion, the former establishing posterior probabilities on the multipole parameters and the latter calculating $p$-values for rejection of the null hypothesis of isotropy (i.e. no power at $\ell&gt;0$). All analysis indicate consistency with isotropy to within $3\sigma$. We similarly identify no evidence for a "hemisphere anisotropy" that neglects the angular dependence of the dipole. We isolate the differences with contrary claims in the ad hoc or biased statistics that they employ. Our code is publicly available.</description>

      <title>Cosmic variance of the Hellings and Downs correlation for ensembles of universes having nonzero angular power spectra</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.08574</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.08574v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Gravitational waves (GWs) induce correlated perturbations to the arrival times of pulses from an array of galactic millisecond pulsars. The expected correlations, obtained by averaging over many pairs of pulsars having the same angular separation (pulsar averaging) and over an ensemble of model universes (ensemble averaging), are described by the Hellings and Downs curve. As shown by Allen [Phys. Rev. D 107, 043018 (2023)], the pulsar-averaged correlation will not agree exactly with the expected Hellings and Downs prediction if the gravitational-wave sources interfere with one another, differing instead by a "cosmic variance" contribution. The precise shape and size of the cosmic variance depends on the statistical properties of the ensemble of universes used to model the background. Here, we extend the calculations of the cosmic variance for the standard Gaussian ensemble to an ensemble of model universes which collectively has rotationally invariant correlations in the GW power on different angular scales (described by an angular power spectrum, $C_\ell$ for $\ell=0,1,\cdots$.). We obtain an analytic form for the cosmic variance in terms of the $C_\ell$'s and show that for realistic values $C_{\ell}/C_0\lesssim 10^{-3}$, there is virtually no difference in the cosmic variance compared to that for the standard Gaussian ensemble (which has a zero angular power spectrum).</description>

      <title>Extreme-value modelling of the brightest galaxies at $z\gtrsim9$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.11567</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.11567v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Data from the James Webb Space Telescope have revealed an intriguing population of bright galaxies at high redshifts. In this work, we use extreme-value statistics to calculate the distribution (in UV magnitude) of the brightest galaxies in the redshift range $9 \lesssim z \lesssim 16$. We combine the Generalised Extreme Value (GEV) approach with modelling of the galaxy luminosity function. We obtain predictions of the brightest galaxies for a suite of luminosity functions, including the Schechter and double power law functions, as well as a model parametrised by the stellar formation efficiency $f_*$. We find that the JWST data is broadly consistent with $f_*$ of $5\%-10\%$, and that the brightest galaxy at $z\sim16$ will have $M_{\rm UV}\approx -23.5^{0.8}_{0.4}$. If $f_*$ is dependent on halo mass, we predict $M_{\rm UV}\approx -22.5^{0.5}_{1.5}$ for such an object. We show that extreme-value statistics not only predicts the magnitude of the brightest galaxies at high redshifts, but may also be able to distinguish between models of star formation in high-redshift galaxies.</description>

      <title>MAMMOTH-Subaru. II. Diverse Populations of Circumgalactic Ly$\alpha$ Nebulae at Cosmic Noon</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.13113</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.13113v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Circumgalactic Lyman-alpha (Ly$\alpha$) nebulae are gaseous halos around galaxies exhibiting luminous extended Ly$\alpha$ emission. This work investigates Ly$\alpha$ nebulae from deep imaging of $\sim12~\mathrm{deg}^2$ sky, targeted by the MAMMOTH-Subaru survey. Utilizing the wide-field capability of Hyper Suprime-Cam (HSC), we present one of the largest blind Ly$\alpha$ nebula selections, including QSO nebulae, Ly$\alpha$ blobs, and radio galaxy nebulae down to typical $2\sigma$ Ly$\alpha$ surface brightness of $(5-10)\times10^{-18}\mathrm{~erg~s^{-1}~cm^{-2}~arcsec^{-2}}$. The sample contains 117 nebulae with Ly$\alpha$ sizes of 40 - 400 kpc, and the most gigantic one spans about 365 kpc, referred to as the Ivory Nebula. Combining multiwavelength data, we investigate diverse nebula populations and associated galaxies. We find a small fraction of Ly$\alpha$ nebulae have QSOs ($\sim7\%$), luminous infrared galaxies ($\sim1\%$), and radio galaxies ($\sim 2\%$). Remarkably, among the 28 enormous Ly$\alpha$ nebulae (ELANe) exceeding 100 kpc, about 80\% are associated with UV-faint galaxies ($M_\mathrm{UV} &gt; -22$), categorized as Type II ELANe. We underscore that Type II ELANe constitute the majority but remain largely hidden in current galaxy and QSO surveys. Dusty starburst and obscured AGN activity are proposed to explain the nature of Type II ELANe. The SED of stacking all Ly$\alpha$ nebulae also reveals signs of massive dusty star-forming galaxies with obscured AGNs. We propose a model to explain the dusty nature where the diverse populations of Ly$\alpha$ nebulae capture massive galaxies at different evolutionary stages undergoing violent assembling. Ly$\alpha$ nebulae provide critical insights into the formation and evolution of today's massive cluster galaxies at cosmic noon.</description>

      <title>Gravitational-wave background in bouncing models from semi-classical, quantum and string gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.13521</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.13521v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the primordial spectra and the gravitational-wave background (GWB) of three models of semi-classical, quantum or string gravity where the big bang is replaced by a bounce and the primordial tensor spectrum is blue: ekpyrotic universe with fast-rolling Galileons, string-gas cosmology with Atick-Witten conjecture and pre-big-bang cosmology. We find that the ekpyrotic scenario with Galileons does not produce a GWB amplitude detectable by present or third-generation interferometers, while the Atick-Witten-based string-gas model is ruled out in its present form for violating the big-bang-nucleosynthesis bound, contrary to the original string-gas scenario. In contrast, the GWB of the pre-big-bang scenario falls within the sensitivity window of both LISA and Einstein Telescope, where it takes the form of a single or a broken power law depending on the choice of parameters. The latter will be tightly constrained by both detectors.</description>

      <title>WIMP dark matter in bulk viscous non-standard cosmologies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.03083</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.03083v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we explored an extension of the classical non-standard cosmological scenario in which the new field, $\phi$, which interacts with the radiation component in the early universe, experiences dissipative processes in the form of a bulk viscosity. Assuming an interaction term given by $\Gamma_{\phi}\rho_{\phi}$, where $\Gamma_{\phi}$ accounts for the decay rate of the field and $\rho_{\phi}$ corresponds to its energy density, and a bulk viscosity according to the expression $\xi=\xi_{0}\rho_{\phi}^{1/2}$ in the framework of Eckart's theory, we apply this novel non-standard cosmology to study the parameters space for WIMPs Dark Matter candidate production. This parameter space shows deviations from the classical non-standard cosmological scenario, obtaining new regions to search for this candidate. In particular, for certain combinations of the free parameters, we found large regions in which the model can establish the DM and reproduce the current observable relic density.</description>

      <title>Optimised neural network predictions of galaxy formation histories using semi-stochastic corrections</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.16548</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.16548v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present a novel methodology to improve neural network (NN) predictions of galaxy formation histories by incorporating semi-stochastic corrections to account for short-timescale variability. Our paper addresses limitations in existing models that capture broad trends in galaxy evolution, but fail to reproduce the bursty nature of star formation and chemical enrichment, resulting in inaccurate predictions of key observables such as stellar masses, optical spectra, and colour distributions. We introduce a simple technique to add stochastic components by utilizing the power spectra of galaxy formation histories. We justify our stochastic approach by studying the correlation between the phases of the halo mass assembly and star-formation histories in the IllustrisTNG simulation, and we find that they are correlated only on timescales longer than 6 Gyr, with a strong dependence on galaxy type. Building on NNs developed in Chittenden &amp; Tojeiro (2023), trained on hydrodynamical simulations from the IllustrisTNG project, which predict time-resolved star formation and stellar metallicity histories for central and satellite galaxies based solely on the properties and evolution of their dark matter halos and environments, this approach successfully recovers realistic variability in galaxy properties at short timescales. It significantly improves the accuracy of predicted stellar masses, metallicities, spectra, and colour distributions and provides a powerful framework for generating large, realistic mock galaxy catalogs, while also enhancing our understanding of the complex interplay between galaxy evolution and dark matter halo assembly.</description>
