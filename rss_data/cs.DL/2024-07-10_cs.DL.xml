      <title>Author Intent: Eliminating Ambiguity in MathML</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.06720</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.06720v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: MathML has been successful in improving the accessibility of mathematical notation on the web. All major screen readers support MathML to generate speech, allow navigation of the math, and generate braille. A troublesome area remains: handling ambiguous notations such as \( \vert x\vert\). While it is possible to speak this syntactically, anecdotal evidence indicates most people prefer semantic speech such as ``absolute value of x'' or ``determinant of x'' instead of ``vertical bar x vertical bar'' when first hearing an expression. Several heuristics to infer semantics have improved speech, but ultimately, the author is the one who definitively knows how an expression is meant to be spoken. The W3C Math Working Group is in the process of allowing authors to convey their intent in MathML markup via an intent attribute. This paper describes that work.</description>

      <title>Microsoft Cloud-based Digitization Workflow with Rich Metadata Acquisition for Cultural Heritage Objects</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.06972</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.06972v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In response to several cultural heritage initiatives at the Jagiellonian University, we have developed a new digitization workflow in collaboration with the Jagiellonian Library (JL). The solution is based on easy-to-access technological solutions -- Microsoft 365 cloud with MS Excel files as metadata acquisition interfaces, Office Script for validation, and MS Sharepoint for storage -- that allows metadata acquisition by domain experts (philologists, historians, philosophers, librarians, archivists, curators, etc.) regardless of their experience with information systems. The ultimate goal is to create a knowledge graph that describes the analyzed holdings, linked to general knowledge bases, as well as to other cultural heritage collections, so careful attention is paid to the high accuracy of metadata and proper links to external sources. The workflow has already been evaluated in two pilots in the DiHeLib project focused on digitizing the so-called "Berlin Collection" and in two workshops with international guests, which allowed for its refinement and confirmation of its correctness and usability for JL. As the proposed workflow does not interfere with existing systems or domain guidelines regarding digitization and basic metadata collection in a given institution (e.g., file type, image quality, use of Dublin Core/MARC-21), but extends them in order to enable rich metadata collection, not previously possible, we believe that it could be of interest to all GLAMs (galleries, libraries, archives, and museums).</description>

      <title>Advancing Manuscript Metadata: Work in Progress at the Jagiellonian University</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.06976</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.06976v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: As part of ongoing research projects, three Jagiellonian University units -- the Jagiellonian University Museum, the Jagiellonian University Archives, and the Jagiellonian Library -- are collaborating to digitize cultural heritage documents, describe them in detail, and then integrate these descriptions into a linked data cloud. Achieving this goal requires, as a first step, the development of a metadata model that, on the one hand, complies with existing standards, on the other hand, allows interoperability with other systems, and on the third, captures all the elements of description established by the curators of the collections. In this paper, we present a report on the current status of the work, in which we outline the most important requirements for the data model under development and then make a detailed comparison with the two standards that are the most relevant from the point of view of collections: Europeana Data Model used in Europeana and Encoded Archival Description used in Kalliope.</description>

      <title>Hybrid X-Linker: Automated Data Generation and Extreme Multi-label Ranking for Biomedical Entity Linking</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.06292</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.06292v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: State-of-the-art deep learning entity linking methods rely on extensive human-labelled data, which is costly to acquire. Current datasets are limited in size, leading to inadequate coverage of biomedical concepts and diminished performance when applied to new data. In this work, we propose to automatically generate data to create large-scale training datasets, which allows the exploration of approaches originally developed for the task of extreme multi-label ranking in the biomedical entity linking task. We propose the hybrid X-Linker pipeline that includes different modules to link disease and chemical entity mentions to concepts in the MEDIC and the CTD-Chemical vocabularies, respectively. X-Linker was evaluated on several biomedical datasets: BC5CDR-Disease, BioRED-Disease, NCBI-Disease, BC5CDR-Chemical, BioRED-Chemical, and NLM-Chem, achieving top-1 accuracies of 0.8307, 0.7969, 0.8271, 0.9511, 0.9248, and 0.7895, respectively. X-Linker demonstrated superior performance in three datasets: BC5CDR-Disease, NCBI-Disease, and BioRED-Chemical. In contrast, SapBERT outperformed X-Linker in the remaining three datasets. Both models rely only on the mention string for their operations. The source code of X-Linker and its associated data are publicly available for performing biomedical entity linking without requiring pre-labelled entities with identifiers from specific knowledge organization systems.</description>
