      <title>Biderivations of some classes of solvable Leibniz algebras</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.18134</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.18134v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, we investigate anti-derivations and biderivation of Leibniz algebras. We describe general form of anti-derivations and biderivations on null-filiform and filiform Leibniz algebras. Moreover, we show how to construct Leibniz algebras, while using these biderivations. We describe general form of anti-derivations and biderivations on solvable Leibniz algebras with null-filiform and filiform nilradicals. Interesting fact that, any biderivations of solvable Leibniz algebras with null-filiform and filiform nilradicals are inner biderivations.</description>

      <title>A note on D-modules on the projective spaces of a class of G-representations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.17970</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.17970v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Consider $(G, V)$ a finite-dimensional representation of a connected reductive complex Lie group $G$ and $\mathbb{P}\left( V\right) $ the projective space of $V$. Denote by $G'$ the derived subgroup of $G$ and assume that the categorical quotient is one dimensional. In the case where the representation $(G, V)$ is also multiplicity-free, it is known from Howe-Umeda [4] that the algebra of $G$-invariant differential operators $\Gamma\left(V, \mathcal{D}_V\right)^G$ is a commutative polynomial ring. Suppose that the representation $(G, V)$ satisfies the abstract Capelli condition: $(G, V)$ is an irreducible multiplicity-free representation such that the Weyl algebra $\Gamma\left(V, \mathcal{D}_V\right)^G$ is equal to the image of the center of the universal enveloping algebra of $\mathrm{Lie}(G)$ under the differential $\tau: \mathrm{Lie}(G) \longrightarrow \Gamma\left(V, \mathcal{D}_V\right)$ of the $G$-action. Let $\mathcal{A}$ be the quotient algebra of all $G'$-invariant differential operators by those vanishing on $G'$-invariant polynomials. The main aim of this paper is to prove that there is an equivalence of categories between the category of regular holonomic $\mathcal{D}_{\mathbb{P}\left( V\right)}$-modules on the complex projective space $\mathbb{P}\left( V\right) $ and the quotient category of finitely generated graded $\mathcal{A}$-modules modulo those supported by $\left\{ 0\right\} $. This result is a generalization of [12, Theorem 3.4] and of [13, Theorem 8]. As an application we give an algebraic/combinatorial classification of regular holonomic $\mathcal{D}_{\mathbb{P}\left( V\right) }$-modules on the projective space of skew-symmetric matrices.</description>

      <title>Matrix evaluations of noncommutative rational functions and Waring problems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.11564</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.11564v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Let $r$ be a nonconstant noncommutative rational function in $m$ variables over an algebraically closed field $K$ of characteristic 0. We show that for $n$ large enough, there exists an $X\in M_n(K)^m$ such that $r(X)$ has $n$ distinct and nonzero eigenvalues. This result is used to study the linear and multiplicative Waring problems for matrix algebras. Concerning the linear problem, we show that for $n$ large enough, every matrix in $sl_n(K)$ can be written as $r(Y)-r(Z)$ for some $Y,Z\in M_n(K)^m$. We also discuss variations of this result for the case where $r$ is a noncommutative polynomial. Concerning the multiplicative problem, we show, among other results, that if $f$ and $g$ are nonconstant polynomials, then, for $n$ large enough, every nonscalar matrix in $GL_n(K)$ can be written as $f(Y)g(Z)$ for some $Y,Z\in M_n(K)^m$.</description>

      <title>Cohomology of left-symmetric color algebras</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.04033</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.04033v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We develop a new cohomology theory for finite-dimensional left-symmetric color algebras and their finite-dimensional bimodules, establishing a connection between Lie color cohomology and left-symmetric color cohomology. We prove that the cohomology of a left-symmetric color algebra $A$ with coefficients in a bimodule $V$ can be computed by a lower degree cohomology of the corresponding Lie color algebra with coefficients in Hom$(A,V)$, generalizing a result of Dzhumadil'daev in right-symmetric cohomology. We also explore the varieties of two-dimensional and three-dimensional left-symmetric color algebras.</description>

      <title>Totally acyclic complexes and homological invariants</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.23277</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.23277v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we study equivalent characterizations of the condition that every acyclic complex of projective (resp., injective and flat) modules is totally acyclic over a general ring R. This line of inquiry was initiated by Iyengar and Krause in 2006 for commutative Noetherian rings with dualizing complexes. We demonstrate that certain equivalent conditions are closely related to the invariants silp(R) and spli(R) defined by Gedrich and Gruenberg, as well as to the invariant sfli(R) defined by Ding and Chen. We also examine some sufficient conditions for the equality spli(R) = silp(R). This improves a result by Ballas and Chatzistavridis that was originally proved in the case that R is a left (and right) coherent ring which is isomorphic with its opposite ring, and a result by Wang and Yang that was originally proved in the case that R is a commutative generalized coherent ring. Finally, we provide examples to illustrate relations among these conditions.</description>

      <title>On the computation of $\mathrm{Ext}_{\mathcal A}^{k,k+*}(\mathbb{Z}/2,\mathbb{Z}/2)$ for $k \leq 5$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.15611</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.15611v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This Note presents a computational algorithm for determining a basis of the cohomology of the mod 2 Steenrod algebra, $\mathrm{Ext}_{\mathcal A}^{k, k+*}(\mathbb{Z}/2, \mathbb{Z}/2)$ for $k \leq 5$, based on the well-known generators and the Adem relations given in Chen's work [2]. The purpose of this algorithm is to verify the hand-computed results for $\mathrm{Ext}_{\mathcal A}^{4, 4+*}(\mathbb{Z}/2, \mathbb{Z}/2)$ presented in our corrected papers [8, 9, 10]. Combining our most recent works [11, 12], the verification of the domain and the codomain of the fourth algebraic transfer in specific degrees can now be completed.</description>
