      <title>Rolling at right angles: magnetic anisotropy enables dual-anisotropic active matter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.05643</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.05643v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We report on an experimental active matter system with motion restricted to four cardinal directions. Our particles are magnetite-doped colloidal spheres driven by the Quincke electrorotational instability. The absence of a magnetic field $(|\mathbf{B}|=0)$ leads to circular trajectories interspersed with short spontaneous runs. Intermediate fields $(|\mathbf{B}|\lesssim 20~\text{mT})$ linearize the motion orthogonal to the field -- the axial mode. At high magnetic fields, we observe the surprising emergence of a second linearization parallel to the field -- the tumbling mode, distinct from the first orthogonal linearization. With numerical simulations, we show that this behavior can be explained by anisotropic magnetic susceptibility.</description>

      <title>Dynamics and rupture of doped Motility Induced Phase Peparation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.05768</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.05768v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Adding a small amount of passive (Brownian) particles to a two-dimensional dense suspension of repulsive active Brownian particles does not affect the appearance of a motility-induced phase separation into a dense and a dilute phase, caused by the persistence of the active particles' direction of motion. Unlike a purely active suspension, the dense slab formed in an elongated system of a passive-active mixture may show, over long periods of time, a stable and well-defined propagation of the interfaces, because of the symmetry breaking caused by the depletion of passive particles on one side of the slab. We investigate these dynamical structures via average density profile calculations, revealing an asymmetry between the two interfaces, and enabling a kinetic analysis of the slab movement. The apparent movement of the dense slab is not a pure source/sink effect, nor a rigid displacement of all the particles, but a self-sustained combination of both effects. Furthermore, we analyse the specific fluctuations that produce, cancel and abruptly reverse the slab motion.</description>

      <title>Unexpectedly large entropic barrier controls bond rearrangements in vitrimers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.05824</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.05824v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Vitrimers are a relatively new class of polymeric materials containing associative covalent dynamic bonds that make them recyclable by design. However, the fundamental mechanisms controlling their viscoelastic properties remain poorly understood. Our detailed studies of relaxation dynamics and viscoelastic behavior of model vitrimers revealed that the density of dynamic covalent crosslinks has no influence on chain dynamics (beyond a weak change in the glass transition temperature), yet it strongly affects the linear viscoelasticity of vitrimers. Increasing the crosslink density induces a sol-gel transition consistent with predictions of classical gelation theory, demonstrating its applicability to vitrimers. Remarkably, the temperature-dependent analysis of the bond rearrangement time reveals an unexpectedly large negative activation entropy in the transition state that strongly slows down the bond exchange process despite its relatively low activation enthalpy. This insight explains the unusual long timescale for bond rearrangement in vitrimers and highlights the significance of entropy in controlling the viscoelasticity of dynamic covalent networks.</description>

      <title>Fusion and Fission of Particle-like Chiral Nematic Vortex Knots</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.05841</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.05841v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Vortex knots have been seen decaying in many physical systems. Here we describe topologically protected vortex knots, which remain stable and undergo fusion and fission while conserving a topological invariant analogous to that of baryon number. While the host medium, a chiral nematic liquid crystal, exhibits intrinsic chirality, cores of the vortex lines are structurally achiral regions where twist cannot be defined. We refer to them as "dischiralation" vortex lines, in analogy to dislocations and disclinations in ordered media where, respectively, positional and orientational order is disrupted. Fusion and fission of these vortex knots, which we reversibly switch by electric pulses, vividly reveal the physical embodiments of knot theory's concepts like connected sums of knots. Our findings provide insights into related phenomena in fields ranging from cosmology to particle physics and can enable applications in electro-optics and photonics, where such fusion and fission processes can be used for controlling light.</description>

      <title>Active Particle Doping Suppresses Brittle Failure in Ultrastable Glasses</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.06260</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.06260v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Ultrastable glasses are known for their exceptional mechanical stability but often fail in a brittle manner, typically marked by the formation of shear bands when subjected to shear deformation. An open question is how shear banding is affected by active particles. Here, we address this issue by investigating ultrastable glasses that are doped with self-propelled particles (SPPs) that perform run-and-tumble motions. In the presence of active particles we find a crossover from heterogeneous to homogeneous yielding. Through extensive computer simulations of a polydisperse model, which is capable of producing ultrastable glasses using swap Monte Carlo Methods, we demonstrate the progressive emergence of multiple shear bands under activity, leading to continuous and delayed yielding. Interestingly, we uncover a compensatory relationship between active forces and global shear rates: a rise in one can offset a decline in the other, arising from the isomorphic-like behavior exhibited by different combinations of active forces and strain rates. We also identify a non-monotonic relationship between yielding and persistence time: while the yield stress increases at shorter persistence times with increasing active forces, it tends to decrease with longer persistence times. This observation highlights a tunable range of activity that can modify the yielding mode. Lastly, we show that the spacing between shear bands diminishes in a power law manner as the magnitude of the active force increases.</description>

      <title>Spontaneous Hole Formation in Cell Monolayers Emerges from Collective Cell Motion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.06461</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.06461v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Although cell monolayers typically remain confluent, they can spontaneously develop persistent holes as a result of collective cellular motion. Recent studies on MDCK monolayers cultured on soft substrates have revealed that cells can align to create regions of local nematic order, and topological defects that generate localised mechanical stresses which can spontaneously trigger hole formation. To investigate this process, we develop a continuum multi-phase field model that incorporates internal dissipation and active dipolar forces that drive cell shape anisotropy. Our simulations show that reducing substrate friction enhances cell-cell velocity correlations. In this low-friction regime, topological defects give rise to spiral flow patterns that concentrate stress and can trigger hole formation. We further demonstrate that the number and stability of the holes, whether they close or persist, depends on both substrate friction and cellular activity. These findings underscore the critical role of collective cell dynamics in maintaining tissue integrity.</description>

      <title>Light-Addressable Smart Nanostructures via Resonant Nanoheating</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.06215</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.06215v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Selective spatial control of chemical reactions at the level of individual nanostructures remains a significant challenge. We introduce a light-activated system that combines plasmonic gold nanorods with a poly(N-isopropylacrylamide) monolayer to gate surface reactivity based on each rod's geometry under optical illumination. Laser excitation tuned to a rod's plasmon resonance and polarization collapses the polymer into a compact shell on that rod, blocking reactive head groups and creating a long-lived, kinetically trapped inert state stable for days. During this interval, orthogonal chemical transformations can be performed on adjacent, unilluminated rods without interference. Subsequent diffusion-limited rehydration restores the swollen brush conformation and renews surface activity, effectively erasing the chemical memory. Numerical simulations based on real nanorod geometries confirm that switching selectivity follows the rods' absorption profiles. This mask-free, fully reversible strategy turns passive polymer films into dynamic chemical interfaces, offering a route to high-resolution patterning and on-demand control of nanoscale reactions for electronic and sensing applications.</description>

      <title>Micellization in active matter of asymmetric self-propelled particles: Experiments</title>

      <description>arXiv:2305.16659v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Active matter composed of self-propelled particles features fascinating self-organization phenomena, spanning from motility-induced phase separation to phototaxis to topological excitations depending on the nature and parameters of the system. In the present paper, we consider micelle formation by active particles with a broken symmetry having a circular back and a sharpened nose toward which the particles accelerate. As we demonstrate in experiments with robotic swarms, such particles can either remain in the isotropic phase or form micelles depending on the location of their center of inertia, in accordance with a recent theoretical proposal [T. Kruglov and A. Borisov, Presentations and Videos to 7th Edition of the International Conference on Particle-based Methods (2021), Vol. CT07, p. 2]. Such a behavior is observed for both nonchiral particles moving linearly and placed in a parabolic potential and for chiral particles moving along circular trajectories on a flat surface. By performing experiments with single robots and two-robot collisions, we unveil that the observed emergence of micellization associated with shifting robots' center of inertia towards their noses is governed by at least two-particle effects, in particular, by a difference in the formation of stable two-robot clusters. Finally, we consider the dependence of micelle lifetime and formation probability as well as two-robot collisions on friction between the lateral surfaces of the robots. Crucially, the predicted micellization does not involve any solvation shells that give rise to the micellization of surfactants but is instead driven by an interplay of activity and particle shape asymmetry.</description>

      <title>Simulations of dielectric permittivity of water by Machine Learned Potentials with long-range Coulombic interactions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2508.04628v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The dielectric permittivity of liquid water is a fundamental property that underlies its distinctive behaviors in numerious physical, biological, and chemical processes. Within a machine learning framework, we present a unified approach to compute the dielectric permittivity of water, systematically incorporating various electric boundary conditions. Our method employs a long-range-inclusive deep potential trained on data from hybrid density functional theory calculations. Dielectric response is evaluated using an auxiliary deep neural network that predicts the centers of maximally localized Wannier functions. We investigate three types of electric boundary conditions--metallic, insulating, and Kirkwood-Frohlich--to assess their influence on correlated dipole fluctuations and dielectric relaxation dynamics. In particular, we demonstrate a consistent methodology for computing the Kirkwood correlation factor, correlation length, and dielectric permittivity under each boundary condition, where long-range electrostatics play a critical role. This work establishes a robust and generalizable machine-learning framework for modeling the dielectric properties of polar liquids under diverse electrostatic environments.</description>

      <title>Hydrodynamics without Boost-Invariance from Kinetic Theory: From Perfect Fluids to Active Flocks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.00025</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.00025v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We derive the hydrodynamic equations of perfect fluids without boost invariance [1] from kinetic theory. Our approach is to follow the standard derivation of the Vlasov hierarchy based on an a-priori unknown collision functional satisfying certain axiomatic properties consistent with the absence of boost invariance. The kinetic theory treatment allows us to identify various transport coefficients in the hydrodynamic regime. We identify a drift term that effects a relaxation to an equilibrium where detailed balance with the environment with respect to momentum transfer is obtained. We then show how the derivative expansion of the hydrodynamics of flocks can be recovered from boost non-invariant kinetic theory and hydrodynamics. We identify how various coefficients of the former relate to a parameterization of the so-called equation of kinetic state that yields relations between different coefficients, arriving at a symmetry-based understanding as to why certain coefficients in hydrodynamic descriptions of active flocks are naturally of order one, and others, naturally small. When inter-particle forces are expressed in terms of a kinetic theory influence kernel, a coarse-graining scale and resulting derivative expansion emerge in the hydrodynamic limit, allowing us to derive diffusion terms as infrared-relevant operators distilling different parameterizations of microscopic interactions. We conclude by highlighting possible applications.</description>

      <title>Traction and Stress Control Formation and Motion of +1/2 Topological Defects in Epithelial Cell Monolayers</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.04827v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In confluent cell monolayers, patterns of cell forces and motion are systematically altered near topological defects in cell shape. In turn, defects have been proposed to alter cell density, extrusion, and invasion, but it remains unclear how the defects form and how they affect cell forces and motion. Here, we studied +1/2 defects, and, in contrast to prior studies, we observed the concurrent occurrence of both tail-to-head and head-to-tail defect motion in the same cell monolayer. We quantified the cell velocities, the tractions at the cell-substrate interface, and the stresses within the cell layer near +1/2 defects. Results revealed that both traction and stress are sources of activity and dissipation within the epithelial cell monolayer, with the direction of motion of +1/2 defects depending on whether energy is injected by stresses or tractions. Interestingly, patterns of motion, traction, stress, and energy injection near +1/2 defects existed before defect formation, suggesting that defects form as a result of spatially coordinated patterns in cell forces and motion. These findings introduce a new focus, on coordinated patterns of force and motion that lead to defect formation and motion.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.05560v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Graphs provide a powerful framework for modeling complex systems, but their structural variability poses significant challenges for analysis and classification. To address these challenges, we introduce GAUDI (Graph Autoencoder Uncovering Descriptive Information), a novel unsupervised geometric deep learning framework designed to capture both local details and global structure. GAUDI employs an innovative hourglass architecture with hierarchical pooling and upsampling layers linked through skip connections, which preserve essential connectivity information throughout the encoding-decoding process. Even though identical or highly similar underlying parameters describing a system's state can lead to significant variability in graph realizations, GAUDI consistently maps them into nearby regions of a structured and continuous latent space, effectively disentangling invariant process-level features from stochastic noise. We demonstrate GAUDI's versatility across multiple applications, including small-world networks modeling, characterization of protein assemblies from super-resolution microscopy, analysis of collective motion in the Vicsek model, and identification of age-related changes in brain connectivity. Comparison with related approaches highlights GAUDI's superior performance in analyzing complex graphs, providing new insights into emergent phenomena across diverse scientific domains.</description>

      <title>Equilibrium Propagation for Dissipative Dynamics</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.20402v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Computing gradients of a cost function is central to design-based optimization and machine learning algorithms. Equilibrium propagation provides an exact method to compute gradients in hardware by exploiting the inherent physical laws. The locality of these algorithms, in conjunction with local updates, enables mechanical and electronic systems that autonomously learn a function. We extend these methods to damped dynamical systems operating in the linear regime, such as mechanical structures obeying damped Newtonian dynamics and RLC circuits. By introducing an effective action whose extremum corresponds to the underlying dynamics, we derive local learning rules. This approach applies both to problems with periodic boundary conditions and to those with resting initial conditions. We demonstrate the viability of our method in mechanical and electronic systems and explore novel functionality such as classifying temporal sound signals. Our work opens the door to intelligent materials that process dynamical signals, enabling temporal computations, passive and active sensors, and materials that act as frequency-dependent filters.</description>
