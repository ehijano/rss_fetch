      <title>Physics-Based Decline Curve Analysis and Machine Learning for Temperature Forecasting in Enhanced Geothermal Systems: Utah FORGE</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.03283</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.03283v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Reliable temperature forecasting in Enhanced Geothermal Systems (EGS) is essential, yet petroleum-based decline curves and many machine-learning surrogates do not enforce geothermal heat transfer, while thermo-hydro-mechanical (THM) simulation remains computationally expensive. This study proposes a physics-consistent framework that advances both decline-curve analysis and surrogate modeling. The classical Arps decline family is generalized for geothermal use by introducing an equilibrium-temperature term motivated by Newton-type cooling, ensuring finite late-time temperature limits while reducing exactly to the conventional Arps forms when the equilibrium term is set to zero. The extended decline curves are validated against Utah FORGE downhole temperature measurements and then used to construct learning surrogates on a controlled THM dataset spanning fracture count, well spacing, fracture spacing, host-rock thermal conductivity, and circulation rate. An equation-informed neural network embeds the modified decline equations as differentiable internal computational layers to produce full 0-60 month temperature trajectories from design and operational inputs. A probabilistic Gaussian Process Regression surrogate is also developed for direct multi-horizon forecasting with calibrated uncertainty, while a direct XGBoost regression baseline provides a purely data-driven reference. Across the simulation dataset, the extended decline models reproduce temperature trajectories with near-perfect fidelity (median RMSE = 0.071 {\deg}C), and the equation-informed network achieves typical hold-out errors of MAE = 3.06 {\deg}C and RMSE = 4.49 {\deg}C. The Gaussian Process surrogate delivers the strongest predictive accuracy across 3-60 month horizons (RMSE = 3.39 {\deg}C; MAE = 2.34 {\deg}C) with well-calibrated uncertainty, whereas the XGBoost baseline exhibits higher errors.</description>

      <title>A disease-spread model on hypergraphs with distinct droplet and aerosol transmission modes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.03563</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.03563v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We examine the spread of an infectious disease, such as one that is caused by a respiratory virus, with two distinct modes of transmission. To do this, we consider a susceptible--infected--susceptible (SIS) disease on a hypergraph, which allows us to incorporate the effects of both dyadic (i.e., pairwise) and polyadic (i.e., group) interactions on disease propagation. This disease can spread either via large droplets through direct social contacts, which we associate with edges (i.e., hyperedges of size 2), or via infected aerosols in the environment through hyperedges of size at least 3 (i.e., polyadic interactions). We derive mean-field approximations of our model for two types of hypergraphs, and we obtain threshold conditions that characterize whether the disease dies out or becomes endemic. Additionally, we numerically simulate our model and a mean-field approximation of it to examine the impact of various factors, such as hyperedge size (when the size is uniform), hyperedge-size distribution (when the sizes are nonuniform), and hyperedge-recovery rates (when the sizes are nonuniform) on the disease dynamics.</description>

      <title>Convergence criteria for self-consistent measures in bipartite networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.04030</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.04030v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Many quantities that characterize network elements are defined in an explicit form and calculated directly from the network structure; examples of include several centrality measures like degree, closeness, or betweenness. However, there are also implicitly defined quantitative measures, which are usually calculated iteratively, in a self-consistent manner, like PageRank or countries' fitness / products' complexity relations. The iteration algorithms involve calculations over the entire network; therefore, their convergence properties depend on the structure of the network. Here, we focus on investigating self-consistently defined quantities in bipartite networks of two sets of nodes where the quantities in one set are determined by the quantities in the other set and vice versa. We derive an explicit convergence criterion for iterations of these quantities and describe two different approaches to improve the convergence properties. In the first one, we identify "problematic nodes" that can be removed or merged while in the second one, we introduce a regularization scheme and show how to estimate the regularization parameter.</description>

      <title>Multi-Dimensional Opinion Formation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.04074</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.04074v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper we propose and investigate a multi-dimensional opinion dynamics model where people are characterised by both opinions and importance weights across these opinions. Opinion changes occur through binary interactions, with a novel coupling mechanism: the change in one topic depends on the weighted similarity across the full opinion vector. We state the kinetic equation for this process and derive its mean-field partial differential equation to describe the overall dynamics. Analytical computations and numerical simulations confirm that this model generates complex stationary states, and we demonstrate that the final opinion structures are critically determined by the peoples' opinion weights.</description>

      <title>Bridging the Linear-Quadratic Gap: A Quantum-Classical Hybrid Approach to Robust Supply Chain Design</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.04095</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.04095v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The design of supply chain networks in densely populated urban logistics systems faces a timely dilemma: the traditional optimisation approaches are effective to maximise the level of demand perfusion, but they are limited to embracing large expenses in overlapping the facilities and cannibalisation in the market. When tested on a high-fidelity digital twin of the Delhi NCR road network of thirty candidate sites, we establish that Classical Greedy algorithms using the theoretical maximum demand of (473 units) lack any theoretical overlap penalty, but incur a prohibitive overlap penalty (5.08). Here, in comparison, the Quantum-Inspired solution only losses 3.2% of demand (450 compared to 465 units relative to the optimal solution), but the solution preserves 21.8% less operational overlap risk (3.26 compared to 4.17), which can be viewed as a 35.8% improvement compared to the Greedy solution. Geospatial analysis shows that it can be attributed to a shift in strategies: This, in contrast to Classical approaches, which focus on locating facilities in the high-density central areas (North/Central Delhi), the quantum-inspired solver autonomously chooses the diversified topology of the North-south network, penetrating into the underserved periphery growth markets. This is a spatially balanced arrangement which is congruent to the polycentric structure of modern time megacities, and displays better stability to volatility in demand. We have shown that quantum-inspired optimisation methods can close the so-called Linear-Quadratic Gap phenomenon, i.e. the systematic inability of greedy methods to capture the actual quadratic interactions between facilities, and offer a way of computing the pathway to operationally robust and risk-optimised supply chain networks in dense urban conditions.</description>

      <title>Integrated strong reciprocity enables productive punishment and protective defection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.03681</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.03681v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Cooperation in large groups and one-shot interactions is often hindered by freeloading. Punishment can enforce cooperation, but it is usually regarded as wasteful because the costs of punishing offset its benefits. Here, we analyze an evolutionary game model that integrates upstream and downstream reciprocity with costly punishment: integrated strong reciprocity (ISR). We demonstrate that ISR admits a stable mixed equilibrium of ISR and unconditional defection (ALLD), and that costly punishment can become productive: When sufficiently efficient, it raises collective welfare above the no-punishment baseline. ALLD players persist as evolutionary shields, preventing invasion by unconditional cooperation (ALLC) or alternative conditional strategies (e.g., antisocial punishment). At the same time, the mixed equilibrium of ISR and ALLD remains robust under modest complexity costs that destabilize other symmetric cooperative systems.</description>

      <title>Minimal branching and fusion morphogenesis approaches biological multi-objective optimality</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.03877</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.03877v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Many biological networks grow by elongation of filaments that can branch and fuse -- typical examples include fungal mycelium or slime mold. These networks must simultaneously perform multiple tasks such as transport, exploration, and robustness under finite resources. Yet, how such multi-task architectures emerge from local growth processes remains poorly understood. Here, we introduce a minimal model of spatial network morphogenesis based solely on stochastic branching, fusion, and stopping, during elongation. Despite the absence of global optimization or feedback, the model generates a broad morphospace from tree-like, to loopy, as well as hybrid architectures. By quantifying multiple functional objectives, we show that (i) these synthetic structures occupy similar regions of performance space than evolved empirical fungal networks, and (ii) that their Pareto front of optimal trade-offs lies close to that of these same fungal networks. Our results show that biological architectures approaching multi-objective optimality can arise from simple local growth rules, and identify branching and fusion as fundamental ingredients shaping the architecture of living transport networks.</description>

      <title>Mapping Regional Disparities in Discounted Grocery Products</title>

      <description>arXiv:2510.27493v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Food waste represents a major challenge to global climate resilience, accounting for almost 10% of annual greenhouse gas emissions. The retail sector is a critical player, mediating product flows between producers and consumers, where supply chain inefficiencies can shape which items are put on sale. Yet how these dynamics vary across geographic contexts remains largely unexplored. Here, we analyze data from Denmark's largest retail group on near-expiry products put on sale. We uncover the geospatial variations using a dual-clustering approach. We characterize multi-scale spatial relationships in retail organization by correlating store clustering -- measured using shortest-path distances along the street network -- with product clustering based on promotion co-occurrence patterns. Using a bipartite network approach, we identify three regional store clusters, and use percolation thresholds to corroborate the scale of their spatial separation. We find that stores in rural communities put meat and dairy products on sale up to 2.2 times more frequently than metropolitan areas. In contrast, metropolitan and capital regions lean toward convenience products, which have more balanced nutritional profiles but less favorable environmental impacts. By linking geographic context to retail inventory, we provide evidence that reducing food waste requires interventions tailored to local retail dynamics, highlighting the importance of region-specific sustainability strategies.</description>

      <title>Towards a Generalized Theory of Observers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.16225</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.16225v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We propose a formal framework for understanding and unifying the concept of observers across physics, computer science, philosophy, and related fields. Building on cybernetic feedback models, we introduce an operational definition of minimal observers, explore their role in shaping foundational concepts, and identify what remains unspecified in their absence. Drawing upon insights from quantum gravity, digital physics, second-order cybernetics, and recent ruliological and pregeometric approaches, we argue that observers serve as indispensable reference points for measurement, reference frames, and the emergence of meaning. We show how this formalism sheds new light on debates related to consciousness, quantum measurement, and computational boundaries; by way of theorems on observer equivalences and complexity measures. This perspective opens new avenues for investigating how complexity and structure arise in both natural and artificial systems.</description>
