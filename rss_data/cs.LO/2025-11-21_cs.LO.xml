      <title>Synthesis of Safety Specifications for Probabilistic Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.16579</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.16579v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Ensuring that agents satisfy safety specifications can be crucial in safety-critical environments. While methods exist for controller synthesis with safe temporal specifications, most existing methods restrict safe temporal specifications to probabilistic-avoidance constraints. Formal methods typically offer more expressive ways to express safety in probabilistic systems, such as Probabilistic Computation Tree Logic (PCTL) formulas. Thus, in this paper, we develop a new approach that supports more general temporal properties expressed in PCTL. Our contribution is twofold. First, we develop a theoretical framework for the Synthesis of safe-PCTL specifications. We show how the reducing global specification satisfaction to local constraints, and define CPCTL, a fragment of safe-PCTL. We demonstrate how the expressiveness of CPCTL makes it a relevant fragment for the Synthesis Problem. Second, we leverage these results and propose a new Value Iteration-based algorithm to solve the synthesis problem for these more general temporal properties, and we prove the soundness and completeness of our method.</description>

      <title>Faster Certified Symmetry Breaking Using Orders With Auxiliary Variables</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.16637</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.16637v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Symmetry breaking is a crucial technique in modern combinatorial solving, but it is difficult to be sure it is implemented correctly. The most successful approach to deal with bugs is to make solvers certifying, so that they output not just a solution, but also a mathematical proof of correctness in a standard format, which can then be checked by a formally verified checker. This requires justifying symmetry reasoning within the proof, but developing efficient methods for this has remained a long-standing open challenge. A fully general approach was recently proposed by Bogaerts et al. (2023), but it relies on encoding lexicographic orders with big integers, which quickly becomes infeasible for large symmetries. In this work, we develop a method for instead encoding orders with auxiliary variables. We show that this leads to orders-of-magnitude speed-ups in both theory and practice by running experiments on proof logging and checking for SAT symmetry breaking using the state-of-the-art satsuma symmetry breaker and the VeriPB proof checking toolchain.</description>

      <title>Formal Abductive Latent Explanations for Prototype-Based Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.16588</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.16588v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Case-based reasoning networks are machine-learning models that make predictions based on similarity between the input and prototypical parts of training samples, called prototypes. Such models are able to explain each decision by pointing to the prototypes that contributed the most to the final outcome. As the explanation is a core part of the prediction, they are often qualified as ``interpretable by design". While promising, we show that such explanations are sometimes misleading, which hampers their usefulness in safety-critical contexts. In particular, several instances may lead to different predictions and yet have the same explanation. Drawing inspiration from the field of formal eXplainable AI (FXAI), we propose Abductive Latent Explanations (ALEs), a formalism to express sufficient conditions on the intermediate (latent) representation of the instance that imply the prediction. Our approach combines the inherent interpretability of case-based reasoning models and the guarantees provided by formal XAI. We propose a solver-free and scalable algorithm for generating ALEs based on three distinct paradigms, compare them, and present the feasibility of our approach on diverse datasets for both standard and fine-grained image classification.

      <title>Type Isomorphisms for Multiplicative-Additive Linear Logic</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.11987</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.11987v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We characterize type isomorphisms in the multiplicative-additive fragment of linear logic (MALL), and thus in *-autonomous categories with finite products, extending a result for the multiplicative fragment by Balat and Di Cosmo. This yields a much richer equational theory involving distributivity and cancellation laws. The unit-free case is obtained by relying on the proof-net syntax introduced by Hughes and Van Glabbeek. We use the sequent calculus to extend our results to full MALL, including all units, thanks to a study of cut-elimination and rule commutations.</description>

      <title>Commutative N-polyregular functions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.02232</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.02232v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper studies which functions computed by $\mathbb{Z}$-weighted automata can be realized by $\mathbb{N}$-weighted automata, under two extra assumptions: commutativity (the order of letters in the input does not matter) and polynomial growth (the output of the function is bounded by a polynomial in the size of the input). We leverage this effective characterization to decide whether a function computed by a commutative $\mathbb{N}$-weighted automaton of polynomial growth is star-free, a notion borrowed from the theory of regular languages that has been the subject of many investigations in the context of string-to-string functions during the last decade. Furthermore, we open the road to a generalization of our results to non-commutative functions, by formalizing a canonical computational model for $\mathbb{N}$-weighted automata of polynomial growth based on the notion of residual transducer.</description>

      <title>Tropical Mathematics and the Lambda-Calculus II: Tropical Geometry of Probabilistic Programming Languages</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.15637</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.15637v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In the last few years there has been a growing interest towards methods for statistical inference and learning based on computational geometry and, notably, tropical geometry, that is, the study of algebraic varieties over the min-plus semiring. At the same time, recent work has demonstrated the possibility of interpreting higher-order probabilistic programming languages in the framework of tropical mathematics, by exploiting algebraic and categorical tools coming from the semantics of linear logic. In this work we combine these two worlds, showing that tools and ideas from tropical geometry can be used to perform statistical inference over higher-order probabilistic programs. Notably, we first show that each such program can be associated with a degree and a n-dimensional polyhedron that encode its most likely runs. Then, we use these tools in order to design an intersection type system that estimates most likely runs in a compositional and efficient way.</description>

      <title>On the consistency of stronger lower bounds for NEXP</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.03320</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.03320v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: It was recently shown by Atserias, Buss and Mueller that the standard complexity-theoretic conjecture NEXP not in P / poly is consistent with the relatively strong bounded arithmetic theory V^0_2, which can prove a substantial part of complexity theory. We observe that their approach can be extended to show that the stronger conjectures NEXP not in EXP / poly and NEXP not in coNEXP are consistent with a stronger theory, which includes every true universal number-sort sentence.</description>
