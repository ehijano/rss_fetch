      <title>Kirchhoff`s Forgotten Contributions to Electromagnetism: Continuity Equation versus Displacement Currents</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.05997</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.05997v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In 1857, Kirchhoff published two seminal papers on the motion of electricity in wires. In that work, he was the first to derive what we now call the telegrapher`s equations, which describes the propagation of electromagnetic signals along a cable at the speed of light, in some conditions. How was Kirchhoff able to describe electromagnetic propagation as early as 1857, when the notion of displacement current which is believed to be the essential ingredient for the propagation of electric and magnetic fields was not introduced by Maxwell until 1861 and fully explained later in 1865? In this paper, we show that Kirchhoff was the first, in his 1857 paper, to introduce the continuity equation when discussing electromagnetic propagation. We argue that the continuity equation used by Kirchhoff is a more fundamental concept now as it was in 1865 than displacement current. In our view, the dynamics of charged particles can be formulated without invoking fields, but the dynamics of fields cannot be formulated without a continuity equation describing the properties of matter.</description>

      <title>The Fine-Structure Constant as a Scaled Quantity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.07027</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.07027v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The fine-structure constant alpha approximately 1/137 is traditionally regarded as a fundamental dimensionless parameter. I argue instead that alpha is a scaled quantity that arises only where the structural scales contributed by classical electromagnetism (e), quantum mechanics (h-bar), and special relativity (c) intersect. None of these theories, taken individually, supplies the independent scales required to define alpha. The constant first appears when relativistic corrections are added to the Schrodinger-Bohr description of hydrogen (Sommerfeld), and it becomes the structural coupling in quantum electrodynamics, where quantum and relativistic effects modify the classical electromagnetic interaction. Expressing the governing laws in canonical form reveals this dependence and eliminates representational artifacts that make alpha appear fundamental. The running of alpha in QED further demonstrates its status as a scale-dependent coupling rather than a universal constant. I conclude that alpha is a domain-specific structural ratio reflecting contingent relationships among independent physical scales.</description>

      <title>Tractatus Quanticum</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.06034</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.06034v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This is a re-editing, which takes quantum mechanics into account, of Wittgenstein's famous Tractatus. The operation has a playful side in the form, but is a serious attempt to capture possible philosophical implications of the Relational Interpretation of Quantum Mechanics, and formalize the naturalistic third-way between realism and instrumentalism explored by this interpretation.</description>

      <title>Wigner's Frame</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.07101</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.07101v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This article suggests that thinking about the role of reference frames can provide new insight into Extended Wigner's Friend scenarios. This involves appealing to symmetries to make a principled distinction between properties of a system which are meaningful only relative to an external reference system and properties which are meaningful without further relativization. Thus we may propose that there are always well-defined facts about what observers have observed, but there are not necessarily well-defined facts about the relations between their reference frames, so there will not always exist a joint distribution over their outcomes which can meaningfully be compared to the predictions of quantum mechanics. In addition, this approach also offers a general argument against the idea that there should be a regress of relativization.</description>
