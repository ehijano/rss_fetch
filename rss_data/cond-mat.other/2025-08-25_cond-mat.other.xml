      <title>Modeling Energy- and Momentum-dependent Scattering Relaxation Times in a Semi-Classical Model of Charge Transport using the Self-Scattering Technique</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.15927</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.15927v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Improvement of numerical methods for calculating charge transport quantities of materials from the Boltzmann transport equation (BTE) is important for prediction of material properties. In particular, techniques which allow for more accurate models of scattering rates and band structures while remaining less computationally involved are valuable. The self-scattering technique is one such technique for implementing energy- and momentum-dependent scattering relaxation times in Monte Carlo simulations of charge transport or iterative techniques for solving the BTE. While the technique initially uses a constant relaxation time in the simulation algorithm, we found, upon analysis of the technique, that the energy and momentum total scattering relaxation time may be recovered. To show this, we preformed self-scattering Monte Carlo simulations of electron transport for both energy-dependent and independent relaxation times. The relaxation times and the fraction of scattering type selected in the simulation matched the full rates implemented in the simulation. In order to understand these results, we developed the theory behind the technique, demonstrating that the probability distribution function of free-flight times created using the self-scattering algorithm produces the analytical probability distribution function expression generated by full energy, momentum and time dependent relaxation times and probabilities. However, certain forms of relaxation times may cause the simulation to fail, depending on implementation. Clarity about such techniques is important for improvement of charge transport simulation models and implementation of ab initio scattering rates and band structures.</description>

      <title>Nonlinear Optical Spectroscopy of Nodal-Line Semimetals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.16494</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.16494v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Intense laser-driven nonlinear optical phenomena in two-dimensional (2D) nodal-line semimetals (NLS) exhibit complex mechanisms, particularly in the NbSi$_{x}$Te$_{2}$ material systems characterized by nonsymmorphic symmetry-protected band degeneracy. Our findings reveal how nonsymmorphic symmetry-protected band degeneracy fundamentally influences the material's nonlienar optical responses. Notably, the nonsymmorphic glide-mirror symmetry leads to the exclusive generation of odd-order harmonics from inversion-symmetry-broken NLS. Moreover, harmonics are emitted parallel and perpendicular to the driving laser's polarization. We demonstrate distinct generation mechanisms arise from intrachain and interchain processes, with their relative contributions varying significantly with the polarization of the driving laser pulse. The polarization-dependence exhibits two-fold anisotropy, with each harmonic order showing characteristic angular distributions of maximum yield. Additionally, our analysis of the ellipticity-dependence reveals an intricate interplay between interband and intraband mechanisms. These insights open new possibilities for controlling harmonic generation through precise tuning parameters of the driving laser and highlight the potentials of NLS materials to fabricate lightwave-based photonics, optoelectronic and quantum devices operating on ultrafast timescales.</description>

      <title>Hyperbolic Spin Liquids</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.09601</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.09601v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Hyperbolic lattices present a unique opportunity to venture beyond the conventional paradigm of crystalline many-body physics and explore correlated phenomena in negatively curved space. As a theoretical benchmark for such investigations, we extend Kitaev's spin-1/2 honeycomb model to hyperbolic lattices and exploit their non-Euclidean space-group symmetries to solve the model exactly. We elucidate the ground-state phase diagram on the $\{8,3\}$ lattice and find a gapped $\mathbb{Z}_2$ spin liquid with Abelian anyons, a gapped chiral spin liquid with non-Abelian anyons and chiral edge states, and a Majorana metal whose finite low-energy density of states is dominated by non-Abelian Bloch states.</description>

      <title>Unified Magnetoelectric Mechanism for Spin Splitting in Magnets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.22227</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.22227v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We identify a magnetoelectric correction that completes the theoretical description of spin splitting (SS) in magnetic systems. Derived from the Dirac equation, this term couples local magnetic moments to the scalar electric potential, providing a third fundamental mechanism, alongside Zeeman and spin-orbit coupling (SOC), that governs SS in ferromagnets, antiferromagnets, and altermagnets. In compensated magnets, the proposed relativistic correction depends on the difference in electric potential between symmetry-inequivalent motifs, $\mathcal{H}_{\text{ME}} = -\mu_{\text{B}}\eta_0(\mathcal{V}_1 - \mathcal{V}_2)\boldsymbol{\sigma} \cdot \boldsymbol{m}$, which explains how finite SS emerges in the absence of SOC and enables a complete classification of momentum dependence and motif connectivity across all 32 point groups. Through illustrative examples, we show that distinct SS behaviors - quadratic ($d$-wave altermagnets), linear ($p$-wave altermagnets or spin Zeeman effect), and $k$-independent (SS at $\Gamma$ or fully compensated ferrimagnets) - are specific manifestations of the proposed magnetoelectric relativistic mechanism, each governed by electric quadrupoles, dipoles, or monopoles, respectively. The formalism naturally extends to higher-order multipoles and more complex symmetries. This work establishes a unified framework for SS in magnets and provides a predictive tool for analyzing symmetry-allowed SS in magnetic materials.</description>
