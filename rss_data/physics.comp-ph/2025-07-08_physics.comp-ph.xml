      <title>A family of conservative axisymmetric contact SPH schemes for impact engineering applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.05927</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.05927v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A family of conservative schemes for the axisymmetric contact smoothed particle hydrodynamics (CSPH) method, which ensure the accuracy and stability in modeling of complex multi-material flows of compressible media, is introduced. Among these schemes, the most convenient ones are considered. Simulations with the proposed schemes may be also improved by embedding of MUSCL reconstruction into a numerical scheme, or by correcting the kernel gradient as was proposed earlier for the Cartesian case.
  Verification of the proposed method is performed on several test problems: Sod's cylindrical test, Taylor bar test, and Sedov's point explosion. The conservative properties of the scheme are demonstrated. Finally, a set of simulations on air shock wave weakening by a breakaway sand barrier is performed and compared to experimental results.</description>

      <title>Drag modelling for flows through assemblies of spherical particles with machine learning: A comparison of approaches</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.05983</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.05983v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Drag forces on particles in random assemblies can be accurately estimated through particle-resolved direct numerical simulations (PR-DNS). Despite its limited applicability to relatively small assemblies, data obtained from PR-DNS has been the driving force for the development of drag closures for much more affordable simulation frameworks, such as Eulerian-Lagrangian point particle methods. Recently, more effort has been invested in the development of deterministic drag models that account for the effect of the structure of the particle assembly. Current successful deterministic models are mainly black-box neural networks which: 1) Assume pairwise superposition of the neighbours' effect on the drag, and 2) Are trained on PR-DNS data for a wide range of particle concentrations and flow regimes. To alleviate the black-box nature of neural networks, we use genetic programming (GP) to develop interpretable models. In our previous research, this has been proven successful in the Stokes regime. In the current contribution, we extend the application of GP to higher particle Reynolds number regimes. This is done by training a graph neural network (GNN) on the PR-DNS data to learn the pairwise interactions among the particles that constitute the drag variation. The significance of the input features of the GNN is assessed via a feature permutation approach. Then, the estimated pairwise interactions as extracted from the GNN are fed to a GP algorithm, which searches for symbolic expressions that fit the input data. A comparison between the trained GNN model and the resulting symbolic expressions is presented, to assess whether the symbolic expression can capture the underlying patterns learnt by the GNN. The comparison demonstrates the potential of GP in finding relatively simple symbolic models. At the same time, the accuracy of the symbolic models slightly fall behind the GNN.</description>

      <title>Physics-Informed Graph Neural Networks to Reconstruct Local Fields Considering Finite Strain Hyperelasticity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.05291</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.05291v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose a physics-informed machine learning framework called P-DivGNN to reconstruct local stress fields at the micro-scale, in the context of multi-scale simulation given a periodic micro-structure mesh and mean, macro-scale, stress values. This method is based in representing a periodic micro-structure as a graph, combined with a message passing graph neural network. We are able to retrieve local stress field distributions, providing average stress values produced by a mean field reduced order model (ROM) or Finite Element (FE) simulation at the macro-scale. The prediction of local stress fields are of utmost importance considering fracture analysis or the definition of local fatigue criteria. Our model incorporates physical constraints during training to constraint local stress field equilibrium state and employs a periodic graph representation to enforce periodic boundary conditions. The benefits of the proposed physics-informed GNN are evaluated considering linear and non linear hyperelastic responses applied to varying geometries. In the non-linear hyperelastic case, the proposed method achieves significant computational speed-ups compared to FE simulation, making it particularly attractive for large-scale applications.</description>

      <title>MBFormer: A General Transformer-based Learning Paradigm for Many-body Interactions in Real Materials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.05480</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.05480v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recently, radical progress in machine learning (ML) has revolutionized computational materials science, enabling unprecedentedly rapid materials discovery and property prediction, but the quantum many-body problem -- which is the key to understanding excited-state properties, ranging from transport to optics -- remains challenging due to the complexity of the nonlocal and energy-dependent interactions. Here, we propose a symmetry-aware, grid-free, transformer-based model, MBFormer, that is designed to learn the entire many-body hierarchy directly from mean-field inputs, exploiting the attention mechanism to accurately capture many-body correlations between mean-field states. As proof of principle, we demonstrate the capability of MBFormer in predicting results based on the GW plus Bethe Salpeter equation (GW-BSE) formalism, including quasiparticle energies, exciton energies, exciton oscillator strengths, and exciton wavefunction distribution. Our model is trained on a dataset of 721 two-dimensional materials from the C2DB database, achieving state-of-the-art performance with a low prediction mean absolute error (MAE) on the order of 0.1-0.2 eV for state-level quasiparticle and exciton energies across different materials. Moreover, we show explicitly that the attention mechanism plays a crucial role in capturing many-body correlations. Our framework provides an end-to-end platform from ground states to general many-body prediction in real materials, which could serve as a foundation model for computational materials science.</description>

      <title>On void formation during the simulated tensile testing of polymer-filler particle composites</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.05547</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.05547v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We simulate a series of model polymer composites, composed of linear polymer strands and spherical, monodisperse filler particles (FP). These molecular dynamics simulations implement a coarse-grained, bead-spring force field and we vary several formulation parameters to study their respective influences on material properties. These parameters include FP radius, FP volume fraction, temperature, and the polymer-polymer, FP-FP, and polymer-FP interaction potentials. Uniaxial extension of the simulation cells allows direct comparison of mechanical reinforcement (or weakening) provided by the FP. We focus on the formation of microscopic voids during simulated tensile testing of glassy polymer composites and quantify how the characteristic spatial and morphological arrangement of these voids is a function of interaction potentials used in the simulation. We discuss the implications of these findings in the context of polymer composite design and formulation.</description>

      <title>MP-ALOE: An r2SCAN dataset for universal machine learning interatomic potentials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.05559</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.05559v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present MP-ALOE, a dataset of nearly 1 million DFT calculations using the accurate r2SCAN meta-generalized gradient approximation. Covering 89 elements, MP-ALOE was created using active learning and primarily consists of off-equilibrium structures. We benchmark a machine learning interatomic potential trained on MP-ALOE, and evaluate its performance on a series of benchmarks, including predicting the thermochemical properties of equilibrium structures; predicting forces of far-from-equilibrium structures; maintaining physical soundness under static extreme deformations; and molecular dynamic stability under extreme temperatures and pressures. MP-ALOE shows strong performance on all of these benchmarks, and is made public for the broader community to utilize.</description>

      <title>Uncovering coupled ionic-polaronic dynamics and interfacial enhancement in Li$_x$FePO$_4$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.05626</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.05626v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Understanding and controlling coupled ionic-polaronic dynamics is crucial for optimizing electrochemical performance in battery materials. However, studying such coupled dynamics remains challenging due to the intricate interplay between Li-ion configurations, polaron charge ordering, and lattice vibrations. Here, we develop a fine-tuned machine-learned force field (MLFF) for Li$_x$FePO$_4$ that captures coupled ion-polaron behavior. Our simulations reveal picosecond-scale polaron flips occurring orders of magnitude faster than Li-ion migration, featuring strong correlation to Li configurations. Notably, polaron charge fluctuations are further enhanced at Li-rich/Li-poor phase boundaries, suggesting a potential interfacial electronic conduction mechanism. These results demonstrate the capability of fine-tuned MLFFs to resolve complex coupled transport and provide insight into emergent ionic-polaronic dynamics in multivalent battery cathodes.</description>

      <title>Revisiting the configurations of hydrogen impurities in SrTiO3: Insights from first-principles local vibration mode calculations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.05752</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.05752v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The specific configurations of hydrogen impurities in SrTiO3 (STO) are still ambiguous. In this study, we systematically investigate the configurations and vibrational properties of hy-drogen impurities in cubic STO using first-principles local vibration mode calculations. Em-ploying the appropriate hybrid exchange correlation functional with the fraction of exact ex-change setting to 0.2, we revisit the interstitial hydrogen (Hi), Hi complexes (2Hi), and various intrinsic cation vacancy complexes with Hi, including VSr-Hi, VSr-2Hi, VTi-Hi, and VTi-2Hi. Comparison of the computed vibrational frequencies with experimental infrared absorption bands reveals that Hi, with a frequency of 3277 cm-1, is unlikely to account for the dominant absorption bands near 3500 cm-1. Instead, strontium vacancy complexes with interstitial hydro-gen (VSr-Hi and VSr-2Hi) exhibit vibrational frequencies that align with the main absorption bands, whereas titanium vacancy complex with two interstitial hydrogen (VTi-2Hi) corresponds to additional absorption bands around 3300 cm-1. These findings provide insights into the im-portance of hydrogen-related complexes in governing the electronic properties of STO, and meanwhile underscore the necessity of employing accurate exchange correlation functionals for reliable theoretical predictions of vibrational properties.</description>

      <title>evortran: a modern Fortran package for genetic algorithms with applications from LHC data fitting to LISA signal reconstruction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.06082</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.06082v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: evortran is a modern Fortran library designed for high-performance genetic algorithms and evolutionary optimization. evortran can be used to tackle a wide range of problems in high-energy physics and beyond, such as derivative-free parameter optimization, complex search taks, parameter scans and fitting experimental data under the presence of instrumental noise. The library is built as an fpm package with flexibility and efficiency in mind, while also offering a simple installation process, user interface and integration into existing Fortran programs. evortran offers a variety of selection, crossover, mutation and elitism strategies, with which users can tailor an evolutionary algorithm to their specific needs. evortran supports different abstraction levels: from operating directly on individuals and populations, to running full evolutionary cycles, and even enabling migration between independently evolving populations to enhance convergence and maintain diversity. In this paper, we present the functionality of the evortran library, demonstrate its capabilities with example benchmark applications, and compare its performance with existing genetic algorithm frameworks. As physics-motivated applications, we use evortran to confront extended Higgs sectors with LHC data and to reconstruct gravitational wave spectra and the underlying physical parameters from LISA mock data, demonstrating its effectiveness in realistic, data-driven scenarios.</description>

      <title>Reference compositions for bismuth telluride thermoelectric materials for low-temperature power generation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.06101</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.06101v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Thermoelectric (TE) technology enables direct heat-to-electricity conversion and is gaining attention as a clean, fuel-saving, and carbon-neutral solution for industrial, automotive, and marine applications. Despite nearly a century of research, apart from successes in deep-space power sources and solid-state cooling modules, the industrialization and commercialization of TE power generation remain limited. Since the new millennium, nanostructured bulk materials have accelerated the discovery of new TE systems. However, due to limited access to high-temperature heat sources, energy harvesting still relies almost exclusively on BiTe-based alloys, which are the only system operating stably near room temperature. Although many BiTe-based compositions have been proposed, concerns over reproducibility, reliability, and lifetime continue to hinder industrial adoption. Here, we aim to develop reference BiTe-based thermoelectric materials through data-driven analysis of Starrydata2, the world's largest thermoelectric database. We identify Bi0.46Sb1.54Te3 and Bi2Te2.7Se0.3 as the most frequently studied ternary compositions. These were synthesized using hot pressing and spark-plasma sintering. Thermoelectric properties were evaluated with respect to the processing method and measurement direction. The results align closely with the median of reported data, confirming the representativeness of the selected compositions. We propose these as reference BiTe materials, accompanied by transparent data and validated benchmarks. Their use can support the standardization of TE legs and modules while accelerating performance evaluation and industrial integration. We further estimated the performance of a thermoelectric module made from the reference composition, which gives the power output of over 2.51 W and an efficiency of 3.58% at a temperature difference of 120 K.</description>

      <title>Bridging Machine Learning and Glassy Dynamics Theory for Predictive Polymer Modeling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.06194</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.06194v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Understanding and predicting the glassy dynamics of polymers remain fundamental challenges in soft matter physics. While the Elastically Collective Nonlinear Langevin Equation (ECNLE) theory has been successful in describing relaxation dynamics, its practical application to polymers depends on a thermal mapping to connect theory with experiment, which in turn requires detailed thermodynamic data. Such data may not be available for chemically complex or newly designed polymers. In this work, we propose a simple approach that integrates machine learning-predicted glass transition temperatures (Tg) with a simplified thermal mapping based on an effective thermal expansion coefficient to overcome these limitations. This approach can provide quantitatively accurate predictions of relaxation dynamics across a broad range of polymers. Rather than replacing the original thermal mapping, our method complements it by trading formal rigor for computational efficiency and broader applicability in high-throughput screening and materials with limited available data. Moreover, we introduce a physically motivated modification to the thermal mapping that resolves discrepancies in the description of low-Tg polymers. Our results establish a generalizable approach for predictive modeling of glassy polymer dynamics and point toward new directions for theory-guided materials discovery.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.03163v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Algorithmic efficiency is essential to reducing energy and time usage for computational problems. Optimizing efficiency is important for tasks involving multiple resources, for example in stochastic calculations where the size of the random ensemble competes with the time-step. We define the complexity order of an algorithm needing multiple resources as the exponent of inverse total error with respect to the total resources used. The optimum order is predicted for independent, factorable resources. We show that it equals the inverse sum of the inverse resource orders. This is applied to computing averages in a stochastic differential equation. We treat numerical examples for multiple different algorithms and for stochastic partial differential equations, all giving quantitative results in excellent agreement with our more general analytic theory.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2301.10270v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Modern security proofs of quantum key distribution (QKD) must take finite-size effects and composable aspects into consideration. This is also the case for continuous-variable (CV) protocols which are based on the transmission and detection of bosonic coherent states. In this paper, we refine and advance the previous theory in this area providing a more rigorous formulation for the composable key rate of a generic CV-QKD protocol. Thanks to these theoretical refinements, our general formulas allow us to prove more optimistic key rates with respect to previous literature.</description>

      <title>Slip-dominated structural transitions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.04066v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We use molecular dynamics to show that plastic slip is a crucial component of the transformation mechanism of a square-to-triangular structural transition. The latter is a stylized analog of many other reconstructive phase transitions. To justify our conclusions we use a novel atomistically-informed mesoscopic representation of the field of lattice distortions in molecular dynamics simulations. Our approach reveals a hidden alternating slip distribution behind the seemingly homogeneous product phase which points to the fact that lattice invariant shears play a central role in this class of phase transformations. While the underlying pattern of anti-parallel displacements may be also interpreted as microscopic shuffling, its precise crystallographic nature strongly suggests the plasticity-centered interpretation.</description>

      <title>Optimal-rate error estimates and a twice decoupled solver for a backward Euler finite element scheme of the Doyle-Fuller-Newman model of lithium-ion cells</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.15722v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate the convergence of a backward Euler finite element discretization applied to a multi-domain and multi-scale elliptic-parabolic system, derived from the Doyle-Fuller-Newman model for lithium-ion cells. We establish optimal-order error estimates for the solution in the norms $l^2(H^1)$ and $l^2(L^2(H^q_r))$, $q=0,1$. To improve computational efficiency, we propose a novel solver that accelerates the solution process and controls memory usage. Numerical experiments with realistic battery parameters validate the theoretical error rates and demonstrate the significantly superior performance of the proposed solver over existing solvers.</description>

      <title>Scalable Discrete Diffusion Samplers: Combinatorial Optimization and Statistical Physics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.08696</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.08696v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Learning to sample from complex unnormalized distributions over discrete domains emerged as a promising research direction with applications in statistical physics, variational inference, and combinatorial optimization. Recent work has demonstrated the potential of diffusion models in this domain. However, existing methods face limitations in memory scaling and thus the number of attainable diffusion steps since they require backpropagation through the entire generative process. To overcome these limitations we introduce two novel training methods for discrete diffusion samplers, one grounded in the policy gradient theorem and the other one leveraging Self-Normalized Neural Importance Sampling (SN-NIS). These methods yield memory-efficient training and achieve state-of-the-art results in unsupervised combinatorial optimization. Numerous scientific applications additionally require the ability of unbiased sampling. We introduce adaptations of SN-NIS and Neural Markov Chain Monte Carlo that enable for the first time the application of discrete diffusion models to this problem. We validate our methods on Ising model benchmarks and find that they outperform popular autoregressive approaches. Our work opens new avenues for applying diffusion models to a wide range of scientific applications in discrete domains that were hitherto restricted to exact likelihood models.</description>

      <title>Efficient Implementation of Gaussian Process Regression Accelerated Saddle Point Searches with Application to Molecular Reactions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.12519</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.12519v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The task of locating first order saddle points on high-dimensional surfaces describing the variation of energy as a function of atomic coordinates is an essential step for identifying the mechanism and estimating the rate of thermally activated events within the harmonic approximation of transition state theory. When combined directly with electronic structure calculations, the number of energy and atomic force evaluations needed for convergence is a primary issue. Here, we describe an efficient implementation of Gaussian process regression (GPR) acceleration of the minimum mode following method where a dimer is used to estimate the lowest eigenmode of the Hessian. A surrogate energy surface is constructed and updated after each electronic structure calculation. The method is applied to a test set of 500 molecular reactions previously generated by Hermez and coworkers [J. Chem. Theory Comput. 18, 6974 (2022)]. An order of magnitude reduction in the number of electronic structure calculations needed to reach the saddle point configurations is obtained by using the GPR compared to the dimer method. Despite the wide range in stiffness of the molecular degrees of freedom, the calculations are carried out using Cartesian coordinates and are found to require similar number of electronic structure calculations as an elaborate internal coordinate method implemented in the Sella software package. The present implementation of the GPR surrogate model in C++ is efficient enough for the wall time of the saddle point searches to be reduced in 3 out of 4 cases even though the calculations are carried out at a low Hartree-Fock level.</description>

      <title>Information-theoretic machine learning for time-varying mode decomposition of separated aerodynamic flows</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.24132</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.24132v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We perform an information-theoretic mode decomposition for separated aerodynamic flows. The current data-driven approach based on a neural network referred to as deep sigmoidal flow enables the extraction of an informative component from a given flow field snapshot with respect to a target variable at a future time stamp, thereby capturing the causality as a time-varying modal structure. We consider four examples of separated flows around a wing, namely, 1. laminar periodic wake at post-stall angles of attack, strong gust-wing interactions of 2. numerical and 3. experimental measurements, and 4. a turbulent wake in a spanwise-periodic domain. The present approach reveals informative vortical structures associated with a time-varying lift response. For the periodic shedding cases, the informative structures vary in time corresponding to the fluctuation level from their mean values. With the examples of gust-wing interactions, how the effect of gust on a wing emerges in the lift response over time is identified in an interpretable manner. Furthermore, for the case of turbulent wake, the present model highlights structures near the wing and vortex cores as informative components based solely on the information metric without any prior knowledge of aerodynamics and length scales. This study provides causality-based insights into a range of unsteady aerodynamic problems.</description>

      <title>A general polynomial emulator for cosmology via moment projection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.02179</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.02179v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present MomentEmu, a general-purpose polynomial emulator for fast and interpretable mappings between theoretical parameters and observational features. The method constructs moment matrices to project simulation data onto polynomial bases, yielding symbolic expressions that approximate the target mapping. Compared to neural-network-based emulators, MomentEmu offers negligible training cost, millisecond-level evaluation, and transparent functional forms. As a demonstration, we develop two emulators: PolyCAMB-$D_\ell$, which maps six cosmological parameters to the CMB temperature power spectrum, and PolyCAMB-peak, which enables bidirectional mapping between parameters and acoustic peak features. PolyCAMB-$D_\ell$ achieves an accuracy of $0.03\%$over $\ell \leq 2510$, while PolyCAMB-peak also reaches sub-percent accuracy and produces symbolic forms consistent with known analytical approximations. The method is well suited for forward modelling, parameter inference, and uncertainty propagation, particularly when the parameter space is moderate in dimensionality and the mapping is smooth. MomentEmu offers a lightweight and portable alternative to regression-based or black-box emulators in cosmological analysis.</description>

      <title>A Novel Hybrid Grey Wolf Differential Evolution Algorithm</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.03022</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.03022v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Grey wolf optimizer (GWO) is a nature-inspired stochastic meta-heuristic of the swarm intelligence field that mimics the hunting behavior of grey wolves. Differential evolution (DE) is a popular stochastic algorithm of the evolutionary computation field that is well suited for global optimization. In this part, we introduce a new algorithm based on the hybridization of GWO and two DE variants, namely the GWO-DE algorithm. We evaluate the new algorithm by applying various numerical benchmark functions. The numerical results of the comparative study are quite satisfactory in terms of performance and solution quality.</description>

      <title>A COMPASS to Model Comparison and Simulation-Based Inference in Galactic Chemical Evolution</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.05060</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.05060v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present COMPASS, a novel simulation-based inference framework that combines score-based diffusion models with transformer architectures to jointly perform parameter estimation and Bayesian model comparison across competing Galactic Chemical Evolution (GCE) models. COMPASS handles high-dimensional, incomplete, and variable-size stellar abundance datasets. Applied to high-precision elemental abundance measurements, COMPASS evaluates 40 combinations of nucleosynthetic yield tables. The model strongly favours Asymptotic Giant Branch yields from NuGrid and core-collapse SN yields used in the IllustrisTNG simulation, achieving near-unity cumulative posterior probability. Using the preferred model, we infer a steep high-mass IMF slope and an elevated Supernova Ia normalization, consistent with prior solar neighbourhood studies but now derived from fully amortized Bayesian inference. Our results demonstrate that modern SBI methods can robustly constrain uncertain physics in astrophysical simulators and enable principled model selection when analysing complex, simulation-based data.</description>
