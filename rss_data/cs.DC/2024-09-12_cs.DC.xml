      <title>ARIM-mdx Data System: Towards a Nationwide Data Platform for Materials Science</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.06734</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.06734v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In modern materials science, effective and high-volume data management across leading-edge experimental facilities and world-class supercomputers is indispensable for cutting-edge research. Such facilities and supercomputers are typically utilized by a wide range of researchers across different fields and organizations in academia and industry. However, existing integrated systems that handle data from these resources have primarily focused just on smaller-scale cross-institutional or single-domain operations. As a result, they often lack the scalability, efficiency, agility, and interdisciplinarity, needed for handling substantial volumes of data from various researchers.
  In this paper, we introduce ARIM-mdx data system, a nationwide data platform for materials science in Japan. The platform involves 8 universities and institutes all over Japan through the governmental materials science project. Currently in its trial phase, the ARIM-mdx data system is utilized by over 800 researchers from around 140 organizations in academia and industry, being intended to gradually expand its reach. The system employs a hybrid architecture, combining a peta-scale dedicated storage system for security and stability with a high-performance academic cloud for efficiency and scalability. Through direct network connections between them, the system achieves 4.7x latency reduction compared to a conventional approach, resulting in near real-time interactive data analysis. It also utilizes specialized IoT devices for secure data transfer from equipment computers and connects to multiple supercomputers via an academic ultra-fast network, achieving 4x faster data transfer compared to the public Internet. The ARIM-mdx data system, as a pioneering nationwide data platform, has the potential to contribute to the creation of new research communities and accelerates innovations.</description>

      <title>FreeRide: Harvesting Bubbles in Pipeline Parallelism</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.06941</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.06941v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The occurrence of bubbles in pipeline parallelism is an inherent limitation that can account for more than 40% of the large language model (LLM) training time and is one of the main reasons for the underutilization of GPU resources in LLM training. Harvesting these bubbles for GPU side tasks can increase resource utilization and reduce training costs but comes with challenges. First, because bubbles are discontinuous with various shapes, programming side tasks becomes difficult while requiring excessive engineering effort. Second, a side task can compete with pipeline training for GPU resources and incur significant overhead. To address these challenges, we propose FreeRide, a system designed to harvest bubbles in pipeline parallelism for side tasks. FreeRide provides programmers with interfaces to implement side tasks easily, manages bubbles and side tasks during pipeline training, and controls access to GPU resources by side tasks to reduce overhead. We demonstrate that FreeRide achieves 7.8% average cost savings with a negligible overhead of about 1% in training LLMs while serving model training, graph analytics, and image processing side tasks.</description>

      <title>Data Backup System with No Impact on Business Processing Utilizing Storage and Container Technologies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.07081</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.07081v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Data backup is a core technology for improving system resilience to system failures. Data backup in enterprise systems is required to minimize the impacts on business processing, which can be categorized into two factors: system slowdown and downtime. To eliminate system slowdown, asynchronous data copy (ADC) technology is prevalent, which copies data asynchronously with original data updates. However, the ADC can collapse backup data when applied to enterprise systems with multiple resources. Then, the demonstration system employed consistency group technology, which makes the order of data updates the same between the original and backup data. In addition, we developed a container platform operator to unravel the complicated correspondence between storage volumes and applications. The operator automates the configuration of the ADC with the setting of consistency groups. We integrated the storage and container technologies into the demonstration system, which can eliminate both system slowdown and downtime.</description>

      <title>Optimizing the Weather Research and Forecasting Model with OpenMP Offload and Codee</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.07232</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.07232v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Currently, the Weather Research and Forecasting model (WRF) utilizes shared memory (OpenMP) and distributed memory (MPI) parallelisms. To take advantage of GPU resources on the Perlmutter supercomputer at NERSC, we port parts of the computationally expensive routines of the Fast Spectral Bin Microphysics (FSBM) microphysical scheme to NVIDIA GPUs using OpenMP device offloading directives. To facilitate this process, we explore a workflow for optimization which uses both runtime profilers and a static code inspection tool Codee to refactor the subroutine. We observe a 2.08x overall speedup for the CONUS-12km thunderstorm test case.</description>

      <title>Kino-PAX: Highly Parallel Kinodynamic Sampling-based Planner</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.06807</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.06807v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Sampling-based motion planners (SBMPs) are effective for planning with complex kinodynamic constraints in high-dimensional spaces, but they still struggle to achieve real-time performance, which is mainly due to their serial computation design. We present Kinodynamic Parallel Accelerated eXpansion (Kino-PAX), a novel highly parallel kinodynamic SBMP designed for parallel devices such as GPUs. Kino-PAX grows a tree of trajectory segments directly in parallel. Our key insight is how to decompose the iterative tree growth process into three massively parallel subroutines. Kino-PAX is designed to align with the parallel device execution hierarchies, through ensuring that threads are largely independent, share equal workloads, and take advantage of low-latency resources while minimizing high-latency data transfers and process synchronization. This design results in a very efficient GPU implementation. We prove that Kino-PAX is probabilistically complete and analyze its scalability with compute hardware improvements. Empirical evaluations demonstrate solutions in the order of 10 ms on a desktop GPU and in the order of 100 ms on an embedded GPU, representing up to 1000 times improvement compared to coarse-grained CPU parallelization of state-of-the-art sequential algorithms over a range of complex environments and systems.</description>

      <title>Privacy-Preserving Federated Learning with Consistency via Knowledge Distillation Using Conditional Generator</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.06955</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.06955v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Federated Learning (FL) is gaining popularity as a distributed learning framework that only shares model parameters or gradient updates and keeps private data locally. However, FL is at risk of privacy leakage caused by privacy inference attacks. And most existing privacy-preserving mechanisms in FL conflict with achieving high performance and efficiency. Therefore, we propose FedMD-CG, a novel FL method with highly competitive performance and high-level privacy preservation, which decouples each client's local model into a feature extractor and a classifier, and utilizes a conditional generator instead of the feature extractor to perform server-side model aggregation. To ensure the consistency of local generators and classifiers, FedMD-CG leverages knowledge distillation to train local models and generators at both the latent feature level and the logit level. Also, we construct additional classification losses and design new diversity losses to enhance client-side training. FedMD-CG is robust to data heterogeneity and does not require training extra discriminators (like cGAN). We conduct extensive experiments on various image classification tasks to validate the superiority of FedMD-CG.</description>

      <title>Federated Impression for Learning with Distributed Heterogeneous Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.07351</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.07351v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Standard deep learning-based classification approaches may not always be practical in real-world clinical applications, as they require a centralized collection of all samples. Federated learning (FL) provides a paradigm that can learn from distributed datasets across clients without requiring them to share data, which can help mitigate privacy and data ownership issues. In FL, sub-optimal convergence caused by data heterogeneity is common among data from different health centers due to the variety in data collection protocols and patient demographics across centers. Through experimentation in this study, we show that data heterogeneity leads to the phenomenon of catastrophic forgetting during local training. We propose FedImpres which alleviates catastrophic forgetting by restoring synthetic data that represents the global information as federated impression. To achieve this, we distill the global model resulting from each communication round. Subsequently, we use the synthetic data alongside the local data to enhance the generalization of local training. Extensive experiments show that the proposed method achieves state-of-the-art performance on both the BloodMNIST and Retina datasets, which contain label imbalance and domain shift, with an improvement in classification accuracy of up to 20%.</description>

      <title>KNN-DBSCAN: a DBSCAN in high dimensions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2009.04552</link>
      <description>arXiv:2009.04552v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Clustering is a fundamental task in machine learning. One of the most successful and broadly used algorithms is DBSCAN, a density-based clustering algorithm. DBSCAN requires $\epsilon$-nearest neighbor graphs of the input dataset, which are computed with range-search algorithms and spatial data structures like KD-trees. Despite many efforts to design scalable implementations for DBSCAN, existing work is limited to low-dimensional datasets, as constructing $\epsilon$-nearest neighbor graphs is expensive in high-dimensions. In this paper, we modify DBSCAN to enable use of $\kappa$-nearest neighbor graphs of the input dataset. The $\kappa$-nearest neighbor graphs are constructed using approximate algorithms based on randomized projections. Although these algorithms can become inaccurate or expensive in high-dimensions, they possess a much lower memory overhead than constructing $\epsilon$-nearest neighbor graphs. We delineate the conditions under which $k$NN-DBSCAN produces the same clustering as DBSCAN. We also present an efficient parallel implementation of the overall algorithm using OpenMP for shared memory and MPI for distributed memory parallelism. We present results on up to 16 billion points in 20 dimensions, and perform weak and strong scaling studies using synthetic data. Our code is efficient in both low and high dimensions. We can cluster one billion points in 3D in less than one second on 28K cores on the Frontera system at the Texas Advanced Computing Center (TACC). In our largest run, we cluster 65 billion points in 20 dimensions in less than 40 seconds using 114,688 x86 cores on TACC's Frontera system. Also, we compare with a state of the art parallel DBSCAN code; on 20d/4M point dataset, our code is up to 37$\times$ faster.</description>

      <title>ScaleLLM: A Resource-Frugal LLM Serving Framework by Optimizing End-to-End Efficiency</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.00008</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.00008v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have surged in popularity and are extensively used in commercial applications, where the efficiency of model serving is crucial for the user experience. Most current research focuses on optimizing individual sub-procedures, e.g. local inference and communication, however, there is no comprehensive framework that provides a holistic system view for optimizing LLM serving in an end-to-end manner. In this work, we conduct a detailed analysis to identify major bottlenecks that impact end-to-end latency in LLM serving systems. Our analysis reveals that a comprehensive LLM serving endpoint must address a series of efficiency bottlenecks that extend beyond LLM inference. We then propose ScaleLLM, an optimized system for resource-efficient LLM serving. Our extensive experiments reveal that with 64 concurrent requests, ScaleLLM achieves a 4.3x speed up over vLLM and outperforms state-of-the-arts with 1.5x higher throughput.</description>

      <title>A Thorough Investigation of Content-Defined Chunking Algorithms for Data Deduplication</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.06066</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.06066v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Data deduplication emerged as a powerful solution for reducing storage and bandwidth costs by eliminating redundancies at the level of chunks. This has spurred the development of numerous Content-Defined Chunking (CDC) algorithms over the past two decades. Despite advancements, the current state-of-the-art remains obscure, as a thorough and impartial analysis and comparison is lacking. We conduct a rigorous theoretical analysis and impartial experimental comparison of several leading CDC algorithms. Using four realistic datasets, we evaluate these algorithms against four key metrics: throughput, deduplication ratio, average chunk size, and chunk-size variance. Our analyses, in many instances, extend the findings of their original publications by reporting new results and putting existing ones into context. Moreover, we highlight limitations that have previously gone unnoticed. Our findings provide valuable insights that inform the selection and optimization of CDC algorithms for practical applications in data deduplication.</description>
