      <title>Collective multicellular patterns arising from cadherin-linked cytoskeletal domains</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.13556</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.13556v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In multicellular systems, adhesion complexes, such as those composed of E-cadherin and associated catenins, mechanically couple neighboring cells by directly linking their actin-based cytoskeletal assemblies. However, the mechanics of how forces are transmitted across these adhesions remains largely unstudied. Here, we introduce a biophysical model that explicitly couples adhesion complex dynamics to intracellular mechanics across cell boundaries. A cadherin dimer plus associated catenins connecting two cells is represented as a spring whose ends experience drag with respect to the moving actin cytoskeleton. The cytoskeleton is modeled as a contractile gel driven by myosin activity in its bulk and forces from adhesion on its boundaries. Our model captures this bidirectional coupling via a coarse-grained continuum framework and reveals a range of observed cell- and tissue-scale behaviors. These include global cell polarization of the multicellular collective, other polarization patterns and oscillatory dynamics, spontaneously formed actin rings within cells, and supracellular stress chains. Many of these features arise from modeling the direct mechanical coupling between cytoskeleton and adhesion. This model can be extended to other adhesion-cytoskeleton feedback systems and used to advance our understanding of multicellular tissue dynamics, particularly during development.</description>

      <title>A numerical approach for the dynamics of active viscoelastic surfaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.13777</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.13777v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The dynamics of active viscoelastic surfaces plays an important role in biological systems. One prominent example is the actin cortex, a thin bio-polymer sheet underneath the outer membrane of biological cells which combines active molecular force generation with viscoelastic behavior characterized by elastic properties at short timescales and viscous properties at longer timescales. We consider a surface Maxwell model within dominant rheology and an additional active term to model the dynamics of the actin cortex. This captures both, shear and dilational surface dynamics. We propose a monolithic numerical approach based on the surface finite element method (SFEM), validate the results for special cases and experimentally demonstrate convergence properties. Moreover, imposing a ring-shaped region of an enhanced active stress mimicking the contractile ring during cytokinesis, we observe different types of emergent patterns and shape dynamics depending on the viscoelastic properties. While viscous surfaces show a ring, which slips to one side of the surface, viscoelasticity provides a stabilization mechanism of the ring, thus forming a requirement for subsequent cell division. This study provides an example that viscoelastic properties are key ingredients to understand biological materials.</description>

      <title>Sensitivity of literature $T_1$ mapping methods to the underlying magnetization transfer parameters</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.13644</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.13644v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Purpose: Magnetization transfer (MT) has been identified as the principal source of $T_1$ variability in the MRI literature. This study assesses the sensitivity of established $T_1$ mapping techniques to variations in the underlying MT parameters.
  Methods: For each $T_1$-mapping method, the observed $T_1$ was simulated as a function of the underlying MT parameters $p_i^\text{MT}$, corresponding to different brain regions of interest (ROIs) at 3T. As measures of sensitivity, the derivatives $\partial T_1^\text{observed} / \partial p_i^\text{MT}$ were computed and analyzed with a linear mixed-effects model as a function of $p_i^\text{MT}$, ROI, pulse sequence type (e.g., inversion recovery, variable flip angle), and the individual sequences.
  Results: The analyzed $T_1$-mapping sequences have a considerable sensitivity to changes in the semi-solid spin pool size $m_0^\text{s}$, $T_1^\text{f}$ of the free, $T_1^\text{s}$ of the semi-solid spin pool, and the (inverse) exchange rate $T_\text{x}$. All derivatives vary considerably with the underlying MT parameters and between pulse sequences. The derivatives can, in general, not be determined by the sequence type, but rather depend on implementation details of the sequence. One notable exception is that variable-flip-angle methods are, in general, more sensitive to the exchange rate than inversion-recovery methods.
  Conclusion: Variations in $T_1$ measurements can be caused by several underlying MT parameters, and the sensitivity to each parameter depends on both the underlying MT parameters and the sequence.</description>

      <title>Dynamic traversal of large gaps by insects and legged robots reveals a template</title>

Abstract: It is well known that animals can use neural and sensory feedback via vision, tactile sensing, and echolocation to negotiate obstacles. Similarly, most robots use deliberate or reactive planning to avoid obstacles, which relies on prior knowledge or high-fidelity sensing of the environment. However, during dynamic locomotion in complex, novel, 3-D terrains such as forest floor and building rubble, sensing and planning suffer bandwidth limitation and large noise and are sometimes even impossible. Here, we study rapid locomotion over a large gap, a simple, ubiquitous obstacle, to begin to discover general principles of dynamic traversal of large 3-D obstacles. We challenged the discoid cockroach and an open-loop six-legged robot to traverse a large gap of varying length. Both the animal and the robot could dynamically traverse a gap as large as 1 body length by bridging the gap with its head, but traversal probability decreased with gap length. Based on these observations, we developed a template that well captured body dynamics and quantitatively predicted traversal performance. Our template revealed that high approach speed, initial body pitch, and initial body pitch angular velocity facilitated dynamic traversal, and successfully predicted a new strategy of using body pitch control that increased the robot maximal traversal gap length by 50%. Our study established the first template of dynamic locomotion beyond planar surfaces and is an important step in expanding terradynamics into complex 3-D terrains.</description>

      <title>Body-terrain interaction affects large bump traversal of insects and legged robots</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/1911.02527</link>
      <description>arXiv:1911.02527v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Small animals and robots must often rapidly traverse large bump-like obstacles when moving through complex 3-D terrains, during which, in addition to leg-ground contact, their body inevitably comes into physical contact with the obstacles. However, we know little about the performance limits of large bump traversal and how body-terrain interaction affects traversal. To address these, we challenged the discoid cockroach and an open-loop six-legged robot to dynamically run into a large bump of varying height to discover the maximal traversal performance, and studied how locomotor modes and traversal performance are affected by body-terrain interaction. Remarkably, during rapid running, both the animal and the robot were capable of dynamically traversing a bump much higher than its hip height (up to 4 times the hip height for the animal and 3 times for the robot, respectively) at traversal speeds typical of running, with decreasing traversal probability with increasing bump height. A stability analysis using a novel locomotion energy landscape model explained why traversal was more likely when the animal or robot approached the bump with a low initial body yaw and a high initial body pitch, and why deflection was more likely otherwise. Inspired by these principles, we demonstrated a novel control strategy of active body pitching that increased the robot maximal traversable bump height by 75%. Our study is a major step in establishing the framework of locomotion energy landscapes to understand locomotion in complex 3-D terrains.</description>

      <title>Robotic modeling of snake traversing large, smooth obstacles reveals stability benefits of body compliance</title>

      <description>arXiv:2002.09711v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Snakes can move through almost any terrain. Although their locomotion on flat surfaces using planar gaits is inherently stable, when snakes deform their body out of plane to traverse complex terrain, maintaining stability becomes a challenge. On trees and desert dunes, snakes grip branches or brace against depressed sand for stability. However, how they stably surmount obstacles like boulders too large and smooth to gain such anchor points is less understood. Similarly, snake robots are challenged to stably traverse large, smooth obstacles for search and rescue and building inspection. Our recent study discovered that snakes combine body lateral undulation and cantilevering to stably traverse large steps. Here, we developed a snake robot with this gait and snake-like anisotropic friction and used it as a physical model to understand stability principles. The robot traversed steps as high as a third of its body length rapidly and stably. However, on higher steps, it was more likely to fail due to more frequent rolling and flipping over, which was absent in the snake with a compliant body. Adding body compliance reduced the robot roll instability by statistically improving surface contact, without reducing speed. Besides advancing understanding of snake locomotion, our robot achieved high traversal speed surpassing most previous snake robots and approaching snakes, while maintaining high traversal probability.</description>

      <title>Scattering approach to diffusion quantifies axonal damage in brain injury</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.18167</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.18167v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Early diagnosis and noninvasive monitoring of neurological disorders require sensitivity to elusive cellular-level alterations that occur much earlier than volumetric changes observable with the millimeter-resolution of medical imaging modalities. Morphological changes in axons, such as axonal varicosities or beadings, are observed in neurological disorders, as well as in development and aging. Here, we reveal the sensitivity of time-dependent diffusion MRI (dMRI) to the structurally disordered axonal morphology at the micrometer scale. Scattering theory uncovers the two parameters that determine the diffusive dynamics of water along axons: the average reciprocal cross-section and the variance of long-range cross-sectional fluctuations. This theoretical development allows us to predict dMRI metrics sensitive to axonal alterations over tens of thousands of axons in seconds rather than months of simulations in a rat model of traumatic brain injury, and is corroborated with ex vivo dMRI. Our approach bridges the gap between micrometers and millimeters in resolution, offering quantitative and objective biomarkers applicable to a broad spectrum of neurological disorders.</description>

      <title>Excitonic Coupling and Photon Antibunching in Venus Yellow Fluorescent Protein Dimers: A Lindblad Master Equation Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.14233</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.14233v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Strong excitonic coupling and photon antibunching (AB) have been observed together in Venus yellow fluorescent protein dimers and currently lack a cohesive theoretical explanation. In 2019, Kim et al. demonstrated Davydov splitting in circular dichroism spectra, revealing strong J-like coupling, while antibunched fluorescence emission was confirmed by combined antibunching--fluorescence correlation spectroscopy (AB/FCS fingerprinting). To investigate the implications of this coexistence, Venus dimer population dynamics are modeled within a Lindblad master equation framework, justified by the separation of characteristic coupling, dephasing, and thermal relaxation rates. Simulations predict rapid decoherence, yielding bright/dark state mixtures consistent with antibunched fluorescence emission at room temperature. Thus, excitonic coupling and photon AB are reconciled without invoking long-lived quantum coherence. More broadly, fluorescent proteins emerge as tractable model systems for probing evolutionary pressures on chromoprotein photophysics and quantum dynamics. Cryogenic cooling may extend coherence time into the regime required for ultrafast gate operations, suggesting fluorescent protein dimers as a viable platform for bio-inspired qubits.</description>
