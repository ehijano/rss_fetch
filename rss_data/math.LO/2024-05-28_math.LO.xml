      <title>Filter-induced entailment relations in paraconsistent G\"{o}del logics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.18262</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.18262v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider two expansions of G\"{o}del logic $\mathsf{G}$ with two versions of paraconsistent negation. The first one is $\mathsf{G_{inv}}$ -- the expansion of $\mathsf{G}$ with an involuitive negation ${\sim_\mathsf{i}}$ defined via $v({\sim_\mathsf{i}}\phi)=1-v(\phi)$. The second one is $\mathsf{G}^2_{(\rightarrow,-\!&lt;)}$ -- an expansion with a so-called strong negation $\neg$. This logic utilises two independent valuations on $[0,1]$ -- $v_1$ (support of truth or positive support) and $v_2$ (support of falsity or negative support) that are connected with $\neg$. Two valuations in $\mathsf{G}^2_{(\rightarrow,-\!&lt;)}$ can be combined into one valuation $v$ on $[0,1]^{\Join}$ -- the twisted product of $[0,1]$ with itself -- with two components $v_1$ and $v_2$. The two logics are closely connected as ${\sim_\mathsf{i}}$ and $\neg$ allow for similar definitions of co-implication -- $\phi-\!&lt;\chi:={\sim_\mathsf{i}}({\sim_\mathsf{i}}\chi\rightarrow{\sim_\mathsf{i}}\phi)$ and $\phi-\!&lt;\chi:=\neg(\neg\chi\rightarrow\neg\phi)$ -- but do not coincide since the set of values of $\mathsf{G}^2_{(\rightarrow,-\!&lt;)}$ is not ordered linearly.
  Our main goal is to study different entailment relations in $\mathsf{G_{inv}}$ and $\mathsf{G}^2_{(\rightarrow,-\!&lt;)}$ that are induced by filters on $[0,1]$ and $[0,1]^{\Join}$, respectively. In particular, we determine the exact number of such relations in both cases, establish whether any of them coincide with the entailment defined via the order on $[0,1]$ and $[0,1]^{\Join}$, and obtain their hierarchy. We also construct reductions of filter-induced entailment relations to the ones defined via the order.</description>

      <title>The finite Friedman-Stanley jumps: generic dichotomies for Borel homomorphisms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.18360</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.18360v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Fix $n=1,2,3,\dots$ or $n=\omega$. We prove a dichotomy for Borel homomorphisms from the $n$-th Friedman-Stanley jump $=^{+n}$ to an equivalence relation $E$ which is classifiable by countable structures: if there is no reduction from $=^{+n}$ to $E$, then in fact all Borel homomorphisms are very far from a reduction. For this we use a different presentation of $=^{+n}$, equivalent up to Borel bi-reducibility, which is susceptible to Baire-category techniques.
  This dichotomy is seen as a method for proving positive Borel reducibility results from $=^{+n}$. As corollaries we prove: (1) for $n\leq\omega$, $=^{+n}$ is in the spectrum of the meager ideal. This extends a result of Kanovei, Sabok, and Zapletal for $n=1$; (2) $=^{+\omega}$ is a regular equivalence relation. This answers positively a question of Clemens; (3) for $n&lt;\omega$, the equivalence relations, classifiable by countable structures, which do not Borel reduce $=^{+n}$ are closed under countable products. This extends a result of Kanovei, Sabok, and Zapletal for $n=1$.</description>

      <title>A Ramsey theorem for the reals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.18431</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.18431v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We prove that for every colouring of pairs of reals with finitely-many colours, there is a set homeomorphic to the rationals which takes no more than two colours. This was conjectured by Galvin in 1970, and a colouring of Sierpi{\'n}ski from 1933 witnesses that the number of colours cannot be reduced to one. Previously in 1985 Shelah had shown that a stronger statement is consistent with a forcing construction assuming the existence of large cardinals. Then in 2018 Raghavan and Todor\v{c}evi\'c had proved it assuming the existence of large cardinals. We prove it in $ZFC$. In fact Raghavan and Todor\v{c}evi\'c proved, assuming more large cardinals, a similar result for a large class of topological spaces. We prove this also, again in $ZFC$.</description>

      <title>Lindenmayer graph languages, first-order theories and expanders</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.17629</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.17629v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Combinatorial generation of expander families and Lindenmayer-style development models are both parallel in nature. Both can be handled within proposed parallel graph grammar formalism. Their first-order properties can then be checked by encompassing the generated graph language into an appropriate automatic structure.</description>

      <title>Stable finiteness of monoid algebras and surjunctivity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.18287</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.18287v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A monoid $M$ is said to be surjunctive if every injective cellular automaton with finite alphabet over $M$ is surjective. We show that monoid algebras of surjunctive monoids are stably finite. In other words, given any field $K$ and any surjunctive monoid $M$, every one-sided invertible square matrix with entries in the monoid algebra $K[M]$ is two-sided invertible. Our proof uses first-order model theory.</description>

      <title>A Closer Look at the Russell Paradox</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2103.00090</link>
      <description>arXiv:2103.00090v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Two types of approximation to the paradoxical Russell Set are presented, one approximating it from below, one from above. It is shown that any lower approximation gives rise to a better approximation containing it, and that any upper approximation contains a distinct better approximation. The Russell Paradox is then seen to be the claim that two of these processes of better approximations stop, and at the same set. This suggests that the unrestricted Axiom of Comprehension is, not a coherent intuition worthy of rescue from a mysterious paradox, but simply wishful thinking, a confusion of sets as extensional objects with classes defined by a property.</description>

      <title>Countability constraints in order-theoretic approaches to computability</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2206.14484</link>
      <description>arXiv:2206.14484v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Computability on uncountable sets has no standard formalization, unlike that on countable sets, which is given by Turing machines. Some of the approaches to define computability in these sets rely on order-theoretic structures to translate such notions from Turing machines to uncountable spaces. Since these machines are used as a baseline for computability in these approaches, countability restrictions on the ordered structures are fundamental. Here, we show several relations between the usual countability restrictions in order-theoretic theories of computability and some more common order-theoretic countability constraints, like order density properties and functional characterizations of the order structure in terms of multi-utilities. As a result, we show how computability can be introduced in some order structures via countability order density and multi-utility constraints.</description>

      <title>Towards solid abelian groups: A formal proof of N\"obeling's theorem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.07252</link>
      <description>arXiv:2309.07252v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Condensed mathematics, developed by Clausen and Scholze over the last few years, is a new way of studying the interplay between algebra and geometry. It replaces the concept of a topological space by a more sophisticated but better-behaved idea, namely that of a condensed set. Central to the theory are solid abelian groups and liquid vector spaces, analogues of complete topological groups.
  N\"obeling's theorem, a surprising result from the 1960s about the structure of the abelian group of continuous maps from a profinite space to the integers, is a crucial ingredient in the theory of solid abelian groups; without it one cannot give any nonzero examples of solid abelian groups. We discuss a recently completed formalisation of this result in the Lean theorem prover, and give a more detailed proof than those previously available in the literature. The proof is somewhat unusual in that it requires induction over ordinals -- a technique which has not previously been used to a great extent in formalised mathematics.</description>
