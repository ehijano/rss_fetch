      <title>Set-valued Star-Shaped Risk Measures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.18014</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.18014v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we introduce a new class of set-valued risk measures, named set-valued star-shaped risk measures. Motivated by the results of scalar monetary and star-shaped risk measures, this paper investigates the representation theorems in the set-valued framework. It is demonstrated that set-valued risk measures can be represented as the union of a family of set-valued convex risk measures, and set-valued normalized star-shaped risk measures can be represented as the union of a family of set-valued normalized convex risk measures. The link between set-valued risk measures and set-valued star-shaped risk measures is also established.</description>

      <title>Liquidity Jump, Liquidity Diffusion, and Crypto Wash Trading</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.05803</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.05803v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We hypothesize that at least a portion of the short-term price jumps in the crypto market are manifestations of liquidity fluctuation caused by wash trading practices. We develop a model to decompose asset liquidity into two components: liquidity jump and liquidity diffusion, which proxy the size and probability of wash trading, respectively. Using the US stock trading data as benchmark, we establish that the combination of high liquidity diffusion and high liquidity jump indicates wash trading, while large-volume trades with high liquidity jump but low liquidity diffusion are actually legitimate trades. The liquidity measures provide a useful tool to all market participants, including researchers, regulators, market makers and investors to understand the interplay between liquidity fluctuation (jump) and liquidity volatility (diffusion), and make appropriate decisions in crypto trading.</description>

      <title>Self-protection and insurance demand with convex premium principles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.19436</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.19436v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In economic analysis, rational decision-makers often take actions to reduce their risk exposure. These actions include purchasing market insurance and implementing prevention measures to modify the shape of the loss distribution. Under the assumption that the insureds' actions are fully observed by the insurer, this paper investigates the interaction between self-protection and insurance demand when insurance premiums are determined by convex premium principles within the framework of distortion risk measures. Specifically, the insured selects an optimal proportional insurance share and prevention effort to minimize the risk measure of their end-of-period exposure. We explicitly characterize the optimal combination of prevention effort and insurance demand in a self-protection model when the insured adopts tail value-at-risk or a subclass with strictly concave distortion functions. Additionally, we conduct comparative static analyses to illustrate our main findings under various premium structures, risk aversion levels, and loss distributions. Our results indicate that market insurance and self-protection are complementary, supporting classical insights from the literature regarding corner insurance policies (i.e., null and full insurance) in the absence of ex ante moral hazard. Finally, we consider the effects of moral hazard on the interaction between self-protection and insurance demand. Our findings show that ex ante moral hazard shifts the complementary effect into substitution effect.</description>
