      <title>Finite central extensions of o-minimal groups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.16440</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.16440v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We answer in the affirmative a conjecture of Berarducci, Peterzil and Pillay \cite{BPP10} for solvable groups, which is an o-minimal version of a particular case of Milnor's isomorphism conjecture \cite{jM83}. We prove that every finite central extension of a definably connected solvable definable group in an o-minimal structure is equivalent to a finite central extension which is definable without additional parameters. The proof relies on an o-minimal adaptation of the higher inflation-restriction exact sequence due to Hochschild and Serre. As in \cite{jM83}, we also prove in o-minimal expansions of real closed fields that the conjecture reduces to definably simple groups.</description>

      <title>Multisorted Boolean Clones Determined by Binary Relations up to Minion Homomorphisms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.16513</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.16513v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We describe the ordering of a class of clones by minion homomorphisms, also known as minor preserving maps or height 1 clone homomorphisms. The class consists of all clones on finite sets determined by binary relations whose projections to both coordinates have at most two elements. This class can be alternatively described up to minion homomorphisms as the class of multisorted Boolean clones determined by binary relations. We also introduce and apply the concept of a minion core which provides canonical representatives for equivalence classes of clones, more generally minions, on finite sets.</description>

      <title>Computable learning of natural hypothesis classes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.16663</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.16663v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper is about the recent notion of computably probably approximately correct learning, which lies between the statistical learning theory where there is no computational requirement on the learner and efficient PAC where the learner must be polynomially bounded. Examples have recently been given of hypothesis classes which are PAC learnable but not computably PAC learnable, but these hypothesis classes are unnatural or non-canonical in the sense that they depend on a numbering of proofs, formulas, or programs. We use the on-a-cone machinery from computability theory to prove that, under mild assumptions such as that the hypothesis class can be computably listable, any natural hypothesis class which is learnable must be computably learnable. Thus the counterexamples given previously are necessarily unnatural.</description>

      <title>Trivial Isomorphisms between Reduced Products</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.06731</link>
      <description>arXiv:2307.06731v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We introduce a general method for showing under weak forcing axioms that reduced products of countable models of a theory $T$ have as few automorphisms as possible. We show that such forcing axioms imply that reduced products of countably infinite or finite fields, linear orders, trees, or random graphs have only trivial automorphisms. We also show that Todor\v{c}evi\'c's Open Colouring Axiom, $\mathsf{OCA}_{\mathrm{T}}$, implies that all automorphisms of $\mathcal{P}(\mathbb{N})/{\mathrm{Fin}}$ are trivial.</description>

      <title>Owings-like theorems for infinitely many colours or finite monochromatic sets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.13124</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.13124v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Inspired by Owings's problem, we investigate whether, for a given an Abelian group $G$ and cardinal numbers $\kappa,\theta$, every colouring $c:G\longrightarrow\theta$ yields a subset $X\subseteq G$ with $|X|=\kappa$ such that $X+X$ is monochromatic. (Owings's problem asks this for $G=\mathbb Z$, $\theta=2$ and $\kappa=\aleph_0$; this is known to be false for the same $G$ and $\kappa$ but $\theta=3$.) We completely settle the question for $\kappa$ and $\theta$ both finite (by obtaining sufficient and necessary conditions for a positive answer) and for $\kappa$ and $\theta$ both infinite (with a negative answer). Also, in the case where $\theta$ is infinite but $\kappa$ is finite, we obtain some sufficient conditions for a negative answer as well as an example with a positive answer.</description>

      <title>Modal weak Kleene logics: axiomatizations and relational semantics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.01274</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.01274v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Weak Kleene logics are three-valued logics characterized by the presence of an infectious truth-value. In their external versions, as they were originally introduced by Bochvar and Hallden, these systems are equipped with an additional connective capable of expressing whether a formula is classically true. In this paper we further expand the expressive power of external weak Kleen logics by modalizing them with a unary operator. The addition of an alethic modality gives rise to the two systems $\B^{\square}$ and $MPWK$, which have two different readings of the modal operator. We provide these logics with a complete and decidable Hilbert-style axiomatization w.r.t. a three-valued possible worlds semantics. The starting point of these calculi are new axiomatizations for the non-modal bases B and PWKe, which we provide using the recent algebraization results about these two logics. In particular, we prove the algebraizability of $\PWKe$. Finally some standard extensions of the basic modal systems are provided with their completeness results w.r.t. special classes of frames.</description>

      <title>Definable $\mathcal C^r$ structures on definable topological groups in d-minimal structures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.15647</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.15647v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Definable topological groups whose topologies are affine have definable $\mathcal C^r$ structures in d-minimal expansions of ordered fields, where $r$ is a positive integer. We prove this fact using a new notion called partition degree of a definable set. Basic properties of partition degree are also studied.</description>

      <title>Isotypical equivalence of periodic Abelian groups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.11261</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.11261v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper we give invariants that characterize isotypically equivalent Abelian periodic groups. Also, we describe types of standart tuples of elements in these groups. As the particular case we prove that two Abelian $p$-groups with separable reduced parts are isotypically equivalent if and only if their divisible parts and their basic subgroups are elementarily equivalent. Also as a corollary we prove that any Abelian $p$-group with a separable reduced part is $\omega$-strongly homogeneous.</description>
