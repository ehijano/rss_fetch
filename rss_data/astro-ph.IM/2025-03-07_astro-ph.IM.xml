      <title>Cosmology with ESO-SKAO Synergies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.03915</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.03915v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We discuss the possible synergies for cosmology between SKAO and ESO facilities, focusing on the combinations SKA-Mid with the Multi-Object Spectrograph Telescope (4MOST) instrument built for ESO's Visible and Infrared Survey Telescope for Astronomy (VISTA), and SKA-Low with ESO's Extremely Large Telescope (ELT) multi-object spectrograph MOSAIC. Combining multiple tracers allows for tackling systematics and lifting parameter degeneracies. It will play a crucial role in the pursuit of precision cosmology.</description>

      <title>Rapid characterization of exoplanet atmospheres with the Exoplanet Transmission Spectroscopy Imager (ETSI)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.03931</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.03931v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Exoplanet Transmission Spectroscopy Imager (ETSI) amalgamates a low resolution slitless prism spectrometer with custom multi-band filters to simultaneously image 15 spectral bandpasses between 430 nm and 975 nm with an average spectral resolution of $R = \lambda/\delta\lambda \sim 20$. ETSI requires only moderate telescope apertures ($\sim2$ m) and is capable of characterizing an exoplanet atmosphere in as little as a single transit, enabling selection of the most interesting targets for further characterization with other ground and space-based observatories and is also well suited to multi-band observations of other variable and transient objects. This enables a new technique, common-path multi-band imaging (CMI), used to observe transmission spectra of exoplanets transiting bright (V$&lt;$14 magnitude) stars. ETSI is capable of near photon-limited observations, with a systematic noise floor on par with the Hubble Space Telescope and below the Earth's atmospheric amplitude scintillation noise limit. We report the as-built instrument optical and optomechanical design, detectors, control system, telescope hardware and software interfaces, and data reduction pipeline. A summary of ETSI's science capabilities and initial results are also included.</description>

      <title>Image Data Augmentation for the TAIGA-IACT Experiment with Conditional Generative Adversarial Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.03982</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.03982v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Modern Imaging Atmospheric Cherenkov Telescopes (IACTs) generate a huge amount of data that must be classified automatically, ideally in real time. Currently, machine learning-based solutions are increasingly being used to solve classification problems. However, these classifiers require proper training data sets to work correctly. The problem with training neural networks on real IACT data is that these data need to be pre-labeled, whereas such labeling is difficult and its results are estimates. In addition, the distribution of incoming events is highly imbalanced. Firstly, there is an imbalance in the types of events, since the number of detected gamma quanta is significantly less than the number of protons. Secondly, the energy distribution of particles of the same type is also imbalanced, since high-energy particles are extremely rare. This imbalance results in poorly trained classifiers that, once trained, do not handle rare events correctly. Using only conventional Monte Carlo event simulation methods to solve this problem is possible, but extremely resource-intensive and time-consuming. To address this issue, we propose to perform data augmentation with artificially generated events of the desired type and energy using conditional generative adversarial networks (cGANs), distinguishing classes by energy values. In the paper, we describe a simple algorithm for generating balanced data sets using cGANs. Thus, the proposed neural network model produces both imbalanced data sets for physical analysis as well as balanced data sets suitable for training other neural networks.</description>

      <title>Baseline filtering and peak reconstruction for haloscope-like axion searches</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.04288</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.04288v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Axions are well-motivated dark matter particles. Many experiments are looking for their experimental evidence. For haloscopes, the problem reduces to the identification of a peak above a noisy baseline. Its modeling, however, may problematic. State-of-the-art analysis rely on the Savitzky-Golay (SG) filtering, which is intrinsically affected by any possible over fluctuation, leading to biased results. In this paper we study the efficiency that different extensions of SG can provide in the peak reconstruction in a standard haloscope-like experiment. We show that, once the correlations among bins are taken into account, there is no appreciable difference. The standard SG remains the advisable choice because of its numerical efficiency.</description>

      <title>The Firmamento platform</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.04434</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.04434v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper introduces Firmamento, a new online platform designed for astronomical research, particularly for studying blazars and other multi-messenger emitters. Firmamento provides access to a wealth of astronomical data, including imaging, spectral, and timing information, along with tools for data analysis and machine learning. A key feature is the Error Region Counterpart Identifier (ERCI), which helps locate potential counterparts to gamma-ray and other high-energy sources pinpointing objects exhibiting blazar-like characteristics. Firmamento grants access to spectral data across the entire electromagnetic spectrum, offering well-populated SED generation and VHE detectability estimation. The platform also supports user-provided data, allowing researchers to incorporate their own source lists.</description>

      <title>Using the XMM-Newton Small Window Mode to investigate systematic uncertainties in the particle background of X-ray CCD detectors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.04682</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.04682v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The level and uncertainty of the particle induced background in CCD detectors plays a crucial role for future X-ray instruments, such as the Wide Field Imager (WFI) onboard Athena. To mitigate the background systematic uncertainties, which will limit the Athena science goals, we aim to understand the relationship between the energetic charged particles interacting in the detector and satellite, and the instrumental science background to an unprecedented level. These particles produce easily identified "cosmic-ray tracks" along with less easily identified signals produced by secondary particles, e.g., X-rays generated by particle interactions with the instrument and indistinguishable from genuine sky X-rays. We utilize the Small Window Mode of the PN camera onboard XMM-Newton to understand the time, spatial and energy dependence of the various background components, particularly the particle induced background. While the distribution of particle events follows expected detector readout patterns, we find a particle track length distribution inconsistent with the simple, isotropic model. We also find that the detector mode-specific readout results in a shifted Cu fluorescent line. We illustrate that on long timescales the variability of the particle background correlates well with the solar cycle. This 20-year lightcurve, can be reproduced by a particle detector onboard Chandra, the HRC anti-coincidence shield. We conclude that the self-anti-coincidence method of removing X-ray-like events near detected particle tracks in the same frame can be optimized with the inclusion of additional information, such as the energy of the X-ray. The results presented here are relevant for any future pixelated X-ray imaging detector, and could allow the WFI to probe to truly faint X-ray surface brightness.</description>

      <title>Exploring the evolution of gravitational-wave emitters with efficient emulation: Constraining the origins of binary black holes using normalising flows</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.03819</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.03819v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Binary population synthesis simulations allow detailed modelling of gravitational-wave sources from a variety of formation channels. These population models can be compared to the observed catalogue of merging binaries to infer the uncertain astrophysical input parameters describing binary formation and evolution, as well as relative rates between various formation pathways. However, it is computationally infeasible to run population synthesis simulations for all variations of uncertain input physics. We demonstrate the use of normalising flows to emulate population synthesis results and interpolate between astrophysical input parameters. Using current gravitational-wave observations of binary black holes, we use our trained normalising flows to infer branching ratios between multiple formation channels, and simultaneously infer common-envelope efficiency and natal spins across a continuous parameter range. Given our set of formation channel models, we infer the natal spin to be $0.04^{+0.04}_{-0.01}$, and the common-envelope efficiency to be $&gt;3.7$ at 90% credibility, with the majority of underlying mergers coming from the common-envelope channel. Our framework allows us to measure population synthesis inputs where we do not have simulations, and better constrain the astrophysics underlying current gravitational-wave populations.</description>

      <title>Ground-Based Reconnaissance Observations of 21 Exoplanet Atmospheres with the Exoplanet Transmission Spectroscopy Imager</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.03930</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.03930v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: One of the most prolific methods of studying exoplanet atmospheres is transmission spectroscopy, which measures the difference between the depth of an exoplanet's transit signal at various wavelengths and attempts to correlate the depth changes to potential features in the exoplanet's atmosphere. Here we present reconnaissance observations of 21 exoplanet atmospheres measured with the Exoplanet Transmission Spectroscopy Imager (ETSI), a recently deployed spectro-photometer on the McDonald Observatory Otto Struve 2.1 m telescope. ETSI measurements are mostly free of systematics through the use of a novel observing technique called common-path multi-band imaging (CMI), which has been shown to achieve photometric color precision on-par with space-based observations (300ppm or 0.03%). This work also describes the various statistical tests performed on the data to evaluate the efficacy of the CMI method and the ETSI instrument in combination. We find that none of the 8 comparisons of exoplanet atmospheres measured with ETSI and other observatories (including the Hubble Space Telescope) provide evidence that the spectra are statistically dissimilar. These results suggest that ETSI can provide initial transmission spectroscopy observations for a fraction of the observational and monetary overhead previously required to detect an exoplanet's atmosphere. Ultimately these reconnaissance observations increase the number of planets with transmission spectroscopy measurements by ~10% and provide an immediate prioritization of 21 exoplanets for future follow-up with more precious observatories, such as the James Webb Space Telescope. The reconnaissance spectra are available through the Filtergraph visualization portal at the URL: https://filtergraph.com/etsi/.</description>

      <title>Improving the Temporal Resolution of SOHO/MDI Magnetograms of Solar Active Regions Using a Deep Generative Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.03959</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.03959v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a novel deep generative model, named GenMDI, to improve the temporal resolution of line-of-sight (LOS) magnetograms of solar active regions (ARs) collected by the Michelson Doppler Imager (MDI) on board the Solar and Heliospheric Observatory (SOHO). Unlike previous studies that focus primarily on spatial super-resolution of MDI magnetograms, our approach can perform temporal super-resolution, which generates and inserts synthetic data between observed MDI magnetograms, thus providing finer temporal structure and enhanced details in the LOS data. The GenMDI model employs a conditional diffusion process, which synthesizes images by considering both preceding and subsequent magnetograms, ensuring that the generated images are not only of high-quality, but also temporally coherent with the surrounding data. Experimental results show that the GenMDI model performs better than the traditional linear interpolation method, especially in ARs with dynamic evolution in magnetic fields.</description>

      <title>Significant challenges for astrophysical inference with next-generation gravitational-wave observatories</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.04073</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.04073v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The next generation of gravitational-wave observatories will achieve unprecedented strain sensitivities with an expanded observing band. They will detect ${\cal O}(10^5)$ binary neutron star (BNS) mergers every year, the loudest of which will be in the band for $\approx 90$ minutes with signal-to-noise ratios $\approx 1500$. Current techniques will not be able to determine the astrophysical parameters of the loudest of next-gen BNS signals. We show that subtleties arising from the rotation of the Earth and the free-spectral range of gravitational-wave interferometers dramatically increases the complexity of next-gen BNS signals compared to the one-minute signals seen by LIGO--Virgo. Various compression methods currently relied upon to speed up the most expensive BNS calculations -- reduced-order quadrature, multi-banding, and relative binning -- will no longer be effective. We carry out reduced-order inference on a simulated next-gen BNS signal taking into account the Earth's rotation and the observatories' free-spectral range. We show that standard data compression techniques become impractical, and the full problem becomes computationally infeasible, when we include data below $\approx 16$Hz -- a part of the observing band that is critical for precise sky localisation. We discuss potential paths towards solving this complex problem.</description>

      <title>HERACLES++: a multi-dimensional Eulerian code for exascale computing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.04428</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.04428v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Numerical simulations of multidimensional astrophysical fluids present considerable challenges. However, the development of exascale computing has significantly enhanced computational capabilities, motivating the development of new codes that can take full advantage of these resources. In this article, we introduce HERACLES++, a new hydrodynamics code with high portability, optimized for exascale machines with different architectures and running efficiently both on CPUs and GPUs. The code is Eulerian and employs a Godunov finite-volume method to solve the hydrodynamics equations, which ensures accuracy in capturing shocks and discontinuities. It includes different Riemann solvers, equations of state, and gravity solvers. It works in Cartesian and spherical coordinates, either in 1-D, 2-D, or 3-D, and uses passive scalars to handle gases with several species. The code accepts a user-supplied heating or cooling term to treat a variety of astrophysical contexts. In addition to the usual series of benchmarking tests, we use HERACLES++ to simulate the propagation of a supernova shock in a red-supergiant star envelope, from minutes after core collapse until shock emergence. In 1-D, the results from HERACLES++ are in agreement with those of V1D for the same configuration. In 3-D, the Rayleigh-Taylor instability develops and modifies the 1-D picture by introducing density and composition fluctuations as well as turbulence. The focus on a wedge, rather than the full solid angle, and the ability of running HERACLES++ with a large number of GPUs allow for long-term simulations of 3-D supernova ejecta with a sub-degree resolution. Future development is to extend HERACLES++ to a radiation-hydrodynamics code.</description>

      <title>MIRI-LRS spectrum of a cold exoplanet around a white dwarf: water, ammonia, and methane measurements</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.04531</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.04531v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The study of the atmosphere of exoplanets orbiting white dwarfs is a largely unexplored field. With WD\,0806-661\,b, we present the first deep dive into the atmospheric physics and chemistry of a cold exoplanet around a white dwarf. We observed WD 0806-661 b using JWST's Mid-InfraRed Instrument Low-Resolution Spectrometer (MIRI-LRS), covering the wavelength range from 5 -- 12~$\mu \rm{m}$, and the Imager, providing us with 12.8, 15, 18 and 21\,$\mu$m photometric measurements. We carried the data reduction of those datasets, tackling second-order effects to ensure a reliable retrieval analysis. Using the \textsc{TauREx} retrieval code, we inferred the pressure-temperature structure, atmospheric chemistry, mass, and radius of the planet. The spectrum of WD 0806-661 b is shaped by molecular absorption of water, ammonia, and methane, consistent with a cold Jupiter atmosphere, allowing us to retrieve their abundances. From the mixing ratio of water, ammonia and methane we derive $\rm{C/O} = 0.34 \pm 0.06$, $\rm{C/N} = 14.4 ^{+2.5}_{-1.8}$ and $\rm{N/O} = 0.023 \pm 0.004$ and the ratio of detected metals as proxy for metallicity. We also derive upper limits for the abundance of CO and $\rm{CO_2}$ ($1.2\cdot10^{-6} \rm{\,and\,} 1.6\cdot10^{-7}$ respectively), which were not detected by our retrieval models. While our interpretation of WD\,0806-661\,b's atmosphere is mostly consistent with our theoretical understanding, some results -- such as the lack of evidence for water clouds, an apparent increase in the mixing ratio of ammonia at low pressure, or the retrieved mass at odds with the supposed age -- remain surprising and require follow-up observational and theoretical studies to be confirmed.</description>

      <title>Mapping inspiral-merger-ringdown waveforms of binary black holes from black hole perturbation waveforms by machine learning</title>

Abstract: Identifying weak gravitational wave signals in noise and estimating the source properties require high-precision waveform templates. Numerical relativity (NR) simulations can provide the most accurate waveforms. However, it is challenging to compute waveform templates in high-dimensional parameter space using NR simulations due to high computational costs. In this work, we implement a novel waveform mapping method, which is an alternative approach to the existing analytical approximations, based on closed-form continuous-time neural networks. This machine-learning-based method greatly improves the efficiency of calculating waveform templates for arbitrary source parameters, such as the binary mass ratio and the spins of component black holes. Based on this method, we present \textit{BHP2NRMLSur}, a class of models (including nonspinning and spin-aligned ones) that maps point-particle black hole perturbation theory waveforms into NR and surrogate waveforms. The nonspinning model provides highly accurate waveforms that match the NR waveforms to the level of $\gtrsim 0.995$. The spin-aligned model reduces the required input parameters and hence improves the efficiency of the waveform generation -- it takes a factor of $\sim 50$ less time than existing NR surrogate models to generate $100,000$ waveforms, with a mismatch of $&lt;0.01$ compared to the NR waveforms from the Simulating eXtreme Spacetimes collaboration.</description>

      <title>Impact of multi-messenger spectral modelling on blazar-neutrino associations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.04632</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.04632v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Blazars are interesting source candidates for astrophysical neutrino emission. Multi-messenger lepto-hadronic models based on proton-photon (p-gamma) interactions result in predictions for the neutrino spectra which are typically strongly peaked at high energies. In contrast, statistical analyses looking to associate blazars and neutrinos often assume a power-law spectral shape, putting the emphasis at lower energies. We aim to examine the impact of such spectral modelling assumptions on the associations of neutrinos with blazars. We use hierarchical_nu, a Bayesian framework for point source searches, and incorporate the theoretical predictions for neutrino spectra through a dedicated spectral model and priors on the relevant parameters. Our spectral model is based on the predictions presented in Rodrigues et al. (2024) for a selection of intermediate and high synchrotron peaked blazars that have been connected with IceCube neutrino alert events. We apply our model to the 10 years of publicly available IceCube data, focusing on the Northern hemisphere. Out of 29 source candidates, we find five sources, including TXS 0506+056, that have an association probability greater than 0.5 to at least one event. The p-gamma spectra typically lead to a lower overall number of associated events compared to the power-law case, but retain or even enhance strong associations to high-energy events. Our results demonstrate that including more information from theoretical predictions can allow for more interpretable source-neutrino connections.</description>

      <title>Simulating image coaddition with the Nancy Grace Roman Space Telescope: III. Software improvements and new linear algebra strategies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.05442</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.05442v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The Nancy Grace Roman Space Telescope will implement a devoted weak gravitational lensing program with its High Latitude Wide Area Survey. For cosmological purposes, a critical step in Roman image processing is to combine dithered undersampled images into unified oversampled images and thus enable high-precision shape measurements. IMCOM is an image coaddition algorithm which offers control over point spread functions in output images. This paper presents the refactored IMCOM software, featuring full object-oriented programming, improved data structures, and alternative linear algebra strategies for determining coaddition weights. Combining these improvements and other acceleration measures, to produce almost equivalent coadded images, the consumption of core-hours has been reduced by about an order of magnitude. We then re-coadd a $16 \times 16 \,{\rm arcmin}^2$ region of our previous image simulations with three linear algebra kernels in four bands, and compare the results in terms of IMCOM optimization goals, properties of coadded noise frames, and measurements of simulated stars. The Cholesky kernel is efficient and relatively accurate, yet its irregular windows for input pixels slightly bias coaddition results. The iterative kernel avoids this issue by tailoring input pixel selection for each output pixel; it yields better noise control, but can be limited by random errors due to finite tolerance. The empirical kernel coadds images using an empirical relation based on geometry; it is inaccurate, but being much faster, it provides a valid option for "quick look" purposes. We fine-tune IMCOM hyperparameters in a companion paper.</description>

      <title>Costs of Bayesian Parameter Estimation in Third-Generation Gravitational Wave Detectors: a Review of Acceleration Methods</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.02651</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.02651v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Bayesian inference with stochastic sampling has been widely used to obtain the properties of gravitational wave (GW) sources. Although computationally intensive, its cost remains manageable for current second-generation GW detectors because of the relatively low event rate and signal-to-noise ratio (SNR). The third-generation (3G) GW detectors are expected to detect hundreds of thousands of compact binary coalescence events every year with substantially higher SNR and longer signal duration, presenting significant computational challenges. In this study, we systematically evaluate the computational costs of source parameter estimation (PE) in the 3G era by modeling the PE time cost as a function of SNR and signal duration. We examine the standard PE method alongside acceleration methods including relative binning, multibanding, and reduced order quadrature. We predict that PE for a one-month-observation catalog with 3G detectors could require billions to quadrillions of CPU core hours with the standard PE method, whereas acceleration techniques can reduce this demand to millions of core hours. These findings highlight the necessity for more efficient PE methods to enable cost-effective and environmentally sustainable data analysis for 3G detectors. In addition, we assess the accuracy of accelerated PE methods, emphasizing the need for careful treatment in high-SNR scenarios.</description>

      <title>Magnetic Field Data Calibration with Transformer Model Using Physical Constraints: A Scalable Method for Satellite Missions, Illustrated by Tianwen-1</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.00020</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.00020v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This study introduces a novel approach that integrates the magnetic field data correction from the Tianwen-1 Mars mission with a neural network architecture constrained by physical principles derived from Maxwell's equation equations. By employing a Transformer based model capable of efficiently handling sequential data, the method corrects measurement anomalies caused by satellite dynamics, instrument interference, and environmental noise. As a result, it significantly improves both the accuracy and the physical consistency of the calibrated data. Compared to traditional methods that require long data segments and manual intervention often taking weeks or even months to complete this new approach can finish calibration in just minutes to hours, and predictions are made within seconds. This innovation not only accelerates the process of space weather modeling and planetary magnetospheric studies but also provides a robust framework for future planetary exploration and solar wind interaction research.</description>

      <title>Mind the gap: addressing data gaps and assessing noise mismodeling in LISA</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.17426</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.17426v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Due to the sheer complexity of the Laser Interferometer Space Antenna (LISA) space mission, data gaps arising from instrumental irregularities and/or scheduled maintenance are unavoidable. Focusing on merger-dominated massive black hole binary signals, we test the appropriateness of the Whittle-likelihood on gapped data in a variety of cases. From first principles, we derive the likelihood valid for gapped data in both the time and frequency domains. Cheap-to-evaluate proxies to p-p plots are derived based on a Fisher-based formalism, and verified through Bayesian techniques. Our tools allow to predict the altered variance in the parameter estimates that arises from noise mismodeling, as well as the information loss represented by the broadening of the posteriors. The result of noise mismodeling with gaps is sensitive to the characteristics of the noise model, with strong low-frequency (red) noise and strong high-frequency (blue) noise giving statistically significant fluctuations in recovered parameters. We demonstrate that the introduction of a tapering window reduces statistical inconsistency errors, at the cost of less precise parameter estimates. We also show that the assumption of independence between inter-gap segments appears to be a fair approximation even if the data set is inherently coherent. However, if one instead assumes fictitious correlations in the data stream, when the data segments are actually independent, then the resultant parameter recoveries could be inconsistent with the true parameters. The theoretical and numerical practices that are presented in this work could readily be incorporated into global-fit pipelines operating on gapped data.</description>

      <title>The impact of local noise recorded at the ET candidate sites on the signal to noise ratio of CBC gravitational wave signals for the ET triangle configuration</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.02166</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.02166v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present an evaluation of how site dependent noise can affect the signal to noise ratio (SNR) of compact binary coalescence (CBC) signals in the future 3rd generation gravitational wave (GW) detector Einstein Telescope (ET). The design of ET is currently pushing the scientific community to study its scientific potential with respect to known, and possibly unexpected, GW signals using its design sensitivity curves. However, local ambient noise may have an impact on the ET sensitivity at low frequency and therefore affect the SNR of CBC signals at low frequency. Therefore, we study the impact of ambient noise on the ET sensitivity curve at the two sites candidate to host ET - Sardinia, in Italy, and the Euregio Meuse-Rhine (EMR) at the Netherlands-Belgium border - and infer the impact on the ET sensitivity curve and how the SNR of CBC signals at low frequencies is affected. We find that Sardinia shows results which are on par, if not better, than the design case. On the other hand, ambient noise for the current EMR sensitivity curve in Terziet causes a higher degradation of the SNR performances.</description>

      <title>A Linear Decomposition Method to Analyze and Study Pulsar Mode Changes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.03452</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.03452v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we present the linear decomposition method (LDM), which we developed to detect and analyze pulsar profile variations and mode changing behaviour. We developed LDM utilizing the likelihood function approach assuming the Gaussian noise. The LDM projects pulse profiles onto significance-ordered orthonormal vector bases. We show that the method is similar to the principal component analysis (PCA), but LDM can handle more general situations. We use simulated dataset and data from the Kunming 40-m radio telescope to demonstrate the application of the LDM. We found that the LDM successfully identified mode changes for well-known mode-changing PSR B0329+54 and found a continuous pulse profile evolution for PSR B0355+54 . We also show that the LDM can be used to improve the timing precision for mode changing PSR B0329+54.</description>
