      <title>Transposed Poisson structures on Virasoro-type algebras</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.15532</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.15532v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We compute $\frac{1}{2}$-derivations on the deformed generalized Heisenberg-Virasoro algebras and on not-finitely graded Heisenberg-Virasoro algebras $\widehat{W}_n(G)$, $\widetilde{W}_n(G)$, and $\widetilde{HW}_n(G)$. We classify all transposed Poisson structures on such algebras.</description>

      <title>On generic properties of nilpotent algebras</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.15631</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.15631v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study general nilpotent algebras. The results obtained are new even for the classical algebras, such as associative or Lie algebras. We single out certain generic properties of finite-dimensional algebras, mostly over infinite fields. The notion of being generic in the class of $n$-generated algebras of an arbitrary primitive class of $c$-nilpotent algebras appears naturally in the following way. On the set of the isomorphism classes of such algebras one can introduce the structure of an algebraic variety. As a result, the subsets are endowed with the dimensions as algebraic varieties. A subset $Y$ of a set $X$ of lesser dimension can be viewed as negligible in $X$. For example, if $n\gg c$, we determine that an automorphism group of a generic algebra $P$ consists of the automorphisms, which are scalar modulo $P^2$. Generic ideals are in $I(P)$, the annihilator of $P$. In the case of classical nilpotent algebras as above, the generic algebras are graded by the degrees with respect to some generating sets.</description>

      <title>m-weak group inverse in a ring with proper involution</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.15745</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.15745v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The m-weak group inverse was recently studied in the literature. The purpose of this paper is to investigate new properties of this generalized inverse for ring elements. We introduce the m-weak group decomposition for a ring element and prove that it coincides with its m-weak group invertibility. We present the equivalent characterization of the m-weak group inverse by using a polar-like property. The relations between m-weak group inverse and core-EP inverse are also established. These give some new properties of the weak group inverse for complex matrices and ring elements.</description>

      <title>A scalar matching factor on the Birkhoff polytope characterizing permutation and uniform matrices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.16284</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.16284v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Birkhoff polytope is the set of all bistochastic matrices (also known as doubly stochastic matrices). Bistochastic matrices form a special class of stochastic matrices where each row and column sums up to one. Permutation matrices and uniform matrices are special extreme cases of bistochastic matrices. In this paper, we define a scalar quantity called the matching factor on the Birkhoff polytope. Given a bistochastic matrix, we define the matching factor by taking the product of the squares of the Euclidean norms of each row and column and show that permutation matrices and uniform matrices maximize and minimize the matching factor, respectively. We also extend this definition of scalar matching factor to a larger class of matrices and show similar maximization and minimization properties.</description>

      <title>Rota-Baxter operators of weight zero on Cayley-Dickson algebra</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.16312</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.16312v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: All Rota-Baxter operators of weight zero on split octonion algebra over a~field of characteristic not 2 are classified up to conjugation by automorphisms and antiautomorphisms. Thus, the classification of Rota-Baxter operators on composition algebras is finished. There are two descriptions: a~common description over arbitratry field of characteristic not 2 and more accurate description over a~quadratically closed field of characteristic not 2.</description>

      <title>A multiplicative surface signature through its Magnus expansion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.16856</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.16856v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the last decade, the concept of path signature has found great success in data science applications, where it provides features describing the path. This is partly explained by the fact that it is possible to compute the signature of a path in linear time, owing to a dynamic programming principle, based on Chen's identity.
  The path signature can be regarded as a specific example of product or time-/path-ordered integral. In other words, it can be seen as a 1-parameter object build on iterated integrals over a path.
  Increasing the number of parameters by one, which amounts to considering iterated integrals over surfaces, is more complicated. An observation that is familiar in the context of higher gauge theory where multiparameter iterated integrals play an important role.
  The 2-parameter case is naturally related to a non-commutative version of Stokes' theorem, which is understood to be fundamentally linked to the concept of crossed modules of groups. Indeed, crossed modules with non-trivial kernel of the feedback map permit to compute features of a surface that go beyond what can be expressed by computing line integrals along the boundary of a surface.
  A good candidate for the crossed analog of free Lie algebra then seems to be a certain free crossed module over it.
  Building on work by Kapranov, we study the analog to the classical path signature taking values in such a free crossed module of Lie algebra.
  In particular, we provide a Magnus-type expression for the logarithm of surface signature as well as a sewing lemma for the crossed module setting.</description>

      <title>Classification of the types for which every Hopf--Galois correspondence is bijective</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.15800</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.15800v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Let $L/K$ be any finite Galois extension with Galois group $G$. It is known by Chase and Sweedler that the Hopf--Galois correspondence is injective for every Hopf--Galois structure on $L/K$, but it need not be bijective in general. Hopf--Galois structures are known to be related to skew braces, and recently, the first-named author and Trappeniers proposed a new version of this connection with the property that the intermediate fields of $L/K$ in the image of the Hopf--Galois correspondence are in bijection with the left ideals of the associated skew brace. As an application, they classified the groups $G$ for which the Hopf--Galois correspondence is bijective for every Hopf--Galois structure on any $G$-Galois extension. In this paper, using a similar approach, we shall classify the groups $N$ for which the Hopf--Galois correspondence is bijective for every Hopf--Galois structure of type $N$ on any Galois extension.</description>

Abstract: We calculate the Fuglede-Kadison determinant of arbitrary matrix-valued semicircular operators in terms of the capacity of the corresponding covariance mapping. We also improve a lower bound by Garg, Gurvits, Oliveira, and Widgerson on this capacity, by making it dimension-independent.</description>

      <title>The derived dimensions and representation distances of artin algebras</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.16011v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: There is a well-known class of algebras called Igusa-Todorov algebras which were introduced in relation to finitistic dimension conjecture. As a generalization of Igusa-Todorov algebras, the new notion of $(m,n)$-Igusa-Todorov algebras provides a wider framework for studying derived dimensions. In this paper, we give a method for constructing $(m,n)$-Igusa-Todorov algebras. As an application, we present for general artin algebras a relationship between the derived dimension and the representation distance. Moreover, we end this paper to show that the main result can be used to give a better upper bound for the derived dimension for some classes of algebras.</description>

      <title>A study on the domain independence of the Laurent property, the irreducibility and the coprimeness in lattice equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.16043</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.16043v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the Laurent property, the irreducibility and the coprimeness for lattice equations (partial difference equations), mainly focusing on how the choice of initial value problem (the choice of domain) affects these properties. We show that these properties do not depend on the choice of domain as long as they are considered together. In other words, these properties are inherent to a difference equation. Applying our result, we discuss the reductions of lattice equations. We show that any reduction of a Laurent system, even if the lattices have torsion elements, preserves the Laurent property.</description>

Abstract: We define the notion of loop torsors under certain group  schemes defined over the localization of a regularhenselian ring A at a strict normal crossing divisor D. We provide a Galois cohomological criterion for classifying those torsors. We revisit also the  related theory of loop torsors on Laurent polynomial rings.</description>

      <title>On 3-generated axial algebras of Jordan type half</title>

      <description>arXiv:2309.10680v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Axial algebras of Jordan type $\eta$ are a special type of commutative non-associative algebras. They are generated by idempotents whose adjoint operators have the minimal polynomial dividing $(x-1)x(x-\eta)$, where $\eta$ is a fixed value that is not equal to $0$ or $1$. These algebras have restrictive multiplication rules that generalize the Peirce decomposition for idempotents in Jordan algebras. A universal $3$-generated algebra of Jordan type $\frac{1}{2}$ as an algebra with $4$ parameters was constructed by I. Gorshkov and A. Staroletov. Depending on the value of the parameter, the universal algebra may contain a non-trivial form radical. In this paper, we describe all semisimple $3$-generated algebras of Jordan type $\frac{1}{2}$ over a quadratically closed field.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.15868v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Using the braided version of Lawvere's algebraic theories and Mac Lane's PROPs, we introduce polynomial identities for arbitrary algebraic structures in a braided monoidal category C as well as their codimensions in the case when C is linear over some field. The new cases include coalgebras, bialgebras, Hopf algebras, braided vector spaces, Yetter-Drinfel'd modules, etc. We find bases for polynomial identities and calculate codimensions in some important particular cases.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2303.08677v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Relying on the notions of submodular function and partial metric, we introduce normed inverse semigroups as a generalization of normed groups and sup-semilattices equipped with an upper valuation. We define the property of skew-convexity for a metric on an inverse semigroup, and prove that every norm on a Clifford semigroup gives rise to a right-subinvariant and skew-convex metric; it makes the semigroup into a Hausdorff topological inverse semigroup if the norm is cyclically permutable. Conversely, we show that every Clifford monoid equipped with a right-subinvariant and skew-convex metric admits a norm for which the metric topology and the norm topology coincide. We characterize convergence of nets and show that Cauchy completeness implies conditional monotone completeness with respect to the natural partial order of the inverse semigroup.</description>
