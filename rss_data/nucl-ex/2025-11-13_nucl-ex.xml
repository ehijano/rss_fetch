      <title>$\beta^+$ radioactive nuclei created during proton therapy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.09468</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.09468v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: During proton therapy, the beam flux decreases due to inelastic interactions with nuclei. At the highest energies used in proton therapy around 25\% protons initiate nuclear reactions. This report presents the cross section measurements of proton-induced production of three $\beta^+$ emitters -- $^{11}$C, $^{13}$N, $^{15}$O -- with half-lives between 2 and 20 minutes, using solid C, BN and SiO$_2$ targets. Stacks of up to 15 targets were irradiated simultaneously with proton beams of kinetic energy below 58 MeV at the AIC-144 cyclotron of the Institute of Nuclear Physics, Polish Academy of Sciences. The measured cross sections follow the excitation function obtained in the previous experiments, with uncertainty of a few percent.</description>

      <title>Electromagnetic Radiation from Baryon-Rich Matter in Heavy-Ion Collisions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.08773</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.08773v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We perform a study of electromagnetic radiation in heavy-ion collisions at Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider (RHIC) Beam Energy Scan (BES) and SPS energies using the iEBE-MUSIC framework, which includes 3D dynamical Monte Carlo Glauber initial conditions, MUSIC (3+1)D viscous relativistic hydrodynamics, and the UrQMD hadronic afterburner. The multistage modeling has been calibrated to hadronic data at RHIC-BES energies using a Bayesian analysis. Integrating the thermal photon emission rates with the medium evolution, we study the direct photon yield and elliptic flow and how they vary with collision energy and emission source. We compare with results obtained by the STAR and PHENIX Collaborations. We employ next-to-leading order thermal QCD dilepton emission rates to compute dilepton invariant mass spectra and extract the effective temperature of the quark-gluon plasma at different collision energies.</description>

      <title>Commissioning the Resonance ionization Spectroscopy Experiment at FRIB</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.08881</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.08881v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This manuscript reports on the commissioning of the Resonance ionization Spectroscopy Experiment (RISE) at the BECOLA facility at FRIB. The new instrument implements the collinear resonance ionization spectroscopy technique for sensitive measurements of isotope shifts and hyperfine structure of short-lived isotopes produced at FRIB. The existing BECOLA beamline was extended to integrate an electrostatic ion-beam bender and an ion detector at ultra-high vacuum. An injection-seeded Ti:Sapphire laser, as well as a multi-harmonic pulsed Nd:YAG laser were installed to perform resonant excitation and selective ionization. Commissioning tests were performed to demonstrate the capabilities of the new instrument by measuring the hyperfine structure of stable $^{27}$Al produced in an offline ion source. The RISE instrument is ready and operational for future studies of short-lived isotopes at FRIB.</description>

      <title>Nuclear shape dynamics in low-energy heavy-ion reactions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.09078</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.09078v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We discuss recent theoretical developments in low-energy heavy-ion reactions. To this end, we put emphasis on a viewpoint of probing nuclear shapes with heavy-ion reactions. We first discuss a single-channel problem with an optical potential model. We particularly discuss a microscopic modeling of the imaginary part of an optical potential as well as a visualization of quantum interference phenomena observed in heavy-ion elastic scattering. We then discuss multi-channel scattering problems, and demonstrate that heavy-ion fusion reactions at energies around the Coulomb barrier are sensitive to the shape of colliding nuclei, providing a powerful tool to probe nuclear shapes. We finally point out that relativistic heavy-ion collisions have large similarities to low-energy heavy-ion reactions in the context of nuclear shape dynamics.</description>

      <title>Explaining higher-order correlations between elliptic and triangular flow</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.09283</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.09283v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The ALICE Collaboration has analyzed a number of cumulants mixing elliptic flow ($v_2$) and triangular flow ($v_3$), involving up to $8$ particles, in Pb+Pb collisions at the LHC. We unravel an unexpected simplicity in these complex mathematical quantities for collisions at fixed impact parameter. We show that as one increases the order in $v_2$, for a given order in $v_3$, the changes in the cumulants are solely determined by the mean elliptic flow in the reaction plane, which originates from the almond-shaped geometry of the overlap area between the colliding nuclei. We derive simple analytic relations between cumulants of different orders on this basis. Some of these relations are in reasonable agreement with existing data. We postulate that agreement will be much improved if the analysis is repeated with a finer centrality binning and a larger pseudorapidity acceptance.</description>

      <title>Burnup Measurement using Bent Crystal Diffraction Spectrometers for Pebble Bed Reactors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.08835</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.08835v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Burnup measurement is essential for monitoring and controlling pebble bed reactors (PBRs), where fuel pebbles circulate rapidly through the core. However, conventional gamma spectroscopy using high purity germanium (HPGe) detectors is difficult due to high activity levels in discharge pebbles, leading to excessive dead time and Compton scattering. This study explores the use of bent crystal diffraction (BCD) spectrometers to filter the emitted gamma spectrum and isolate key peaks for improved measurement accuracy and speed. Pebble wise depletion calculations were performed and the resulting spectra were analyzed using ray tracing (SHADOW3) and gamma response modeling (GADRAS). Key isotopes, $^{137m}$Ba/$^{137}$Cs, $^{239}$Pu, $^{144}$Ce, $^{148m}$Pm, and $^{140}$La, were found to strongly correlate with burnup, residence time, core passes, plutonium production, and fluence. Machine learning regression models applied to simulated spectra achieved a coefficient of determination ($R^2$) as high as 0.995 for burnup prediction. Among various BCD configurations, mosaic silicon crystals in the (440) orientation combined with an HPGe detector provided optimal performance for $^{137m}$Ba, while (220) and (440) configurations paired with scintillators were effective for the remaining isotopes.</description>
