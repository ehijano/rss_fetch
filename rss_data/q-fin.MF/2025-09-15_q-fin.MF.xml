      <title>The Interplay between Utility and Risk in Portfolio Selection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.10351</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.10351v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We revisit the problem of portfolio selection, where an investor maximizes utility subject to a risk constraint. Our framework is very general and accommodates a wide range of utility and risk functionals, including non-concave utilities such as S-shaped utilities from prospect theory and non-convex risk measures such as Value at Risk. Our main contribution is a novel and complete characterization of well-posedness for utility-risk portfolio selection in one period that takes the interplay between the utility and the risk objectives fully into account. We show that under mild regularity conditions the minimal necessary and sufficient condition for well-posedness is given by a very simple either-or criterion: either the utility functional or the risk functional need to satisfy the axiom of sensitivity to large losses. This allows to easily describe well-posedness or ill-posedness for many utility-risk pairs, which we illustrate by a large number of examples. In the special case of expected utility maximization without a risk constraint (but including non-concave utilities), we show that well-posedness is fully characterised by the asymptotic loss-gain ratio, a simple and interpretable quantity that describes the investor's asymptotic relative weighting of large losses versus large gains.</description>

      <title>An Axiomatic Risk-Reward Framework for Sustainable Investing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.05866</link>
      <description>arXiv:2309.05866v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Continued interest in sustainable investing calls for an axiomatic approach to measures of risk and reward that focus not only on financial returns, but also on measures of environmental and social sustainability, i.e. environmental, social, and governance (ESG) scores. We propose definitions for ESG-coherent risk measures and ESG reward-risk ratios based on functions of bivariate random variables that are applied to financial returns and real-time ESG scores, extending the traditional univariate measures to the ESG case. We provide examples and present an empirical analysis in which the ESG-coherent risk measures and ESG reward-risk ratios are used to rank stocks.</description>
