      <description>arXiv:2404.10919v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The evolution of complex correlated quantum systems such as random circuit networks is governed by the dynamical buildup of both entanglement and entropy. We here introduce a real-time field theory approach -- essentially a fusion of the $G \Sigma$-functional of the SYK-model and the field theory of disordered systems -- enigneered to microscopically describe the full range of such crossover dynamics: from initial product states to a maximum entropy ergodic state. To showcase this approach in the simplest nontrivial setting, we consider a tensor product of coupled random matrices, and compare to exact diagonalization.</description>

      <title>Non-Hermitian zero-energy pinning of Andreev and Majorana bound states in superconductor-semiconductor systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.11026</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.11026v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The emergence of Majorana bound states in finite length superconductor-semiconductor hybrid systems has been predicted to occur in the form of oscillatory energy levels with parity crossings around zero energy. Each zero-energy crossing is expected to produce a quantized zero-bias conductance peak but several studies have reported conductance peaks pinned at zero energy over a range of Zeeman fields, whose origin, however, is not clear. In this work we consider superconducting systems with spin-orbit coupling under a Zeeman field and demonstrate that non-Hermitian effects, due to coupling to ferromagnet leads, induce zero-energy pinning of Majorana and trivial Andreev bound states. We find that this zero-energy pinning effect occurs due to the formation of non-Hermitian spectral degeneracies known as exceptional points, whose emergence can be controlled by the interplay of non-Hermiticity, the applied Zeeman field, and chemical potentials. Moreover, depending on the non-Hermitian spatial profile, we find that non-Hermiticity changes the single point Hermitian topological phase transition into a flattened zero energy line bounded by exceptional points from multiple low energy levels. This seemingly innocent change notably enables a gap closing well below the Hermitian topological phase transition, which can be in principle simpler to achieve. Furthermore, we reveal that the energy gap separating Majorana and trivial Andreev bound states from the quasicontinuum remains robust for the values that give rise to the zero-energy pinning effect. While reasonable values of non-Hermiticity can be indeed beneficial, very strong non-Hermitian effects can be detrimental as it might destroy superconductivity. Our findings can be therefore useful for understanding the zero-energy pinning of trivial and topological states in Majorana devices.</description>

      <title>Transition between scattering regimes of 2D electron transport</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.11353</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.11353v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We examine 2D electron transport through a long narrow channel driven by an external electric field in presence of diffusive boundary scattering. At zero temperature, we derive an analytical solution of the transition from ballistic to diffusive transport if we increase the bulk disorder strength. This crossover yields characteristic current density profiles. Furthermore, we illustrate the current density in the transition from ballistic to hydrodynamic transport. This corresponds to the Gurzhi effect in the resistivity. We also study the influence of finite temperature on current densities and average current in this system. In particular, we analyze how different scaling laws of scattering with respect to temperature affect the current profile along the channel.</description>

      <title>Revealing the spatial nature of sublattice symmetry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.11398</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.11398v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The sublattice symmetry on a bipartite lattice is commonly regarded as the chiral symmetry in the AIII class of the tenfold Altland--Zirnbauer classification. Here, we reveal the spatial nature of sublattice symmetry, and show that this assertion holds only if the periodicity of primitive unit cells agrees with that of the sublattice labeling. In cases where the periodicity does not agree, sublattice symmetry is represented as a glide reflection in energy--momentum space, which inverts energy and simultaneously translates some $k$ by $\pi$, leading to substantially different physics. Particularly, it introduces novel constraints on zero modes in semimetals and completely alters the classification table of topological insulators compared to class AIII. Notably, the dimensions corresponding to trivial and nontrivial classifications are switched, and the nontrivial classification becomes $\mathbb{Z}_2$ instead of $\mathbb{Z}$. We have applied these results to several models, including the Hofstadter model both with and without dimerization.</description>

      <title>Dynamical Detection of Topological Spectral Density</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.11402</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.11402v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Local density of states (LDOS) is emerging as powerful means of exploring synthetic topological phases. However, the current LDOS detection method remains rare and merely works for static situations. Here, we introduce a generic dynamical method to detect both the static and Floquet LDOS, based on an elegant connection between dynamics of chiral density and local spectral densities. Moreover, we find that the Floquet LDOS allows to measure out Floquet quasienergy spectra and identify topological $\pi$ modes. As an example, we demonstrate that both the static and Floquet higher-order topological phase can be universally identified via LDOS detection, regardless of whether the topological corner modes are in energy gaps, bands or continue energy spectra without bandgaps. Our study opens a new avenue utilizing dynamics to detect topological spectral densities and provides a universal approach of identifying static and Floquet topological phases.</description>

      <title>Efficient system for bulk characterization of cryogenic CMOS components</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.11451v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Semiconductor integrated circuits operated at cryogenic temperature will play an essential role in quantum computing architectures. These can offer equivalent or superior performance to their room-temperature counterparts while enabling a scaling up of the total number of qubits under control. Silicon integrated circuits can be operated at a temperature stage of a cryogenic system where cooling power is sufficient ($\sim$3.5+ K) to allow for analog signal chain components (e.g. amplifiers and mixers), local signal synthesis, signal digitization, and control logic. A critical stage in cryo-electronics development is the characterization of individual transistor devices in a particular technology node at cryogenic temperatures. This data enables the creation of a process design kit (PDK) to model devices and simulate integrated circuits operating well below the minimum standard temperature ranges covered by foundry-released models (e.g. -55 {\deg}C). Here, an efficient approach to the characterization of large numbers of components at cryogenic temperature is reported. We developed a system to perform DC measurements with Kelvin sense of individual transistors at 4.2 K using integrated on-die multiplexers, enabling bulk characterization of thousands of devices with no physical change to the measurement setup.</description>

      <title>Exciton-Phonon Coupling in Single Band-Gap Engineered ZnCdSe-Dot/CdS-Rod Nanocrystals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.11516</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.11516v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Exciton-phonon coupling limits the homogeneous emission linewidth of nanocrystals. Hence, a full understanding of it is crucial. In this work, we statistically investigate exciton-phonon coupling by performing single-particle spectroscopy on Zn$_{1-x}$Cd$_{x}$Se/CdS dot-in-rod nanocrystals at cryogenic temperatures ($T\approx 10~\rm{K}$). In situ cation exchange enables us to analyze different band alignments and thereby different charge-carrier distributions. We find that the relative intensities of the longitudinal optical S- and Se-type phonon replicas correlate with the charge-carrier distribution. Our experimental findings are complemented with quantum mechanical calculations within the effective mass approximation that hint at the relevance of surface charges.</description>

      <title>Higher Hall conductivity from a single wave function: Obstructions to symmetry-preserving gapped edge of (2+1)D topological order</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.10814</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.10814v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A (2+1)D topological ordered phase with U(1) symmetry may or may not have a symmetric gapped edge state, even if both thermal and electric Hall conductivity are vanishing. It is recently discovered that there are "higher" versions of Hall conductivity valid for fermionic fractional quantum Hall (FQH) states, which obstructs symmetry-preserving gapped edge state beyond thermal and electric Hall conductivity. In this paper, we show that one can extract higher Hall conductivity from a single wave function of an FQH state, by evaluating the expectation value of the "partial rotation" unitary which is a combination of partial spatial rotation and a U(1) phase rotation. This result is verified numerically with the fermionic Laughlin state with $\nu=1/3$, $1/5$, as well as the non-Abelian Moore-Read state. Together with topological entanglement entropy, we prove that the expectation values of the partial rotation completely determines if a bosonic/fermionic Abelian topological order with U(1) symmetry has a symmetry-preserving gappable edge state or not. Even in non-Abelian FQH states, partial rotation provides the Lieb-Schultz-Mattis type theorem constraining the low-energy spectrum of the bulk-boundary system. The generalization of higher Hall conductivity to the case with Lie group symmetry is also presented.</description>

      <title>Extensive Long-Range Entanglement at Finite Temperatures from a Nonequilibrium Bias</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.10822</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.10822v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Thermal equilibrium states of local quantum many-body systems are notorious for their spatially decaying correlations, which place severe restrictions on the types of many-body entanglement structures that may be observed at finite temperatures. These restrictions may however be defied when an out-of-equilibrium steady state is considered instead. In this paper, we study the entanglement properties of free fermions on a one-dimensional lattice that contains a generic charge- and energy-conserving noninteracting impurity, and that is connected at its edges to two reservoirs with different equilibrium energy distributions. These distributions may differ in either temperature, chemical potential, or both, thereby inducing an external bias. We analytically derive exact asymptotic expressions for several quantum information measures -- the mutual information, its R\'enyi generalizations, and the fermionic negativity -- that quantify the correlation and entanglement between two subsystems located on opposite sides of the impurity. We show that all these measures scale (to a leading order) linearly with the overlap between one subsystem and the mirror image of the other (upon reflection of the latter about the impurity), independently of the distance between the subsystems. While a simple proportionality relation between the negativity and R\'enyi versions of the mutual information is observed to hold at zero temperature, it breaks down at finite temperatures, suggesting that these quantities represent strong long-range correlations of different origins. Our results generalize previous findings that were limited to the case of a chemical-potential bias at zero temperature, rigorously demonstrating that the effect of long-range volume-law entanglement is robust at finite temperatures.</description>

      <title>Multiple charge-density-wave gaps in LaSbTe and CeSbTe as revealed by ultrafast spectroscopy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.11154</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.11154v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Utilizing ultrafast time-resolved pump-probe spectroscopy measurements, we investigate the photoinduced quasiparticle dynamics of the topological materials LaSbTe and CeSbTe. In LaSbTe, the relaxation of quasiparticles is dominated by two different mechanisms: electron-phonon coupling, and phonon-assisted electron-hole recombination. Significantly, the amplitude of photoinduced reflectivity related to the former one shows two pronounced peaks at 156 K and 263 K, indicating the occurrence of two charge density wave (CDW) phase transitions. The ultrafast responses of CeSbTe share a lot of similarities with LaSbTe, and an additional CDW phase transition at 154 K is revealed in CeSbTe. However, the slower relaxation of CeSbTe exhibits an exotic behavior that deviates from the typical phonon-assisted electron-hole recombination process, probably due to the imbalance between the electron- and hole-type carriers. Unlike LaSbTe, the relaxation times of CeSbTe vary slightly with the pump power, inferring the possible participation of 4$f$ electron in the decay process. In addition, two oscillation modes around 1 THz and 3 THz are identified in both LaSbTe and CeSbTe, which are mostly likely to be coherent phonon modes. These findings unravel the existence of multiple CDW orders in LaSbTe and CeSbTe, offering insights into the underlying physics of these systems.</description>

      <title>Texture tomography, a versatile framework to study crystalline texture in 3D</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.11195</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.11195v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The crystallographic texture is a key organization feature of many technical and biological materials. In these materials, especially hierarchically structured ones, the preferential alignment of the nano constituents is heavily influencing the macroscopic behaviour of the material. In order to study local crystallographic texture with both high spatial and angular resolution, we developed Texture tomography (TexTOM). This approach allows to model the diffraction data of polycrystalline materials by using the full reciprocal space of the ensemble of crystals and describe the texture in each voxel via a orientation distribution function. This means, it provides 3D reconstructions of the local texture by measuring the probabilities of all crystal orientations. The TexTOM approach addresses limitations associated with existing models: It correlates the intensities from several Bragg reflections, thus reduces ambiguities resulting from symmetry. Further, it yields quantitative probability distributions of local real space crystal orientations without further assumptions on the sample structure. Finally, its efficient mathematical formulation enables reconstructions faster than the time-scale of the experiment. In this manuscript, we present the mathematical model, the inversion strategy and its current experimental implementation. We show characterizations of simulated data as well as experimental data obtained from a synthetic, inorganic model sample, the silica-witherite biomorph. In conclusion, Tex-TOM provides a versatile framework to reconstruct 3D quantitative texture information for polycrystalline samples. In this way, it opens the door for unprecedented insights into the nanostructural makeup of natural and technical materials.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.11421v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Within the first principle calculations, we propose a boron and nitrogen cluster incorporated graphene system for efficient valley polarization. The broken spatial inversion symmetry results in high Berry curvature at K and K' valleys of the hexagonal Brillouin zone in this semiconducting system. The consideration of excitonic quasiparticles within GW approximation along with their scattering processes within many-body Bethe-Salpeter equation gives rise to an optical gap of 1.72 eV with an excitonic binding energy of 0.65 eV. Owing to the negligible intervalley scattering, the electrons in opposite valleys are selectively excited by left- and right-handed circular polarized lights, as evident from the oscillator strength calculations. Therefore, this system can exhibit circular-dichroism valley Hall effect in the presence of the in-plane electric field. Moreover, such excitonic qubits can be exploited for information processing.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.11462v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Dual-emissive nanorods with fluorescence in both, the visible and infrared range are prepared by a combination of a CdSe-nanocrystal-seeded growth of CdS nanorods, and a successive partial Cd-to-Pb cation exchange. We show that the exchange reaction, which involves Pb halides in oleylamine, starts at the tip of the rods, leading to the formation of CdSe-dot/CdS-rod/PbS-dot nanocrystals (DRDs). Besides these DRDs, the reaction product also contains shorter nanorods and spherical quantum dots. Their fraction strongly depend on the amount of lead halide precursor and the reaction time. The reaction mechanism is investigated in detail, such that by carefully adjusting the reaction conditions, it is possible to synthesize DRDs of distinct PbS-dot sizes with yields over 95%. The resulting DRDs are crystalline and show a CdSe-fluorescence band in the visible range at 600 nm, and also a fluorescence band in the NIR at 1440 nm, resulting from the PbS part of the rods.</description>

Abstract: Identifying and controlling decoherence in single electron sources (SES) is important for their applications in quantum information processing. The recent experiments with ultrashort electron pulses [J. D. Fletcher et al., Nat. Commun. 10, 5298 (2019)] demonstrate strong decoherence that cannot be caused by traditional mechanisms such as electron-electron or electron-phonon interactions. Here we propose timing noise as a universal model, consistent with existing experimental data, to explain strong decoherence of ultrafast SES pulses, without resorting to any specific microscopic mechanism for such decoherence. We also propose a protocol to filter out timing noise which works even in the presence of other decoherence effects, such as those present in, e.g., low-energy SESs.</description>

Abstract: Controlling zero bias anomalies in magnetic atoms provides a promising strategy to engineer tunable quantum many-body excitations. Here we show how two different quantum impurities featuring spinaron and Kondo excitations can be controlled via quantum confinement engineering by using circular quantum corrals on a Ag(111) surface. In corrals built from both Ag and Co adatoms, the width of the zero bias anomaly in the central Co adatom oscillates as a function of corral radius with a period of half of the Ag(111) surface state wavelength. Parameters extracted for Co/Ag(111) show only small differences in extracted spinaron zero-bias anomaly between corral walls built from Ag or Co adatoms. In quantum corrals occupied with metal-free phthalocyanine, a $S=1/2$ Kondo system, we observe notable changes in the zero bias anomaly lineshape as a function of corral radius.

      <title>Skyrmion on Magnetic Tunnel Junction: Interweaving Quantum Transport with Micro-magnetism</title>

Abstract: Over the last two decades, non-trivial magnetic textures, especially the magnetic skyrmion family, have been extensively explored out of fundamental interest, and diverse possible applications. Given the possible technological and scientific ramifications of skyrmion-texture on magnetic tunnel junction (ST-MTJ), in this work, we present non-equilibrium Green's function (NEGF) based description of ST-MTJs both for N\'eel and Bloch textures, to capture the spin/charge current across different voltages, temperatures, and sizes. We predict the emergence of a textured spin current from the uniform layer of the ST-MTJs, along with a radially varying, asymmetrical voltage dependence of spin torque. We delineate the voltage-induced rotation of the spin current texture, coupled with the appearance of helicity in spin current, particularly in the case of N\'eel skyrmions on MTJs. We describe the TMR roll-off in ST-MTJ with lower cross-sectional area and higher temperature based on transmission spectra analysis. We also introduce a computationally efficient coupled spatio-eigen framework of NEGF to address the 3D-NEGF requirement of the ST-MTJs. With analytical underpinning, we establish the generic nature of the spatio-eigen framework of NEGF, alleviating the sine-qua-non of the 3D-NEGF for systems that lack transnational invariance and simultaneous eigen-basis in the transverse directions.</description>

      <title>Anyon braiding and telegraph noise in a graphene interferometer</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.18983</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.18983v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The search for anyons, quasiparticles with fractional charge and exotic exchange statistics, has inspired decades of condensed matter research. Quantum Hall interferometers enable direct observation of the anyon braiding phase via discrete interference phase jumps when the quasiparticle number changes. Here, we observe the universal anyonic braiding phase in both the $\nu = 1/3$ and $4/3$ fractional quantum Hall states by probing three-state random telegraph noise (RTN) in real-time. We find that the observed RTN stems from anyon quasiparticle number $n$ fluctuations and reconstruct three Aharonov-Bohm oscillation signals phase shifted by $2\pi/3$, corresponding to the three possible interference branches from braiding around $n$ (mod 3) anyons. Hence, we fully characterize the anyon exchange statistics using new methods that can readily extend to non-abelian states.</description>

      <title>Electronic states and quantum transport in bilayer graphene Sierpinski-carpet fractals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.10333</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.10333v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We construct Sierpinski-carpet (SC) based on AA or AB bilayer graphene by atom vacancies, namely, SC-AA and SC-AB, to investigate the effects of interlayer coupling on the electronic properties of fractals. Compared with monolayer graphene SC, their density of states have similar features, such as Van-Hove singularities and edge states corresponding to the central peaks near zero energy, but remarkable energy broadening of edge states emerges in SC-AA(AB). Calculated conductance spectrum shows that the conductance fluctuations still hold the Hausdorff fractal dimension behavior even with the interlayer coupling. Thus, the high correlation between quantum conductance and fractal geometry dimension is not affected by the interlayer coupling in bilayer graphene SC. We further reveal the quasi-eigenstates in fractal-like pressure-modulated bilayer graphene, namely, SC-pAA and SC-pAB. Numerical results show that the density of states of SC-pAA(pAB) show an asymptotic behavior to those of SC-AA(AB) especially for high energy quasi-eigenstates. Within a certain energy range, stronger pressure can lead to stronger localization, forming an efficient fractal space.</description>

      <title>Nonthermal electron-photon steady states in open cavity quantum materials</title>

      <description>arXiv:2312.17436v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Coupling a system to two different baths can lead to novel phenomena escaping the constraints of thermal equilibrium. In quantum materials inside optical cavities, this feature can be exploited as electrons and cavity-photons are easily pulled away from their mutual equilibrium, even in the steady state. This offers new routes for a non-invasive control of material properties and functionalities. We show that the absence of thermal equilibrium between electrons and photons leads to reduced symmetries of the steady-state electronic distribution function. Moreover, by defining an effective temperature from the on-shell distribution function, we find a non-monotonic behaviour as a function of cavity frequency, consistent with recent experimental findings. Finally, we show that, the non-thermal behaviour leads to qualitative modifications of the material's properties, as the standard Sommerfeld expansion for observables is modified by a leading-order correction linearly proportional to the temperature difference between the two baths and to the frequency-derivative of the electron damping.</description>

      <title>Theory of Majorana zero modes in unconventional superconductors</title>

Abstract: Majorana fermions are spin-1/2 neutral particles that are their own antiparticles and were initially predicted by Ettore Majorana in particle physics but their observation still remains elusive. The concept of Majorana fermions has been borrowed into condensed matter physics, where, unlike particle physics, Majorana fermions emerge as zero-energy quasiparticles that can be engineered by combining electrons and holes and have therefore been coined Majorana zero modes. In this review, we provide a pedagogical explanation of the basic properties of Majorana zero modes in unconventional superconductors and their consequences in experimental observables, putting a special emphasis on the initial theoretical discoveries. In particular, we first show that Majorana zero modes are self-conjugated and emerge as a special type of zero energy surface Andreev bound states at the boundary of unconventional superconductors. We then explore Majorana zero modes in one-dimensional spin-polarized $p$-wave superconductors, where we address the formation of topological superconductivity and the physical realization in superconductor-semiconductor hybrids. In this part we highlight that Majorana quasiparticles appear as zero-energy edge states, exhibiting charge neutrality, spin-polarized, and spatial nonlocality as unique properties that can be already seen from their energies and wavefunctions. Next, we discuss analytically obtained Green's functions of $p$-wave superconductors and demonstrate that the emergence of Majorana zero modes is always accompanied by the formation of odd-frequency spin-triplet pairing as a unique result of the self-conjugate nature of Majorana zero modes. We finally address the signatures of Majorana zero modes in tunneling spectroscopy, including the anomalous proximity effect, and the phase-biased Josephson effect.</description>

      <title>Dynamic magnetic phase transition induced by parametric magnon pumping</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.09521</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.09521v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Uncovering pathways to optically drive magnetic order-disorder transitions on ultrashort timescales can lead to the realization of novel out-of-equilibrium quantum phenomena. A long-sought pathway is to directly excite a highly non-thermal energy-momentum distribution of magnons, bypassing both charge and lattice degrees of freedom. However, this remains elusive owing to the weak coupling and large momentum mismatch between photons and magnons. Here we demonstrate strong parametric excitation of magnons across the entire Brillouin zone of the antiferromagnetic insulator Sr$_2$Cu$_3$O$_4$Cl$_2$ by periodically modulating the superexchange interaction with the electric field of light. The excitation efficiency is greatly enhanced by tuning to the van Hove singularity in the magnon spectrum, sufficient to transiently collapse the antiferromagnetic state using a pulsed laser field of 10$^9$ V/m. The order parameter recovery timescale increases by over 1000 times as a function of excitation density, reflecting a crossover from high- to low-energy magnon dominated decay dynamics. This electric-field induced parametric magnon pumping mechanism is applicable to a broad range of magnetic insulators and opens up the possibility of dynamically engineering magnon distributions by design.</description>
