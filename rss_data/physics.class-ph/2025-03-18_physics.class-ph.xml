      <title>An On-Chip Ultra-wideband Antenna with Area-Bandwidth Optimization for Sub-Terahertz Transceivers and Radars</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.13481</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.13481v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we present an on-chip antenna at 290 GHz that achieves a maximum efficiency of 42\% on a low-resistivity silicon substrate for sub-terahertz integrated transceivers. The proposed antenna is based on a dual-slot structure to accommodate a limited ground plane and maintain desired radiation and impedance characteristics across the target frequency range. The antenna impedance bandwidth reaches 39\% with compact physical dimensions of 0.24$\lambda_0\times$0.42$\lambda_0$. Simulation and measurement results confirm its promising antenna performance for potential transceiver and radar applications.</description>

      <title>Thermodynamic uncertainty relations for three-terminal systems with broken time-reversal symmetry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.13851</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.13851v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the thermodynamic uncertainty relations (TURs) in steady-state transport for three-terminal systems within the linear response regime, specifically in the presence of broken time-reversal symmetry. To quantify the TUR, we introduce a dimensionless trade-off parameter $Q_J$, and derive new bounds of $Q_J$ for both particle and heat currents under a strong constraint on the Onsager coefficients. Furthermore, we determine a universal lower bound $Q_J^{bound}\geq1.5$ for three-terminal systems in the linear response regime when the time-reversal symmetry is broken.</description>

      <title>Electromagnetic Duality Symmetry-Protected Dirac-Like Cones</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.14155</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.14155v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Dirac-like cones, featuring conical linear dispersions intersecting with flat bands, typically arise from accidental degeneracy of multiple modes that requires precise tuning of material and structural parameters, inherently limiting their robustness and applications. In this work, by introducing electromagnetic duality symmetry into photonic crystals, we demonstrate the emergence of intrinsically robust deterministic Dirac-like cones. We show that such symmetry (achieved through either self-dual particles or non-self-dual particle clusters with duality-glide symmetry) enforces double degeneracies for band structures of photonic crystals. Furthermore, by harnessing the joint duality-structural symmetry, multiple deterministic Dirac-like cones exhibiting exceptional resilience to lattice size variations can be obtained. Our introduction of an extra symmetry into photonic crystals establishes a profound connection between duality symmetry and Dirac physics, providing a robust platform for advanced photonic band engineering.</description>

      <title>On Laplace equation solution in orthogonal similar oblate spheroidal coordinates</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.17063</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.17063v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Orthogonal coordinate systems enable expressing the boundary conditions of differential equations in accord with the physical boundaries of the problem. It can significantly simplify calculations. The orthogonal similar oblate spheroidal (SOS) coordinate system can be particularly useful for a physical processes description inside or in the vicinity of the bodies or particles with the geometry of an oblate spheroid. The interior solution of the Laplace equation in the SOS coordinates was recently found; however, the exterior solution was missing. The exterior solution of the azimuthally symmetric Laplace equation in the SOS coordinates is derived. In the steps leading to this solution, important formulas of the SOS algebra are found. Various forms of the Laplace operator in the SOS coordinates in azimuthally symmetric case are shown. General transformation between two different SOS coordinate systems is derived. It is determined that the SOS harmonics are physically the same as the solid harmonics. Further, a formula expressing any generalized Legendre polynomial as a finite sum of monomials is found. The reported relations have potential application in geophysics, astrophysics, electrostatics and solid state physics (e.g. ferroic inclusions).</description>
