      <title>Adaptive Diffusion Models for Motion-corrected Cone-beam Head CT</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.14033</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.14033v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Cone-beam computed tomography (CBCT) is a versatile imaging modality widely used in head and neck diagnostics due to its accessibility and lower radiation dose. However, its relatively long acquisition times make it susceptible to patient motion, especially under sparse-view settings used to reduce dose, which can result in severe image artifacts. In this work, we propose a novel framework, joint reconstruction and motion estimation (JRM) with adaptive diffusion model (ADM), that simultaneously addresses motion compensation and sparse-view reconstruction in head CBCT. Leveraging recent advances in diffusion-based generative models, our method integrates a wavelet-domain diffusion prior into an iterative reconstruction pipeline to guide the solution toward anatomically plausible volumes while estimating rigid motion parameters in a blind fashion. We evaluate our method on simulated motion-affected CBCT data derived from real clinical computed tomography (CT) volumes. Experimental results demonstrate that JRM-ADM substantially improves reconstruction quality over traditional model-based and learning-based baselines, particularly in highly undersampled scenarios. Our approach enables motion-robust and low-dose CBCT imaging, paving the way for improved clinical viability.</description>

      <title>Reducing the set of considered scenarios in robust optimization of intensity-modulated proton therapy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.14227</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.14227v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Robust optimization is a commonly employed method to mitigate uncertainties in the planning of intensity-modulated proton therapy (IMPT). In certain contexts, the large number of uncertainty scenarios makes the robust problem impractically expensive to solve. Recent developments in research on IMPT treatment planning indicate that the number of ideally considered error scenarios may continue to increase.
  In this paper, we therefore investigate methods that reduce the size of the scenario set considered during the robust optimization. Six cases of patients with non-small cell lung cancer are considered. First, we investigate the existence of an optimal subset of scenarios that needs to be considered during robust optimization, and perform experiments to see if the set can be found in a reasonable time and substitute for the full set of scenarios during robust IMPT optimization. We then consider heuristic methods to estimate this subset or find subsets with similar properties. Specifically, we select a subset of maximal diversity in terms of scenario-specific features such as the dose distributions and function gradients at the initial point. Finally, we consider adversarial methods as an alternative to solving the full robust problem and investigate the impact on computation times.
  The results indicate that the optimal subset can be well approximated by solving the robust IMPT problem with conventional methods. Of the methods designed to approximate it within a practically useful time frame, the results of the diversity-maximization methods indicate that they may perform better than a manual selection of scenarios based on the patient geometry. In addition, the adversarial approaches decreased the computation time by at least half compared to the conventional approach.</description>

      <title>Parametrization of microbial survival models under UVC exposure</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.14724</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.14724v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study aims to identify and parameterize the optimal survival curves for 33 fundamental microorganisms subject to UVC exposure through experimental measurements. We compile published data on UVC doses and corresponding survival fractions for these microorganisms to estimate parameters for four prominent survival models: Single-target (ST), Multi-target (MT), Linear Quadratic (LQ), and Two-Stage Decay (TSD). The best-fitting model for each microorganism is determined by selecting the one with the lowest mean squared error (MSE) compared to the experimental data. Our analysis indicates that the MT model is the most frequently appropriate, accurately fitting 21 of the 33 microorganisms. The TSD model is the best fit for only three, while the LQ model, though occasionally suitable at lower doses, is often excluded due to unreliable performance at higher doses. The assessed models, particularly the MT model, demonstrate strong predictive capabilities for UVC surface sterilization of microorganisms. However, caution is warranted with the LQ model at higher doses due to its potential limitations.</description>

      <title>Transferred plasma catheter for endotherapeutic applications: a parametric study of guided streamers dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.14637</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.14637v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Non-thermal atmospheric pressure plasma jets (APPJs) are increasingly used in biomedical applications due to their low temperatures and ability to generate reactive oxygen and nitrogen species (RONS), making them suitable for sensitive environments like medical therapies. The transferred plasma catheter (TPC), a variant of APPJ, shows promise for endoscopic applications but requires precise control of plasma dynamics in confined spaces to ensure safety and efficacy. Despite extensive studies on guided streamers in traditional APPJs, there is limited understanding of streamer behavior in TPC configurations, particularly in challenging scenarios involving grounded metallic surfaces. This study examines the spatiotemporal dynamics of guided streamers generated by TPCs under varying gap distances to establish a robust framework for safe and effective plasma delivery in endoscopic settings. Combining electrical and optical diagnostics, the study characterizes streamer propagation, electric field profiles, and plasma-induced currents in a helium-driven TPC delivering cold plasma to a grounded metal target across gaps of 2 to 18 mm. Results show that streamers maintain charge stability and effectively interact with the target for gap distances below 12 mm, producing significant therapeutic currents. Beyond this threshold, propagation deteriorates due to recombination and reduced electric field intensity. For shorter gaps, counter-propagating waves and secondary streamer interactions are observed, while larger gaps lead to charge dissipation and reduced efficacy. These findings highlight the importance of optimizing gap distances for plasma-assisted endoscopic procedures and demonstrate the TPC's robustness in adverse conditions.</description>

      <title>Impact of Optic Nerve Tortuosity, Globe Proptosis, and Size on Retinal Ganglion Cell Thickness Across General, Glaucoma, and Myopic Populations: Insights from the UK Biobank</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.13147</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.13147v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Purpose: To investigate the impact of optic nerve tortuosity (ONT), and the interaction of globe proptosis and globe size on retinal ganglion cell (RGC) thickness, using Retinal Nerve Fiber Layer (RNFL) thickness, across general, glaucoma, and myopic populations.
  Methods: We analyzed 17,940 eyes from the UKBiobank cohort (ID 76442), including 72 glaucoma and 2475 myopic eyes. AI models segmented structures from 3D optical coherence tomography (OCT) scans and magnetic resonance images (MRI). RNFL thickness was derived from OCT scans and corrected for ocular magnification, was derived from OCT. From MRIs, we extracted: ONT, globe proptosis, axial length, and a novel interzygomatic line-to-posterior pole (ILPP) distance, a composite marker of globe proptosis and size. GEE models assessed associations between orbital and retinal features across all populations.
  Results: Segmentation models achieved Dice coefficients over 0.94 for both MRI and OCT. RNFL thickness was positively correlated with both ONT and ILPP distance (r = 0.065, p &lt; 0.001, and r = 0.206, p &lt; 0.001 respectively). The same was true for glaucoma (r = 0.040, p = 0.74, and r = 0.224, p = 0.059), and for myopia (r = 0.069, p &lt; 0.001, and r = 0.100, p &lt; 0.0001). GEE models revealed straighter optic nerves and shorter ILPP distance as predictive of thinner RNFL in all populations.
  Conclusions: This study emphasizes the impact of ONT, globe size, and proptosis on retinal health, suggesting RNFL thinning may arise from biomechanical stress due to straighter optic nerves or reduced ILPP distance, particularly in glaucoma or myopia. The novel ILPP metric, integrating globe size and position, shows potential as a biomarker for axonal health. These findings highlight the role of orbit structures in RGC axonal health and warrant further exploration of the biomechanical relationship between the orbit and optic nerve.</description>

      <title>Mechanical Characterization of Brain Tissue: Experimental Techniques, Human Testing Considerations, and Perspectives</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.12346</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.12346v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Understanding the mechanical behavior of brain tissue is crucial for advancing both fundamental neuroscience and clinical applications. Yet, accurately measuring these properties remains challenging due to the brain unique mechanical attributes and complex anatomical structures. This review provides a comprehensive overview of commonly used techniques for characterizing brain tissue mechanical properties, covering both invasive methods such as atomic force microscopy, indentation, axial mechanical testing, and oscillatory shear testing and noninvasive approaches like magnetic resonance elastography and ultrasound elastography. Each technique is evaluated in terms of working principles, applicability, representative studies, and experimental limitations. We further summarize existing publications that have used these techniques to measure human brain tissue mechanical properties. With a primary focus on invasive studies, we systematically compare their sample preparation, testing conditions, reported mechanical parameters, and modeling strategies. Key sensitivity factors influencing testing outcomes (e.g., sample size, anatomical location, strain rate, temperature, conditioning, and post-mortem interval) are also discussed. Additionally, selected noninvasive studies are reviewed to assess their potential for in vivo characterization. A comparative discussion between invasive and noninvasive methods, as well as in vivo versus ex vivo testing, is included. This review aims to offer practical guidance for researchers and clinicians in selecting appropriate mechanical testing approaches and contributes a curated dataset to support constitutive modeling of human brain tissue.</description>
