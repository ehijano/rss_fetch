      <title>Developing a Linear Fluid Plasma Model with Accurate Kinetic Bernstein Waves: A First Step</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.06550</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.06550v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Kinetic models provide highly accurate descriptions of plasma waves but involve complex integrals that are computationally expensive to solve. To facilitate a fluid-like treatment of the system, we propose rational approximations for both the plasma dispersion function in the parallel integral and the Bessel function in the perpendicular integral, ensuring that the system remains rational with respect to all three variables: wave frequency $\omega$, parallel wavevector $k_\parallel$, and perpendicular wavevector $k_\perp$. By accurately approximating the Bessel function over a wide range of Larmor radius $\rho_{cs}$ values, from $k_\perp\rho_{cs} \to 0$ to $k_\perp\rho_{cs} \to \infty$, we present an initial attempt to incorporate kinetic Bernstein waves into a fluid model. As an application, we employ this model to analyze wave propagation conditions (i.e., accessibility) by solving for the complex perpendicular wavevector $k_\perp$ using a matrix eigenvalue method with given input parameters. This work may contribute to studies of electron cyclotron resonance heating (ECRH) and ion cyclotron resonance frequency (ICRF) heating in magnetized confinement plasmas.</description>

      <title>Betatron radiation emitted during the direct laser acceleration of electrons in underdense plasmas</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.06744</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.06744v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Relativistic laser pulses can accelerate electrons up to energies of several GeV during the interaction with gaseous targets through the direct laser acceleration (DLA) mechanism. While the electrons are accelerated to high energies, they oscillate transversely to the laser propagation direction, emitting radiation. We demonstrate using particle-in-cell (PIC) simulations that the high accelerated electron charge enables DLA sources to emit $\sim 10^{10}~\rm{photons}/0.1\%\rm{BW}$ at energies of hundreds MeV when interacting with multi-petawatt laser pulses. We provide an analytical estimate of the expected critical frequency for the DLA betatron spectrum which is in strong agreement with PIC simulations. We also show that using gas jets of low density ($\sim 10^{19}~\rm{cm^{-3}}$) is beneficial for the brightness of the source, since low plasma density produces collimated radiation. If the laser pulse is focused to an optimal spot size that results in the highest cut-off energies, conversion efficiency from laser to radiation can reach up to a few percent, which makes the DLA a promising high-brilliance source of gamma-ray radiation.</description>

      <title>A comparison of the turbulent dynamo in weakly-collisional and collisional plasmas: from subsonic to supersonic turbulence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.05235</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.05235v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Weakly-collisional plasmas, such as the solar wind or the intra-cluster medium (ICM) of galaxy clusters, evolve in the presence of dynamically strong magnetic fields. The turbulent dynamo can amplify magnetic fields to such levels by converting turbulent kinetic energy into magnetic energy. While extensively studied in collisional magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) simulations, the weakly-collisional regime has only been explored recently. Here, we determine the properties of the weakly-collisional turbulent dynamo in the exponential ``kinematic" growth phase in both the subsonic and the previously unexplored supersonic regime of turbulence, using hybrid particle-in-cell (HPIC) and MHD simulations. We conduct a large parameter study, fixing the magnetic Reynolds number, Rm = 500, and the initial ratio of the magnetic to kinetic energy, $(E_{\rm{mag}}/E_{\rm{kin}})_{0} = 10^{-10}$, and then vary the kinetic Reynolds number, Re = 500, 50, and 5, for the MHD simulations. In the HPIC runs, only Rm = 500 is controlled, while Re emerges self-consistently from wave-particle interactions. We find that the velocity and magnetic field structures, probability distribution functions, and power spectra of the HPIC runs are similar to that of the MHD dynamo with Re ~ 50-500 and Re ~ 500 in the subsonic and supersonic regimes, respectively. Using MHD scaling relations, we infer $\text{Re}_{\rm inferred}=480^{+170}_{-250}$ and $690^{+360}_{-360}$ in the subsonic and supersonic weakly-collisional plasma, respectively. Overall, we find that the turbulent dynamo shares similar physical properties in both weakly-collisional and collisional plasmas. Our results of the weakly-collisional turbulent dynamo may have relevant applications to the solar wind, weakly-collisional shocks, and the hot ICM.</description>

      <title>An assessment of observational coverage and gaps for robust Sun to heliosphere integrated science</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.06036</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.06036v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Understanding the generation and development of the continuous outflow from the Sun requires tracing the physical conditions from deep in the corona to the heliosphere. Detailed global observations of plasma state variables and the magnetic field are needed to provide critical constraints to the underlying physics driving models of the corona and solar wind. Key diagnostics of the solar wind require measurements at its formation site and during its outflow to continuously track it across rapidly changing regions of space. A unified view of the solar wind is only possible through coordinated remote and in situ observations that probe these different regions. Here, we discuss current observational coverage and gaps of different plasma properties and review recent coordinated studies. We highlight how these efforts may become more routine with the launch of upcoming and planned missions.</description>

      <title>Photon-polarization-resolved linear Breit-Wheeler pair production in a laser-plasma system</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.04140</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.04140v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The linear Breit-Wheeler (LBW) process, mediated by photon-photon collisions, can emerge as the dominant pair production mechanism in the ultraintense laser-plasma interaction for laser intensities below $10^{23}~\rm W/cm^2$. Here, we explore the role of photon polarization in LBW pair production for a 10 PW-class, linearly polarized laser interacting with a solid-density plasma. The motivation for this investigation lies in two main aspects: photons emitted via nonlinear Compton scattering are inherently linearly polarized, and the LBW process exhibits a distinct sensitivity to photon polarization. By leveraging particle-in-cell simulations that self-consistently incorporate photon-polarization-resolved LBW pair production, our results reveal that photon polarization leads to a 5\% to 10\% reduction in the total LBW positron yield. This suppression arises because the polarization directions of the colliding photons are primarily parallel to each other, resulting in a diminished LBW cross section compared to the unpolarized case. The influence of photon polarization weakens as the laser intensity increases.</description>

      <title>Collisional charging of dust particles by suprathermal plasmas. II -- Regularized Kappa distributions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.05630</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.05630v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the effects of the velocity distribution functions of the plasma particles on the equilibrium charge of dust grains, acquired through inelastic collisions of the particles with the grains. This paper is the second in a series of two papers on the subject. Here, we consider the charging process when the plasma particles are statistically described by the recently proposed regularized Kappa distribution functions, which allow for extreme suprathermal states, characterized by extremely low values of the kappa index, previously forbidden to the standard Kappa distributions, whose effects on dust charging were studied in Paper I of this series. We analyse the effects that extreme suprathermal states of the plasma particles have on dust charging and verify conditions for the uncommon result of positive equilibrium charge, employing two different models for the regularized Kappa distributions, one with kinetic temperature dependent on the kappa index, and another where the temperature is kappa-independent.</description>

      <title>Back to the Figure-8 Stellarator</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.16411v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The first stellarator design was a simple tube of plasma twisted and closed on itself in the form of a figure-8. The line of such devices, however, was quickly ended over concerns related to plasma stability. We revisit the figure-8 concept, re-imagined as a modern optimized stellarator, and find the potential for a high degree of stability, as well as exceptionally simple construction. In particular, the design that we find admits planar coils, and is the first quasi-isodynamic stellarator design to have this property. Our work is made possible by recent theoretical progress in the near-axis theory of quasi-isodynamic stellarators, combined with fundamental progress in the numerical solution of three-dimensional magnetohydrodynamic equilibria that cannot be well represented using traditional cylindrical coordinates.</description>

Abstract: We compare traditional finite volume and Physics Informed Neural Network (PINN) solvers for elliptic (Poisson), hyperbolic (advection), and parabolic (diffusion) equations in 2d settings. We describe the challenges of using traditional and PINN solvers for electron kinetic equations in collisional plasmas. The advantages and drawbacks of PINNs over state-of-the-art traditional solvers are discussed. We also consider angular moments in spherical velocity space and the potential use of ML algorithms for reduced kinetic models in the coordinate-energy phase space based on adaptive closure relations.</description>

      <title>A projection method for particle resampling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.13681</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.13681v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Particle discretizations of partial differential equations are advantageous for high-dimensional kinetic models in phase space due to their better scalability than continuum approaches with respect to dimension. Complex processes collectively referred to as \textit{particle noise} hamper long-time simulations with particle methods. One approach to address this problem is particle mesh adaptivity or remapping, known as \textit{particle resampling}. This paper introduces a resampling method that projects particles to and from a (finite element) function space. The method is simple; using standard sparse linear algebra and finite element techniques, it can adapt to almost any set of new particle locations and preserves all moments up to the order of polynomial represented exactly by the continuum function space.
  This work is motivated by the Vlasov-Maxwell-Landau model of magnetized plasmas with up to six dimensions, $3X$ in physical space and $3V$ in velocity space, and is developed in the context of a $1X$ + $1V$ Vlasov-Poisson model of Landau damping with logically regular particle and continuum phase space grids. The evaluation codes are publicly available, along with the data and reproducibility artifacts, and developed in the PETSc numerical library (petsc.org).</description>

      <title>Emergence of two inertial sub-ranges in solar wind turbulence: dependence on heliospheric distance and solar activity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.03090</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.03090v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The solar wind is highly turbulent, and intermittency effects are observed for fluctuations within the inertial range. By analyzing magnetic field spectra and fourth-order moments, we perform a comparative study of turbulence and intermittency in different types of solar wind measured during periods of solar minima and a maximum. Using eight fast solar wind intervals measured during solar minima between 0.3 au and 3.16 au, we found a clear signature of two inertial sub-ranges with $f^{-3/2}$ and $f^{-5/3}$ power laws in the magnetic power spectra. The intermittency, measured through the scaling law of the kurtosis of magnetic field fluctuations, further confirms the existence of two different power laws separated by a clear break. A systematic study on the evolution of the said sub-ranges as a function of heliospheric distance shows correlation of the break scale with both the turbulence outer scale and the typical ion scales. During solar maximum, on the contrary, the two sub-ranges are not omnipresent, thus showing more variability in the power spectra and intermittency scaling properties.</description>

      <title>Understanding Streaming Instabilities in the Limit of High Cosmic Ray Current Density</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.05704v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A critical component of particle acceleration in astrophysical shocks is the non-resonant (Bell) instability, where the streaming of cosmic rays (CRs) leads to the amplification of magnetic fields necessary to scatter particles. In this work we use kinetic particle-in-cells simulations to investigate the high-CR current regime, where the typical assumptions underlying the Bell instability break down. Despite being more strongly driven, significantly less magnetic field amplification is observed compared to low-current cases, an effect due to the anisotropic heating that occurs in this regime. We also find that electron-scale modes, despite being fastest growing, mostly lead to moderate electron heating and do not affect the late evolution or saturation of the instability.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.12923v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Models for the transport of high energy charged particles through strong magnetic turbulence play a key role in space and astrophysical studies, such as describing the propagation of solar energetic particles and high energy cosmic rays. Inspired by the recent advances in high-performance machine learning techniques, we investigate the application of generative diffusion models to synthesizing test particle trajectories obtained from a turbulent magnetohydrodynamics simulation. We consider velocity increment, spatial transport and curvature statistics, and find excellent agreement with the baseline trajectories for fixed particle energies. Additionally, we consider two synthetic turbulence models for comparison. Finally, challenges towards an application-ready transport model based on our approach are discussed.</description>
