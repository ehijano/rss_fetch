      <title>Data-Driven Room Acoustic Modeling Via Differentiable Feedback Delay Networks With Learnable Delay Lines</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.00082</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.00082v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Over the past few decades, extensive research has been devoted to the design of artificial reverberation algorithms aimed at emulating the room acoustics of physical environments. Despite significant advancements, automatic parameter tuning of delay-network models remains an open challenge. We introduce a novel method for finding the parameters of a Feedback Delay Network (FDN) such that its output renders the perceptual qualities of a measured room impulse response. The proposed approach involves the implementation of a differentiable FDN with trainable delay lines, which, for the first time, allows us to simultaneously learn each and every delay-network parameter via backpropagation. The iterative optimization process seeks to minimize a time-domain loss function incorporating differentiable terms accounting for energy decay and echo density. Through experimental validation, we show that the proposed method yields time-invariant frequency-independent FDNs capable of closely matching the desired acoustical characteristics, and outperforms existing methods based on genetic algorithms and analytical filter design.</description>

      <title>Scaling Properties of Speech Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.00685</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.00685v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Speech Language Models (SLMs) aim to learn language from raw audio, without textual resources. Despite significant advances, our current models exhibit weak syntax and semantic abilities. However, if the scaling properties of neural language models hold for the speech modality, these abilities will improve as the amount of compute used for training increases. In this paper, we use models of this scaling behavior to estimate the scale at which our current methods will yield a SLM with the English proficiency of text-based Large Language Models (LLMs). We establish a strong correlation between pre-training loss and downstream syntactic and semantic performance in SLMs and LLMs, which results in predictable scaling of linguistic performance. We show that the linguistic performance of SLMs scales up to three orders of magnitude more slowly than that of text-based LLMs. Additionally, we study the benefits of synthetic data designed to boost semantic understanding and the effects of coarser speech tokenization.</description>

      <title>Heterogeneity over Homogeneity: Investigating Multilingual Speech Pre-Trained Models for Detecting Audio Deepfake</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.00809</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.00809v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, we investigate multilingual speech Pre-Trained models (PTMs) for Audio deepfake detection (ADD). We hypothesize that multilingual PTMs trained on large-scale diverse multilingual data gain knowledge about diverse pitches, accents, and tones, during their pre-training phase and making them more robust to variations. As a result, they will be more effective for detecting audio deepfakes. To validate our hypothesis, we extract representations from state-of-the-art (SOTA) PTMs including monolingual, multilingual as well as PTMs trained for speaker and emotion recognition, and evaluated them on ASVSpoof 2019 (ASV), In-the-Wild (ITW), and DECRO benchmark databases. We show that representations from multilingual PTMs, with simple downstream networks, attain the best performance for ADD compared to other PTM representations, which validates our hypothesis. We also explore the possibility of fusion of selected PTM representations for further improvements in ADD, and we propose a framework, MiO (Merge into One) for this purpose. With MiO, we achieve SOTA performance on ASV and ITW and comparable performance on DECRO with current SOTA works.</description>

      <title>Enhancing Real-World Active Speaker Detection with Multi-Modal Extraction Pre-Training</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.00861</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.00861v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Audio-visual active speaker detection (AV-ASD) aims to identify which visible face is speaking in a scene with one or more persons. Most existing AV-ASD methods prioritize capturing speech-lip correspondence. However, there is a noticeable gap in addressing the challenges from real-world AV-ASD scenarios. Due to the presence of low-quality noisy videos in such cases, AV-ASD systems without a selective listening ability are short of effectively filtering out disruptive voice components from mixed audio inputs. In this paper, we propose a Multi-modal Speaker Extraction-to-Detection framework named `MuSED', which is pre-trained with audio-visual target speaker extraction to learn the denoising ability, then it is fine-tuned with the AV-ASD task. Meanwhile, to better capture the multi-modal information and deal with real-world problems such as missing modality, MuSED is modelled on the time domain directly and integrates the multi-modal plus-and-minus augmentation strategy. Our experiments demonstrate that MuSED substantially outperforms the state-of-the-art AV-ASD methods and achieves 95.6% mAP on the AVA-ActiveSpeaker dataset, 98.3% AP on the ASW dataset, and 97.9% F1 on the Columbia AV-ASD dataset, respectively. We will publicly release the code in due course.</description>

      <title>Voice Conversion Augmentation for Speaker Recognition on Defective Datasets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.00863</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.00863v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Modern speaker recognition system relies on abundant and balanced datasets for classification training. However, diverse defective datasets, such as partially-labelled, small-scale, and imbalanced datasets, are common in real-world applications. Previous works usually studied specific solutions for each scenario from the algorithm perspective. However, the root cause of these problems lies in dataset imperfections. To address these challenges with a unified solution, we propose the Voice Conversion Augmentation (VCA) strategy to obtain pseudo speech from the training set. Furthermore, to guarantee generation quality, we designed the VCA-NN~(nearest neighbours) strategy to select source speech from utterances that are close to the target speech in the representation space. Our experimental results on three created datasets demonstrated that VCA-NN effectively mitigates these dataset problems, which provides a new direction for handling the speaker recognition problems from the data aspect.</description>

      <title>KazEmoTTS: A Dataset for Kazakh Emotional Text-to-Speech Synthesis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.01033</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.01033v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study focuses on the creation of the KazEmoTTS dataset, designed for emotional Kazakh text-to-speech (TTS) applications. KazEmoTTS is a collection of 54,760 audio-text pairs, with a total duration of 74.85 hours, featuring 34.23 hours delivered by a female narrator and 40.62 hours by two male narrators. The list of the emotions considered include "neutral", "angry", "happy", "sad", "scared", and "surprised". We also developed a TTS model trained on the KazEmoTTS dataset. Objective and subjective evaluations were employed to assess the quality of synthesized speech, yielding an MCD score within the range of 6.02 to 7.67, alongside a MOS that spanned from 3.51 to 3.57. To facilitate reproducibility and inspire further research, we have made our code, pre-trained model, and dataset accessible in our GitHub repository.</description>

      <title>Where Are You From? Let Me Guess! Subdialect Recognition of Speeches in Sorani Kurdish</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.00124</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.00124v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Classifying Sorani Kurdish subdialects poses a challenge due to the need for publicly available datasets or reliable resources like social media or websites for data collection. We conducted field visits to various cities and villages to address this issue, connecting with native speakers from different age groups, genders, academic backgrounds, and professions. We recorded their voices while engaging in conversations covering diverse topics such as lifestyle, background history, hobbies, interests, vacations, and life lessons. The target area of the research was the Kurdistan Region of Iraq. As a result, we accumulated 29 hours, 16 minutes, and 40 seconds of audio recordings from 107 interviews, constituting an unbalanced dataset encompassing six subdialects. Subsequently, we adapted three deep learning models: ANN, CNN, and RNN-LSTM. We explored various configurations, including different track durations, dataset splitting, and imbalanced dataset handling techniques such as oversampling and undersampling. Two hundred and twenty-five(225) experiments were conducted, and the outcomes were evaluated. The results indicated that the RNN-LSTM outperforms the other methods by achieving an accuracy of 96%. CNN achieved an accuracy of 93%, and ANN 75%. All three models demonstrated improved performance when applied to balanced datasets, primarily when we followed the oversampling approach. Future studies can explore additional future research directions to include other Kurdish dialects.</description>

      <title>Classification of Short Segment Pediatric Heart Sounds Based on a Transformer-Based Convolutional Neural Network</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.00470</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.00470v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Congenital anomalies arising as a result of a defect in the structure of the heart and great vessels are known as congenital heart diseases or CHDs. A PCG can provide essential details about the mechanical conduction system of the heart and point out specific patterns linked to different kinds of CHD. This study aims to investigate the minimum signal duration required for the automatic classification of heart sounds. This study also investigated the optimum signal quality assessment indicator (Root Mean Square of Successive Differences) RMSSD and (Zero Crossings Rate) ZCR value. Mel-frequency cepstral coefficients (MFCCs) based feature is used as an input to build a Transformer-Based residual one-dimensional convolutional neural network, which is then used for classifying the heart sound. The study showed that 0.4 is the ideal threshold for getting suitable signals for the RMSSD and ZCR indicators. Moreover, a minimum signal length of 5s is required for effective heart sound classification. It also shows that a shorter signal (3 s heart sound) does not have enough information to categorize heart sounds accurately, and the longer signal (15 s heart sound) may contain more noise. The best accuracy, 93.69%, is obtained for the 5s signal to distinguish the heart sound.</description>

      <title>CM-TTS: Enhancing Real Time Text-to-Speech Synthesis Efficiency through Weighted Samplers and Consistency Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.00569</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.00569v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Neural Text-to-Speech (TTS) systems find broad applications in voice assistants, e-learning, and audiobook creation. The pursuit of modern models, like Diffusion Models (DMs), holds promise for achieving high-fidelity, real-time speech synthesis. Yet, the efficiency of multi-step sampling in Diffusion Models presents challenges. Efforts have been made to integrate GANs with DMs, speeding up inference by approximating denoising distributions, but this introduces issues with model convergence due to adversarial training. To overcome this, we introduce CM-TTS, a novel architecture grounded in consistency models (CMs). Drawing inspiration from continuous-time diffusion models, CM-TTS achieves top-quality speech synthesis in fewer steps without adversarial training or pre-trained model dependencies. We further design weighted samplers to incorporate different sampling positions into model training with dynamic probabilities, ensuring unbiased learning throughout the entire training process. We present a real-time mel-spectrogram generation consistency model, validated through comprehensive evaluations. Experimental results underscore CM-TTS's superiority over existing single-step speech synthesis systems, representing a significant advancement in the field.</description>

      <title>WavLLM: Towards Robust and Adaptive Speech Large Language Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.00656</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.00656v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The recent advancements in large language models (LLMs) have revolutionized the field of natural language processing, progressively broadening their scope to multimodal perception and generation. However, effectively integrating listening capabilities into LLMs poses significant challenges, particularly with respect to generalizing across varied contexts and executing complex auditory tasks. In this work, we introduce WavLLM, a robust and adaptive speech large language model with dual encoders, and a prompt-aware LoRA weight adapter, optimized by a two-stage curriculum learning approach. Leveraging dual encoders, we decouple different types of speech information, utilizing a Whisper encoder to process the semantic content of speech, and a WavLM encoder to capture the unique characteristics of the speaker's identity. Within the curriculum learning framework, WavLLM first builds its foundational capabilities by optimizing on mixed elementary single tasks, followed by advanced multi-task training on more complex tasks such as combinations of the elementary tasks. To enhance the flexibility and adherence to different tasks and instructions, a prompt-aware LoRA weight adapter is introduced in the second advanced multi-task training stage. We validate the proposed model on universal speech benchmarks including tasks such as ASR, ST, SV, ER, and also apply it to specialized datasets like Gaokao English listening comprehension set for SQA, and speech Chain-of-Thought (CoT) evaluation set. Experiments demonstrate that the proposed model achieves state-of-the-art performance across a range of speech tasks on the same model size, exhibiting robust generalization capabilities in executing complex tasks using CoT approach. Furthermore, our model successfully completes Gaokao tasks without specialized training. The codes, models, audio, and Gaokao evaluation set can be accessed at \url{aka.ms/wavllm}.</description>

      <title>Measuring audio prompt adherence with distribution-based embedding distances</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.00775</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.00775v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: An increasing number of generative music models can be conditioned on an audio prompt that serves as musical context for which the model is to create an accompaniment (often further specified using a text prompt). Evaluation of how well model outputs adhere to the audio prompt is often done in a model or problem specific manner, presumably because no generic evaluation method for audio prompt adherence has emerged. Such a method could be useful both in the development and training of new models, and to make performance comparable across models. In this paper we investigate whether commonly used distribution-based distances like Fr\'echet Audio Distance (FAD), can be used to measure audio prompt adherence. We propose a simple procedure based on a small number of constituents (an embedding model, a projection, an embedding distance, and a data fusion method), that we systematically assess using a baseline validation. In a follow-up experiment we test the sensitivity of the proposed audio adherence measure to pitch and time shift perturbations. The results show that the proposed measure is sensitive to such perturbations, even when the reference and candidate distributions are from different music collections. Although more experimentation is needed to answer unaddressed questions like the robustness of the measure to acoustic artifacts that do not affect the audio prompt adherence, the current results suggest that distribution-based embedding distances provide a viable way of measuring audio prompt adherence. An python/pytorch implementation of the proposed measure is publicly available as a github repository.</description>

      <title>A Comparative Analysis of Poetry Reading Audio: Singing, Narrating, or Somewhere In Between?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.00789</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.00789v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper provides a computational analysis of poetry reading audio signals at a large scale to unveil the musicality within professionally-read poems. Although the acoustic characteristics of other types of spoken language have been extensively studied, most of the literature is limited to narrative speech or singing voice, discussing how different they are from each other. In this work, we develop signal processing methods, which are tailored to capture the unique acoustic characteristics of poetry reading based on their silence patterns, temporal variations of local pitch, and beat stability. Our large-scale statistical analyses on three big corpora, each of which consists of narration (LibriSpeech), singing voice (Intonation), and poetry reading (from The Poetry Foundation), discover that poetry reading does share some musical characteristics with singing voice, although it may also resemble narrative speech.</description>

      <title>Personalized Neural Speech Codec</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.00791v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we propose a personalized neural speech codec, envisioning that personalization can reduce the model complexity or improve perceptual speech quality. Despite the common usage of speech codecs where only a single talker is involved on each side of the communication, personalizing a codec for the specific user has rarely been explored in the literature. First, we assume speakers can be grouped into smaller subsets based on their perceptual similarity. Then, we also postulate that a group-specific codec can focus on the group's speech characteristics to improve its perceptual quality and computational efficiency. To this end, we first develop a Siamese network that learns the speaker embeddings from the LibriSpeech dataset, which are then grouped into underlying speaker clusters. Finally, we retrain the LPCNet-based speech codec baselines on each of the speaker clusters. Subjective listening tests show that the proposed personalization scheme introduces model compression while maintaining speech quality. In other words, with the same model complexity, personalized codecs produce better speech quality.</description>

      <title>Removing Speaker Information from Speech Representation using Variable-Length Soft Pooling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.00856</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.00856v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recently, there have been efforts to encode the linguistic information of speech using a self-supervised framework for speech synthesis. However, predicting representations from surrounding representations can inadvertently entangle speaker information in the speech representation. This paper aims to remove speaker information by exploiting the structured nature of speech, composed of discrete units like phonemes with clear boundaries. A neural network predicts these boundaries, enabling variable-length pooling for event-based representation extraction instead of fixed-rate methods. The boundary predictor outputs a probability for the boundary between 0 and 1, making pooling soft. The model is trained to minimize the difference with the pooled representation of the data augmented by time-stretch and pitch-shift. To confirm that the learned representation includes contents information but is independent of speaker information, the model was evaluated with libri-light's phonetic ABX task and SUPERB's speaker identification task.</description>

      <title>360+x: A Panoptic Multi-modal Scene Understanding Dataset</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.00989v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Human perception of the world is shaped by a multitude of viewpoints and modalities. While many existing datasets focus on scene understanding from a certain perspective (e.g. egocentric or third-person views), our dataset offers a panoptic perspective (i.e. multiple viewpoints with multiple data modalities). Specifically, we encapsulate third-person panoramic and front views, as well as egocentric monocular/binocular views with rich modalities including video, multi-channel audio, directional binaural delay, location data and textual scene descriptions within each scene captured, presenting comprehensive observation of the world. Figure 1 offers a glimpse of all 28 scene categories of our 360+x dataset. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first database that covers multiple viewpoints with multiple data modalities to mimic how daily information is accessed in the real world. Through our benchmark analysis, we presented 5 different scene understanding tasks on the proposed 360+x dataset to evaluate the impact and benefit of each data modality and perspective in panoptic scene understanding. We hope this unique dataset could broaden the scope of comprehensive scene understanding and encourage the community to approach these problems from more diverse perspectives.</description>

      <title>A Novel Audio Representation for Music Genre Identification in MIR</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.01058</link>

Abstract: For Music Information Retrieval downstream tasks, the most common audio representation is time-frequency-based, such as Mel spectrograms. In order to identify musical genres, this study explores the possibilities of a new form of audio representation one of the most usual MIR downstream tasks. Therefore, to discretely encoding music using deep vector quantization; a novel audio representation was created for the innovative generative music model i.e. Jukebox. The effectiveness of Jukebox's audio representation is compared to Mel spectrograms using a dataset that is almost equivalent to State-of-the-Art (SOTA) and an almost same transformer design. The results of this study imply that, at least when the transformers are pretrained using a very modest dataset of 20k tracks, Jukebox's audio representation is not superior to Mel spectrograms. This could be explained by the fact that Jukebox's audio representation does not sufficiently take into account the peculiarities of human hearing perception. On the other hand, Mel spectrograms are specifically created with the human auditory sense in mind.</description>

      <title>Deep Learning Based Stage-wise Two-dimensional Speaker Localization with Large Ad-hoc Microphone Arrays</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2210.10265</link>
      <description>arXiv:2210.10265v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: While deep-learning-based speaker localization has shown advantages in challenging acoustic environments, it often yields only direction-of-arrival (DOA) cues rather than precise two-dimensional (2D) coordinates. To address this, we propose a novel deep-learning-based 2D speaker localization method leveraging ad-hoc microphone arrays, where an ad-hoc microphone array is composed of randomly distributed microphone nodes, each of which is equipped with a traditional array. Specifically, we first employ convolutional neural networks at each node to estimate speaker directions. Then, we integrate these DOA estimates using triangulation and clustering techniques to get 2D speaker locations. To further boost the estimation accuracy, we introduce a node selection algorithm that strategically filters the most reliable nodes. Extensive experiments on both simulated and real-world data demonstrate that our approach significantly outperforms conventional methods. The proposed node selection further refines performance. The real-world dataset in the experiment, named Libri-adhoc-node10 which is a newly recorded data described for the first time in this paper, is online available at https://github.com/Liu-sp/Libri-adhoc-nodes10.</description>

      <title>Explicit Estimation of Magnitude and Phase Spectra in Parallel for High-Quality Speech Enhancement</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.08926</link>
      <description>arXiv:2308.08926v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Phase information has a significant impact on speech perceptual quality and intelligibility. However, existing speech enhancement methods encounter limitations in explicit phase estimation due to the non-structural nature and wrapping characteristics of the phase, leading to a bottleneck in enhanced speech quality. To overcome the above issue, in this paper, we proposed MP-SENet, a novel Speech Enhancement Network that explicitly enhances Magnitude and Phase spectra in parallel. The proposed MP-SENet comprises a Transformer-embedded encoder-decoder architecture. The encoder aims to encode the input distorted magnitude and phase spectra into time-frequency representations, which are further fed into time-frequency Transformers for alternatively capturing time and frequency dependencies. The decoder comprises a magnitude mask decoder and a phase decoder, directly enhancing magnitude and wrapped phase spectra by incorporating a magnitude masking architecture and a phase parallel estimation architecture, respectively. Multi-level loss functions explicitly defined on the magnitude spectra, wrapped phase spectra, and short-time complex spectra are adopted to jointly train the MP-SENet model. A metric discriminator is further employed to compensate for the incomplete correlation between these losses and human auditory perception. Experimental results demonstrate that our proposed MP-SENet achieves state-of-the-art performance across multiple speech enhancement tasks, including speech denoising, dereverberation, and bandwidth extension. Compared to existing phase-aware speech enhancement methods, it further mitigates the compensation effect between the magnitude and phase by explicit phase estimation, elevating the perceptual quality of enhanced speech.</description>

      <title>Exploring Phonetic Context-Aware Lip-Sync For Talking Face Generation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.19556</link>
      <description>arXiv:2305.19556v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Talking face generation is the challenging task of synthesizing a natural and realistic face that requires accurate synchronization with a given audio. Due to co-articulation, where an isolated phone is influenced by the preceding or following phones, the articulation of a phone varies upon the phonetic context. Therefore, modeling lip motion with the phonetic context can generate more spatio-temporally aligned lip movement. In this respect, we investigate the phonetic context in generating lip motion for talking face generation. We propose Context-Aware Lip-Sync framework (CALS), which explicitly leverages phonetic context to generate lip movement of the target face. CALS is comprised of an Audio-to-Lip module and a Lip-to-Face module. The former is pretrained based on masked learning to map each phone to a contextualized lip motion unit. The contextualized lip motion unit then guides the latter in synthesizing a target identity with context-aware lip motion. From extensive experiments, we verify that simply exploiting the phonetic context in the proposed CALS framework effectively enhances spatio-temporal alignment. We also demonstrate the extent to which the phonetic context assists in lip synchronization and find the effective window size for lip generation to be approximately 1.2 seconds.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2311.09117v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper introduces Robust Spin (R-Spin), a data-efficient domain-specific self-supervision method for speaker and noise-invariant speech representations by learning discrete acoustic units with speaker-invariant clustering (Spin). R-Spin resolves Spin's issues and enhances content representations by learning to predict acoustic pieces. R-Spin offers a 12X reduction in computational resources compared to previous state-of-the-art methods while outperforming them in severely distorted speech scenarios. This paper provides detailed analyses to show how discrete units contribute to speech encoder training and improving robustness in diverse acoustic environments.</description>

      <title>HiCMAE: Hierarchical Contrastive Masked Autoencoder for Self-Supervised Audio-Visual Emotion Recognition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.05698</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.05698v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Audio-Visual Emotion Recognition (AVER) has garnered increasing attention in recent years for its critical role in creating emotion-ware intelligent machines. Previous efforts in this area are dominated by the supervised learning paradigm. Despite significant progress, supervised learning is meeting its bottleneck due to the longstanding data scarcity issue in AVER. Motivated by recent advances in self-supervised learning, we propose Hierarchical Contrastive Masked Autoencoder (HiCMAE), a novel self-supervised framework that leverages large-scale self-supervised pre-training on vast unlabeled audio-visual data to promote the advancement of AVER. Following prior arts in self-supervised audio-visual representation learning, HiCMAE adopts two primary forms of self-supervision for pre-training, namely masked data modeling and contrastive learning. Unlike them which focus exclusively on top-layer representations while neglecting explicit guidance of intermediate layers, HiCMAE develops a three-pronged strategy to foster hierarchical audio-visual feature learning and improve the overall quality of learned representations. To verify the effectiveness of HiCMAE, we conduct extensive experiments on 9 datasets covering both categorical and dimensional AVER tasks. Experimental results show that our method significantly outperforms state-of-the-art supervised and self-supervised audio-visual methods, which indicates that HiCMAE is a powerful audio-visual emotion representation learner. Codes and models will be publicly available at https://github.com/sunlicai/HiCMAE.</description>

      <title>TelME: Teacher-leading Multimodal Fusion Network for Emotion Recognition in Conversation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.12987</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.12987v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Emotion Recognition in Conversation (ERC) plays a crucial role in enabling dialogue systems to effectively respond to user requests. The emotions in a conversation can be identified by the representations from various modalities, such as audio, visual, and text. However, due to the weak contribution of non-verbal modalities to recognize emotions, multimodal ERC has always been considered a challenging task. In this paper, we propose Teacher-leading Multimodal fusion network for ERC (TelME). TelME incorporates cross-modal knowledge distillation to transfer information from a language model acting as the teacher to the non-verbal students, thereby optimizing the efficacy of the weak modalities. We then combine multimodal features using a shifting fusion approach in which student networks support the teacher. TelME achieves state-of-the-art performance in MELD, a multi-speaker conversation dataset for ERC. Finally, we demonstrate the effectiveness of our components through additional experiments.</description>

      <title>Recursive Joint Cross-Modal Attention for Multimodal Fusion in Dimensional Emotion Recognition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.13659</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.13659v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Though multimodal emotion recognition has achieved significant progress over recent years, the potential of rich synergic relationships across the modalities is not fully exploited. In this paper, we introduce Recursive Joint Cross-Modal Attention (RJCMA) to effectively capture both intra-and inter-modal relationships across audio, visual and text modalities for dimensional emotion recognition. In particular, we compute the attention weights based on cross-correlation between the joint audio-visual-text feature representations and the feature representations of individual modalities to simultaneously capture intra- and inter-modal relationships across the modalities. The attended features of the individual modalities are again fed as input to the fusion model in a recursive mechanism to obtain more refined feature representations. We have also explored Temporal Convolutional Networks (TCNs) to improve the temporal modeling of the feature representations of individual modalities. Extensive experiments are conducted to evaluate the performance of the proposed fusion model on the challenging Affwild2 dataset. By effectively capturing the synergic intra- and inter-modal relationships across audio, visual and text modalities, the proposed fusion model achieves a Concordance Correlation Coefficient (CCC) of 0.585 (0.542) and 0.659 (0.619) for valence and arousal respectively on the validation set (test set). This shows a significant improvement over the baseline of 0.24 (0.211) and 0.20 (0.191) for valence and arousal respectively on the validation set (test set) of the valence-arousal challenge of 6th Affective Behavior Analysis in-the-Wild (ABAW) competition.</description>

      <title>Robust Active Speaker Detection in Noisy Environments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.19002</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.19002v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper addresses the issue of active speaker detection (ASD) in noisy environments and formulates a robust active speaker detection (rASD) problem. Existing ASD approaches leverage both audio and visual modalities, but non-speech sounds in the surrounding environment can negatively impact performance. To overcome this, we propose a novel framework that utilizes audio-visual speech separation as guidance to learn noise-free audio features. These features are then utilized in an ASD model, and both tasks are jointly optimized in an end-to-end framework. Our proposed framework mitigates residual noise and audio quality reduction issues that can occur in a naive cascaded two-stage framework that directly uses separated speech for ASD, and enables the two tasks to be optimized simultaneously. To further enhance the robustness of the audio features and handle inherent speech noises, we propose a dynamic weighted loss approach to train the speech separator. We also collected a real-world noise audio dataset to facilitate investigations. Experiments demonstrate that non-speech audio noises significantly impact ASD models, and our proposed approach improves ASD performance in noisy environments. The framework is general and can be applied to different ASD approaches to improve their robustness. Our code, models, and data will be released.</description>
