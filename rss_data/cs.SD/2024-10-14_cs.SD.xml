      <title>A Recurrent Neural Network Approach to the Answering Machine Detection Problem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.08235</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.08235v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the field of telecommunications and cloud communications, accurately and in real-time detecting whether a human or an answering machine has answered an outbound call is of paramount importance. This problem is of particular significance during campaigns as it enhances service quality, efficiency and cost reduction through precise caller identification. Despite the significance of the field, it remains inadequately explored in the existing literature. This paper presents an innovative approach to answering machine detection that leverages transfer learning through the YAMNet model for feature extraction. The YAMNet architecture facilitates the training of a recurrent-based classifier, enabling real-time processing of audio streams, as opposed to fixed-length recordings. The results demonstrate an accuracy of over 96% on the test set. Furthermore, we conduct an in-depth analysis of misclassified samples and reveal that an accuracy exceeding 98% can be achieved with the integration of a silence detection algorithm, such as the one provided by FFmpeg.</description>

      <title>Music Genre Classification using Large Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.08321</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.08321v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper exploits the zero-shot capabilities of pre-trained large language models (LLMs) for music genre classification. The proposed approach splits audio signals into 20 ms chunks and processes them through convolutional feature encoders, a transformer encoder, and additional layers for coding audio units and generating feature vectors. The extracted feature vectors are used to train a classification head. During inference, predictions on individual chunks are aggregated for a final genre classification. We conducted a comprehensive comparison of LLMs, including WavLM, HuBERT, and wav2vec 2.0, with traditional deep learning architectures like 1D and 2D convolutional neural networks (CNNs) and the audio spectrogram transformer (AST). Our findings demonstrate the superior performance of the AST model, achieving an overall accuracy of 85.5%, surpassing all other models evaluated. These results highlight the potential of LLMs and transformer-based architectures for advancing music information retrieval tasks, even in zero-shot scenarios.</description>

      <title>Symbolic Music Generation with Fine-grained Interactive Textural Guidance</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.08435</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.08435v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The problem of symbolic music generation presents unique challenges due to the combination of limited data availability and the need for high precision in note pitch. To overcome these difficulties, we introduce Fine-grained Textural Guidance (FTG) within diffusion models to correct errors in the learned distributions. By incorporating FTG, the diffusion models improve the accuracy of music generation, which makes them well-suited for advanced tasks such as progressive music generation, improvisation and interactive music creation. We derive theoretical characterizations for both the challenges in symbolic music generation and the effect of the FTG approach. We provide numerical experiments and a demo page for interactive music generation with user input to showcase the effectiveness of our approach.</description>

      <title>Small Tunes Transformer: Exploring Macro &amp; Micro-Level Hierarchies for Skeleton-Conditioned Melody Generation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.08626</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.08626v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recently, symbolic music generation has become a focus of numerous deep learning research. Structure as an important part of music, contributes to improving the quality of music, and an increasing number of works start to study the hierarchical structure. In this study, we delve into the multi-level structures within music from macro-level and micro-level hierarchies. At the macro-level hierarchy, we conduct phrase segmentation algorithm to explore how phrases influence the overall development of music, and at the micro-level hierarchy, we design skeleton notes extraction strategy to explore how skeleton notes within each phrase guide the melody generation. Furthermore, we propose a novel Phrase-level Cross-Attention mechanism to capture the intrinsic relationship between macro-level hierarchy and micro-level hierarchy. Moreover, in response to the current lack of research on Chinese-style music, we construct our Small Tunes Dataset: a substantial collection of MIDI files comprising 10088 Small Tunes, a category of traditional Chinese Folk Songs. This dataset serves as the focus of our study. We generate Small Tunes songs utilizing the extracted skeleton notes as conditions, and experiment results indicate that our proposed model, Small Tunes Transformer, outperforms other state-of-the-art models. Besides, we design three novel objective evaluation metrics to evaluate music from both rhythm and melody dimensions.</description>

      <title>Exploring ASR-Based Wav2Vec2 for Automated Speech Disorder Assessment: Insights and Analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.08250</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.08250v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: With the rise of SSL and ASR technologies, the Wav2Vec2 ASR-based model has been fine-tuned for automated speech disorder quality assessment tasks, yielding impressive results and setting a new baseline for Head and Neck Cancer speech contexts. This demonstrates that the ASR dimension from Wav2Vec2 closely aligns with assessment dimensions. Despite its effectiveness, this system remains a black box with no clear interpretation of the connection between the model ASR dimension and clinical assessments. This paper presents the first analysis of this baseline model for speech quality assessment, focusing on intelligibility and severity tasks. We conduct a layer-wise analysis to identify key layers and compare different SSL and ASR Wav2Vec2 models based on pre-trained data. Additionally, post-hoc XAI methods, including Canonical Correlation Analysis (CCA) and visualization techniques, are used to track model evolution and visualize embeddings for enhanced interpretability.</description>

      <title>The language of sound search: Examining User Queries in Audio Search Engines</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.08324</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.08324v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This study examines textual, user-written search queries within the context of sound search engines, encompassing various applications such as foley, sound effects, and general audio retrieval. Current research inadequately addresses real-world user needs and behaviours in designing text-based audio retrieval systems. To bridge this gap, we analysed search queries from two sources: a custom survey and Freesound website query logs. The survey was designed to collect queries for an unrestricted, hypothetical sound search engine, resulting in a dataset that captures user intentions without the constraints of existing systems. This dataset is also made available for sharing with the research community. In contrast, the Freesound query logs encompass approximately 9 million search requests, providing a comprehensive view of real-world usage patterns. Our findings indicate that survey queries are generally longer than Freesound queries, suggesting users prefer detailed queries when not limited by system constraints. Both datasets predominantly feature keyword-based queries, with few survey participants using full sentences. Key factors influencing survey queries include the primary sound source, intended usage, perceived location, and the number of sound sources. These insights are crucial for developing user-centred, effective text-based audio retrieval systems, enhancing our understanding of user behaviour in sound search contexts.</description>

      <title>Enhancing Indonesian Automatic Speech Recognition: Evaluating Multilingual Models with Diverse Speech Variabilities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.08828</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.08828v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: An ideal speech recognition model has the capability to transcribe speech accurately under various characteristics of speech signals, such as speaking style (read and spontaneous), speech context (formal and informal), and background noise conditions (clean and moderate). Building such a model requires a significant amount of training data with diverse speech characteristics. Currently, Indonesian data is dominated by read, formal, and clean speech, leading to a scarcity of Indonesian data with other speech variabilities. To develop Indonesian automatic speech recognition (ASR), we present our research on state-of-the-art speech recognition models, namely Massively Multilingual Speech (MMS) and Whisper, as well as compiling a dataset comprising Indonesian speech with variabilities to facilitate our study. We further investigate the models' predictive ability to transcribe Indonesian speech data across different variability groups. The best results were achieved by the Whisper fine-tuned model across datasets with various characteristics, as indicated by the decrease in word error rate (WER) and character error rate (CER). Moreover, we found that speaking style variability affected model performance the most.</description>

      <title>UniGlyph: A Seven-Segment Script for Universal Language Representation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.08974</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.08974v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: UniGlyph is a constructed language (conlang) designed to create a universal transliteration system using a script derived from seven-segment characters. The goal of UniGlyph is to facilitate cross-language communication by offering a flexible and consistent script that can represent a wide range of phonetic sounds. This paper explores the design of UniGlyph, detailing its script structure, phonetic mapping, and transliteration rules. The system addresses imperfections in the International Phonetic Alphabet (IPA) and traditional character sets by providing a compact, versatile method to represent phonetic diversity across languages. With pitch and length markers, UniGlyph ensures accurate phonetic representation while maintaining a small character set. Applications of UniGlyph include artificial intelligence integrations, such as natural language processing and multilingual speech recognition, enhancing communication across different languages. Future expansions are discussed, including the addition of animal phonetic sounds, where unique scripts are assigned to different species, broadening the scope of UniGlyph beyond human communication. This study presents the challenges and solutions in developing such a universal script, demonstrating the potential of UniGlyph to bridge linguistic gaps in cross-language communication, educational phonetics, and AI-driven applications.</description>

      <title>Controlling Whisper: Universal Acoustic Adversarial Attacks to Control Speech Foundation Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.04482</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.04482v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Speech enabled foundation models, either in the form of flexible speech recognition based systems or audio-prompted large language models (LLMs), are becoming increasingly popular. One of the interesting aspects of these models is their ability to perform tasks other than automatic speech recognition (ASR) using an appropriate prompt. For example, the OpenAI Whisper model can perform both speech transcription and speech translation. With the development of audio-prompted LLMs there is the potential for even greater control options. In this work we demonstrate that with this greater flexibility the systems can be susceptible to model-control adversarial attacks. Without any access to the model prompt it is possible to modify the behaviour of the system by appropriately changing the audio input. To illustrate this risk, we demonstrate that it is possible to prepend a short universal adversarial acoustic segment to any input speech signal to override the prompt setting of an ASR foundation model. Specifically, we successfully use a universal adversarial acoustic segment to control Whisper to always perform speech translation, despite being set to perform speech transcription. Overall, this work demonstrates a new form of adversarial attack on multi-tasking speech enabled foundation models that needs to be considered prior to the deployment of this form of model.</description>

      <title>MaskGCT: Zero-Shot Text-to-Speech with Masked Generative Codec Transformer</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.00750</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.00750v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The recent large-scale text-to-speech (TTS) systems are usually grouped as autoregressive and non-autoregressive systems. The autoregressive systems implicitly model duration but exhibit certain deficiencies in robustness and lack of duration controllability. Non-autoregressive systems require explicit alignment information between text and speech during training and predict durations for linguistic units (e.g. phone), which may compromise their naturalness. In this paper, we introduce Masked Generative Codec Transformer (MaskGCT), a fully non-autoregressive TTS model that eliminates the need for explicit alignment information between text and speech supervision, as well as phone-level duration prediction. MaskGCT is a two-stage model: in the first stage, the model uses text to predict semantic tokens extracted from a speech self-supervised learning (SSL) model, and in the second stage, the model predicts acoustic tokens conditioned on these semantic tokens. MaskGCT follows the mask-and-predict learning paradigm. During training, MaskGCT learns to predict masked semantic or acoustic tokens based on given conditions and prompts. During inference, the model generates tokens of a specified length in a parallel manner. Experiments with 100K hours of in-the-wild speech demonstrate that MaskGCT outperforms the current state-of-the-art zero-shot TTS systems in terms of quality, similarity, and intelligibility. Audio samples are available at https://maskgct.github.io/.</description>

      <title>High-Quality Visually-Guided Sound Separation from Diverse Categories</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.00122</link>
      <description>arXiv:2308.00122v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We propose DAVIS, a Diffusion-based Audio-VIsual Separation framework that solves the audio-visual sound source separation task through generative learning. Existing methods typically frame sound separation as a mask-based regression problem, achieving significant progress. However, they face limitations in capturing the complex data distribution required for high-quality separation of sounds from diverse categories. In contrast, DAVIS leverages a generative diffusion model and a Separation U-Net to synthesize separated sounds directly from Gaussian noise, conditioned on both the audio mixture and the visual information. With its generative objective, DAVIS is better suited to achieving the goal of high-quality sound separation across diverse sound categories. We compare DAVIS to existing state-of-the-art discriminative audio-visual separation methods on the AVE and MUSIC datasets, and results show that DAVIS outperforms other methods in separation quality, demonstrating the advantages of our framework for tackling the audio-visual source separation task.</description>

      <title>Sentiment Reasoning for Healthcare</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.21054</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.21054v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Transparency in AI healthcare decision-making is crucial for building trust among AI and users. Incorporating reasoning capabilities enables Large Language Models (LLMs) to understand emotions in context, handle nuanced language, and infer unstated sentiments. In this work, we introduce a new task -- Sentiment Reasoning -- for both speech and text modalities, along with our proposed multimodal multitask framework and dataset. Sentiment Reasoning is an auxiliary task in sentiment analysis where the model predicts both the sentiment label and generates the rationale behind it based on the input transcript. Our study conducted on both human transcripts and Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) transcripts shows that Sentiment Reasoning helps improve model transparency by providing rationale for model prediction with quality semantically comparable to humans while also improving model performance (1% increase in both accuracy and macro-F1) via rationale-augmented fine-tuning. Also, no significant difference in the semantic quality of generated rationales between human and ASR transcripts. All code, data (English-translated and Vietnamese) and models are published online: https://github.com/leduckhai/MultiMed.</description>

      <title>Enhancing Large Language Model-based Speech Recognition by Contextualization for Rare and Ambiguous Words</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.08027</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.08027v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We develop a large language model (LLM) based automatic speech recognition (ASR) system that can be contextualized by providing keywords as prior information in text prompts. We adopt decoder-only architecture and use our in-house LLM, PLaMo-100B, pre-trained from scratch using datasets dominated by Japanese and English texts as the decoder. We adopt a pre-trained Whisper encoder as an audio encoder, and the audio embeddings from the audio encoder are projected to the text embedding space by an adapter layer and concatenated with text embeddings converted from text prompts to form inputs to the decoder. By providing keywords as prior information in the text prompts, we can contextualize our LLM-based ASR system without modifying the model architecture to transcribe ambiguous words in the input audio accurately. Experimental results demonstrate that providing keywords to the decoder can significantly improve the recognition performance of rare and ambiguous words.</description>

      <title>SSL-TTS: Leveraging Self-Supervised Embeddings and kNN Retrieval for Zero-Shot Multi-speaker TTS</title>

Abstract: While recent zero-shot multispeaker text-to-speech (TTS) models achieve impressive results, they typically rely on extensive transcribed speech datasets from numerous speakers and intricate training pipelines. Meanwhile, self-supervised learning (SSL) speech features have emerged as effective intermediate representations for TTS. It was also observed that SSL features from different speakers that are linearly close share phonetic information while maintaining individual speaker identity, which enables straight-forward and robust voice cloning. In this study, we introduce SSL-TTS, a lightweight and efficient zero-shot TTS framework trained on transcribed speech from a single speaker. SSL-TTS leverages SSL features and retrieval methods for simple and robust zero-shot multi-speaker synthesis. Objective and subjective evaluations show that our approach achieves performance comparable to state-of-the-art models that require significantly larger training datasets. The low training data requirements mean that SSL-TTS is well suited for the development of multi-speaker TTS systems for low-resource domains and languages. We also introduce an interpolation parameter which enables fine control over the output speech by blending voices. Demo samples are available at https://idiap.github.io/ssl-tts</description>

      <title>Benchmarking Japanese Speech Recognition on ASR-LLM Setups with Multi-Pass Augmented Generative Error Correction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.16180</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.16180v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: With the strong representational power of large language models (LLMs), generative error correction (GER) for automatic speech recognition (ASR) aims to provide semantic and phonetic refinements to address ASR errors. This work explores how LLM-based GER can enhance and expand the capabilities of Japanese language processing, presenting the first GER benchmark for Japanese ASR with 0.9-2.6k text utterances. We also introduce a new multi-pass augmented generative error correction (MPA GER) by integrating multiple system hypotheses on the input side with corrections from multiple LLMs on the output side and then merging them. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first investigation of the use of LLMs for Japanese GER, which involves second-pass language modeling on the output transcriptions generated by the ASR system (e.g., N-best hypotheses). Our experiments demonstrated performance improvement in the proposed methods of ASR quality and generalization both in SPREDS-U1-ja and CSJ data.</description>
