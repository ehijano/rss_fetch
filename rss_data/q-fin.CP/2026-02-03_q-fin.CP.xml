      <title>A Prior-Predictive Monte Carlo Framework for Pricing Complex Data Products in Data-Poor Markets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.00121</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.00121v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Pricing advanced data products - particularly in complex fields such as semiconductor manufacturing - is a fundamentally challenging task due to the sparsity of publicly available transaction data, and its frequent heterogeneity and confidentiality. While data value depends on multiple interacting factors, such as technical sophistication, quality, utility, and licensing rights, traditional pricing methods tend to rely on ad-hoc heuristics or require massive amounts of historical transaction data. In an increasingly data-based economy, we introduce a prior-predictive Monte Carlo framework that enables the generation of fair, consistent, and justified price ranges for data products in the absence of empirical data. By simulating many plausible pricing 'worlds' and deal configurations, the framework produces stable probabilistic price bands (e.g., P5/P50/P95) rather than single point estimates, creating an auditable and repeatable probabilistic pricing system with business realism enforced via constraint-truncated priors. The proposed model bridges traditional data pricing rooted in professional experience with a data-based approach that also allows for classical Bayesian updating as more transaction data is accumulated.</description>

      <title>Numerical Simulations for Time-Fractional Black-Scholes Equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.00201</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.00201v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper implements an efficient numerical algorithm for the time-fractional Black-Scholes model governing European options. The proposed method comprises the Crank-Nicolson approach to discretize the time variable and exponential B-spline approximation for the space variable. The implemented method is unconditionally stable. We present few numerical examples to confirm the theory. Numerical simulations with comparisons exhibit the supremacy of the proposed approach.</description>

      <title>Rough Martingale Optimal Transport: Theory, Implementation, and Regulatory Applications for Non-Modelable Risk Factors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.00097</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.00097v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Fundamental Review of the Trading Book (FRTB) poses a significant challenge for exotic derivatives pricing, particularly for non-modelable risk factors (NMRF) where sparse market data leads to infinite audit bounds under classical Martingale Optimal Transport (MOT). We propose a unified Rough Martingale Optimal Transport (RMOT) framework that regularizes the transport plan with a rough volatility prior, yielding finite, explicit, and asymptotically tight extrapolation bounds. We establish an identifiability theorem for rough volatility parameters under sparse data, proving that 50 strikes are sufficient to estimate the Hurst exponent within $\pm 0.05$. For the multi-asset case, we prove that the correlation matrix is locally identifiable from marginal option surfaces provided the Hurst exponents are distinct. Model calibration on SPY and QQQ options (2019--2024) confirms that the optimal martingale measure exhibits stretched exponential tail decay ($\sim\exp(-k^{1-H})$), consistent with rough volatility asymptotics, whereas classical MOT yields trivial bounds. We validate the framework on live SPX/NDX data and scale it to $N = 30$ assets using a block-sparse optimization algorithm. Empirical results show that RMOT provides approximately \$880M in capital relief per \$1B exotic book compared to classical methods, while maintaining conservative coverage confirmed by 100-seed cross-validation. This constitutes a pricing framework designed to align with FRTB principles for NMRFs with explicit error quantification.</description>

      <title>Explainable Patterns in Cryptocurrency Microstructure</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.00776</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.00776v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We document stable cross-asset patterns in cryptocurrency limit-order-book microstructure: the same engineered order book and trade features exhibit remarkably similar predictive importance and SHAP dependence shapes across assets spanning an order of magnitude in market capitalization (BTC, LTC, ETC, ENJ, ROSE). The data covers Binance Futures perpetual contract order books and trades on 1-second frequency starting from January 1st, 2022 up to October 12th, 2025. Using a unified CatBoost modeling pipeline with a direction-aware GMADL objective and time-series cross validation, we show that feature rankings and partial effects are stable across assets despite heterogeneous liquidity and volatility. We connect these SHAP structures to microstructure theory (order flow imbalance, spread, and adverse selection) and validate tradability via a conservative top-of-book taker backtest as well as fixed depth maker backtest. Our primary novelty is a robustness analysis of a major flash crash, where the divergent performance of our taker and maker strategies empirically validates classic microstructure theories of adverse selection and highlights the systemic risks of algorithmic trading. Our results suggest a portable microstructure representation of short-horizon returns and motivate universal feature libraries for crypto markets.</description>

      <title>Do Whitepaper Claims Predict Market Behavior? Evidence from Cryptocurrency Factor Analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.20336</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.20336v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Cryptocurrency projects articulate value propositions through whitepapers, making claims about functionality and technical capabilities. This study investigates whether these narratives align with observed market behavior. We construct a pipeline combining zero-shot NLP classification (BART-MNLI) with CP tensor decomposition to compare three spaces: (1) a claims matrix from 24 whitepapers across 10 semantic categories, (2) market statistics for 49 assets over two years of hourly data, and (3) latent factors from tensor decomposition (rank 2, 92.45% variance explained). Using Procrustes rotation and Tucker's congruence coefficient, we test alignment across 23 common entities.
  Results show weak alignment: claims-statistics (phi=0.341, p=0.332), claims-factors (phi=0.077, p=0.747), and statistics-factors (phi=0.197, p&lt;0.001). The statistics-factors significance validates our methodology, confirming the pipeline detects relationships when present. Inter-model validation with DeBERTa-v3 yields 32% exact agreement but 67% top-3 agreement. Cross-sectional analysis reveals heterogeneous contributions: NEAR, MKR, ATOM show positive alignment while ENS, UNI, Bitcoin diverge most. Excluding Bitcoin confirms results are not driven by market dominance.
  We interpret findings as weak alignment between whitepaper narratives and market factor structure. Limited power (n=23) precludes distinguishing weak from no alignment, but strong alignment (phi&gt;=0.70) can be confidently rejected. Implications for narrative economics and investment analysis are discussed.</description>

      <title>A Learnable Wavelet Transformer for Long-Short Equity Trading and Risk-Adjusted Return Optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.13435</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.13435v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Learning profitable intraday trading policies from financial time series is challenging due to heavy noise, non-stationarity, and strong cross-sectional dependence among related assets. We propose \emph{WaveLSFormer}, a learnable wavelet-based long-short Transformer that jointly performs multi-scale decomposition and return-oriented decision learning. Specifically, a learnable wavelet front-end generates low-/high-frequency components via an end-to-end trained filter bank, guided by spectral regularizers that encourage stable and well-separated frequency bands. To fuse multi-scale information, we introduce a low-guided high-frequency injection (LGHI) module that refines low-frequency representations with high-frequency cues while controlling training stability. The model outputs a portfolio of long/short positions that is rescaled to satisfy a fixed risk budget and is optimized directly with a trading objective and risk-aware regularization. Extensive experiments on five years of hourly data across six industry groups, evaluated over ten random seeds, demonstrate that WaveLSFormer consistently outperforms MLP, LSTM and Transformer backbones, with and without fixed discrete wavelet front-ends. On average in all industries, WaveLSFormer achieves a cumulative overall strategy return of $0.607 \pm 0.045$ and a Sharpe ratio of $2.157 \pm 0.166$, substantially improving both profitability and risk-adjusted returns over the strongest baselines.</description>
