      <title>Boosting Perovskite Solar Cell Stability: Dual Protection with Ultrathin Plasma Polymer Passivation Layers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.19863</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.19863v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Metal halide perovskite solar cells (MHPSCs) hold great promise related to their high efficiency and low fabrication costs, but their long-term stability under environmental conditions remains a major challenge. In this study, we demonstrate an effective protection strategy to enhance the stability of MHPSCs through the incorporation of a double passivation layer based on an adamantane-based plasma polymer (ADA) at both the electron transport layer (ETL)/perovskite and perovskite/hole transport layer (HTL) interfaces. Our results show that the implemented ADA deposition technique is compatible with delicate substrates such as perovskites thin films, as their optical, morphological and optoelectronic properties are unaltered upon ADA deposition. At the same time, it provides effective protection to the perovskite material in high humidity environments. The ADA-double passivation not only reduces the formation of mobile ionic defects that cause additional recombination, but also significantly reduces humidity-induced degradation and mitigates the photocatalytic degradation caused by TiO2 under UV exposure. Stability tests performed under 100% relative humidity and continuous AM 1.5G illumination (ISOS-L-1) show that ADA dual passivated devices retained 80% of their initial efficiency after 4000 minutes, while reference samples dropped to 30%. The enhanced performance of ADA-passivated cells is attributed to protective nature of the plasma polymer layer resulting in a preservation of photocurrent and the prevention of new recombination routes. This dual passivation strategy offers a promising route to improve the environmental stability of PSCs and extend their operational lifetime.</description>

      <title>Rotating polarization magnetometry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.20044</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.20044v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Precise magnetometry is vital in numerous scientific and technological applications. At the forefront of sensitivity, optical atomic magnetometry, particularly techniques utilizing nonlinear magneto-optical rotation (NMOR), enables ultraprecise measurements across a broad field range. Despite their potential, these techniques reportedly lose sensitivity at higher magnetic fields, which is attributed to the alignment-to-orientation conversion (AOC) process. In our study, we utilize light with continuously rotating linear polarization to avoid AOC, producing robust optical signals and achieving high magnetometric sensitivity over a dynamic range nearly three times greater than Earth's magnetic field. We demonstrate that employing rotating polarization surpasses other NMOR techniques that use modulated light. Our findings also indicate that the previously observed signal deterioration is not due to AOC, suggesting an alternative cause for this decline.</description>

      <title>Back-Scattering Suppression for Broad-Spectral High-Absorption Silicon Extended Area Blackbody</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.20153</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.20153v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The stability and emissivity of the online calibration blackbody used in high-precision infrared remote sensing detectors in extreme environments are the primary limiting factors for their measurement accuracy. Due to the limitations of microstructure size effects, traditional calibration extended area blackbody cannot achieve an optimal balance between emissivity and stability, thus hindering further improvement in infrared remote sensing accuracy. This work proposes a new method that utilize suppressing near-field backscattering to control far-field reflectance. Specifically, through simultaneously reducing backscattering intensity and the backscattering solid angle, the reflectance is significantly reduced to an extremely low limit, which is validated through numerical simulations. Additionally, by combining the femtosecond laser self-convergent processing technique, the spontaneous energy negative feedback mechanism during femtosecond laser processing is utilized to achieve the fabrication of a high emissivity, thermally stable, mechanically stable, and highly uniform extended area blackbody. The blackbody fabricated using this technique can be applied for online calibration in various extreme environments, significantly improving measurement accuracy and service life.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.20261v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We demonstrate trapping of individual rubidium (Rb) and cesium (Cs) atoms in an interleaved array of bright tweezers and dark bottle-beam traps, using a microfabricated optical element illuminated by a single laser beam. This trapping approach is simple and robust compared to common approaches that use active optoelectronic components and multiple laser wavelengths, and can be easily adapted for other atomic species.</description>

      <title>The destabilising effect of particle concentration in inclined settlers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.20284</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.20284v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Water scarcity has required constant water recycling, leading to a decline in water quality, further exacerbated by high concentrations of fine particles that reduce the efficiency of solid-liquid separation systems. Inclined settlers offer a viable secondary treatment option for high-turbidity water. Effective design requires understanding of operational conditions, geometry, and suspension properties. Using OpenFOAM, CFD simulations were performed for a continuous inclined countercurrent conduit to assess the influence of inlet particle concentration on efficiency, exploring various Surface Overflow Rates (SOR) and inclination angles. The results show that the steady state in which the flow settles is strongly dependent on the particle concentration. For very low particle concentrations, the flow is mostly stationary with little to no resuspension of particles. Increasingly unstable regimes are observed to emerge as the inlet concentration increases, leading to increased particle resuspension. Instabilities arise from overhanging zones at the tip of the suspension, generating recirculation zones that enlarge the resuspension region and induce entrainment within the bulk suspension. Shear instabilities become noticeable at large particle concentrations, further increasing resuspension. Different regimes were identified, influenced by the SOR and the inclination angles. Additionally, a Reynolds number characterizing these systems is proposed alongside a scale analysis. The findings highlight particle concentration as a critical parameter in inclined plate settler design.</description>

      <title>Simultaneous imaging of bidirectional guided waves enables synchronous probing of mechanical anisotropy, local blood pressure, and stress in arteries</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.20288</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.20288v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Arterial biomechanical indicators have long been recognized as fundamental contributors to the physiology and pathology of cardiovascular systems. Probing the multiple biomechanical parameters of arteries simultaneously at different time points within one cardiac cycle is of great importance but remains challenging. Here we report an ultrasound elastography method to quantify arterial anisotropic stiffness, mechanical stresses in arterial wall, and local blood pressure in a single measurement. With programmed acoustic radiation force, arterial axial and circumferential guided elastic waves were induced simultaneously and recorded at multiple time points within one cardiac cycle. Then a mechanical model incorporating acoustoelasticity and viscoelasticity of arteries was proposed to quantitatively predict the correlation of arterial guided elastic waves with arterial biomechanical parameters. Our experimental design and biomechanical model lead to an elastography method to interrogate the variation of blood pressure, arterial bidirectional stiffnesses and mechanical stresses in arterial walls with time. In vivo experiments were performed on healthy young, normotensive older and hypertensive older volunteers. The results demonstrate that the reported method can find applications in understanding aging of cardiovascular system and diagnosis of cardiovascular diseases.</description>

      <title>Theory of Valley Splitting in Si/SiGe Spin-Qubits: Interplay of Strain, Resonances and Random Alloy Disorder</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.20618</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.20618v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Electron spin-qubits in silicon-germanium (SiGe) heterostructures are a major candidate for the realization of scalable quantum computers. A critical challenge in strained Si/SiGe quantum wells (QWs) is the existence of two nearly degenerate valley states at the conduction band minimum that can lead to leakage of quantum information. To address this issue, various strategies have been explored to enhance the valley splitting (i.e., the energy gap between the two low-energy conduction band minima), such as sharp interfaces, oscillating germanium concentrations in the QW and shear strain engineering. In this work, we develop a comprehensive envelope-function theory augmented by the empirical pseudopotential method to incorporate the effects of alloy disorder, strain, and non-trivial resonances arising from interaction between valley states across different Brillouin zones. We apply our model to analyze common epitaxial profiles studied in the literature and compare our results with previous work. This framework provides an efficient tool for quantifying the interplay of these effects on the valley splitting, enabling complex epitaxial profile optimization in future work.</description>

Abstract: We establish the theoretical framework for a material system that supports surface plasmon polaritions (SPPs) excited by a dipole excitation, where the media configuration suddenly changes at a temporal boundary. We employ three-dimensional Green's function analysis in the Laplace transform domain. We use this framework to demonstrate dynamic SPP formation and time-boundary-induced interference of slow and fast propagating SPPs. This analysis provides insight into how SPPs are formed in time and how they interfere at a temporal boundary.</description>

      <title>Diffractive Magic Cube Network with Super-high Capacity Enabled by Mechanical Reconfiguration</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.20693</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.20693v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Multiplexing and dynamic reconfigurable metasurfaces have been extensively studied to enhance system capacity in response to the challenges posed by the exponential growth of optical information. Among them, the mechanically reconfigurable strategy offers a cost-effective and low-complexity approach for capacity enhancement. However, the channel numbers achieved in current studies are insufficient for practical applications because of inadequate mechanical transformations and suboptimal optimization methods. In this article, a diffractive magic cube network (DMCN) is proposed to advance the multiplexing capacity of mechanically reconfigurable metasurfaces. We utilized the deep diffractive neural network (D2NN) model to jointly optimize the subset of channels generated by the combination of three mechanical operations, permutation, translation, and rotation. The 144-channel holograms, 108-channel single-focus/multi-focus, and 60-channel orbital angular momentum (OAM) beam/comb generation were numerically achieved and experimentally validated using a spatial light modulator (SLM) and a reflective mirror. Our strategy not only provides a novel paradigm to improve metasurface capacity to super-high level with low crosstalk, but also paves the way for new advancements in optical storage, computing, communication, and photolithography.</description>

      <title>High-pressure growth effects on the superconducting properties of Sm-based oxypnictide superconductors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.20837</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.20837v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: High-pressure synthesis can be an effective method for improving the sample quality of materials as well as their superconducting properties. In this paper, the synthesis process of F- doped SmFeAsO has been optimized by preparing a series of bulk SmFeAsO0.8F0.2 (Sm1111) using the high gas pressure and high-temperature synthesis (HP-HTS) method, considering various growth parameters like growth pressures (0-1 GPa) and heating time (0.5-2 h). Structural, microstructural, Raman spectroscopic, transport, and magnetic measurements are employed to comprehensively analyze these bulks and derive the conclusive findings. The parent SmFeAsO0.8F0.2 prepared by the conventional synthesis process at ambient pressure (CSP) has a transition temperature (Tc) of around 53-54 K, and the critical current density (Jc) of 103 A/cm2 at 5 K with a small amount of the impurity phases (SmOF and SmAs), consistent with previous reports. Interestingly, all bulks synthesized by HP-HTS have almost the same Tc and Jc as the parent sample. The optimal growth conditions are obtained as 900C, 1 hour, and 0.5 GPa with the sealed Ta-tube, which slightly improved the sample quality and the superconducting properties compared to other bulks grown by HP-HTS. Our study confirms that the existence of the impurity phases in the 1111 family is very robust and cannot be reduced by HP-HTS, leading to only a small variation in the observed superconducting properties of Sm1111 whether prepared by CSP or HP-HTS. This is the first comprehensive investigation of the high-pressure development of Sm1111, which shows distinct behaviour from other families of iron-based superconductors.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.20938v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Switching magnetism using only electricity is of great significance for information applications but remains challenging. We find that, altermagnetism, as a newly discovered unconventional magnetism, may open an avenue along this effort. Specifically, to have deterministic switching, i.e., reversing current direction must reverse magnetic structure, parity symmetry has to be broken. We discover that due to their symmetry that depends on chemical environments, altermagnet devices may naturally carry the parity symmetry breaking required for deterministic electrical switching of magnetism. More importantly, we identify MnTe and FeS bilayers as candidate devices. This scheme will inspire further explorations on unconventional magnetism and potential applications.</description>

      <title>On-chip, inverse-designed active wavelength division multiplexer at THz frequencies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.20967</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.20967v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The development of photonic integrated components for terahertz has become an active and growing research field. Despite its numerous applications, several challenges are still present in hardware design. We demonstrate an on-chip active wavelength division multiplexer (WDM) operating at THz frequencies. The WDM architecture is based on an inverse design topology optimization, which is applied in this case to the active quantum cascade heterostructure material embedded within a polymer in a planarized double metal cavity. Such an approach enables the fabrication of a strongly subwavelength device, with a normalized volume of only $V/\lambda^3 \simeq 0.5$. The WDM input is integrated with a THz quantum cascade laser frequency comb, providing three broadband output ports, ranging from 2.2 THz to 3.2 THz, with $\approx$ 330 GHz bandwidth and a maximum crosstalk of -6 dB. The three ports are outcoupled via integrated broadband patch array antennas with surface emission. Such a device can be also function as a stand-alone element, unlocking complex on-chip signal processing in the THz range</description>

      <title>Near-zero-index behavior in indium antimonide revealed by phase-corrected terahertz reflection spectroscopy</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.21073v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We developed a phase correction method for broadband terahertz time-domain spectroscopy in reflection geometry, which allows us to obtain quantitative and accurate values for the complex refractive index of materials. The process is analytical, based on the Kramers-Kronig relations, and does not require any computationally intensive algorithms. We validate it by extracting the refractive index of silicon, obtaining the nominal value with an accuracy better than 2.5\% over the 0.25--3.5 THz range, and better than 0.6\% in the 1--2 THz range. We use the method to experimentally observe that an undoped InSb crystal shows a refractive index of $n&lt;1$ between 1 and 2 THz, in proximity to the plasma frequency of the material where, the amplitude of the group velocity goes as low as 0.08$c$.</description>

      <title>Cavity-QED Simulation of a Maser beyond the Mean-Field Approximation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.21166</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.21166v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We here introduce a method for simulating, quantum mechanically, the dynamics of a maser where the strength of the magnetic field of the microwave mode being amplified by stimulated emission varies over the volume of the maser's spatially extended gain medium. This is very often the case in real systems. Our method generalizes the well-known Tavis-Cummings (T-C) model of cavity quantum electrodynamics (QED) to encompass quantum emitters whose coupling strengths to the maser's amplified mode vary over a distribution that can be accurately determined using an electromagnetic-field solver applied to the maser cavity's geometry and composition. We then solve our generalized T-C model to second order in cumulant expansion using publicly available Python-based software. We apply our methodology to a specific, experimentally measured maser based on an optically pumped crystal of pentacene-doped para-terphenyl. We demonstrate that certain distinct quantum-mechanical features exhibited by this maser's dynamics, most notably the observation of Rabi-like flopping associated with the generation of spin-photon Dicke states, can be accurately reproduced using our numerically solved model. The equivalent simpler model, that invokes the mean-field approximation, fails to do so. By constructing then solving for artificial (perfectly Gaussian) distributions, we go on to explore how the performance of this type of maser is affected by the spread in spin-photon coupling strengths. Our methodology thereby enables the maser's anatomy to be more rationally engineered.</description>

      <title>Ultratight confinement of atoms in a Rydberg empowered optical lattice</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2301.04450</link>
      <description>arXiv:2301.04450v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Optical lattices serve as fundamental building blocks for atomic quantum technology. However, the scale and resolution of these lattices are diffraction-limited to the light wavelength. In conventional lattices, achieving tight confinement of single sites requires high laser intensity, which unfortunately leads to reduced coherence due to increased scattering. This article presents a novel approach for creating an atomic optical lattice with a sub-wavelength spatial structure. The potential is generated by leveraging the nonlinear optical response of three-level Rydberg-dressed atoms, which allows us to overcome the diffraction limit of the driving fields. The resulting lattice comprises a three-dimensional array of ultra-narrow Lorentzian wells over nanometer scales. These unprecedented scales can now be accessed through a hybrid scheme that combines the dipolar interaction and optical twist of atomic eigenstates. The interaction-induced two-body resonance that forms the trapping potential, only occurs at a peculiar laser intensity, localizing the trap sites to ultra-narrow regions over the standing-wave driving field. The feasibility study shows that single-atom confinement in Lorentzian sites with 3nm width, and 37MHz depth are realizable with available lasers. The development of these ultra-narrow trapping techniques holds great promise for applications such as Rydberg-Fermi gates, atomtronics, quantum walks, Hubbard models, and neutral-atom quantum simulation.</description>

      <title>Shadow Area and Degrees of Freedom for Free-Space Communication</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.21122</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.21122v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The number of degrees-of-freedom (NDoF) in a communication system is limited by the number of antenna ports, element shapes, positions, and the propagation environment. As the number of antenna elements increases within a given region, the NDoF eventually saturates due to correlation of the radiated fields. The maximal NDoF can be determined numerically for communication between two regions using singular value decomposition of a channel model representing wave propagation between densely sampled sources at the transmitter and fields at the receiver. This paper provides a straightforward analytical estimate of the NDoF for arbitrarily shaped transmitter and receiver regions. The analysis show that the NDoF for electrically large regions is approximated by the mutual shadow area of the regions, measured in wavelengths. Several setups illustrate the results, which are then compared with numerical evaluations of the singular values of the propagation channel. These new analytical expressions also simplify to previously established results based on Weyl's law and the paraxial approximation.</description>

      <title>A physics-compliant diagonal representation for wireless channels parametrized by beyond-diagonal reconfigurable intelligent surfaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.20509</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.20509v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The parametrization of wireless channels by so-called "beyond-diagonal reconfigurable intelligent surfaces" (BD-RIS) is mathematically characterized by a matrix whose off-diagonal entries are partially or fully populated. Physically, this corresponds to tunable coupling mechanisms between the RIS elements that originate from the RIS control circuit. Here, we derive a physics-compliant diagonal representation for BD-RIS-parametrized channels. We recognize that any RIS control circuit can always be separated into its static parts (SLC) and a set of tunable individual loads (IL). Therefore, a BD-RIS-parametrized channel results from the chain cascade of three systems: i) radio environment (RE), ii) SLC, and iii) IL. RE and SLC are static non-diagonal systems whose cascade K is terminated by the tunable diagonal system IL. This physics-compliant representation in terms of K and IL is directly analogous to that for conventional ("diagonal") RIS (D-RIS). Therefore, scenarios with BD-RIS can also readily be captured by the physics-compliant coupled-dipole model PhysFad, as we show. In addition, physics-compliant algorithms for system-level optimization with D-RIS can be directly applied to scenarios with BD-RIS. We demonstrate this important implication of our conceptual finding in a case study on end-to-end channel estimation and optimization in a BD-RIS-parametrized rich-scattering environment. Our case study is the first experimentally grounded system-level optimization for BD-RIS: We obtain the characteristics of RE and IL from experimental measurements and a commercial PIN diode, respectively. Altogether, our physics-compliant diagonal representation for BD-RIS enables a paradigm shift in how practitioners in wireless communications and signal processing implement system-level optimizations for BD-RIS because it enables them to directly apply existing physics-compliant D-RIS algorithms.</description>

      <title>Physically Guided Deep Unsupervised Inversion for 1D Magnetotelluric Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.15274</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.15274v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The global demand for unconventional energy sources such as geothermal energy and white hydrogen requires new exploration techniques for precise subsurface structure characterization and potential reservoir identification. The Magnetotelluric (MT) method is crucial for these tasks, providing critical information on the distribution of subsurface electrical resistivity at depths ranging from hundreds to thousands of meters. However, traditional iterative algorithm-based inversion methods require the adjustment of multiple parameters, demanding time-consuming and exhaustive tuning processes to achieve proper cost function minimization. Although recent advances have incorporated deep learning algorithms for MT inversion, primarily based on supervised learning, \paul{and} needs large labeled datasets for training. This work utilizes TensorFlow operations to create a differentiable forward MT operator, leveraging its automatic differentiation capability. Moreover, instead of solving for the subsurface model directly, as classical algorithms perform, this paper presents a new deep unsupervised inversion algorithm guided by physics to estimate 1D MT models. Instead of using datasets with the observed data and their respective model as labels during training, our method employs a differentiable modeling operator that physically guides the cost function minimization, making the proposed method solely dependent on observed data. Therefore, the optimization \paul{algorithm} updates the network weights to minimize the data misfit. We test the proposed method with field and synthetic data at different acquisition frequencies, demonstrating that the resistivity models obtained are more accurate than those calculated using other techniques.</description>

      <title>Wavelength-selective thermal nonreciprocity barely improves sky radiative cooling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.02387</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.02387v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Radiative cooling has showcased great potential for passive refrigeration without extra energy consumption, while its cooling power and efficiency is confined by Kirchhoff's law, that is, the emissivity is equal to the absorptivity. The recent development of thermal nonreciprocity that breaks the limitations of Kirchhoff's law, especially in broadband manner, makes nonreciprocal radiative cooling (NRC) possible. Since there lacks of reports of NRC theoretically or experimentally, it is time to evaluate the feasibility and worthiness of develop NRC. Here, we discussed the effects of NRC at around room temperature (298.15 K) from three perspectives: ideal selective radiators, non-selective radiators, and colored radiators. Contrary to intuition, the introduction of thermal nonreciprocity in the atmospheric window (8-13 {\mu}m) only leads to a negative gain. Additionally, it should be noted that the radiators discussed in this work are horizontally placed without the influence of asymmetric external heat sources. The current findings shatter the inherent notion of NRC and offer some theoretical support for the practical realization and application of nonreciprocal radiative refrigeration devices.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.05948v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Lattice thermal conductivity, being integral to thermal transport properties, is indispensable to advancements in areas such as thermoelectric materials and thermal management. Traditional methods, such as Density Functional Theory and Molecular Dynamics, require significant computational resources, posing challenges to the high-throughput prediction of lattice thermal conductivity. Although AI-driven material science has achieved fruitful progress, the trade-off between accuracy and interpretability in machine learning continues to hinder further advancements. This study utilizes interpretable deep learning techniques to construct a rapid prediction framework that enables both qualitative assessments and quantitative predictions, accurately forecasting the thermal transport properties of three novel materials. Furthermore, interpretable deep learning offers analytically grounded physical models while integrating with sensitivity analysis to uncover deeper theoretical insights.</description>

      <title>Thermo-optic tuning of directional infrared emissivity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.17659</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.17659v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Tuning the spatial extent of directional thermal emission across an arbitrary, and fixed spectral bandwidth is a fundamentally enabling capability for a range of emerging applications such as thermophotovoltaics, thermal imaging, and radiative cooling. However, previous experimental demonstrations were limited to narrow bandwidths, and the resonance frequency itself changed significantly as a function of the reconfigured directional response. Here, we demonstrate thermo-optic tuning of directional infrared emissivity using InAs-based gradient ENZ materials functioning as broadband directional thermal emitters whose angular selectivity can be modified via thermal free-carrier effects. We experimentally demonstrate two emitters achieving a 5{\deg} and 10{\deg} increase in the angular extent of their directional emissivity in the p-polarization across a prescribed, broad wavelength range of operation (12.5 to 15$\mu$m), for moderate temperatures below 400 K. Temperature-driven control of directional emissivity offers a new mode of post-fabrication control of radiative heat transfer that may in turn enable novel device functionalities.</description>

      <title>Integrated Electro-Optic Absorption Modulator for Silicon Nitride Platform</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.19306</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.19306v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Silicon nitride (SiN) is currently the most prominent platform for photonics at visible and near-IR wavelength bandwidth. However, realizing fast electro-optic (EO) modulators, the key components of any integrated optics platform, remains challenging in SiN. Recently, transparent conductive oxides (TCO) have emerged as a promising platform for photonic integrated circuits. Here we make an important step towards exceeding possibilities of both platforms, reporting for the first-time high-speed ITO electro-optic modulators based on silicon nitride waveguides. The insertion losses of 5.7 dB and bandwidth of about 1 GHz are shown for 300 nm-thickness SiN waveguide platform with 9.3-um-length hybrid waveguide. The fabrication process of devices requires only standard clean room tools, is repeatable and compatible with the CMOS technology. Simulation results of optimized device designs indicate that further improvement is possible and offer promising opportunities towards silicon nitride photonic computation platforms based on ITO.</description>
