      <title>Channel and Spectrum Consumption Models for Urban Outdoor-to-Outdoor 28 GHz Wireless</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.11876</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.11876v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Next generation wireless and mobile networks will utilize millimeter-wave (mmWave) communication to achieve significantly increased data rates. However, since mmWave radio signals experience high path loss, the operation of mmWave networks will require accurate channel models designed for specific deployment sites. In this paper, we focus on the deployment area of the PAWR COSMOS testbed in New York City and report extensive 28 GHz channel measurements. These include over 46 million power measurements collected from over 3,000 links on 24 sidewalks at 4 different sites and in different settings. Using these measurements, we study the effects of the setup and environments (e.g., transmitter height and seasonal effects). We then discuss the obtained path gain values and their fitted lines, and the resulting effective azimuth beamforming gain. Based on these results, we also study the link SNR values that can be supported on individual sidewalks and the corresponding theoretically achievable data rates. Finally, we develop a process to transform the measurements and generate Spectrum Consumption Models (SCMs) based on the IEEE 1900.5.2 standard. The generated SCMs facilitate the evaluation of spectrum sharing and interference management scenarios since they capture all the directional propagation effects reflected in the measurements and provide a way to easily share the main propagation characterization results derived from the measurements. We believe that the results can inform the COSMOS testbed deployment process and provide a benchmark for other deployment efforts in dense urban areas.</description>

      <title>Low Range-Doppler Sidelobe ISAC Waveform Design: A Low-Complexity Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.11949</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.11949v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) is a pivotal enabler for next-generation wireless networks. A key challenge in ISAC systems lies in designing dual-functional waveforms that can achieve satisfactory radar sensing accuracy by effectively suppressing range-Doppler sidelobes. However, existing solutions are often computationally intensive, limiting their practicality in multi-input multi-output (MIMO) orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM) ISAC deployments. This paper presents a novel low-complexity algorithm leveraging the augmented Lagrangian method (ALM) and Riemannian conjugate gradient (RCG) optimization techniques to address these challenges. The proposed algorithm achieves superior sidelobe suppression compared to state-of-the-art methods while dramatically reducing computational complexity, making it highly suitable for real-world MIMO-OFDM ISAC systems. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed approach not only outperforms existing benchmarks in sidelobe reduction but also accelerates convergence, ensuring efficient performance across communication and sensing tasks.</description>

      <title>Impact of Frequency on Diffraction-Aided Wireless Positioning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.11993</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.11993v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper tackles the challenge of accurate positioning in Non-Line-of-Sight (NLoS) environments, with a focus on indoor public safety scenarios where NLoS bias severely impacts localization performance. We explore Diffraction MultiPath Components (MPC) as a critical mechanism for Outdoor-to-Indoor (O2I) signal propagation and its role in positioning. The proposed system comprises outdoor Uncrewed Aerial Vehicle (UAV) transmitters and indoor receivers that require localization. To facilitate diffraction-based positioning, we develop a method to isolate diffraction MPCs at indoor receivers and validate its effectiveness using a ray-tracing-generated dataset, which we have made publicly available. Our evaluation across the FR1, FR2, and FR3 frequency bands within the 5G/6G spectrum confirms the viability of diffraction-based positioning techniques for next-generation wireless networks.</description>

      <title>WiFi-Diffusion: Achieving Fine-Grained WiFi Radio Map Estimation With Ultra-Low Sampling Rate by Diffusion Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.12004</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.12004v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Fine-grained radio map presents communication parameters of interest, e.g., received signal strength, at every point across a large geographical region. It can be leveraged to improve the efficiency of spectrum utilization for a large area, particularly critical for the unlicensed WiFi spectrum. The problem of fine-grained radio map estimation is to utilize radio samples collected by sparsely distributed sensors to infer the map. This problem is challenging due to the ultra-low sampling rate, where the number of available samples is far less than the fine-grained resolution required for radio map estimation. We propose WiFi-Diffusion -- a novel generative framework for achieving fine-grained WiFi radio map estimation using diffusion models. WiFi-Diffusion employs the creative power of generative AI to address the ultra-low sampling rate challenge and consists of three blocks: 1) a boost block, using prior information such as the layout of obstacles to optimize the diffusion model; 2) a generation block, leveraging the diffusion model to generate a candidate set of radio maps; and 3) an election block, utilizing the radio propagation model as a guide to find the best radio map from the candidate set. Extensive simulations demonstrate that 1) the fine-grained radio map generated by WiFi-Diffusion is ten times better than those produced by state-of-the-art (SOTA) when they use the same ultra-low sampling rate; and 2) WiFi-Diffusion achieves comparable fine-grained radio map quality with only one-fifth of the sampling rate required by SOTA.</description>

      <title>Dynamic IRS Allocation for Spectrum-Sharing MIMO Communication and Radar Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.12005</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.12005v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper investigates the use of intelligent reflecting surfaces (IRS) to assist cellular communications and radar sensing operations in a communications and sensing setup. The IRS dynamically allocates reflecting elements to simultaneously localize a target and assist a user's communication. To achieve this, we propose a novel optimization framework that jointly addresses beamforming design and IRS element allocation. Specifically, we formulate a Weighted Minimum Mean Square Error (WMMSE)-based approach that iteratively optimizes the transmit and receive beamforming vectors, IRS phase shifts, and element allocation. The allocation mechanism adaptively balances the number of IRS elements dedicated to communication and sensing subsystems by leveraging the signal-to-noise-plus-interference-ratio (SINR) between the two. The proposed solution ensures efficient resource utilization while maintaining performance trade-offs. Numerical results demonstrate significant improvements in both communication and sensing SINRs under varying system parameters.</description>

      <title>Unsupervised Learning for AoD Estimation in MISO Downlink LoS Transmissions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.12033</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.12033v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: With the emerging of simultaneous localization and communication (SLAC), it becomes more and more attractive to perform angle of departure (AoD) estimation at the receiving Internet of Thing (IoT) user end for improved positioning accuracy, flexibility and enhanced user privacy. To address challenges like large number of real-time measurements required for latency-critical applications and enormous data collection for training deep learning models in conventional AoD estimation methods, we propose in this letter an unsupervised learning framework, which unifies training for both deterministic maximum likelihood (DML) and stochastic maximum likelihood (SML) based AoD estimation in multiple-input single-output (MISO) downlink (DL) wireless transmissions. Specifically, under the line-of-sight (LoS) assumption, we incorporate both the received signals and pilot-sequence information, as per its availability at the DL user, into the input of the deep learning model, and adopt a common neural network architecture compatible with input data in both DML and SML cases. Extensive numerical results validate that the proposed unsupervised learning based AoD estimation not only improves estimation accuracy, but also significantly reduces required number of observations, thereby reducing both estimation overhead and latency compared to various benchmarks.</description>

      <title>A Novel Environment Object Modeling Method for Vehicular ISAC Scenarios</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.12078</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.12078v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Integrated Sensing and Communication (ISAC), as a fundamental technology of 6G, empowers Vehicle-to-Everything (V2X) systems with enhanced sensing capabilities. One of its promising applications is the reliance on constructed maps for vehicle positioning. Traditional positioning methods primarily rely on Line-of-Sight (LOS), but in urban vehicular scenarios, obstructions often result in predominantly Non-Line-of-Sight (NLOS) conditions. Existing research indicates that NLOS paths, characterized by one-bounce reflection on building walls with determined delay and angle, can support sensing and positioning. However, experimental validation remains insufficient. To address this gap, channel measurements are conducted in an urban street to explore the existence of strong reflected paths in the presence of a vehicle target. The results show significant power contribution from NLOS paths, with large Environmental Objects (EOs) playing a key role in shaping NLOS propagation. Then, a novel model for EO reflection is proposed to extend the Geometry-Based Stochastic Model (GBSM) for ISAC channel standardization. Simulation results validate the model's ability to capture EO's power and position characteristics, showing that higher EO-reflected power and closer distance to Rx reduce Delay Spread (DS), which is more favorable for positioning. This model provides theoretical guidance and empirical support for ISAC positioning algorithms and system design in vehicular scenarios.</description>

      <title>Optimal Hybrid Transmit Beamforming for mm-Wave Integrated Sensing and Communication</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.12129</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.12129v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A hybrid beamformer (HBF) is designed for integrated sensing and communication (ISAC)-aided millimeter wave (mmWave) systems. The ISAC base station (BS), relying on a limited number of radio frequency (RF) chains, supports multiple communication users (CUs) and simultaneously detects the radar target (RT). To maximize the probability of detection (PD) of the RT, and achieve rate fairness among the CUs, we formulate two problems for the optimization of the RF and baseband (BB) transmit precoders (TPCs): PD-maximization (PD-max) and geometric mean rate-maximization (GMR-max), while ensuring the quality of services (QoS) of the RT and CUs. Both problems are highly non-convex due to the intractable expressions of the PD and GMR and also due to the non-convex unity magnitude constraints imposed on each element of the RF TPC. To solve these problems, we first transform the intractable expressions into their tractable counterparts and propose a power-efficient bisection search and majorization and minimization-based alternating algorithms for the PD-max and GMR-max problems, respectively. Furthermore, both algorithms optimize the BB TPC and RF TPCs in an alternating fashion via the successive convex approximation (SCA) and penalty-based Riemannian conjugate gradient (PRCG) techniques, respectively. Specifically, in the PRCG method, we initially add all the constraints except for the unity magnitude constraint to the objective function as a penalty term and subsequently employ the RCG method for optimizing the RF TPC. Finally, we present our simulation results and compare them to the benchmarks for demonstrating the efficacy of the proposed algorithms.</description>

      <title>Indoor Positioning for Public Safety: Role of UAVs, LEOs, and Propagation-Aware Techniques</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.12264</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.12264v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Effective indoor positioning is critical for public safety, enabling first responders to locate at-risk individuals accurately during emergency scenarios. However, traditional Global Navigation Satellite Systems (GNSS) often perform poorly indoors due to poor coverage and non-line-of-sight (NLOS) conditions. Moreover, relying on fixed cellular infrastructure, such as terrestrial networks (TNs), may not be feasible, as indoor signal coverage from a sufficient number of base stations or WiFi access points cannot be guaranteed for accurate positioning. In this paper, we propose a rapidly deployable indoor positioning system (IPS) leveraging mobile anchors, including uncrewed aerial vehicles (UAVs) and Low-Earth-Orbit (LEO) satellites, and discuss the role of GNSS and LEOs in localizing the mobile anchors. Additionally, we discuss the role of sidelink-based positioning, which is introduced in 3rd Generation Partnership Project (3GPP) Release 18, in enabling public safety systems. By examining outdoor-to-indoor (O2I) signal propagation, particularly diffraction-based approaches, we highlight how propagation-aware positioning methods can outperform conventional strategies that disregard propagation mechanism information. The study highlights how emerging 5G Advanced and Non-Terrestrial Networks (NTN) features offer new avenues to improve positioning in challenging indoor environments, ultimately paving the way for cost-effective and resilient IPS solutions tailored to public safety applications.</description>

      <title>How Do Microstrip Losses Impact Near-Field Beam Depth in Dynamic Metasurface Antennas?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.12280</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.12280v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The convergence of eXtremely Large (XL) antenna arrays and high-frequency bands in future wireless networks will inevitably give rise to near-field communications, localization, and sensing. Dynamic Metasurface Antennas (DMAs) have emerged as a key enabler of the XL Multiple-Input Multiple-Output (MIMO) paradigm, leveraging reconfigurable metamaterials to support large antenna arrays. However, DMAs are inherently lossy due to propagation losses in the microstrip lines and radiative losses from the metamaterial elements, which reduce their gain and alter their beamforming characteristics compared to a lossless aperture. In this paper, we address the gap in understanding how DMA losses affect near-field beamforming performance, by deriving novel analytical expressions for the beamforming gain of DMAs under misalignments between the focusing position and the intended user's position in 3D space. Additionally, we derive beam depth limits for varying attenuation conditions, from lossless to extreme attenuation, offering insights into the impact of losses on DMA near-field performance.</description>

      <title>AI-driven 6G Air Interface: Technical Usage Scenarios and Balanced Design Methodology</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.12308</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.12308v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper systematically analyzes the typical application scenarios and key technical challenges of AI in 6G air interface transmission, covering important areas such as performance enhancement of single functional modules, joint optimization of multiple functional modules, and low-complexity solutions to complex mathematical problems. Innovatively, a three-dimensional joint optimization design criterion is proposed, which comprehensively considers AI capability, quality, and cost. By maximizing the ratio of multi-scenario communication capability to comprehensive cost, a triangular equilibrium is achieved, effectively addressing the lack of consideration for quality and cost dimensions in existing design criteria. The effectiveness of the proposed method is validated through multiple design examples, and the technical pathways and challenges for air interface AI standardization are thoroughly discussed. This provides significant references for the theoretical research and engineering practice of 6G air interface AI technology.</description>

      <title>Low-Complexity MUSIC Algorithm: From Finite-Precision Perspective</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.12316</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.12316v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The high computational complexity of the multiple signal classification (MUSIC) algorithm is mainly caused by the subspace decomposition and spectrum search, especially for frequent real-time applications or massive sensors. In this paper, we propose a low-complexity MUSIC algorithm from finite-precision arithmetic perspective. First, we analyze the computational bottlenecks of the classic low-complexity randomized unitary-based MUSIC (RU-MUSIC), formulating this computational issue as an inner product problem. Then, a mixed-precision method is introduced to address this problem. Specifically, this method partitions summations in inner products into blocks, where intra-block computations use low-precision arithmetic and inter-block sums use high-precision arithmetic. To further improve computational accuracy, we develop an adaptive-precision method that supports adaptive block sizes and multiple precision levels. Finally, simulation results show that the proposed finite-precision MUSIC design achieves direction-of-arrival (DOA) estimation performance similar to that using full-precision arithmetic while reducing more than 50\% computational cost.</description>

      <title>A Comparative Study of Invariance-Aware Loss Functions for Deep Learning-based Gridless Direction-of-Arrival Estimation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.12386</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.12386v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Covariance matrix reconstruction has been the most widely used guiding objective in gridless direction-of-arrival (DoA) estimation for sparse linear arrays. Many semidefinite programming (SDP)-based methods fall under this category. Although deep learning-based approaches enable the construction of more sophisticated objective functions, most methods still rely on covariance matrix reconstruction. In this paper, we propose new loss functions that are invariant to the scaling of the matrices and provide a comparative study of losses with varying degrees of invariance. The proposed loss functions are formulated based on the scale-invariant signal-to-distortion ratio between the target matrix and the Gram matrix of the prediction. Numerical results show that a scale-invariant loss outperforms its non-invariant counterpart but is inferior to the recently proposed subspace loss that is invariant to the change of basis. These results provide evidence that designing loss functions with greater degrees of invariance is advantageous in deep learning-based gridless DoA estimation.</description>

      <title>Movable Cell-Free Massive MIMO For High-Speed Train Communications: A PPO-Based Antenna Position Optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.12405</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.12405v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In recent years, high-speed trains (HSTs) communications have developed rapidly to enhance the stability of train operations and improve passenger connectivity experiences. However, as the train continues to accelerate, urgent technological innovations are needed to overcome challenges such as frequency handover and significant Doppler effects. In this paper, we present a novel architecture featuring movable antennas (MAs) to fully exploit macro spatial diversity, enabling a cell-free (CF) massive multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) system that supports high-speed train communications. Considering the high likelihood of line-of-sight (LoS) transmission in HST scenario, we derive the uplink spectral efficiency (SE) expression for the movable CF massive MIMO system. Moreover, an optimization problem is formulated to maximize the sum SE of the considered system by optimizing the positions of the antennas. Since the formulated problem is non-convex and highly non-linear, we improve a deep reinforcement learning algorithm to address it by using proximal policy optimization (PPO). Different from traditional optimization approaches, which optimize variables separately and alternately, our improved PPO-based approach optimizes all the variables in unison. Simulation results demonstrate that movable CF massive MIMO effectively suppresses the negative impact of the Doppler effect in HST communications.</description>

      <title>Spectral efficiency for mmWave downlink with beam misalignment in urban macro scenario</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.12442</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.12442v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we analyze the spectral efficiency for millimeter wave downlink with beam misalignment in urban macro scenario. For this purpose, we use a new approach based on the modified Shannon formula, which considers the propagation environment and antenna system coefficients. These factors are determined based on a multi-ellipsoidal propagation model. The obtained results show that under non-line-of-sight conditions, the appropriate selection of the antenna beam orientation may increase the spectral efficiency in relation to the direct line to a user.</description>

      <title>Power angular spectrum versus Doppler spectrum -- Measurements and analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.12443</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.12443v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we present an empirical verification of the method of determining the Doppler spectrum (DS) from the power angular spectrum (PAS). Measurements were made for the frequency of 3.5 GHz, under non-line-of-sight conditions in suburban areas characteristic of a university campus. In the static scenario, the measured PAS was the basis for the determination of DSs, which were compared with the DSs measured in the mobile scenario. The obtained results show that the proposed method gives some approximation to DS determined with the classic methods used so far.</description>

      <title>Variability of radio signal attenuation by single deciduous tree versus reception angle at 80 GHz</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.12445</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.12445v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Vegetation significantly affects radio signal attenuation, influenced by factors such as signal frequency, plant species, and foliage density. Existing attenuation models typically address specific scenarios, like single trees, rows of trees, or green spaces, with the ITU-R P.833 recommendation being a widely recognized standard. Most assessments for single trees focus on the primary radiation direction of the transmitting antenna. This paper introduces a novel approach to evaluating radio signal scattering by a single deciduous tree. Through measurements at 80 GHz and a bandwidth of approximately 2 GHz, we analyze how total signal attenuation varies with the reception angle relative to the transmitter-tree axis. The findings from various directional measurements contribute to a comprehensive attenuation model applicable to any reception angle and also highlight the impact of bandwidth on the received signal level.</description>

      <title>Fuzzy Clustering for Low-Complexity Time Domain Chromatic Dispersion Compensation Scheme in Coherent Optical Fiber Communication Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.12482</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.12482v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Chromatic dispersion compensation (CDC), implemented in either the time-domain or frequency-domain, is crucial for enhancing power efficiency in the digital signal processing of modern optical fiber communication systems. Developing low-complexity CDC schemes is essential for hardware implemention, particularly for high-speed and long-haul optical fiber communication systems. In this work, we propose a novel two-stage fuzzy clustered time-domain chromatic dispersion compensation scheme. Unlike hard decisions of CDC filter coefficients after determining the cluster centroids, our approach applies a soft fuzzy decision, allowing the coefficients to belong to multiple clusters. Experiments on a single-channel, single-polarization 20Gbaud 16-QAM 1800 km standard single-mode fiber communication system demonstrate that our approach has a complexity reduction of 53.8% and 40% compared with clustered TD-CDC and FD-CDC at a target Q-factor of 20% HD-FEC, respectively. Furthermore, the proposed method achieves the same optimal Q-factor as FD-CDC with a 27% complexity reduction.</description>

      <title>Limited-Resolution Hybrid Analog-Digital Precoding Design Using MIMO Detection Methods</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.12517</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.12517v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: While fully digital precoding achieves superior performance in massive multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) systems, it comes with significant drawbacks in terms of computational complexity and power consumption, particularly when operating at millimeter-wave frequencies and beyond. Hybrid analog-digital architectures address this by reducing radio frequency (RF) chains while maintaining performance in sparse multipath environments. However, most hybrid precoder designs assume ideal, infinite-resolution analog phase shifters, which cannot be implemented in actual systems. Another practical constraint is the limited fronthaul capacity between the baseband processor and array, implying that each entry of the digital precoder must be picked from a finite set of quantization labels. This paper proposes novel designs for the limited-resolution analog and digital precoders by exploiting two well-known MIMO symbol detection algorithms, namely sphere decoding (SD) and expectation propagation (EP). The goal is to minimize the Euclidean distance between the optimal fully digital precoder and the hybrid precoder to minimize the degradation caused by the finite resolution of the analog and digital precoders. Taking an alternative optimization approach, we first apply the SD method to find the precoders in each iteration optimally. Then, we apply the lower-complexity EP method which finds a near-optimal solution at a reduced computational cost. The effectiveness of the proposed designs is validated via numerical simulations, where we show that the proposed symbol detection-based precoder designs significantly outperform the nearest point mapping scheme which is commonly used for finding a sub-optimal solution to discrete optimization problems.</description>

      <title>Single-Carrier Waveform Design for Joint Sensing and Communication</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.12638</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.12638v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The emergence of 6G wireless networks demands solutions that seamlessly integrate communication and sensing. This letter proposes a novel waveform design for joint sensing and communication (JSAC) systems, combining single-carrier interleaved frequency division multiplexing (SC-IFDM), a 5G communication candidate signal, with frequency modulated continuous wave (FMCW), widely used for sensing. The proposed waveform leverages the sparse nature of FMCW within SC-IFDM to achieve orthogonal integration in three steps: SC-IFDM symbols are allocated alongside the sparse FMCW, followed by the SC-IFDM transform into the time domain, and a cyclic prefix (CP) is applied in which phase shifts are introduced to the FMCW. Additionally, an enhanced channel estimation method is incorporated to boost system performance. Simulation results demonstrate the proposed waveform's ability to deliver high-resolution sensing and superior communication performance, surpassing traditional multicarrier designs.</description>

      <title>TEANet: A Transpose-Enhanced Autoencoder Network for Wearable Stress Monitoring</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.12657</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.12657v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Mental stress poses a significant public health concern due to its detrimental effects on physical and mental well-being, necessitating the development of continuous stress monitoring tools for wearable devices. Blood volume pulse (BVP) sensors, readily available in many smartwatches, offer a convenient and cost-effective solution for stress monitoring. This study proposes a deep learning approach, a Transpose-Enhanced Autoencoder Network (TEANet), for stress detection using BVP signals. The proposed TEANet model was trained and validated utilizing a self-collected RUET SPML dataset, comprising 19 healthy subjects, and the publicly available wearable stress and affect detection (WESAD) dataset, comprising 15 healthy subjects. It achieves the highest accuracy of 92.51% and 96.94%, F1 scores of 95.03% and 95.95%, and kappa of 0.7915 and 0.9350 for RUET SPML, and WESAD datasets respectively. The proposed TEANet effectively detects mental stress through BVP signals with high accuracy, making it a promising tool for continuous stress monitoring. Furthermore, the proposed model effectively addresses class imbalances and demonstrates high accuracy, underscoring its potential for reliable real-time stress monitoring using wearable devices.</description>

      <title>Redefining Orthogonal Co-Existence: A Mother Waveform Framework for DFT-Based Waveforms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.12676</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.12676v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we introduce the concept of a mother waveform to address key challenges in 5th generation (5G) and 6th generation (6G) networks, including spectral efficiency, backward compatibility, enhanced flexibility, and the integration of joint sensing and communication (JSAC). We propose single-carrier interleaved frequency division multiplexing (SC-IFDM) as the mother waveform and demonstrate, through rigorous mathematical modeling, that it can generate all discrete Fourier transform (DFT)-based waveforms without requiring structural modifications. Specifically, by selectively configuring lattice indices and phase adjustments, SC-IFDM enables seamless adaptation to diverse waveforms, such as orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM), orthogonal chirp division multiplexing (OCDM), orthogonal time-frequency space (OTFS), affine frequency division multiplexing (AFDM), and frequency-modulated continuous wave (FMCW) within a unified framework. Critical aspects such as coexistence strategies and resource allocation are thoroughly explored. Simulation results demonstrate the proposed frameworks ability to deliver superior communication performance, robust sensing capabilities, and efficient coexistence, surpassing traditional waveform designs in scalability and adaptability.</description>

      <title>High-Resolution Range-Doppler Imaging from One-Bit PMCW Radar via Generative Adversarial Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.12841</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.12841v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Digital modulation schemes such as PMCW have recently attracted increasing attention as possible replacements for FMCW modulation in future automotive radar systems. A significant obstacle to their widespread adoption is the expensive and power-consuming ADC required at gigahertz frequencies. To mitigate these challenges, employing low-resolution ADC, such as one-bit, has been suggested. Nonetheless, using one-bit sampling results in the loss of essential information. This study explores two RD imaging methods in PMCW radar systems utilizing NN. The first method merges standard RD signal processing with a GAN, whereas the second method uses an E2E strategy in which traditional signal processing is substituted with an NN-based RD module. The findings indicate that these methods can substantially improve the probability of detecting targets in the range-Doppler domain.</description>

      <title>Robust Deep Joint Source Channel Coding for Task-Oriented Semantic Communications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.12907</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.12907v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Semantic communications based on deep joint source-channel coding (JSCC) aim to improve communication efficiency by transmitting only task-relevant information. However, ensuring robustness to the stochasticity of communication channels remains a key challenge in learning-based JSCC. In this paper, we propose a novel regularization technique for learning-based JSCC to enhance robustness against channel noise. The proposed method utilizes the Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence as a regularizer term in the training loss, measuring the discrepancy between two posterior distributions: one under noisy channel conditions (noisy posterior) and one for a noise-free system (noise-free posterior). Reducing this KL divergence mitigates the impact of channel noise on task performance by keeping the noisy posterior close to the noise-free posterior. We further show that the expectation of the KL divergence given the encoded representation can be analytically approximated using the Fisher information matrix and the covariance matrix of the channel noise. Notably, the proposed regularization is architecture-agnostic, making it broadly applicable to general semantic communication systems over noisy channels. Our experimental results validate that the proposed regularization consistently improves task performance across diverse semantic communication systems and channel conditions.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.12913v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose an sparse Bayesian learning (SBL)-based method that leverages group sparsity and multiple parameterized dictionaries to detect the relevant dictionary entries and estimate their continuous parameters by combining data from multiple independent sensors. In a MIMO multi-radar setup, we demonstrate its effectiveness in jointly detecting and localizing multiple objects, while also emphasizing its broader applicability to various signal processing tasks. A key benefit of the proposed SBL-based method is its ability to resolve correlated dictionary entries-such as closely spaced objects-resulting in uncorrelated estimates that improve subsequent estimation stages. Through numerical simulations, we show that our method outperforms the newtonized orthogonal matching pursuit (NOMP) algorithm when two objects cross paths using a single radar. Furthermore, we illustrate how fusing measurements from multiple independent radars leads to enhanced detection and localization performance</description>

      <title>Task-Oriented Feature Compression for Multimodal Understanding via Device-Edge Co-Inference</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.12926</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.12926v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: With the rapid development of large multimodal models (LMMs), multimodal understanding applications are emerging. As most LMM inference requests originate from edge devices with limited computational capabilities, the predominant inference pipeline involves directly forwarding the input data to an edge server which handles all computations. However, this approach introduces high transmission latency due to limited uplink bandwidth of edge devices and significant computation latency caused by the prohibitive number of visual tokens, thus hindering delay-sensitive tasks and degrading user experience. To address this challenge, we propose a task-oriented feature compression (TOFC) method for multimodal understanding in a device-edge co-inference framework, where visual features are merged by clustering and encoded by a learnable and selective entropy model before feature projection. Specifically, we employ density peaks clustering based on K nearest neighbors to reduce the number of visual features, thereby minimizing both data transmission and computational complexity. Subsequently, a learnable entropy model with hyperprior is utilized to encode and decode merged features, further reducing transmission overhead. To enhance compression efficiency, multiple entropy models are adaptively selected based on the characteristics of the visual features, enabling a more accurate estimation of the probability distribution. Comprehensive experiments on seven visual question answering benchmarks validate the effectiveness of the proposed TOFC method. Results show that TOFC achieves up to 60% reduction in data transmission overhead and 50% reduction in system latency while maintaining identical task performance, compared with traditional image compression methods.</description>

      <title>Goal-Oriented Remote Tracking Through Correlated Observations in Pull-based Communications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.12962</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.12962v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We address the real-time remote tracking problem in a status update system comprising two sensors, two independent information sources, and a remote monitor. The status updating follows a pull-based communication, where the monitor commands/pulls the sensors for status updates, i.e., the actual state of the sources. We consider that the observations are correlated, meaning that each sensor sent data could also include the state of the other source due to, e.g., inter-sensor communication or proximity-based monitoring. The effectiveness of data communication is measured by a generic distortion, capturing the underlying application goal. We provide optimal command/pulling policies for the monitor that minimize the average weighted sum distortion and transmission cost. Since the monitor cannot fully observe the exact state of each source, we propose a partially observable Markov decision process (POMDP) and reformulate it as a belief MDP problem. We then effectively truncate the infinite belief space and transform it into a finite-state MDP problem, which is solved via relative value iteration. Simulation results show the effectiveness of the derived policy over the age-optimal and max-age-first baseline policies.</description>

Abstract: This paper presents a non-parametric method for 3-D imaging of natural volumes using Synthetic Aperture Radar tomography. This array processing-based technique aims at characterizing a spatially distributed density of incoherent sources, whose shape is imprecisely known. The proposed technique estimates the moments of the reflectivity density using a low-complexity covariance matching approach, and retrieves the mean location, dispersion, and power of the distributed source. Numerical simulations of realistic tomographic scenarios show that the proposed model-free scheme achieves better accuracy than slightly misspecified maximum likelihood estimators, derived from approximately known distribution shapes.</description>

      <title>A Design of Denser-Graph-Frequency Graph Fourier Frames for Graph Signal Analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.13164</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.13164v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper introduces a design method for densergraph-frequency graph Fourier frames (DGFFs) to enhance graph signal processing and analysis. The graph Fourier transform (GFT) enables us to analyze graph signals in the graph spectral domain and facilitates various graph signal processing tasks, such as filtering, sampling and reconstruction, denoising, and so on. However, the conventional GFT faces two significant limitations. First, unlike the discrete Fourier transform and its variants (such as discrete cosine transforms), the graph frequencies of the derived graph Fourier basis (GFB) from a given graph tend to be unevenly distributed or localized, which leads to biased spectral analysis. Second, the GFB used in GFT does not provide an efficient sparse representation of graph signals compared to overcomplete systems like frames. To overcome these challenges, we propose adding oscillating vectors with intermediate graph frequencies between the original vectors in the GFB for both undirected and directed graphs, constructing GFFs with densergraph frequencies. The resulting DGFFs are expected to enable more accurate graph signal analysis. Furthermore, we propose a graph filtering method based on the DGFFs. In experiments, we apply the DGFFs to practical applications such as graph signal recovery, demonstrating superior performance compared to existing GFBs.</description>

      <title>Equalization-Enhanced Phase Noise: Modeling and DSP-aware Analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.13199</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.13199v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In coherent optical communication systems the laser phase noise is commonly modeled as a Wiener process. We propose a sliding-window based linearization of the phase noise, enabling a novel description. We show that, by stochastically modeling the residual error introduced by this approximation, equalization-enhanced phase noise (EEPN) can be described and decomposed into four different components. Furthermore, we analyze the four components separately and provide a stochastical model for each of them. This novel model allows to predict the impact of well-known algorithms in coherent digital signal processing (DSP) pipelines such as timing recovery (TR) and carrier phase recovery (CPR) on each of the terms. Thus, it enables to approximate the resulting signal affected by EEPN after each of these DSP steps and helps to derive appropriate ways of mitigating such effects.</description>

      <title>MUSE: A Real-Time Multi-Sensor State Estimator for Quadruped Robots</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.12101</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.12101v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper introduces an innovative state estimator, MUSE (MUlti-sensor State Estimator), designed to enhance state estimation's accuracy and real-time performance in quadruped robot navigation. The proposed state estimator builds upon our previous work presented in [1]. It integrates data from a range of onboard sensors, including IMUs, encoders, cameras, and LiDARs, to deliver a comprehensive and reliable estimation of the robot's pose and motion, even in slippery scenarios. We tested MUSE on a Unitree Aliengo robot, successfully closing the locomotion control loop in difficult scenarios, including slippery and uneven terrain. Benchmarking against Pronto [2] and VILENS [3] showed 67.6% and 26.7% reductions in translational errors, respectively. Additionally, MUSE outperformed DLIO [4], a LiDAR-inertial odometry system in rotational errors and frequency, while the proprioceptive version of MUSE (P-MUSE) outperformed TSIF [5], with a 45.9% reduction in absolute trajectory error (ATE).</description>

      <title>Robust Full-Space Physical Layer Security for STAR-RIS-Aided Wireless Networks: Eavesdropper with Uncertain Location and Channel</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.12233</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.12233v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A robust full-space physical layer security (PLS) transmission scheme is proposed in this paper considering the full-space wiretapping challenge of wireless networks supported by simultaneous transmitting and reflecting reconfigurable intelligent surface (STAR-RIS). Different from the existing schemes, the proposed PLS scheme takes account of the uncertainty on the eavesdropper's position within the 360$^\circ$ service area offered by the STAR-RIS. Specifically, the large system analytical method is utilized to derive the asymptotic expression of the average security rate achieved by the security user, considering that the base station (BS) only has the statistical information of the eavesdropper's channel state information (CSI) and the uncertainty of its location. To evaluate the effectiveness of the proposed PLS scheme, we first formulate an optimization problem aimed at maximizing the weighted sum rate of the security user and the public user. This optimization is conducted under the power allocation constraint, and some practical limitations for STAR-RIS implementation, through jointly designing the active and passive beamforming variables. A novel iterative algorithm based on the minimum mean-square error (MMSE) and cross-entropy optimization (CEO) methods is proposed to effectively address the established non-convex optimization problem with discrete variables. Simulation results indicate that the proposed robust PLS scheme can effectively mitigate the information leakage across the entire coverage area of the STAR-RIS-assisted system, leading to superior performance gain when compared to benchmark schemes encompassing traditional RIS-aided scheme.</description>

      <title>SCReedSolo: A Secure and Robust LSB Image Steganography Framework with Randomized Symmetric Encryption and Reed-Solomon Coding</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.12368</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.12368v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Image steganography is an information-hiding technique that involves the surreptitious concealment of covert informational content within digital images. In this paper, we introduce ${\rm SCR{\small EED}S{\small OLO}}$, a novel framework for concealing arbitrary binary data within images. Our approach synergistically leverages Random Shuffling, Fernet Symmetric Encryption, and Reed-Solomon Error Correction Codes to encode the secret payload, which is then discretely embedded into the carrier image using LSB (Least Significant Bit) Steganography. The combination of these methods addresses the vulnerability vectors of both security and resilience against bit-level corruption in the resultant stego-images. We show that our framework achieves a data payload of 3 bits per pixel for an RGB image, and mathematically assess the probability of successful transmission for the amalgamated $n$ message bits and $k$ error correction bits. Additionally, we find that ${\rm SCR{\small EED}S{\small OLO}}$ yields good results upon being evaluated with multiple performance metrics, successfully eludes detection by various passive steganalysis tools, and is immune to simple active steganalysis attacks. Our code and data are available at https://github.com/Starscream-11813/SCReedSolo-Steganography.</description>

      <title>SING: Semantic Image Communications using Null-Space and INN-Guided Diffusion Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.12484</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.12484v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Joint source-channel coding systems based on deep neural networks (DeepJSCC) have recently demonstrated remarkable performance in wireless image transmission. Existing methods primarily focus on minimizing distortion between the transmitted image and the reconstructed version at the receiver, often overlooking perceptual quality. This can lead to severe perceptual degradation when transmitting images under extreme conditions, such as low bandwidth compression ratios (BCRs) and low signal-to-noise ratios (SNRs). In this work, we propose SING, a novel two-stage JSCC framework that formulates the recovery of high-quality source images from corrupted reconstructions as an inverse problem. Depending on the availability of information about the DeepJSCC encoder/decoder and the channel at the receiver, SING can either approximate the stochastic degradation as a linear transformation, or leverage invertible neural networks (INNs) for precise modeling. Both approaches enable the seamless integration of diffusion models into the reconstruction process, enhancing perceptual quality. Experimental results demonstrate that SING outperforms DeepJSCC and other approaches, delivering superior perceptual quality even under extremely challenging conditions, including scenarios with significant distribution mismatches between the training and test data.</description>

      <title>Optimal Transmission Sequence Design with ISI Matching in Molecular Communication</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.12647</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.12647v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Molecular communication (MC) offers a groundbreaking approach to communication inspired by biological signaling. It is particularly suited for environments where traditional electromagnetic methods fail, such as fluid mediums or within the human body. This study focuses on addressing a major challenge in MC systems: inter symbol interference (ISI), which arises due to the random, diffusive propagation of molecules. We propose a novel technique that leverages transmission shaping to mitigate ISI effectively by designing optimal transmission pulse (or sequence) for symbols. Our approach centers on solving a multi-objective optimization problem that aims to maximize the separability of individual symbol's responses within the symbol duration while matching the interference caused by molecular spillover for all symbols. By making ISI of each symbol similar, the approach reduces the effect of previous symbols and thus not require any adaptive computations. We introduce a geometric analogy involving two families of ellipses to derive the optimal solution. Analytical insights are supported by numerical simulations to design optimized transmission profiles to enhance the resilience toward ISI. The proposed transmission shaping method is evaluated through symbol error rate (SER). These results mark a significant step forward in developing robust and efficient MC systems, opening doors to advanced applications in bio-inspired and nano-scale communication technologies.</description>

      <title>Semantic-Relevance Based Sensor Selection for Edge-AI Empowered Sensing Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.12785</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.12785v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The sixth-generation (6G) mobile network is envisioned to incorporate sensing and edge artificial intelligence (AI) as two key functions. Their natural convergence leads to the emergence of Integrated Sensing and Edge AI (ISEA), a novel paradigm enabling real-time acquisition and understanding of sensory information at the network edge. However, ISEA faces a communication bottleneck due to the large number of sensors and the high dimensionality of sensory features. Traditional approaches to communication-efficient ISEA lack awareness of semantic relevance, i.e., the level of relevance between sensor observations and the downstream task. To fill this gap, this paper presents a novel framework for semantic-relevance-aware sensor selection to achieve optimal end-to-end (E2E) task performance under heterogeneous sensor relevance and channel states. E2E sensing accuracy analysis is provided to characterize the sensing task performance in terms of selected sensors' relevance scores and channel states. Building on the results, the sensor-selection problem for accuracy maximization is formulated as an integer program and solved through a tight approximation of the objective. The optimal solution exhibits a priority-based structure, which ranks sensors based on a priority indicator combining relevance scores and channel states and selects top-ranked sensors. Low-complexity algorithms are then developed to determine the optimal numbers of selected sensors and features. Experimental results on both synthetic and real datasets show substantial accuracy gain achieved by the proposed selection scheme compared to existing benchmarks.</description>

      <title>STAR-RIS-Assisted Cell-Free Massive MIMO with Multi-antenna Users and Hardware Impairments Over Correlated Rayleigh Fading Channels</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.12830v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Integrating cell-free massive multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) with simultaneous transmitting and reflecting reconfigurable intelligent surfaces (STAR-RISs) can provide ubiquitous connectivity and enhance coverage. This paper explores a STAR-RIS-assisted cell-free massive MIMO system featuring multi-antenna users, multi-antenna access points (APs), and multi-element STAR-RISs, accounting for transceiver hardware impairments. We first establish the system model of STAR-RIS-assisted cell-free massive MIMO systems with multi-antenna users. Subsequently, we analyze two uplink implementations: local processing and centralized decoding (Level 1), and fully centralized processing (Level 2), both implementations incorporating hardware impairments. We study the local and global minimum mean square error (MMSE) combining schemes to maximize the uplink spectral efficiency (SE) for Level 1 and Level 2, respectively. The MMSE-based successive interference cancellation detector is utilized to compute the uplink SE. We introduce the optimal large-scale fading decoding at the central processing unit and derive closed-form SE expressions utilizing maximum ratio combining at APs for Level 1. Our numerical results reveal that hardware impairments negatively affect SE performance, particularly at the user end. However, this degradation can be mitigated by increasing the number of user antennas. Enhancing the number of APs and STAR-RIS elements also improves performance and mitigates performance degradation. Notably, unlike conventional results based on direct links, our findings show that Level 2 consistently outperforms Level 1 with arbitrary combining schemes for the proposed STAR-RIS-assisted system.</description>

      <title>A Wearable Rehabilitation System to Assist Partially Hand Paralyzed Patients in Repetitive Exercises</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.12831v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The main purpose of the paper is development, implementation, and testing of a low-cost portable system to assist partially paralyzed patients in their hand rehabilitation after strokes or some injures. Rehabilitation includes time consuming and repetitive exercises which are costly and demotivating as well as the requirements of clinic attending and direct supervision of physiotherapists. In this work, the system consists of a graphical user interface (GUI) on a smartphone screen to instruct and motivate the patients to do their exercises by themselves. Through the GUI, the patients are instructed to do a sequence of exercises step by step, and the system measures the electrical activities (electromyographic signals EMG) of the user's forearm muscles by Myo armband. Depending on d database, the system can tell whether the patients have done correct movements or not. If a correct movement is detected, the system will inform the user through the GUI and move to the next exercise. For preliminary results, the system was extensively tested on a healthy person.</description>

      <title>Low-PAPR OFDM-ISAC Waveform Design Based on Frequency-Domain Phase Differences</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.12916v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Low peak-to-average power ratio (PAPR) orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM) waveform design is a crucial issue in integrated sensing and communications (ISAC). This paper introduces an OFDM-ISAC waveform design that utilizes the entire spectrum simultaneously for both communication and sensing by leveraging a novel degree of freedom (DoF): the frequency-domain phase difference (PD). Based on this concept, we develop a novel PD-based OFDM-ISAC waveform structure and utilize it to design a PD-based Low-PAPR OFDM-ISAC (PLPOI) waveform. The design is formulated as an optimization problem incorporating four key constraints: the time-frequency relationship equation, frequency-domain unimodular constraints, PD constraints, and time-domain low PAPR requirements. To solve this challenging non-convex problem, we develop an efficient algorithm, ADMM-PLPOI, based on the alternating direction method of multipliers (ADMM) framework. Extensive simulation results demonstrate that the proposed PLPOI waveform achieves significant improvements in both PAPR and bit error rate (BER) performance compared to conventional OFDM-ISAC waveforms.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.13029v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Design of antennas for modern applications is a challenging task that combines cognition-driven development of topology intertwined with tuning of its parameters using rigorous numerical optimization. However, the process can be streamlined by neglecting the engineering insight in favor of automatic de-termination of structure geometry. In this work, a specification-oriented design of topologically agnostic antenna is considered. The radiator is developed using a bi-stage algorithm that involves min-max classification of randomly-generated topologies followed by local tuning of the promising designs using a trust-region optimization applied to a feature-based representation of the structure frequency response. The automatically generated antenna is characterized by -10 dB bandwidth of over 600 MHz w.r.t. the center frequency of 6.5 GHz and a dual-lobe radiation pattern. The obtained performance figures make the radiator of use for in-door positioning applications. The design method has been favorably compared against the frequency-based trust-region optimization.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.13036v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper presents a dual-channel tactile skin that integrates Electrical Impedance Tomography (EIT) with air pressure sensing to achieve accurate multi-contact force detection. The EIT layer provides spatial contact information, while the air pressure sensor delivers precise total force measurement. Our framework combines these complementary modalities through: deep learning-based EIT image reconstruction, contact area segmentation, and force allocation based on relative conductivity intensities from EIT. The experiments demonstrated 15.1% average force estimation error in single-contact scenarios and 20.1% in multi-contact scenarios without extensive calibration data requirements. This approach effectively addresses the challenge of simultaneously localizing and quantifying multiple contact forces without requiring complex external calibration setups, paving the way for practical and scalable soft robotic skin applications.</description>

      <title>PAUSE: Low-Latency and Privacy-Aware Active User Selection for Federated Learning</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.13173v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Federated learning (FL) enables multiple edge devices to collaboratively train a machine learning model without the need to share potentially private data. Federated learning proceeds through iterative exchanges of model updates, which pose two key challenges: First, the accumulation of privacy leakage over time, and second, communication latency. These two limitations are typically addressed separately: The former via perturbed updates to enhance privacy and the latter using user selection to mitigate latency - both at the expense of accuracy. In this work, we propose a method that jointly addresses the accumulation of privacy leakage and communication latency via active user selection, aiming to improve the trade-off among privacy, latency, and model performance. To achieve this, we construct a reward function that accounts for these three objectives. Building on this reward, we propose a multi-armed bandit (MAB)-based algorithm, termed Privacy-aware Active User SElection (PAUSE) which dynamically selects a subset of users each round while ensuring bounded overall privacy leakage. We establish a theoretical analysis, systematically showing that the reward growth rate of PAUSE follows that of the best-known rate in MAB literature. To address the complexity overhead of active user selection, we propose a simulated annealing-based relaxation of PAUSE and analyze its ability to approximate the reward-maximizing policy under reduced complexity. We numerically validate the privacy leakage, associated improved latency, and accuracy gains of our methods for the federated training in various scenarios.</description>

      <title>Highly Efficient Direct Analytics on Semantic-aware Time Series Data Compression</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.13246v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Semantic communication has emerged as a promising paradigm to tackle the challenges of massive growing data traffic and sustainable data communication. It shifts the focus from data fidelity to goal-oriented or task-oriented semantic transmission. While deep learning-based methods are commonly used for semantic encoding and decoding, they struggle with the sequential nature of time series data and high computation cost, particularly in resource-constrained IoT environments. Data compression plays a crucial role in reducing transmission and storage costs, yet traditional data compression methods fall short of the demands of goal-oriented communication systems. In this paper, we propose a novel method for direct analytics on time series data compressed by the SHRINK compression algorithm. Through experimentation using outlier detection as a case study, we show that our method outperforms baselines running on uncompressed data in multiple cases, with merely 1% difference in the worst case. Additionally, it achieves four times lower runtime on average and accesses approximately 10% of the data volume, which enables edge analytics with limited storage and computation power. These results demonstrate that our approach offers reliable, high-speed outlier detection analytics for diverse IoT applications while extracting semantics from time-series data, achieving high compression, and reducing data transmission.</description>

      <title>Digital Beamforming Enhanced Radar Odometry</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.13252v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Radar has become an essential sensor for autonomous navigation, especially in challenging environments where camera and LiDAR sensors fail. 4D single-chip millimeter-wave radar systems, in particular, have drawn increasing attention thanks to their ability to provide spatial and Doppler information with low hardware cost and power consumption. However, most single-chip radar systems using traditional signal processing, such as Fast Fourier Transform, suffer from limited spatial resolution in radar detection, significantly limiting the performance of radar-based odometry and Simultaneous Localization and Mapping (SLAM) systems. In this paper, we develop a novel radar signal processing pipeline that integrates spatial domain beamforming techniques, and extend it to 3D Direction of Arrival estimation. Experiments using public datasets are conducted to evaluate and compare the performance of our proposed signal processing pipeline against traditional methodologies. These tests specifically focus on assessing structural precision across diverse scenes and measuring odometry accuracy in different radar odometry systems. This research demonstrates the feasibility of achieving more accurate radar odometry by simply replacing the standard FFT-based processing with the proposed pipeline. The codes are available at GitHub*.</description>

      <title>Channel Estimation for Pinching-Antenna Systems (PASS)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.13268</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.13268v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Pinching Antennas (PAs) represent a revolutionary flexible antenna technology that leverages dielectric waveguides and electromagnetic coupling to mitigate large-scale path loss. This letter is the first to explore channel estimation for Pinching-Antenna SyStems (PASS), addressing their uniquely ill-conditioned and underdetermined channel characteristics. In particular, two efficient deep learning-based channel estimators are proposed. 1) PAMoE: This estimator incorporates dynamic padding, feature embedding, fusion, and mixture of experts (MoE) modules, which effectively leverage the positional information of PAs and exploit expert diversity. 2) PAformer: This Transformer-style estimator employs the self-attention mechanism to predict channel coefficients in a per-antenna manner, which offers more flexibility to adaptively deal with dynamic numbers of PAs in practical deployment. Numerical results demonstrate that 1) the proposed deep learning-based channel estimators outperform conventional methods and exhibit excellent zero-shot learning capabilities, and 2) PAMoE delivers higher channel estimation accuracy via MoE specialization, while PAformer natively handles an arbitrary number of PAs, trading self-attention complexity for superior scalability.</description>

      <title>Decentralized Sensor Network Localization using Matrix-Parametrized Proximal Splittings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.13403</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.13403v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a novel application of a recently-proposed matrix-parametrized proximal splitting method to sensor network localization, the problem of estimating the locations of a set of sensors using only noisy pairwise distance information between the sensors. The decentralized computation required by our approach respects the communication structure between sensors specified by the noisy SNL problem, thereby allowing individual sensors to estimate their location using only local computations and communication with their neighbors. Our proposed method experimentally outperforms a competing method for decentralized computation -- the alternating direction method of multipliers (ADMM) -- with respect to convergence rate and memory use. As an independent methodological contribution, we propose using the Sinkhorn-Knopp algorithm in a completely decentralized manner to construct the matrices which parametrize our proposed splitting method. We show that parameters selected using this method perform similarly to those selected via existing parameter selection methods while requiring far less computation. Unlike centralized interior point solution methods, our first order splitting method allows for efficient warm starting, and we demonstrate improvements in convergence using rough estimates of sensor location to warm start our algorithm. We also find that early termination of the algorithm provides more accurate location estimates than the minimizer of the node-based SDP relaxation of the SNL.</description>

      <title>Dehazing Ultrasound using Diffusion Models</title>

Abstract: Echocardiography has been a prominent tool for the diagnosis of cardiac disease. However, these diagnoses can be heavily impeded by poor image quality. Acoustic clutter emerges due to multipath reflections imposed by layers of skin, subcutaneous fat, and intercostal muscle between the transducer and heart. As a result, haze and other noise artifacts pose a real challenge to cardiac ultrasound imaging. In many cases, especially with difficult-to-image patients such as patients with obesity, a diagnosis from B-Mode ultrasound imaging is effectively rendered unusable, forcing sonographers to resort to contrast-enhanced ultrasound examinations or refer patients to other imaging modalities. Tissue harmonic imaging has been a popular approach to combat haze, but in severe cases is still heavily impacted by haze. Alternatively, denoising algorithms are typically unable to remove highly structured and correlated noise, such as haze. It remains a challenge to accurately describe the statistical properties of structured haze, and develop an inference method to subsequently remove it. Diffusion models have emerged as powerful generative models and have shown their effectiveness in a variety of inverse problems. In this work, we present a joint posterior sampling framework that combines two separate diffusion models to model the distribution of both clean ultrasound and haze in an unsupervised manner. Furthermore, we demonstrate techniques for effectively training diffusion models on radio-frequency ultrasound data and highlight the advantages over image data. Experiments on both in-vitro and in-vivo cardiac datasets show that the proposed dehazing method effectively removes haze while preserving signals from weakly reflected tissue.</description>

      <title>Unified Fourier bases for signals on random graphs with group symmetries</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.06306v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider a recently proposed approach to graph signal processing (GSP) based on graphons. We show how the graphon-based approach to GSP applies to graphs sampled from a stochastic block model derived from a weighted Cayley graph. When SBM block sizes are equal, a nice Fourier basis can be derived from the representation theory of the underlying group. We explore how the SBM Fourier basis is affected when block sizes are not uniform. When block sizes are nearly uniform, we demonstrate that the group Fourier basis closely approximates the SBM Fourier basis. More specifically, we quantify the approximation error using matrix perturbation theory. When block sizes are highly non-uniform, the group-based Fourier basis can no longer be used. However, we show that partial information regarding the SBM Fourier basis can still be obtained from the underlying group.</description>

      <title>Pulling Back Theorem for Generalizing the Diagonal Averaging Principle in Symplectic Geometry Mode Decomposition and Singular Spectrum Analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.09584</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.09584v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The symplectic geometry mode decomposition (SGMD) is a powerful method for analyzing time sequences. The SGMD is based on the upper conversion via embedding and down conversion via diagonal averaging principle (DAP) inherited from the singular spectrum analysis (SSA). However, there are two defects in the DAP: it just hold for the time delay $\tau=1$ in the trajectory matrix and it fails for the time sequence of type-1 with the form $X=\{x[n]\}^N_{n=1}$. In order to overcome these disadvantages, the inverse step for embedding is explored with binary Diophantine equation in number theory. The contributions of this work lie in three aspects: firstly, the pulling back theorem is proposed and proved, which state the general formula for converting the component of trajectory matrix to the component of time sequence for the general representation of time sequence and for any time delay $\tau\ge 1$; secondly a unified framework for decomposing both the deterministic and random time sequences into multiple modes is presented and explained; finally, the guidance of configuring the time delay is suggested, namely the time delay should be selected in a limited range via balancing the efficiency of matrix computation and accuracy of state estimation. It could be expected that the pulling back theorem will help the researchers and engineers to deepen the understanding of the theory and extend the applications of the SGMD and SSA in analyzing time sequences.</description>

      <title>Neuromorphic Photonic Computing with an Electro-Optic Analog Memory</title>

      <description>arXiv:2401.16515v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Artificial intelligence (AI) has seen remarkable advancements across various domains, including natural language processing, computer vision, autonomous vehicles, and biology. However, the rapid expansion of AI technologies has escalated the demand for more powerful computing resources. As digital computing approaches fundamental limits, neuromorphic photonics emerges as a promising platform to complement existing digital systems. In neuromorphic photonic computing, photonic devices are controlled using analog signals. This necessitates the use of digital-to-analog converters (DAC) and analog-to-digital converters (ADC) for interfacing with these devices during inference and training. However, data movement between memory and these converters in conventional von Neumann computing architectures consumes energy. To address this, analog memory co-located with photonic computing devices is proposed. This approach aims to reduce the reliance on DACs and minimize data movement to enhance compute efficiency. This paper demonstrates a monolithically integrated neuromorphic photonic circuit with co-located capacitive analog memory and analyzes analog memory specifications for neuromorphic photonic computing using the MNIST dataset as a benchmark.</description>

      <title>Effect of Realistic Oscillator Phase Noise on the Performance of Cell-Free Massive MIMO Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.04099</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.04099v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: As the demand for 6G technologies continues to grow, the radio access infrastructure is expected to become increasingly dense. Cell-free (CF) Massive MIMO systems provide remarkable flexibility by enabling coherent service to users through multiple Access Points (APs). This innovative paradigm necessitates precise and stable phase synchronization. This paper examines the standardized 5G New Radio (NR) framework, focusing on subcarrier spacing, OFDM symbol duration, and allocation, while investigating the impact of Phase Noise (PN) on the performance of scalable massive MIMO cell-free systems. Unlike existing studies that typically employ a simplified model of a free-running oscillator characterized by a Wiener process, we present a realistic phase noise model inspired by actual hardware, designed to accurately capture the Local Oscillator (LO) phase drift. Furthermore, our PN model extends its applicability beyond cell-free systems, making it relevant for any RF system operating within the sub-6 GHz band. This model provides a robust foundation for the practical design of cell-free systems, encompassing numerology and pilot allocation strategies. Our findings reveal that even cost-effective low-cost Local Oscillators can achieve sufficient stability, resulting in negligible degradation of uplink Spectral Efficiency (SE) within the standardized 5G Transmission Time Interval of 1 ms. These results affirm the viability of cell-free massive MIMO systems based on 5G standards and their potential integration into future 6G networks.</description>

      <title>EmT: A Novel Transformer for Generalized Cross-subject EEG Emotion Recognition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.18345</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.18345v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Integrating prior knowledge of neurophysiology into neural network architecture enhances the performance of emotion decoding. While numerous techniques emphasize learning spatial and short-term temporal patterns, there has been limited emphasis on capturing the vital long-term contextual information associated with emotional cognitive processes. In order to address this discrepancy, we introduce a novel transformer model called emotion transformer (EmT). EmT is designed to excel in both generalized cross-subject EEG emotion classification and regression tasks. In EmT, EEG signals are transformed into a temporal graph format, creating a sequence of EEG feature graphs using a temporal graph construction module (TGC). A novel residual multi-view pyramid GCN module (RMPG) is then proposed to learn dynamic graph representations for each EEG feature graph within the series, and the learned representations of each graph are fused into one token. Furthermore, we design a temporal contextual transformer module (TCT) with two types of token mixers to learn the temporal contextual information. Finally, the task-specific output module (TSO) generates the desired outputs. Experiments on four publicly available datasets show that EmT achieves higher results than the baseline methods for both EEG emotion classification and regression tasks. The code is available at https://github.com/yi-ding-cs/EmT.</description>

      <title>Communication Constellation Design of Minimum Number of Satellites with Continuous Coverage and Inter-Satellite Link</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.03354v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The recent advancement in research on distributed space systems that operate a large number of satellites as a single system urges the need for the investigation of satellite constellations. Communication constellations can be used to construct global or regional communication networks using inter-satellite and ground-to-satellite links. This study examines two challenges of communication constellations: continuous coverage and inter-satellite link connectivity. The bounded Voronoi diagram and APC decomposition are presented as continuous coverage analysis methods. For continuity analysis of the inter-satellite link, the relative motion between adjacent orbital planes is used to derive analytic solutions. The Walker-Delta constellation and common ground-track constellation design methods are introduced as examples to verify the analysis methods. The common ground-track constellations are classified into quasi-symmetric and optimal constellations. The optimal common ground-track constellation is optimized using the BILP algorithm. The simulation results compare the performance of the communication constellations according to various design methods.</description>

      <title>A3E: Aligned and Augmented Adversarial Ensemble for Accurate, Robust and Privacy-Preserving EEG Decoding</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.11390v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: An electroencephalogram (EEG) based brain-computer interface (BCI) enables direct communication between the brain and external devices. However, EEG-based BCIs face at least three major challenges in real-world applications: data scarcity and individual differences, adversarial vulnerability, and data privacy. While previous studies have addressed one or two of these issues, simultaneous accommodation of all three challenges remains challenging and unexplored. This paper fills this gap, by proposing an Aligned and Augmented Adversarial Ensemble (A3E) algorithm and integrating it into three privacy protection scenarios (centralized source-free transfer, federated source-free transfer, and source data perturbation), achieving simultaneously accurate decoding, adversarial robustness, and privacy protection of EEG-based BCIs. Experiments on three public EEG datasets demonstrated that our proposed approach outperformed over 10 classic and state-of-the-art approaches in both accuracy and robustness in all three privacy-preserving scenarios, even outperforming state-of-the-art transfer learning approaches that do not consider privacy protection at all. This is the first time that three major challenges in EEG-based BCIs can be addressed simultaneously, significantly improving the practicalness of EEG decoding in real-world BCIs.</description>

Abstract: We aim at the solution of inverse problems in imaging, by combining a penalized sparse representation of image patches with an unconstrained smooth one. This allows for a straightforward interpretation of the reconstruction. We formulate the optimization as a bilevel problem. The inner problem deploys classical algorithms while the outer problem optimizes the dictionary and the regularizer parameters through supervised learning. The process is carried out via implicit differentiation and gradient-based optimization. We evaluate our method for denoising, super-resolution, and compressed-sensing magnetic-resonance imaging. We compare it to other classical models as well as deep-learning-based methods and show that it always outperforms the former and also the latter in some instances.</description>

      <title>Open-Set Gait Recognition from Sparse mmWave Radar Point Clouds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.07435</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.07435v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The adoption of Millimeter-Wave (mmWave) radar devices for human sensing, particularly gait recognition, has recently gathered significant attention due to their efficiency, resilience to environmental conditions, and privacy-preserving nature. In this work, we tackle the challenging problem of Open-set Gait Recognition (OSGR) from sparse mmWave radar point clouds. Unlike most existing research, which assumes a closed-set scenario, our work considers the more realistic open-set case, where unknown subjects might be present at inference time, and should be correctly recognized by the system. Point clouds are well-suited for edge computing applications with resource constraints, but are more significantly affected by noise and random fluctuations than other representations, like the more common micro-Doppler signature. This is the first work addressing open-set gait recognition with sparse point cloud data. To do so, we propose a novel neural network architecture that combines supervised classification with unsupervised reconstruction of the point clouds, creating a robust, rich, and highly regularized latent space of gait features. To detect unknown subjects at inference time, we introduce a probabilistic novelty detection algorithm that leverages the structured latent space and offers a tunable trade-off between inference speed and prediction accuracy. Along with this paper, we release mmGait10, an original human gait dataset featuring over five hours of measurements from ten subjects, under varied walking modalities. Extensive experimental results show that our solution attains F1-Score improvements by 24% over state-of-the-art methods, on average, and across multiple openness levels.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.10345v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Online conformal prediction enables the runtime calibration of a pre-trained artificial intelligence model using feedback on its performance. Calibration is achieved through set predictions that are updated via online rules so as to ensure long-term coverage guarantees. While recent research has demonstrated the benefits of incorporating prior knowledge into the calibration process, this has come at the cost of replacing coverage guarantees with less tangible regret guarantees based on the quantile loss. This work introduces intermittent mirror online conformal prediction (IM-OCP), a novel runtime calibration framework that integrates prior knowledge, while maintaining long-term coverage and achieving sub-linear regret. IM-OCP features closed-form updates with minimal memory complexity, and is designed to operate under potentially intermittent feedback.</description>
