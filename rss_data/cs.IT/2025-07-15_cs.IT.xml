      <title>Asymptotically Optimal Repair of Reed-Solomon Codes with Small Sub-Packetization under Rack-Aware Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.11009</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.11009v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper presents a comprehensive study on the asymptotically optimal repair of Reed-Solomon (RS) codes with small sub-packetization, specifically tailored for rack-aware distributed storage systems. Through the utilization of multi-base expansion, we introduce a novel approach that leverages monomials to construct linear repair schemes for RS codes. Our repair schemes which adapt to all admissible parameters achieve asymptotically optimal repair bandwidth while significantly reducing the sub-packetization compared with existing schemes. Furthermore, our approach is capable of repairing RS codes with asymptotically optimal repair bandwidth under the homogeneous storage model, achieving smaller sub-packetization than existing methods.</description>

      <title>Extropy Rate: Properties and Application in Feature Selection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.11242</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.11242v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Extropy, a complementary dual of entropy, (proposed by Lad et al. \cite{lad2015extropy} in 2015) has attracted considerable interest from the research community. In this study, we focus on discrete random variables and define conditional extropy, establishing key properties of joint and conditional extropy such as bounds, uncertainty reduction due to additional information, and Lipschitz continuity. We further introduce the concept of extropy rate for a stochastic process of discrete random variables as a measure of the average uncertainty per random variable within the process. It is observed that for infinite stationary and ergodic stochastic processes, as well as for identically and independently distributed sequences, the extropy rate exhibits asymptotic equivalence. We explore the extropy rate for finite stochastic processes and numerically illustrate its effectiveness in capturing the underlying information across various distributions, quantifying complexity in time series data, and characterizing chaotic dynamics in dynamical systems. The behaviour of estimated extropy rate is observed to be closely aligned with Simpson's diversity index. The real-life applicability of the extropy rate is presented through a novel feature selection method based on the fact that features with higher extropy rates contain greater inherent information. Using six publicly available datasets, we show the superiority of the proposed feature selection method over some other existing popular approaches.</description>

      <title>Waterfilling at the Edge: Optimal Percentile Resource Allocation via Risk-Averse Reduction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.10838</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.10838v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We address deterministic resource allocation in point-to-point multi-terminal AWGN channels without inter-terminal interference, with particular focus on optimizing quantile transmission rates for cell-edge terminal service. Classical utility-based approaches -- such as minimum rate, sumrate, and proportional fairness -- are either overconservative, or inappropriate, or do not provide a rigorous and/or interpretable foundation for fair rate optimization at the edge. To overcome these challenges, we employ Conditional Value-at-Risk (CVaR), a popular coherent risk measure, and establish its equivalence with the sum-least-$\alpha$th-quantile (SL$\alpha$Q) utility. This connection enables an exact convex reformulation of the SL$\alpha$Q maximization problem, facilitating analytical tractability and precise and interpretable control over cell-edge terminal performance. Utilizing Lagrangian duality, we provide (for the first time) parameterized closed-form solutions for the optimal resource policy -- which is of waterfilling-type -- as well as the associated (auxiliary) Value-at-Risk variable. We further develop a novel inexact dual subgradient descent algorithm of minimal complexity to determine globally optimal resource policies, and we rigorously establish its convergence. The resulting edge waterfilling algorithm iteratively and efficiently allocates resources while explicitly ensuring transmission rate fairness across (cell-edge) terminals. Several (even large-scale) numerical experiments validate the effectiveness of the proposed method for enabling robust quantile rate optimization at the edge.</description>

      <title>Optimizing Fluid Antenna Configurations for Constructive Interference Precoding</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.11093</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.11093v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The fluid antenna system (FAS) has emerged as a new physical-layer concept to provide enhanced propagation conditions for multiuser multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) communications over conventional fixed arrays. This work focuses on minimizing the maximum symbol error probability (SEP) under $M$-ary phase shift keying (MPSK) signaling in a multiuser downlink equipped with FAS, where each antenna moves within nonoverlapping intervals. This specific problem of joint SEP minimization with FAS and constructive interference (CI) precoding has not been previously addressed. The resulting problem turns out to be a nonconvex and nonsmooth optimization challenge. We transform the SEP minimization problem into a safety margin maximization problem in constructive interference precoding. Then, we customize a smoothing technique and a block coordinate descent (BCD) algorithm, with emphasis on low computational complexity. Simulation results show that our approach can reduce bit error rate (BER) compared to both the fixed arrays and FAS designed by existing particle swarm optimization (PSO). Also, our approach shows attractively low computational complexity compared to PSO benchmarks.</description>

      <title>Performance Enhancement of the Recursive Least Squares Algorithms with Rank Two Updates</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.11095</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.11095v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: New recursive least squares algorithms with rank two updates (RLSR2) that include both exponential and instantaneous forgetting (implemented via a proper choice of the forgetting factor and the window size) are introduced and systematically associated in this report with well-known RLS algorithms with rank one updates. Moreover, new properties (which can be used for further performance improvement) of the recursive algorithms associated with the convergence of the inverse of information matrix and parameter vector are established in this report. The performance of new algorithms is examined in the problem of estimation of the grid events in the presence of significant harmonic emissions.</description>

      <title>Fast and Efficient Implementation of the Maximum Likelihood Estimation for the Linear Regression with Gaussian Model Uncertainty</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.11249</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.11249v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The linear regression model with a random variable (RV) measurement matrix, where the mean of the random measurement matrix has full column rank, has been extensively studied. In particular, the quasiconvexity of the maximum likelihood estimation (MLE) problem was established, and the corresponding Cramer-Rao bound (CRB) was derived, leading to the development of an efficient bisection-based algorithm known as RV-ML. In contrast, this work extends the analysis to both overdetermined and underdetermined cases, allowing the mean of the random measurement matrix to be rank-deficient. A remarkable contribution is the proof that the equivalent MLE problem is convex and satisfies strong duality, strengthening previous quasiconvexity results. Moreover, it is shown that in underdetermined scenarios, the randomness in the measurement matrix can be beneficial for estimation under certain conditions. In addition, a fast and unified implementation of the MLE solution, referred to as generalized RV-ML (GRV-ML), is proposed, which handles a more general case including both underdetermined and overdetermined systems. Extensive numerical simulations are provided to validate the theoretical findings.</description>

      <title>Sharp Error-Rate Transitions in Quantum QC-LDPC Codes under Joint BP Decoding</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.11534</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.11534v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this study, we report that quantum quasi-cyclic low-density parity-check codes decoded via joint belief propagation (BP) exhibit steep error-rate curves, despite the presence of error floors. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first observation of such threshold-like behavior for quantum codes with non-vanishing coding rate, excluding those decoded with non-binary BP decoders. Moreover, we find that dominant error events contributing to the error floor typically involve only a small number of bits. These findings suggest that the error floor is caused by trapping sets -- specific subgraph structures in the Tanner graph -- and indicate that identifying and avoiding such structures may lead to further reduction of the error floor.</description>

      <title>Multivariate Analytic Combinatorics for Cost Constrained Channels</title>

      <description>arXiv:2111.06105v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Analytic combinatorics in several variables is a branch of mathematics that deals with deriving the asymptotic behavior of combinatorial quantities by analyzing multivariate generating functions. We study information-theoretic questions about sequences in a discrete noiseless channel under cost constraints. Our main contributions involve the relationship between the graph structure of the channel and the singularities of the bivariate generating function whose coefficients are the number of sequences satisfying the constraints. We use these new results to invoke theorems from multivariate analytic combinatorics to obtain the asymptotic behavior of the number of cost-limited strings that are admissible by the channel. This builds a new bridge between analytic combinatorics in several variables and labeled weighted graphs, bringing a new perspective and a set of powerful results to the literature of cost-constrained channels. Along the way, we show that the cost-constrained channel capacity is determined by a cost-dependent singularity of the bivariate generating function, generalizing Shannon's classical result for unconstrained capacity, and provide a new proof of the equivalence of the combinatorial and probabilistic definitions of the cost-constrained capacity.</description>

      <title>Blind and Topological Interference Managements for Bistatic Integrated Sensing and Communication</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.03956</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.03956v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) systems provide significant enhancements in performance and resource efficiency compared to individual sensing and communication systems, primarily attributed to the collaborative use of wireless resources, radio waveforms, and hardware platforms. This paper focuses on the bistatic ISAC systems with dispersed multi-receiver and one sensor. Compared to a monostatic ISAC system, the main challenge in the bistatic setting is that the information messages are unknown to the sensor and therefore they are seen as interference, while the channel between the transmitters (TX) and the sensor is unknown to the transmitters. In order to mitigate the interference at the sensor while maximizing the communication degree of freedom, we introduce two strategies, namely, blind interference alignment and topological interference management. Although well-known in the context of Gaussian interference channels, these strategies are novel in the context of bistatic ISAC. For the bistatic ISAC models with heterogeneous coherence times or with heterogeneous connectivity, the achieved ISAC tradeoff points in terms of communication and sensing degrees of freedom are characterized. In particular, we show that the new tradeoff outperforms the time-sharing between the sensing-only and the communication-only schemes. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed schemes significantly improve the channel estimation error for the sensing task, compared to treating interference as noise at the sensor and successive interference cancellation.</description>

      <title>Joint Detection and Decoding: A Graph Neural Network Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.08871</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.08871v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Narrowing the performance gap between optimal and feasible detection in inter-symbol interference (ISI) channels, this paper proposes to use graph neural networks (GNNs) for detection that can also be used to perform joint detection and decoding (JDD). For detection, the GNN is build upon the factor graph representations of the channel, while for JDD, the factor graph is expanded by the Tanner graph of the parity-check matrix (PCM) of the channel code, sharing the variable nodes (VNs). A particularly advantageous property of the GNN is a) the robustness against cycles in the factor graphs which is the main problem for sum-product algorithm (SPA)-based detection, and b) the robustness against channel state information (CSI) uncertainty at the receiver. Additionally, we propose using an input embedding resulting in a GNN independent of the channel impulse response (CIR). Consequently, a fully deep learning-based receiver enables joint optimization instead of individual optimization of the components, so-called end-to-end learning. Furthermore, we propose a parallel flooding schedule that also reduces the latency, which turns out to improve the error correcting performance. The proposed approach is analyzed and compared to state-of-the-art baselines for different modulations and codes in terms of error correcting capability and latency. The gain compared to SPA-based detection might be explained with improved messages between nodes and adaptive damping of messages. For a higher order modulation in a high-rate turbo detection and decoding (TDD) scenario the GNN shows a, at first glance, surprisingly high gain of 6.25 dB compared to the best, feasible non-neural baseline.</description>

      <title>Lowering the Error Floor of Error Correction Code Transformer</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.09065v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: With the success of transformer architectures across diverse applications, the error correction code transformer (ECCT) has gained significant attention for its superior decoding performance. In spite of its advantages, the error floor problem in ECCT decoding remains unexplored. We present the first investigation into this issue, revealing that ECCT encounters error floors, limiting its effectiveness in practical settings. To address this error floor problem, we adopt a hybrid decoding framework that integrates ECCT with conventional hard decision decoders. Unlike prior hybrid decoding schemes, our key contribution lies in proposing a novel loss function that explicitly takes into account the interaction between ECCT and hard decision decoders during training. The proposed loss function guides ECCT to focus on residual errors that are not corrected by the hard decision stages, effectively lowering the error floor. Simulation results confirm that the hybrid decoder trained with the proposed loss function achieves substantial performance gains over standard ECCT in both the waterfall and the error floor regions.</description>

Abstract: We investigate the hyperbolic decomposition of the Dirichlet norm and distance between autoregressive moving average (ARMA) models. With the K\"ahler information geometry of linear systems in Hardy spaces and weighted Hardy spaces, we demonstrate that the Dirichlet norm and distance of ARMA models, corresponding to the mutual information between the past and future, are decomposed into functions of the hyperbolic distances between the poles and zeros of the ARMA models. Moreover, the distance is also expressed with separate terms from AR parts, MA parts, and AR-MA cross terms. Furthermore, the hyperbolic decomposition is helpful for the model order reduction of ARMA models.</description>

      <title>Neural Coding Is Not Always Semantic: Towards the Standardized Coding Workflow in Semantic Communications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.18637</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.18637v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Semantic communication, leveraging advanced deep learning techniques, emerges as a new paradigm that meets the requirements of next-generation wireless networks. However, current semantic communication systems, which employ neural coding for feature extraction from raw data, have not adequately addressed the fundamental question: Is general feature extraction through deep neural networks sufficient for understanding semantic meaning within raw data in semantic communication? This article is thus motivated to clarify two critical aspects: semantic understanding and general semantic representation. This article presents a standardized definition on semantic coding, an extensive neural coding scheme for general semantic representation that clearly represents underlying data semantics based on contextual modeling. With these general semantic representations obtained, both human- and machine-centric end-to-end data transmission can be achieved through only minimal specialized modifications, such as fine-tuning and regularization. This article contributes to establishing a commonsense that semantic communication extends far beyond mere feature transmission, focusing instead on conveying compact semantic representations through context-aware coding schemes.</description>

      <title>SIC-Free Rate-Splitting Multiple Access: Constellation-Constrained Optimization and Application to Large-Scale Systems</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.12668v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Rate-Splitting Multiple Access (RSMA) has been recognized as a promising multiple access technique for future wireless communication systems. Recent research demonstrates that RSMA can maintain its superiority without relying on Successive Interference Cancellation (SIC) receivers. In practical systems, SIC-free receivers are more attractive than SIC receivers because of their low complexity and latency. This paper evaluates the theoretical limits of RSMA with and without SIC receivers under finite constellations. We first derive the constellation-constrained rate expressions for RSMA. We then design algorithms based on projected subgradient ascent to optimize the precoders and maximize the weighted sum-rate or max-min fairness among users. To apply the proposed optimization algorithms to large-scale systems, one challenge lies in the exponentially increasing computational complexity brought about by the constellation-constrained rate expressions. In light of this, we propose methods to avoid such computational burden. Numerical results show that, under optimized precoders, SIC-free RSMA leads to minor losses in both weighted sum-rate and max-min fairness in comparison to RSMA with SIC receivers, making it a viable option for future implementations.</description>

Abstract: This paper studies privacy-sensitive federated learning (FL) under unreliable communication, with a focus on secure aggregation and straggler mitigation. To preserve user privacy without compromising the utility of the global model, secure aggregation emerges as a promising approach by coordinating the use of privacy-preserving noise (secret keys) across participating clients. However, the unreliable communication will randomly disrupt the key coordination and disable the exact recovery of the global model in secure aggregation. Furthermore, unreliable communication can distort the optimization trajectory, causing the global model to deviate further from the intended global optimum.To address these challenges, we propose Secure Cooperative Gradient Coding (SecCoGC), a practical solution that achieves accurate aggregation with arbitrarily strong privacy guarantees and is inherently robust to communication uncertainties. To ensure fairness in privacy protection, we further introduce Fair-SecCoGC, an extension of SecCoGC that enforces equitable privacy preservation across all clients. Notably, Fair-SecCoGC achieves optimal privacy under a per-key total power constraint. We formally formulate the problem of secure aggregation in the real field and present both general and computationally efficient methods for secret key construction. Our privacy analysis covers both Local Mutual Information Privacy (LMIP) and Local Differential Privacy (LDP) across all protocol layers, accounting for intermittent networks and correlation among secret keys. In addition, we characterize the system reliability and convergence properties of the proposed scheme. Experimental results demonstrate that SecCoGC achieves strong resilience to unreliable communication while maintaining arbitrarily strong privacy guarantees, yielding test accuracy improvements of 20% to 70% over existing privacy-preserving methods.</description>

      <title>Privacy Against Agnostic Inference Attacks in Vertical Federated Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2302.05545</link>

Abstract: A novel form of inference attack in vertical federated learning (VFL) is proposed, where two parties collaborate in training a machine learning (ML) model. Logistic regression is considered for the VFL model. One party, referred to as the active party, possesses the ground truth labels of the samples in the training phase, while the other, referred to as the passive party, only shares a separate set of features corresponding to these samples. It is shown that the active party can carry out inference attacks on both training and prediction phase samples by acquiring an ML model independently trained on the training samples available to them. This type of inference attack does not require the active party to be aware of the score of a specific sample, hence it is referred to as an agnostic inference attack. It is shown that utilizing the observed confidence scores during the prediction phase, before the time of the attack, can improve the performance of the active party's autonomous ML model, and thus improve the quality of the agnostic inference attack. As a countermeasure, privacy-preserving schemes (PPSs) are proposed. While the proposed schemes preserve the utility of the VFL model, they systematically distort the VFL parameters corresponding to the passive party's features. The level of the distortion imposed on the passive party's parameters is adjustable, giving rise to a trade-off between privacy of the passive party and interpretabiliy of the VFL outcomes by the active party. The distortion level of the passive party's parameters could be chosen carefully according to the privacy and interpretabiliy concerns of the passive and active parties, respectively, with the hope of keeping both parties (partially) satisfied. Finally, experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed attack and the PPSs.</description>

      <title>Gram-Schmidt Methods for Unsupervised Feature Extraction and Selection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.09386</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.09386v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Feature extraction and selection in the presence of nonlinear dependencies among the data is a fundamental challenge in unsupervised learning. We propose using a Gram-Schmidt (GS) type orthogonalization process over function spaces to detect and map out such dependencies. Specifically, by applying the GS process over some family of functions, we construct a series of covariance matrices that can either be used to identify new large-variance directions, or to remove those dependencies from known directions. In the former case, we provide information-theoretic guarantees in terms of entropy reduction. In the latter, we provide precise conditions by which the chosen function family eliminates existing redundancy in the data. Each approach provides both a feature extraction and a feature selection algorithm. Our feature extraction methods are linear, and can be seen as natural generalization of principal component analysis (PCA). We provide experimental results for synthetic and real-world benchmark datasets which show superior performance over state-of-the-art (linear) feature extraction and selection algorithms. Surprisingly, our linear feature extraction algorithms are comparable and often outperform several important nonlinear feature extraction methods such as autoencoders, kernel PCA, and UMAP. Furthermore, one of our feature selection algorithms strictly generalizes a recent Fourier-based feature selection mechanism (Heidari et al., IEEE Transactions on Information Theory, 2022), yet at significantly reduced complexity.</description>

      <title>A quantum semantic framework for natural language processing</title>

Abstract: Semantic degeneracy represents a fundamental property of natural language that extends beyond simple polysemy to encompass the combinatorial explosion of potential interpretations that emerges as semantic expressions increase in complexity. In this work, we argue this property imposes fundamental limitations on Large Language Models (LLMs) and other modern NLP systems, precisely because they operate within natural language itself. Using Kolmogorov complexity, we demonstrate that as an expression's complexity grows, the amount of contextual information required to reliably resolve its ambiguity explodes combinatorially. The computational intractability of recovering a single intended meaning for complex or ambiguous text therefore suggests that the classical view that linguistic forms possess intrinsic meaning in and of themselves is conceptually inadequate. We argue instead that meaning is dynamically actualized through an observer-dependent interpretive act, a process whose non-deterministic nature is most appropriately described by a non-classical, quantum-like logic. To test this hypothesis, we conducted a semantic Bell inequality test using diverse LLM agents. Our experiments yielded average CHSH expectation values from 1.2 to 2.8, with several runs producing values (e.g., 2.3-2.4) in significant violation of the classical boundary ($|S|\leq2$), demonstrating that linguistic interpretation under ambiguity can exhibit non-classical contextuality, consistent with results from human cognition experiments. These results inherently imply that classical frequentist-based analytical approaches for natural language are necessarily lossy. Instead, we propose that Bayesian-style repeated sampling approaches can provide more practically useful and appropriate characterizations of linguistic meaning in context.</description>

      <title>Balancing Privacy and Utility in Correlated Data: A Study of Bayesian Differential Privacy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.21308</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.21308v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Privacy risks in differentially private (DP) systems increase significantly when data is correlated, as standard DP metrics often underestimate the resulting privacy leakage, leaving sensitive information vulnerable. Given the ubiquity of dependencies in real-world databases, this oversight poses a critical challenge for privacy protections. Bayesian differential privacy (BDP) extends DP to account for these correlations, yet current BDP mechanisms indicate notable utility loss, limiting its adoption.
  In this work, we address whether BDP can be realistically implemented in common data structures without sacrificing utility -- a key factor for its applicability. By analyzing arbitrary and structured correlation models, including Gaussian multivariate distributions and Markov chains, we derive practical utility guarantees for BDP. Our contributions include theoretical links between DP and BDP and a novel methodology for adapting DP mechanisms to meet the BDP requirements. Through evaluations on real-world databases, we demonstrate that our novel theorems enable the design of BDP mechanisms that maintain competitive utility, paving the way for practical privacy-preserving data practices in correlated settings.</description>
