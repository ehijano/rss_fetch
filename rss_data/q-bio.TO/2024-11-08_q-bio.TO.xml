      <title>Unveiling Placental Development in Circadian Rhythm-Disrupted Mice: A Photo-acoustic Imaging Study on Unstained Tissue</title>

Abstract: Introduction: Circadian rhythm disruption has garnered significant attention for its adverse effects on human health, particularly in reproductive medicine and fetal well-being. Assessing pregnancy health often relies on diagnostic markers such as the labyrinth zone (LZ) proportion within the placenta. This study aimed to investigate the impact of disrupted circadian rhythms on placental health and fetal development using animal models. Methods and Results: Employing unstained photo-acoustic microscopy (PAM) and hematoxylin and eosin (HE)-stained images, we found them mutually reinforcing. Our images revealed the role of MCRD on the LZ and fetus weight: a decrease in LZ area from 5.01-HE(4.25-PAM) mm2 to 3.58-HE (2.62-PAM) mm2 on day 16 and 6.48-HE(5.16-PAM) mm2 to 4.61-HE (3.03-PAM) mm2 on day 18, resulting in 0.71 times lower fetus weights. We have discriminated a decrease in the mean LZ to placenta area ratio from 64% to 47% on day 18 in mice with disrupted circadian rhythms with PAM. Discussion: The study highlights the negative influence of circadian rhythm disruption on placental development and fetal well-being. Reduced LZ area and fetal weights in the MCRD group suggest compromised placental function under disrupted circadian rhythms. PAM imaging proved to be an efficient technique for assessing placental development, offering advantages over traditional staining methods. These findings contribute to understanding the mechanisms underlying circadian disruption's effects on reproductive health and fetal development, emphasizing the importance of maintaining normal circadian rhythms for optimal pregnancy outcomes. Further research is needed to explore interventions to mitigate these effects and improve pregnancy outcomes.</description>
