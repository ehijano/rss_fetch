      <title>Earth ECS using Modified Energy Budget Methods and Trend Analyses v.1SS</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.11869</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.11869v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Earth global and regional effective thermal conductance G(eff) (in (W/m^2)/C and often labeled lambda in climate research) and the related Equilibrium Climate Sensitivity (ECS) are evaluated by applying a modified version of the Energy Budget method, and using data only after 1970. By removing Periodic Interfering temperature components (using a novel PIR process) and applying high frequency filtering, an extraordinarily near linear temperature response is revealed, enhancing accurate G(eff) calculation and avoiding the pre-1970 aerosol forcing and ocean energy per area (E*) absorption uncertainties. A formal/empirical method is used to determine more reliable values of Q(t)=d[E*(Ocean.energy)]/dt . Using NOAA data, and after PIR, it is shown that: 1) The Energy Budget Method can be realistically applied to the Ocean and Land regions independently, 2) the effective volcanic forcing is &lt;= 1/5 the IPCC AR5 estimate, 3) the "historical" 1980-2020 ECS(eff) values for Global, global Ocean, and global Land regions values are &lt;= 2.16, 1.69, 2.96 C/2xCO2 respectively; where the updated IPCC AR5 orthodox independent global Forcing value of 0.4 (W/m^2)/Decade and F/2xCO2= 3.7 W/m^2 were used. The Global average ECS(true) value of &lt;= 2.10 C is 70% of the IPCC AR6 ECS estimate of 3.0 C, but 127% of the ECS(eff) value reported by Lewis (1.66 C) . The estimated oceans average TCR/ECS ratio = 0.71 and the global average TCR/ECS ratio = 0.83, and ECS(land)/ECS(Ocean) = 1.78 . [Results using HADCRUT temperature data instead are similar, but 6% "cooler" over land, and 8% "warmer" over oceans.] A simplified physically realistic formal/empirical Coarse 2-D Global Climate Model is derived wherein variation of Geff(t) until equilibrium (i.e. "pattern effects") are proven to be negligible or "cooling", using these Methods. And so it is likely ECS(true) &lt;= ECS(eff).</description>

      <title>Solar Power Prediction Using Satellite Data in Different Parts of Nepal</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.11877</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.11877v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Due to the unavailability of solar irradiance data for many potential sites of Nepal, the paper proposes predicting solar irradiance based on alternative meteorological parameters. The study focuses on five distinct regions in Nepal and utilizes a dataset spanning almost ten years, obtained from CERES SYN1deg and MERRA-2. Machine learning models such as Random Forest, XGBoost, K-Nearest Neighbors, and deep learning models like LSTM and ANN-MLP are employed and evaluated for their performance. The results indicate high accuracy in predicting solar irradiance, with R-squared(R2) scores close to unity for both train and test datasets. The impact of parameter integration on model performance is analyzed, revealing the significance of various parameters in enhancing predictive accuracy. Each model demonstrates strong performance across all parameters, consistently achieving MAE values below 6, RMSE values under 10, MBE within |2|, and nearly unity R2 values. Upon removal of various solar parameters such as "Solar_Irradiance_Clear_Sky", "UVA", etc. from the datasets, the model's performance is significantly affected. This exclusion leads to considerable increases in MAE, reaching up to 82, RMSE up to 135, and MBE up to |7|. Among the models, KNN displays the weakest performance, with an R2 of 0.7582546. Conversely, ANN exhibits the strongest performance, boasting an R2 value of 0.9245877. Hence, the study concludes that Artificial Neural Network (ANN) performs exceptionally well, showcasing its versatility even under sparse data parameter conditions.</description>

      <title>Experimental verification of the optimal fingerprint method for detecting climate change</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.11879</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.11879v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The optimal fingerprint method serves as a potent approach for detecting and attributing climate change. However, its experimental validation encounters challenges due to the intricate nature of climate systems. Here, we experimentally examine the optimal fingerprint method simulated by a precisely controlled magnetic resonance system of spins. The spin dynamic under an applied deterministic driving field and a noise field is utilized to emulate the complex climate system with external forcing and internal variability. Our experimental results affirm the theoretical prediction regarding the existence of an optimal detection direction which maximizes the signal-to-noise ratio, thereby validating the optimal fingerprint method. This work offers direct empirical verification of the optimal fingerprint method, crucial for comprehending climate change and its societal impacts.</description>

      <title>A non-autonomous framework for climate change and extreme weather events increase in a stochastic energy balance model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.11881</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.11881v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We develop a three-timescale framework for modelling climate change and introduce a space-heterogeneous one-dimensional energy balance model. This model, addressing temperature fluctuations from rising carbon dioxide levels and the super-greenhouse effect in tropical regions, fits within the setting of stochastic reaction-diffusion equations. Our results show how both mean and variance of temperature increase, without the system going through a bifurcation point. This study aims to advance the conceptual understanding of the extreme weather events frequency increase due to climate change.</description>

      <title>Topographic Visualization of Near-surface Temperatures for Improved Lapse Rate Estimation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.11894</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.11894v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Numerical model forecasts of near-surface temperatures are prone to error. This is because terrain can exert a strong influence on temperature that is not captured in numerical weather models due to spatial resolution limitations. To account for the terrain height difference between the forecast model and reality, temperatures are commonly corrected using a vertical adjustment based on a fixed lapse rate. This, however, ignores the fact that true lapse rates vary from 1.2 K temperature drop per 100 m of ascent to more than 10 K temperature rise over the same vertical distance. In this work, we develop topographic visualization techniques to assess the resulting uncertainties in near-surface temperatures and reveal relationships between those uncertainties, features in the resolved and unresolved topography, and the temperature distribution in the near-surface atmosphere. Our techniques highlight common limitations of the current lapse rate scheme and hint at their topographic dependencies in the context of the prevailing weather conditions. Together with scientists working in postprocessing and downscaling of numerical model output, we use these findings to develop an improved lapse rate scheme. This model adapts to both the topography and the current weather situation. We examine the quality and physical consistency of the new estimates by comparing them with station observations around the world and by including visual representations of radiation-slope interactions.</description>

      <title>The Link between Gulf Stream Precipitation and European Blocking in General Circulation Models and the Role of Horizontal Resolution</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.12597</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.12597v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Past studies show that coupled model biases in European blocking and North Atlantic eddy-driven jet variability decrease as one increases the horizontal resolution in the atmospheric and oceanic model components. This has commonly been argued to be related to an alleviation of sea surface temperature (SST) biases due to increased oceanic resolution in particular, with a physical pathway via changes to surface baroclinicity. On the other hand, many studies have now highlighted the key role of diabatic processes in the Gulf Stream region on blocking formation and maintenance. Here, following recent work by Schemm, we leverage a large multi-model ensemble to show that Gulf Stream precipitation variability in coupled models is tightly linked to the simulated frequency of European blocking and northern jet excursions. Furthermore, the reduced biases in blocking and jet variability are consistent with greater precipitation variability as a result of increased atmospheric horizontal resolution. By contrast, typical North Atlantic SST biases are found to share only a weak or negligible relationship with blocking and jet biases. Finally, while previous studies have used a comparison between coupled models and models run with prescribed SSTs to argue for the role of ocean resolution, we emphasise here that models run with prescribed SSTs experience greatly reduced precipitation variability due to their excessive thermal damping, making it unclear if such a comparison is meaningful. Instead, we speculate that most of the reduction in coupled model biases may actually be due to increased atmospheric resolution.</description>

      <title>Research on Dangerous Flight Weather Prediction based on Machine Learning</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.12298v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: With the continuous expansion of the scale of air transport, the demand for aviation meteorological support also continues to grow. The impact of hazardous weather on flight safety is critical. How to effectively use meteorological data to improve the early warning capability of flight dangerous weather and ensure the safe flight of aircraft is the primary task of aviation meteorological services. In this work, support vector machine (SVM) models are used to predict hazardous flight weather, especially for meteorological conditions with high uncertainty such as storms and turbulence. SVM is a supervised learning method that distinguishes between different classes of data by finding optimal decision boundaries in a high-dimensional space. In order to meet the needs of this study, we chose the radial basis function (RBF) as the kernel function, which helps to deal with nonlinear problems and enables the model to better capture complex meteorological data structures. During the model training phase, we used historical meteorological observations from multiple weather stations, including temperature, humidity, wind speed, wind direction, and other meteorological indicators closely related to flight safety. From this data, the SVM model learns how to distinguish between normal and dangerous flight weather conditions.</description>

      <title>Wind-Driven Interfacial Evaporation from Cold Water</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.12522</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.12522v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Interfacial evaporation, utilizing renewable energy, presents a sustainable approach to promote fast water evaporation with applications in wastewater treatment, soil remediation, and seawater desalination. Solar energy is typically considered a sustainable and stable resource for interfacial evaporation. However, in the cold climate and high-latitude regions, it is challenging how to speed up evaporation of ice-water mixtures. Harnessing wind energy for water evaporation under low-temperature conditions offers considerable potential for addressing wastewater treatment challenges in these areas. In this study, an interfacial evaporation system was designed to harness wind energy for enhanced evaporation from an icy cold water source. A classic oil-lamp evaporator and a new sailboat were used to reveal the influence of wind speed on water evaporation from pure water, and water covered with an oil layer in both lab-scale batch experiments and outdoor trials. The evaporation rate was increased by 6 to 75 times by wind. Our experimental results show that when wind speed exceeds 2.4 m/s, the evaporation rate of water under 1 sun irradiation is comparable to that in dark at the same wind speed at an ambient temperature of 20 $^\circ$C. Our findings demonstrate that a substantial increase in water evaporation rate from solar radiation in weak wind. With an evaporation surface area of 4750 cm$^2$, a high water evaporation rate was maintained at 1.2 kg m$^{-2}$h$^{-1}$, an order of magnitude faster than natural evaporation. A simple theoretical model was developed to correlate the evaporation rate with wind velocity and clarify the diminishing impact of solar irradiation at high wind speeds. The insights gained from this study may contribute to the development of a clean, sustainable approach for reducing wastewater volume in high latitude areas.</description>

      <title>DiuSST: A conceptual model of diurnal warm layers for idealized atmospheric simulations with interactive SST</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2205.07933</link>
      <description>arXiv:2205.07933v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The diurnal variability of sea surface temperature (SST) may play an important role for cloud organization above the tropical ocean, with implications for precipitation extremes, storminess, and climate sensitivity. Recent cloud-resolving simulations demonstrate how imposed diurnal SST oscillations can strongly, and delicately, impact mesoscale convective organization. In spite of this nuanced interaction, many idealized modeling studies of tropical convection either assume a constant, homogeneous SST or, in case of a responsive sea surface, represent the upper ocean by a slab with fixed thickness. Here we show that slab ocean models with constant heat capacity fail to capture the wind-dependence of observed diurnal sea surface warming. To alleviate this shortcoming, we present a simple, yet explicitly depth-resolved model of upper-ocean temperature dynamics under atmospheric forcing. Our modular scheme describes turbulent mixing as diffusion with a wind-dependent diffusivity, in addition to a bulk mixing term and heat fluxes entering as sources and sinks. Using observational data, we apply Bayesian inference to calibrate the model. In contrast with a slab model, our model captures the exponential reduction of the diurnal warming amplitude with increasing wind speed. Further, our model performs comparably to a more elaborately parameterized diurnal warm layer model. Formulated as a single partial differential equation with three key tuning parameters, the model is suitable as an interactive numerical boundary condition for idealized atmospheric simulations.</description>
