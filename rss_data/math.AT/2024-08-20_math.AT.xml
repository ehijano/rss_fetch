      <title>On $(n-2)$-connected $2n$-dimensional Poincar\'e complexes with torsion-free homology</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.09996</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.09996v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $X$ be an $(n-2)$-connected $2n$-dimensional Poincar\'e complex with torsion-free homology, where $n\geq 4$. We prove that $X$ can be decomposed into a connected sum of two Poincar\'e complexes: one being $(n-1)$-connected, while the other having trivial $n$th homology group. Under the additional assumption that $H_n(X)=0$ and $Sq^2:H^{n-1}(X;\mathbb{Z}_2)\to H^{n+1}(X;\mathbb{Z}_2)$ is trivial, we can prove that $X$ can be further decomposed into connected sums of Poincar\'e complexes whose $(n-1)$th homology is isomorphic to $\mathbb{Z}$. As an application of this result, we classify the homotopy types of such $2$-connected $8$-dimensional Poincar\'e complexes.</description>

      <title>On digital H-spaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.10087</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.10087v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this article, we investigate properties of digital H-spaces in the graph theoretic model of digital topology. As in prior work, the results obtained often depend fundamentally on the choice between NP$_1$ and NP$_2$ product adjacencies. We explore algebraic properties of digital H-spaces preserved under digital homotopy equivalence, and we give a general construction that produces examples of digital H-spaces which are not homotopy-equivalent to digital topological groups in both categories. Further, we show that this construction essentially classifies all NP$_2$-digital H-spaces. In a short appendix, we resolve a question that was left unresolved in [17], and complete the full classification of digital topological groups.</description>

      <title>GKM actions on almost quaternionic manifolds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.09299</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.09299v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce quaternionic structures on abstract GKM graphs, as the combinatorial counterpart of almost quaternionic structures left invariant by a torus action of GKM type. In the GKM$_3$ setting the 2-faces of the GKM graph can naturally be divided into quaternionic and complex 2-faces; it turns out that for GKM$_3$ actions on positive quaternion-K\"ahler manifolds the quaternionic 2-faces are biangles or triangles, and the complex 2-faces triangles or quadrangles. We show purely combinatorially that any abstract GKM$_3$ graph with quaternionic structure satisfying this restriction on the 2-faces of the GKM graph is that of a torus action on quaternionic projective space ${\mathbb{H}} P^n$ or the Grassmannian ${\mathrm{Gr}}_2({\mathbb{C}}^n)$ of complex 2-planes in ${\mathbb{C}}^n$.</description>

      <title>Chow rings of quasi-split geometrically almost simple algebraic groups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.09390</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.09390v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We compute the Chow ring of a quasi-split geometrically almost simple algebraic group assuming the coefficients to be a field. This extends the classical computation for split groups done by Kac to the non-split quasi-split case. For the proof we introduce and study equivariant conormed Chow rings, which are well adapted to the study of quasi-split groups and their homogeneous varieties.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2408.09968v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the sets of planes in an even dimensional real vector space $V$ which are simultaneously stabilised by a pair of complex structures on $V$. We completely describe these sets of planes for pairs of orthogonal complex structures. Generically, the number of such planes is finite. We compute this number for orthogonal complex structures and prove that it gives a lower bound for the number of planes simultaneously stabilised by a generic pair of complex structures on $V$.</description>

Abstract: We present a 2-dimensional Peano continuum $\mathbb{T}\subseteq \mathbb{R}^3$ with the following properties: (1) There is a universal covering projection $q:\overline{\mathbb{T}}\rightarrow \mathbb{T}$ with uncountable fundamental group $\pi_1(\overline{\mathbb{T}})$; (2) For every $1\not=[\overline{\alpha}]\in \pi_1(\overline{\mathbb{T}},\ast)$, there is a covering projection $r:(E,e)\rightarrow (\overline{\mathbb{T}},\ast)$ such that $[\overline{\alpha}]\not\in r_\#\pi_1(E,e)$; (3) There is no universal covering projection $r:E\rightarrow \overline{\mathbb{T}}$; (4) The universal object $p:\widetilde{\mathbb{T}}\rightarrow \mathbb{T}$ in the category of fibrations with unique path lifting (and path-connected total space) over $\mathbb{T}$ has trivial fundamental group $\pi_1(\widetilde{\mathbb{T}})=1$; (5) $p:\widetilde{\mathbb{T}}\rightarrow \mathbb{T}$ is not a path component of an inverse limit of covering projections over $\mathbb{T}$.</description>

      <title>On Simplicial Principal Bundles in Descent Categories</title>

      <description>arXiv:2305.01630v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Simplicial objects $\mathsf{sC}$ in descent categories $\mathsf{C}$, as introduced by Behrend and Getzler, provide a context in which to study higher stacks. In this note, we extend the construction of the canonical cocycle of a smooth principal $G$-bundle to the context of principal $G$-bundles in $\mathsf{sC}_{/X}$. As an application, we show how this specializes to $\mathsf{C}=\mathsf{Sets}$ to give a streamlined construction of $k$-invariants of reduced Kan complexes. We adapt this to give a similarly streamlined construction of minimal Kan complexes, with the goal of clarifying the role of the axiom of choice; Postnikov towers of minimal Kan complexes provide examples of towers of simplicial principal bundles of the type we consider.</description>

      <title>A Positive Answer to a Question of K. Borsuk on the Capacity of Polyhedra with Finite by Cyclic Fundamental Group</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.15502</link>
      <description>arXiv:2307.15502v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Karol Borsuk in 1968 asked: Is it true that every finite polyhedron dominates only finitely many different shapes? Danuta Kolodziejczyk showed that generally an answer to the Borsuk question is negative and also presented a positive answer by proving that every polyhedron with finite fundamental group dominates only finitely many different homotopy types (hence shapes). In this paper, we show that polyhedra with finite by cyclic fundamental group dominate only finitely many homotopy types. As a consequence, we give a partial positive answer to this question of Kolodziejczyk: Does every polyhedron with abelian fundamental group dominate only finitely many different homotopy types? In fact, we that every polyhedron with abelian fundamental group of rank 1 dominates only finitely many different homotopy types. Finally, we prove that every polyhedron dominates only finitely many homotopy types of simply connected CW-complexes.</description>

      <title>On spaces of minimal higher topological complexity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.07364</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.07364v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Let TC$_n$(X) denote the n-th topological complexity of a topological space X. It is known that TC$_n$(X) does not exceed n-1 for non-contractible X, and so it makes sense to describe spaces X with TC$_n$(X) =n-1. Grant--Lupton--Oprea proved the following: If X is a nilpotent space with TC$_n$(X)=n-1 then X is homotopy equivalent to an odd-dimensional sphere. Here we made an attempt to get rid of nilpotency condition and prove the following: If TC$_n$(X) =n-1 then either X is homotopy equivalent to a sphere of odd dimension or is a homology circle with the infinite cyclic fundamental group.</description>

      <title>On the structures of the Johnson cokernels of the basis-conjugating automorphism groups of free groups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.04286</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.04286v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we study the Johnson homomorphisms of basis-conjugating automorphism groups of free groups. We construct obstructions for the surjectivity of the Johnson homomorphisms. By using it, we determine its cokernels of degree up to four, and give further observations for degree greater than four.
  As applications, we give the affirmative answer for the Andreadakis problem for degree four. We show that the cup product map of the first cohomology groups of the basis-conjugating automorphism group of a free group into the second cohomology group is surjective. Finally, we calculate the twisted first cohomology groups of the braid-permutation automorphism groups of a free group.</description>

      <title>On the Euler characteristic of the commutative graph complex and the top weight cohomology of $\mathcal M_g$</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.04190v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We prove an asymptotic formula for the Euler characteristic of Kontsevich's commutative graph complex. This formula implies that the total amount of commutative graph homology grows super-exponentially with the rank and, via a theorem of Chan, Galatius, and Payne, that the dimension of the top weight cohomology of the moduli space of curves, $\mathcal M_g$, grows super-exponentially with the genus $g$.</description>

      <title>$K(Z,2)$ out of circular permutations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.01625</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.01625v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We discuss $\pmb{SC}_*$, a simplicial homotopy model of $K(Z,2)$ constructed from circular permutations. In any dimension, the number of simplices in the model is finite. The complex $\pmb{SC}_*$ naturally manifests as a simplicial set representing ``minimally" triangulated circle bundles over simplicial bases. On the other hand, existence of the homotopy equivalence $|\pmb{SC}_*| \approx B(U(1)) \approx K(Z,2)$ appears to be a canonical fact from the foundations of the theory of crossed simplicial groups.</description>

      <title>On the mod-2 cohomology of the product of the infinite lens space and the space of invariants in a generic degree</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.07485</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.07485v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Let $\mathbb S^{\infty}/\mathbb Z_2$ be the infinite lens space and $\mathscr A$ be the Steenrod algebra over the binary field $\mathbb F_2.$ The cohomology $H^{*}((\mathbb S^{\infty}/\mathbb Z_2)^{\oplus s}; \mathbb F_2)$ is known to be isomorphic to the graded polynomial ring $\mathcal {P}_s:= \mathbb F_2[x_1, \ldots, x_s]$ on $s$ generators of degree 1, viewed as an unstable $\mathscr A$-module. The Kameko squaring operation $(\widetilde {Sq^0_*})_{(s; N)}: (\mathbb F_2\otimes_{\mathscr A} \mathcal {P}_s)_{2N+s} \longrightarrow (\mathbb F_2\otimes_{\mathscr A} \mathcal {P}_s)_{N}$ is rather useful in studying an open problem of determining the dimension of the indecomposables $(\mathbb F_2\otimes_{\mathscr A} \mathcal {P}_s)_N.$ As a continuation of our recent works, this paper deals with the kernel of the Kameko $(\widetilde {Sq^0_*})_{(s; N_d)}$ for the case where $s = 5$ and the "generic" degree $N_d$ is of the form $N_d = 5(2^{d} - 1) + 11.2^{d+1}$ for arbitrary $d &gt; 0.$ We then rectify almost all of the main results that were inaccurate in an earlier publication [Rev. Real Acad. Cienc. Exactas Fis. Nat. Ser. A-Mat. \textbf{116}:81 (2022)] by Nguyen Khac Tin. We have also constructed several advanced algorithms in \texttt{SageMath} to validate our results. These new algorithms make an important contribution to tackling the intricate task of explicitly determining both the dimension and the basis for the indecomposables $\mathbb F_2 \otimes_{\mathscr A} \mathcal {P}_s$ at positive degrees, a problem concerning algorithmic approaches that had not previously been addressed by any author. Also, the present study encompasses an investigation of the behavior of the cohomological transfer in bidegrees $(5, 5+N_d)$, with the internal degree $N_d$ mentioned above. The interplay between the papers by Nguyen Sum \cite{SM, N.S3} and our preceding studies \cite{D.P3, D.P7-1} is also discussed.</description>

      <title>An Equisingular Specialisation of the Compactified Jacobian and its applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2107.12259</link>
      <description>arXiv:2107.12259v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: For any positive integer $k$, let $X_k$ be a projective irreducible nodal curve with $k$ nodes. We show that the Betti numbers and the mixed Hodge numbers of the compactified Jacobian $\overline{J_{k}}$ of an irreducible nodal curve $X_k$ with $k$ nodes are the same as the Betti numbers and the mixed Hodge numbers of $J_0\times R^k$, where $J_0$ is the Jacobian of the normalisation of the irreducible nodal curve and $R$ denotes the rational nodal curve with one node. We prove it by constructing a topologically locally trivial family of projective varieties containing $\overline{J_{k}}$ and $J_0\times R^k$ as fibres.</description>
