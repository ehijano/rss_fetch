      <title>Investigating vector-like leptons decaying into an electron and missing transverse energy in e$^{+}$ e$^{-}$ collisions with $\sqrt{s} = 500$ GeV at the ILC</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.08143</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.08143v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This analysis focuses on probing the lepton portal dark matter using Monte Carlo simulated samples from electron-positron collisions at the International Linear Collider (ILC) of 500 GeV center of mass energy with an integrated luminosity of 1000 fb$^{-1}$. The study examines a benchmark scenario where the dark matter is a scalar particle produced as a daughter particle of the vector-like lepton. The signal topology consists of missing transverse energy and dilepton. If no new physics is discovered,the study sets 95\% confidence level exclusion limits on the mass of vector-like leptons.</description>

      <title>A precision evaluation of the $\eta$- and $\eta'$-pole contributions to hadronic light-by-light scattering in the anomalous magnetic moment of the muon</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.08098</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.08098v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Next to the $\pi^0$ pole, $\eta$ and $\eta'$ intermediate states give rise to the leading singularities of the hadronic light-by-light tensor, resulting in sizable contributions to the anomalous magnetic moment of the muon $a_\mu$. The strength of the poles is determined by the respective transition form factors (TFFs) to two (virtual) photons. We present a calculation of these TFFs that implements a number of low- and high-energy constraints, including the $\eta^{(\prime)}\to\gamma\gamma$ decay widths, $\eta^{(\prime)}\to\pi^+\pi^-\gamma$ spectra, chiral symmetry for the $\eta^{(\prime)}\to2(\pi^+\pi^-)$ amplitudes, vector-meson couplings, and asymptotic limits. Crucially, we investigate the role of the leading left-hand singularity generated by the exchange of the $a_2$ tensor meson, yielding, for the first time, an estimate of the associated factorization-breaking corrections. Our final results, $a_\mu^{\eta\text{-pole}}=14.7(9)\times 10^{-11}$ and $a_\mu^{\eta'\text{-pole}}=13.5(7)\times 10^{-11}$, conclude a dedicated effort to evaluate the pseudoscalar-pole contributions to hadronic light-by-light scattering using dispersion relations, amounting to a combined $a_\mu^{\text{PS-poles}}=91.2^{+2.9}_{-2.4}\times 10^{-11}$.</description>

      <title>Leveraging intermediate resonances to probe CP violation at colliders</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.08714</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.08714v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the phenomenological implications of interference between tree-level contributions to three-body final states in $2\to 3$ scattering. We propose a new CP-violating observable in this scattering which probes the different virtualities of intermediate resonances, in the presence of Standard Model~(SM) and new physics contributions to these processes. Analytically, we demonstrate the efficacy of this observable in probing interference between SM charged-current decays and effective left-handed vector interactions, and in a toy model featuring a scalar leptoquark, $S_1 \sim (3, 1, -1/3)$. Numerically, we apply this formalism to studying the decay $pp\to b \tau\nu$ over the full kinematic region of final-state phase space. In contrast to existing probes of new physics at colliders, this study demonstrates a use for an intermediate region of energies, where new physics is not light enough to produced on shell, but not heavy enough to be integrated out and treated with effective-theory formalism. Furthermore, we perform a proof-of-principle analysis to demonstrate how this new search can be complementary to the traditional high-transverse momentum searches. In light of the large amount of data to be collected at the high-luminosity LHC, this study paves the way to further spectroscopic studies to probe CP-violation in $2\to 3$ processes at the LHC and at future colliders.</description>

      <title>Characterisation of analogue MAPS produced in the 65 nm TPSCo process</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.08740</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.08740v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Within the context of the ALICE ITS3 collaboration, a set of MAPS small-scale test structures were developed using the 65 nm TPSCo CMOS imaging process with the upgrade of the ALICE inner tracking system as its primary focus. One such sensor, the Circuit Exploratoire 65 nm (CE-65), and its evolution the CE-65v2, were developed to explore charge collection properties for varying configurations including collection layer process (standard, blanket, modified with gap), pixel pitch (15, 18, \SI{22.5}{\micro\meter}), and pixel geometry (square vs hexagonal/staggered). In this work the characterisation of the CE-65v2 chip, based on $^{55}$Fe lab measurements and test beams at CERN SPS, is presented. Matrix gain uniformity up to the $\mathcal{O}$(5\%) level was demonstrated for all considered chip configurations. The CE-65v2 chip achieves a spatial resolution of under \SI{2}{\micro\meter} during beam tests. Process modifications allowing for faster charge collection and less charge sharing result in decreased spatial resolution, but a considerably wider range of operation, with both the \SI{15}{\micro\meter} and \SI{22.5}{\micro\meter} chips achieving over 99\% efficiency up to a $\sim$180 e$^{-}$ seed threshold. The results serve to validate the 65 nm TPSCo CMOS process, as well as to motivate design choices in future particle detection experiments.</description>

      <title>Vertically stacked amorphous selenium based VUV photodetectors for use in liquid noble detectors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.08823</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.08823v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present results from the characterization of a vertically stacked amorphous selenium (aSe)-based photodetector for use in cryogenic environments. aSe has been identified as an ideal photoconductor that can efficiently convert vacuum ultraviolet (VUV) light to charges even at cryogenic temperatures. We have designed and fabricated an aSe device in vertical geometry with top and bottom metal electrodes that produces an electric field perpendicular to the substrate. The top-metal contact has an open design that results in a large fraction of the aSe thin film surface to be active for photodetection. Our experiments show that the vertically stacked aSe device detects light from a Xenon flash lamp in a vacuum environment and can produce measurable signals at \(\sim \)130K. We also demonstrate a significant enhancement in the amplitude of the photoinduced signal by growing graphene on the top-metal contact and the aSe thin film. Our results provide the first demonstration of a vertical aSe based VUV photodetector that utilizes the wide-band optical transparency of graphene top-electrode. Our results could open the doorway to a potentially game-changing solution of an integrated charge and light sensor that can be employed in future large-scale time projection chambers with pixelated anode planes.</description>

      <title>Fast $b$-tagging at the high-level trigger of the ATLAS experiment in LHC Run 3</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.09738</link>
      <description>arXiv:2306.09738v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The ATLAS experiment relies on real-time hadronic jet reconstruction and $b$-tagging to record fully hadronic events containing $b$-jets. These algorithms require track reconstruction, which is computationally expensive and could overwhelm the high-level-trigger farm, even at the reduced event rate that passes the ATLAS first stage hardware-based trigger. In LHC Run 3, ATLAS has mitigated these computational demands by introducing a fast neural-network-based $b$-tagger, which acts as a low-precision filter using input from hadronic jets and tracks. It runs after a hardware trigger and before the remaining high-level-trigger reconstruction. This design relies on the negligible cost of neural-network inference as compared to track reconstruction, and the cost reduction from limiting tracking to specific regions of the detector. In the case of Standard Model $HH \rightarrow b\bar{b}b\bar{b}$, a key signature relying on $b$-jet triggers, the filter lowers the input rate to the remaining high-level trigger by a factor of five at the small cost of reducing the overall signal efficiency by roughly 2%.</description>

      <title>Precise measurements of $W$- and $Z$-boson transverse momentum spectra with the ATLAS detector using $pp$ collisions at $\sqrt{s} = 5.02$ TeV and $13$ TeV</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.06204</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.06204v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper describes measurements of the transverse momentum spectra of $W$ and $Z$ bosons produced in proton-proton collisions at centre-of-mass energies of $\sqrt{s}=5.02$ TeV and $\sqrt{s}=13$ TeV with the ATLAS experiment at the Large Hadron Collider. Measurements are performed in the electron and muon channels, $W \to \ell\nu$ and $Z \to \ell\ell$ ($\ell=e$ or $\mu$), and for $W$ events further separated by charge. The data were collected in 2017 and 2018, in dedicated runs with reduced instantaneous luminosity, and correspond to $255$ pb$^{-1}$ and $338$ pb$^{-1}$ at $\sqrt{s}=5.02$ TeV and $13$ TeV, respectively. These conditions optimise the reconstruction of the $W$-boson transverse momentum. The distributions observed in the electron and muon channels are unfolded, combined, and compared to QCD calculations based on parton shower Monte Carlo event generators and analytical resummation. The description of the transverse momentum distributions by Monte Carlo event generators is imperfect and shows significant differences largely common to $W^-$, $W^+$ and $Z$ production. The agreement is better at $\sqrt{s}=5.02$ TeV, especially for predictions that were tuned to $Z$ production data at $\sqrt{s}=7$ TeV. Higher-order, resummed predictions based on DYTurbo generally match the data best across the spectra. Distribution ratios are also presented and test the understanding of differences between the production processes.</description>

      <title>Pileup density estimate independent on jet multiplicity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.08383</link>
      <description>arXiv:2304.08383v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The hard-scatter processes in hadronic collisions are often largely contaminated with soft background coming from pileup in proton-proton collisions, or underlying event in heavy-ion collisions. There are multiple methods to remove the effect of pileup for jets. Two such methods, Area Subtraction and Constituent Subtraction, use the pileup density as the main ingredient to estimate the magnitude of pileup contribution on an event-by-event basis. The state-of-the-art approaches to estimating pileup density are sensitive to the number of hard-scatter jets in the event. This paper presents a new pileup-density estimation method that minimizes the sensitivity on the presence of hard-scatter jets in the event. Using a detector-level simulation, we provide a comparison of the new method with the state-of-the-art estimation methods. We observe a significantly lower bias for the estimated pileup density when using the new method. We conclude that the new method has the potential to significantly improve pileup mitigation in proton-proton collisions or the underlying event subtraction in heavy-ion collisions.</description>

      <title>Identification of the $G(3900)$ as the P-wave $D\bar{D}^*/\bar{D}D^*$ resonance</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.01727</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.01727v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The BESIII Collaboration recently performed a precise measurement of the $e^+e^-\rightarrow D\bar{D}$ Born cross sections, and confirmed the $G(3900)$ structure reported by BaBar and Belle with high significance. We identify the $G(3900)$ as the first P-wave $\DDbar$ molecular resonance. The experimental and theoretical identification of the P-wave dimeson state holds paramount importance in enhancing our comprehension of the non-perturbative QCD and few-body physics. Its existence is firmly established in a unified meson-exchange model which simultaneously depicts the features of the $\chi_{c1}(3872)$, $Z_c(3900)$ and $T_{cc}(3875)$. This scenario can be directly examined in the $e^+e^-\rightarrow D\bar{D}^*/\bar{D}D^*$ cross section by seeing whether a resonance exists at the threshold. The credibility of the investigations is also ensured by the fact that the P-wave interaction dominantly arises from the well-known long-range pion exchange. Additionally, thanks to the centrifugal barrier, it is easier to form resonances in P-wave than in S-wave. We extensively calculate all systems up to P-wave with various quantum numbers and predict a dense population of the $\DDbar$ and $\DD$ states, where the S-wave $\DDbar$ state with $I^G (J^{PC})=0^- (1^{+-})$, P-wave $\DDbar$ state with $I^G(J^{PC})=0^+(0^{-+})$, and P-wave $\DD$ state with $I(J^P)=0(0^-)$ are more likely to be observed in experiments.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.18837v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We report on updated precision predictions for total cross sections of coloured supersymmetric particle production at the LHC with a centre-of-mass energy of $\sqrt S$ = 13.6 TeV, computed with the modern PDF4LHC21 set. The cross sections are calculated at an approximated NNLO accuracy in QCD and contain corrections from the threshold resummation of soft-gluon emission up to NNLL accuracy as well as Coulomb-gluon contributions including bound-state terms. The corrections are found to increase the cross sections and reduce the theoretical uncertainty as compared to the best available fixed-order calculations. These predictions constitute the state-of-the-art calculations and update the existing results for $\sqrt S$ = 13 TeV. We make our new results publicly available in the version 2.0 update to the code package NNLL-fast.</description>

      <title>X650-&gt;ZZ/WW/H125H95/A450Z -- scalar, tensor or both ?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.12178</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.12178v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: At ICHEP 2024 CMS has published RUN2 results for X650-&gt;ZZ-&gt;4leptons and reached the conclusion that there is no evidence for a scalar resonance H650 decaying into ZZ, as was also concluded by ATLAS using an MVA analysis optimised for a scalar particle. Since this resonance is indicated into ZZ in a Cut Based Analysis and into three other modes: WW, H95H125 and A450Z, the present paper is an attempt to understand these apparent contradictions. Our conclusion, to be confirmed by ATLAS and CMS experiments, is that strict selections for the reaction H650-&gt;ZZ mode seem inadequate, cutting as much into the signal than into the background, therefore reducing its statistical significance. A possible interpretation of this behaviour is that these selections are inefficient for a tensor particle produced by VBF and decaying into ZZ with an angular distributions similar to the Drell Yan background. If true, our description of the various findings in term of the Georgi Machacek model needs to be deeply revised, which is attempted in the present note. A scenario with T650 as a tensor resonance is presented which naturally accommodates WW/ZZ and H95H125 decays, while we suggest that A420Z could come from a H650 resonance degenerate in mass with T650. We propose a scheme in which scalar resonances are accommodated in three doublets, T650 in an isosinglet, T450++, T375+ and T400 belong to an isofiveplet.</description>

      <title>Limits on planetary-mass primordial black holes from the OGLE high-cadence survey of the Magellanic Clouds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.06251</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.06251v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Observations of the Galactic bulge revealed an excess of short-timescale gravitational microlensing events that are generally attributed to a large population of free-floating or wide-orbit exoplanets. However, in recent years, some authors suggested that planetary-mass primordial black holes (PBHs) comprising a substantial fraction (1%-10%) of the dark matter in the Milky Way may be responsible for these events. If that was the case, a large number of short-timescale microlensing events should also be seen toward the Magellanic Clouds. Here, we report the results of a high-cadence survey of the Magellanic Clouds carried out from 2022 October through 2024 May as part of the Optical Gravitational Lensing Experiment. We observed almost 35 million source stars located in the central regions of the Large and Small Magellanic Clouds and found only one long-timescale microlensing event candidate. No short-timescale events were detected despite high sensitivity to such events. That allows us to infer the strongest available limits on the frequency of planetary-mass PBHs in dark matter. We find that PBHs and other compact objects with masses from $1.4 \times 10^{-8}\,M_{\odot}$ (half of the Moon mass) to $0.013\,M_{\odot}$ (planet/brown dwarf boundary) may comprise at most 1% of dark matter. That rules out the PBH origin hypothesis for the short-timescale events detected toward the Galactic bulge and indicates they are caused by the population of free-floating or wide-orbit planets.</description>

Abstract: Jet clustering or reconstruction is a crucial component at high energy colliders, a procedure to identify sprays of collimated particles originating from the fragmentation and hadronization of quarks and gluons. It is a complicated combinatorial optimization problem and requires intensive computing resources. In this study, we formulate jet reconstruction as a quadratic unconstrained binary optimization (QUBO) problem and introduce novel quantum-annealing-inspired algorithms for clustering multiple jets in electron-positron collision events. One of these quantum-annealing-inspired algorithms, ballistic simulated bifurcation, overcomes problems previously observed in multijet clustering with quantum-annealing approaches. We find that both the distance defined in the QUBO matrix and the prediction power of the QUBO solvers have crucial impacts on the multijet clustering performance. This study opens up a new approach to globally reconstructing multijet beyond dijet in one go, in contrast to the traditional iterative method.</description>

      <title>Collider-Flavour Complementarity from the bottom to the top</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.00940</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.00940v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Motivated by recently observed anomalies in the flavour sector, we analyse the potential of measurements of top quarks at the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) to provide complementary constraints on interactions that shape low-energy precision investigations in the $B$ sector. The measurement of top quark properties, such as the top width and the abundant top pair production channels, are already reaching the percent level at this relatively early stage of the LHC phenomenology program. A focused analysis of four-fermion interactions, employing effective field theory without flavour structure assumptions and incorporating renormalization group evolution effects, bridges $B$ meson scale phenomena with key top quark measurements. We demonstrate that the LHC is increasingly competitive with, and complementary to, flavour physics constraints. Our results, which include a first comprehensive analysis of non-leptonic B decays in this context, suggest that the LHC's top physics program could serve as a valuable, complementary tool in the search for physics beyond the Standard Model within the flavour sector.</description>
