      <title>Efficiently Building and Characterizing Electromagnetic Models of Multi-Qubit Superconducting Circuits</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.04351</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.04351v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In an attempt to better leverage superconducting quantum computers, scaling efforts have become the central concern. These efforts have been further exacerbated by the increased complexity of these circuits. The added complexity can introduce parasitic couplings and resonances, which may hinder the overall performance and scalability of these devices. We explore a method of modeling and characterization based on multiport impedance functions that correspond to multi-qubit circuits. By combining vector fitting techniques with a novel method for interconnecting rational impedance functions, we are able to efficiently construct Hamiltonians for multi-qubit circuits using electromagnetic simulations. Our methods can also be applied to circuits that contain both lumped and distributed element components. The constructed Hamiltonians account for all the interactions within a circuit that are described by the impedance function. We then present characterization methods that allow us to estimate effective qubit coupling rates, state-dependent dispersive shifts of resonant modes, and qubit relaxation times.</description>

      <title>Quantum erasure based on phase structure</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.04358</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.04358v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The quantum eraser effect exemplifies the distinct properties of quantum mechanics that challenge classical intuition and expose the wave-particle duality of light. This effect has been extensively explored in various experiments; most of these investigations use polarisation to distinguish which path information, and less attention has been paid to the phase structure which is related wavefront of photon. In this study, we introduce a theoretical framework for quantum erasure that focusses on the phase structure and demonstrate it experimentally. In this experiment, we employ a Mach-Zehnder interferometer (MZI) where a first-order spiral phase plate (SPP) is integrated into one of its arms. This setup applied orbital angular momentum (OAM) to the photons and established predetermined which-way information. Consequently, the photon demonstrates its particle characteristics, with absence of interference at the MZI's output ports. Utilizing an additional SPP to erase the phase structure from the output photon results in pronounced interference patterns, observable in a post-measurement scenario. This result allows us to include the structure information of the equiphase plane of the light field in quantum erasure. The results challenge the traditional cause-effect relationship in classical physics, given that the subsequent choice of the SPP adheres to a space-like separation.</description>

      <title>Feasible generation of gravity-induced entanglement by using optomechanical systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.04361</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.04361v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We report the feasibility of detecting the gravity-induced entanglement (GIE) with optomechanical systems, which is the first investigation that clarifies the feasible experimental parameters to achieve a signal-to-noise ratio of S/N=1. Our proposal focuses on GIE generation between optomechanical mirrors, coupled via gravitational interactions, under continuous measurement, feedback control, and Kalman filtering process, which matured in connection with the field of gravitational wave observations. We solved the Riccati equation to evaluate the time evolution of the conditional covariance matrix for optomechanical mirrors that estimated the minimum variance of the motions. The results demonstrate that GIE is generated faster than a well-known time scale without optomechanical coupling. The fast generation of entanglement is associated with quantum-state squeezing by the Kalman filtering process, which is an advantage of using optomechanical systems to experimentally detect GIE.</description>

      <title>A momentum space formulation for some relativistic statistical field theories with quantum-like observables</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.04365</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.04365v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Considering a fluctuating scalar field on momentum space, some relativistic statistical field theories are constructed. A Hilbert space of observables is then constructed from functionals of the fluctuating scalar field with an inner product defined in terms of expectation values of the functionals. A bosonic Fock space is then constructed from the Hilbert space and creation and annihilation operators that act on the Fock space are defined. The creation and annihilation operators are used to define field operators. These field operators have some interesting quantum-like properties. For example, the field operators do not commute in general and, in the particular case of the free field theory, can be shown to satisfy the microcausality condition.</description>

      <title>Simulating and comparing the quantum and classical mechanically motion of two hydrogen atoms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.04366</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.04366v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A comprehensive comparison of quantum evolution between the quantum and classical mechanically motion of nuclei in a finite-dimensional quantum chemistry model is presented. A modified version of Tavis-Cummings-Hubbard model with two two-level artificial atoms in optical cavities is described for simulating the association and dissociation of neutral hydrogen molecule. The initial circumstances that led to the formation and decomposition of neutral hydrogen molecule are discussed. The dissipative process of Markovian open system is simulated through solving quantum master equation - Lindbladian. The motion of these two atoms (nuclei) both quantum and classical mechanically is compared. In quantum form, nuclei's mobility is portrayed by tunneling effect of nuclei. And we describe the effect of the classical motion of nuclei on the interaction within the system by fluctuation of strengths. Consideration is also given to the dark state, which is produced along with the dissociation process and has a non-negligible impact on the final result of the evolution.</description>

      <title>High-dimensional entanglement witnessed by correlations in arbitrary bases</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.04395</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.04395v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Certifying entanglement is an important step in the development of many quantum technologies, especially for higher-dimensional systems, where entanglement promises increased capabilities for quantum communication and computation. A key feature distinguishing entanglement from classical correlations is the occurrence of correlations for complementary measurement bases. In particular, mutually unbiased bases (MUBs) are a paradigmatic example that is well-understood and routinely employed for entanglement certification. However, implementing unbiased measurements exactly is challenging and not generically possible for all physical platforms. Here, we extend the entanglement-certification toolbox from correlations in MUBs to arbitrary bases, even without requiring aligned reference frames. This represents a practically significant simplification that paves the way for the efficient characterization of high-dimensional entanglement in a wide range of physical systems.</description>

      <title>Geometric Quantum Machine Learning with Horizontal Quantum Gates</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.04418</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.04418v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the current framework of Geometric Quantum Machine Learning, the canonical method for constructing a variational ansatz that respects the symmetry of some group action is by forcing the circuit to be equivariant, i.e., to commute with the action of the group. This can, however, be an overzealous constraint that greatly limits the expressivity of the circuit, especially in the case of continuous symmetries. We propose an alternative paradigm for the symmetry-informed construction of variational quantum circuits, based on homogeneous spaces, relaxing the overly stringent requirement of equivariance. We achieve this by introducing horizontal quantum gates, which only transform the state with respect to the directions orthogonal to those of the symmetry. We show that horizontal quantum gates are much more expressive than equivariant gates, and thus can solve problems that equivariant circuits cannot. For instance, a circuit comprised of horizontal gates can find the ground state of an $\mathrm{SU}(2)$-symmetric model where the ground state spin sector is unknown--a task where equivariant circuits fall short. Moreover, for a particular subclass of horizontal gates based on symmetric spaces, we can obtain efficient circuit decompositions for our gates through the KAK theorem. Finally, we highlight a particular class of horizontal quantum gates that behave similarly to general $\mathrm{SU}(4)$ gates, while achieving a quadratic reduction in the number of parameters for a generic problem.</description>

      <title>Revisiting astrophysical bounds on continuous spontaneous localization models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.04463</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.04463v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Among the open problems in fundamental physics, few are as conceptually significant as the measurement problem in Quantum Mechanics. One of the proposed solutions to this problem is the Continuous Spontaneous Localization (CSL) model, which introduces a non-linear and stochastic modification of the Schr\"odinger equation. This model incorporates two parameters that can be subjected to experimental constraints. One of the most notable consequences of this theory is the spontaneous heating of massive objects; this anomalous heating is dependent on the CSL parameters. In this work, we will revisit some astrophysical bounds previously found, and introduce new methods for testing the spontaneous heating in a variety of compact objects. Finally, we will compare our different bounds and discuss the benefits and shortcomings of each one.</description>

      <title>Estimating molecular thermal averages with the quantum equation of motion and informationally complete measurements</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.04475</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.04475v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: By leveraging the Variational Quantum Eigensolver (VQE), the ``quantum equation of motion" (qEOM) method established itself as a promising tool for quantum chemistry on near term quantum computers, and has been used extensively to estimate molecular excited states. Here, we explore a novel application of this method, employing it to compute thermal averages of quantum systems, specifically molecules like ethylene and butadiene. A drawback of qEOM is that it requires measuring the expectation values of a large number of observables on the ground state of the system, and the number of necessary measurements can become a bottleneck of the method. In this work we focus on measurements through informationally complete positive operator-valued measures (IC-POVMs) to achieve a reduction in the measurements overheads. We show with numerical simulations that the qEOM combined with IC-POVM measurements ensures a satisfactory accuracy in the reconstruction of the thermal state with a reasonable number of shots.</description>

      <title>Quantum Communication: From Fundamentals to Recent Trends, Challenges and Open Problems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.04492</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.04492v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: With the recent advancements and developments in quantum technologies, the emerging field of quantum communication and networking has gained the attention of the researchers. Owing to the unique properties of quantum mechanics, viz., quantum superposition and entanglement, this new area of quantum communication has shown potential to replace modernday communication technologies. The enhanced security and high information sharing ability using principles of quantum mechanics has encouraged networking engineers and physicists to develop this technology for next generation wireless systems. However, a conceptual bridge between the fundamentals of quantum mechanics, photonics and the deployability of a quantum communication infrastructure is not well founded in the current literature. This paper aims to fill this gap by merging the theoretical concepts from quantum physics to the engineering and computing perspectives of quantum technology. This paper builds the fundamental concepts required for understanding quantum communication, reviews the key concepts and demonstrates how these concepts can be leveraged for accomplishing successful communication. The paper delves into implementation advancements for executing quantum communication protocols, explaining how hardware implementation enables the achievement of all basic quantum computing operations. Finally, the paper provides a comprehensive and critical review of the state-of-the-art advancements in the field of quantum communication and quantum internet; and points out the recent trends, challenges and open problems for the real-world realization of next generation networking systems.</description>

      <title>Entanglement engineering of optomechanical systems by reinforcement learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.04550</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.04550v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Entanglement is fundamental to quantum information science and technology, yet controlling and manipulating entanglement -- so-called entanglement engineering -- for arbitrary quantum systems remains a formidable challenge. There are two difficulties: the fragility of quantum entanglement and its experimental characterization. We develop a deep reinforcement-learning (RL) approach to entanglement engineering, in which feedback control together with weak continuous measurement and partial state observation is exploited to generate and maintain desired entanglement. We employ quantum optomechanical systems with linear or nonlinear photon-phonon interactions to demonstrate the workings of our machine-learning-based entanglement engineering protocol. In particular, the RL agent sequentially interacts with one or multiple parallel quantum optomechanical environments, collects trajectories, and updates the policy to maximize the accumulated reward to create and stabilize quantum entanglement over an arbitrary amount of time. The machine-learning-based control principle is applicable to entanglement engineering of experimental quantum systems in general.</description>

      <title>A Mechanism for Entanglement?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.04571</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.04571v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose that quantum entanglement is a special sort of selection artefact, explicable as a combination of (i) collider bias and (ii) a boundary constraint on the collider variable. We show that the proposal is valid for a special class of (`W-shaped') Bell experiments involving delayed-choice entanglement swapping, and argue that it can be extended to the ordinary (`V-shaped') case. The proposal requires no direct causal influence outside lightcones, and may hence offer a way to reconcile Bell nonlocality and relativity. The main argument is a detailed version of an approach previously outlined in arXiv:2404.13928 [quant-ph].</description>

      <title>Quantum state preparation for a velocity field based on the spherical Clebsch wave function</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.04652</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.04652v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose a method for preparing the quantum state for a given velocity field, e.g., in fluid dynamics, via the spherical Clebsch wave function (SCWF). Using the pointwise normalization constraint for the SCWF, we develop a variational ansatz comprising parameterized controlled rotation gates. Employing the variational quantum algorithm, we iteratively optimize the circuit parameters to transform the target velocity field into the SCWF and its corresponding discrete quantum state, enabling subsequent quantum simulation of fluid dynamics. Validations for one- and two-dimensional flow fields confirm the accuracy and robustness of our method, emphasizing its effectiveness in handling multiscale and multidimensional velocity fields. Our method is able to capture critical flow features like sources, sinks, and saddle points. Furthermore, it enables the generation of SCWFs for various vector fields, which can then be applied in quantum simulations through SCWF evolution.</description>

      <title>Quantum channel correction outperforming direct transmission</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.04661</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.04661v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Long-distance optical quantum channels are necessarily lossy, leading to errors in transmitted quantum information, entanglement degradation and, ultimately, poor protocol performance. Quantum states carrying information in the channel can be probabilistically amplified to compensate for loss, but are destroyed when amplification fails. Quantum correction of the channel itself is therefore required, but break-even performance -- where arbitrary states can be better transmitted through a corrected channel than an uncorrected one -- has so far remained out of reach. Here we perform distillation by heralded amplification to improve a noisy entanglement channel. We subsequently employ entanglement swapping to demonstrate that arbitrary quantum information transmission is unconditionally improved -- i.e. without relying on postselection or post-processing of data -- compared to the uncorrected channel. In this way, it represents realisation of a genuine quantum relay. Our channel correction for single-mode quantum states will find use in quantum repeater, communication and metrology applications.</description>

      <title>CHSH Bell Tests For Optical Hybrid Entanglement</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.04736</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.04736v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Optical hybrid entanglement can be created between two qubits, one encoded in a single photon and another one in coherent states with opposite phases. It opens the path to a variety of quantum technologies, such as heterogeneous quantum networks, merging continuous and discrete variable encoding, and enabling the transport and interconversion of information. However, reliable characterization of the nature of this entanglement is limited so far to full quantum state tomography. Here, we perform a thorough study of Clauser-Horne-Shimony-Holt (CHSH) Bell inequality tests, enabling practical verification of quantum correlations for optical hybrid entanglement. We show that a practical violation of this inequality is possible with simple photon number on/off measurements if detection efficiencies stay above 82%. Another approach, based on photon-number parity measurements, requires 94% efficiency but works well in the limit of higher photon populations. Both tests use no postselection of the measurement outcomes and they are free of the fair-sampling hypothesis. Our proposal paves the way to performing loophole-free tests using feasible experimental tasks such as coherent state interference and photon counting, and to verification of hybrid entanglement in real-world applications.</description>

      <title>Solving the Zeh problem about the density operator with higher-order statistics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.04774</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.04774v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Since a 1932 work from von Neumann, it is generally considered that if two statistical mixtures are represented by the same density operator \r{ho}, they should in fact be considered as the same mixture. In a 1970 paper, Zeh, considering this result to be a consequence of what he called the measurement axiom, introduced a thought experiment with neutron spins and showed that in that experiment the density operator could not tell the whole story. Since then, no consensus has emerged yet, and controversies on the subject still presently develop. In this paper, stimulated by our previous works in the field of Quantum Information Processing, we show that the two mixtures imagined by Zeh, with the same \r{ho}, should however be distinguished. We show that this result suppresses a restriction unduly installed on statistical mixtures, but does not affect the general use of \r{ho}, e.g. in quantum statistical mechanics, and the von Neumann entropy keeps its own interest and even helps clarifying this confusing consequence of the measurement axiom. In order to avoid any ambiguity, the identification of the introduction of this postulate, which von Neumann rather suggested to be a general property, is given in an appendix where it is shown that Zeh was right when he spoke of a measurement axiom and identified his problem. The use and content of a density operator is also discussed in another physical case which we are led to call the Landau-Feynman situation, and which implies the concept of entanglement rather than the one of mixed states.</description>

      <title>Efficient Fault-Tolerant Single Qubit Gate Approximation And Universal Quantum Computation Without Using The Solovay-Kitaev Theorem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.04846</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.04846v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Arbitrarily accurate fault-tolerant (FT) universal quantum computation can be carried out using the Clifford gates Z, S, CNOT plus the non-Clifford T gate. Moreover, a recent improvement of the Solovay-Kitaev theorem by Kuperberg implies that to approximate any single-qubit gate to an accuracy of $\epsilon &gt; 0$ requires $\text{O}(\log^c[1/\epsilon])$ quantum gates with $c &gt; 1.44042$. Can one do better? That was the question asked by Nielsen and Chuang in their quantum computation textbook. Specifically, they posted a challenge to efficiently approximate single-qubit gate, fault-tolerantly or otherwise, using $\Omega(\log[1/\epsilon])$ gates chosen from a finite set. Here I give a partial answer to this question by showing that this is possible using $\text{O}(\log[1/\epsilon] \log\log[1/\epsilon] \log\log\log[1/\epsilon] \cdots)$ FT gates chosen from a finite set depending on the value of $\epsilon$. The key idea is to construct an approximation of any phase gate in a FT way by recursion to any given accuracy $\epsilon &gt; 0$. This method is straightforward to implement, easy to understand, and interestingly does not involve the Solovay-Kitaev theorem.</description>

      <title>Dispersive Qubit Readout with Intrinsic Resonator Reset</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.04891</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.04891v2 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A key challenge in quantum computing is speeding up measurement and initialization. Here, we experimentally demonstrate a dispersive measurement method for superconducting qubits that simultaneously measures the qubit and returns the readout resonator to its initial state. The approach is based on universal analytical pulses and requires knowledge of the qubit and resonator parameters, but needs no direct optimization of the pulse shape, even when accounting for the nonlinearity of the system. Moreover, the method generalizes to measuring an arbitrary number of modes and states. For the qubit readout, we can drive the resonator to $\sim 10^2$ photons and back to $\sim 10^{-3}$ photons in less than $3 \kappa^{-1}$, while still achieving a $T_1$-limited assignment error below 1\%. We also present universal pulse shapes and experimental results for qutrit readout.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.04909v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: High-dimensional encodings based on temporal modes (TMs) of photonic quantum states provide the foundations for a highly versatile and efficient quantum information science (QIS) framework. Here, we demonstrate a crucial building block for any QIS applications based on TMs: a programmable source of maximally entangled high-dimensional TM states. Our source is based on a parametric down-conversion process driven by a spectrally shaped pump pulse, which facilitates the generation of maximally entangled TM states with a well-defined dimensionality that can be chosen programmatically. We characterize the effective dimensionality of the generated states via measurements of second-order correlation functions and joint spectral intensities, demonstrating the generation of bi-photon TM states with a controlled dimensionality in up to 20 dimensions.</description>

      <title>Disentangling Quantum Classifiers: Simplex Edge Mapping for Few-Sample Confidence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.04944</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.04944v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum machine learning aims to use quantum computers to enhance machine learning, but it is often limited by the required number of samples due to quantum noise and statistical limits on expectation value estimates. While efforts are made to reduce quantum noise, less attention is given to boosting the confidence of Variational Quantum Classifiers (VQCs) and reducing their sampling needs. This paper focuses on multiclass classification, introducing a parameter-free post-processing technique that treats circuit outputs as edges of an n-dimensional simplex, representing independent binary decisions between each pair of classes. We prove and show in our experiments that this method improves few-sample accuracy by a factor of two by disentangling the wire outputs and compelling the VQC to avoid uncertain outputs. We describe this method and provide comparisons of accuracy, confidence, and entanglement, advocating for few-sample accuracy as a primary goal for effective VQCs.</description>

      <title>Characterizing Biphoton Spatial Wave Function Dynamics with Quantum Wavefront Sensing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.04973</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.04973v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: With an extremely high dimensionality, the spatial degree of freedom of entangled photons is a key tool for quantum foundation and applied quantum techniques. To fully utilize the feature, the essential task is to experimentally characterize the multiphoton spatial wave function including the entangled amplitude and phase information at different evolutionary stages. However, there is no effective method to measure it. Quantum state tomography is costly, and quantum holography requires additional references. Here we introduce quantum Shack-Hartmann wavefront sensing to perform efficient and reference-free measurement of the biphoton spatial wave function. The joint probability distribution of photon pairs at the back focal plane of a microlens array is measured and used for amplitude extraction and phase reconstruction. In the experiment, we observe that the biphoton amplitude correlation becomes weak while phase correlation shows up during free-space propagation. Our work is a crucial step in quantum physical and adaptive optics and paves the way for characterizing quantum optical fields with high-order correlations or topological patterns.</description>

      <title>Self-testing in the compiled setting via tilted-CHSH inequalities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.04986</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.04986v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In a Bell scenario, a classical verifier interacts with two non-communicating provers, producing a correlation. Certain correlations allow the verifier to certify, or self-test, the underlying quantum state and measurements. Notably, the family of tilted-CHSH inequalities has been used to self-test any two-qubit state. Self-tests underpin numerous device-independent protocols, however, a significant drawback of such applications is the non-communicating assumption. To address the non-communication assumption Kalai et al. (STOC'23) give a procedure which compiles a bipartite Bell scenario into a 2-round interaction between a verifier and a single computationally bounded prover. In this work, we formalize self-testing for compiled Bell scenarios. We prove the maximal quantum value is preserved under compilation for the family of tilted-CHSH inequalities, and that any maximal violation constitutes a compiled self-test. More specifically, we establish the existence of an efficient isometry recovering the state and measurements in the second round.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.05007v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent progresses in Josephson-junction-based superconducting circuits have propelled quantum information processing forward. However, the lack of a metastable state in most superconducting artificial atoms hinders the development of photonic quantum memory in this platform. Here, we use a single superconducting qubit-resonator system to realize a desired $\Lambda$-type artificial atom, and to demonstrate slow light with a group velocity of 3.6 km/s and the microwave storage with a memory time extending to several hundred nanoseconds via electromagnetically induced transparency. Our results highlight the potential of achieving microwave quantum memory, promising substantial advancements in quantum information processing within superconducting circuits.</description>

      <title>Quantum Alternating Operator Ansatz for the Preparation and Detection of Long-Lived Singlet States in NMR</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.05015</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.05015v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Designing efficient and robust quantum control strategies is vital for developing quantum technologies. One recent strategy is the Quantum Alternating Operator Ansatz (QAOA) sequence that alternatively propagates under two noncommuting Hamiltonians, whose control parameters can be optimized to generate a gate or prepare a state. Here, we describe the design of the QAOA sequence and their variants to prepare long-lived singlet states (LLS) from the thermal state in NMR. With extraordinarily long lifetimes exceeding the spin-lattice relaxation time constant $T_1$, LLS have been of great interest for various applications, from spectroscopy to medical imaging. Accordingly, designing sequences for efficiently preparing LLS in a general spin system is crucial. Using numerical analysis, we study the efficiency and robustness of the QAOA sequences over a wide range of errors in the control parameters. Using a two-qubit NMR register, we conduct an experimental study to benchmark QAOA sequences against other prominent methods of LLS preparation and observe the significantly superior performance of the QAOA sequences.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.05030v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Generic open quantum systems are notoriously difficult to simulate unless one looks at specific regimes. In contrast, classical dissipative systems can often be effectively described by stochastic processes, which are generally less computationally expensive. Here, we use the paradigmatic case of a dissipative quantum oscillator to give a pedagogic introduction into the modelling of open quantum systems using quasiclassical methods, i.e. classical stochastic methods that use a 'quantum' noise spectrum to capture the influence of the environment on the system. Such quasiclassical methods have the potential to offer insights into the impact of the quantum nature of the environment on the dynamics of the system of interest whilst still being computationally tractable.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.04362v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A study of the spin 1 Unruh-De Witt detectors interacting with a relativistic scalar quantum field is presented. After tracing out the field modes, the resulting density matrix for a bipartite qutrit system is employed to investigate the violation of the Bell-CHSH inequality. Unlike the case of spin $1/2$, for which the effects of the quantum field result in a decreasing of the size of violation, in the case of spin $1$ both decreasing and increasing of the violation may occur. This effect is ascribed to the fact that Tsirelson's bound is not saturated in the case of qutrits.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.04402v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In the past years, it was shown that entanglement and Bell nonlocality, which are key concepts in Quantum Mechanics, can be probed in high-energy colliders, via processes of fundamental particle scattering. Recently, it has been shown that spin correlations can be measured in pairs of bottom quarks at the LHC. Given the low mass of the bottom quark compared to typical scattering processes at the LHC, many of the bottom-quark pairs are in the ultrarelativistic regime, where they can exhibit strong spin entanglement. We find that entanglement of bottom-quark pairs may be measurable even with Run 2 data, especially with the CMS $B$ parking dataset, while observation of Bell nonlocality may become feasible at the high-luminosity phase of the LHC.</description>

      <title>Ultrafast Optical Control of Rashba Interactions in a TMDC Heterostructure</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.04454</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.04454v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate spin relaxation dynamics of interlayer excitons in a MoSe2/MoS2 heterostructure induced by the Rashba effect. In such a system, Rashba interactions arise from an out-of-plane electric field due to photo-generated interlayer excitons inducing a phonon-assisted intravalley spin relaxation. We develop a theoretical description based on a microscopic approach to quantify the magnitude of Rashba interactions and test these predictions via time-resolved Kerr rotation measurements. In agreement with the calculations, we find that the Rashba-induced intravalley spin mixing becomes the dominating spin relaxation channel above T = 50 K. Our work identifies a previously unexplored spin-depolarization channel in heterostructures which can be used for ultrafast spin manipulation.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.04684v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Understanding how out-of-equilibrium states thermalize under quantum unitary dynamics is an important problem in many-body physics. In this work, we propose a statistical ansatz for the matrix elements of non-equilibrium initial states in the energy eigenbasis. The approach is inspired by the Eigenstate Thermalisation Hypothesis (ETH) but the proposed ansatz exhibits different scaling. Importantly, exponentially small cross-correlations between the observable and the initial state matrix elements determine relaxation dynamics toward equilibrium. We numerically verify scaling and cross-correlation, point out the emergent universality of the high-frequency behavior, and outline possible generalizations.</description>

Abstract: A large spectrum of problems in classical physics and engineering, such as turbulence, is governed by nonlinear differential equations, which typically require high-performance computing to be solved. Over the past decade, however, the growth of classical computing power has slowed down because the miniaturisation of chips has been approaching the atomic scale. This is marking an end to Moore's law, which calls for a new computing paradigm: Quantum computing is a prime candidate. In this paper, we offer a perspective on the current challenges that need to be overcome in order to use quantum computing for the simulation of nonlinear dynamics. We review and discuss progress in the development of both quantum algorithms for nonlinear equations and quantum hardware. We propose pairings between quantum algorithms for nonlinear equations and quantum hardware concepts. These avenues open new opportunities for the simulation of nonlinear systems and turbulence.</description>

      <title>Unraveling-induced entanglement phase transition in diffusive trajectories of continuously monitored noninteracting fermionic systems</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.04869v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The competition between unitary quantum dynamics and dissipative stochastic effects, as emerging from continuous-monitoring processes, can culminate in measurement-induced phase transitions. Here, a many-body system abruptly passes, when exceeding a critical measurement rate, from a highly entangled phase to a low-entanglement one. We consider a different perspective on entanglement phase transitions and explore whether these can emerge when the measurement process itself is modified, while keeping the measurement rate fixed. To illustrate this idea, we consider a noninteracting fermionic system and focus on diffusive detection processes. Through extensive numerical simulations, we show that, upon varying a suitable \textit{unraveling parameter} -- interpolating between measurements of different quadrature operators -- the system displays a transition from a phase with area-law entanglement to one where entanglement scales logarithmically with the system size. Our findings may be relevant for tailoring quantum correlations in noisy quantum devices and for conceiving optimal classical simulation strategies.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.04895v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Cellular automata (CA) exemplify systems where simple local interaction rules can lead to intricate and complex emergent phenomena at large scales. The various types of dynamical behavior of CA are usually categorized empirically into Wolfram's complexity classes. Here, we propose a quantitative measure, rooted in quantum information theory, to categorize the complexity of classical deterministic cellular automata. Specifically, we construct a Matrix Product Operator (MPO) of the transition matrix on the space of all possible CA configurations. We find that the growth of entropy of the singular value spectrum of the MPO reveals the complexity of the CA and can be used to characterize its dynamical behavior. This measure defines the concept of operator entanglement entropy for CA, demonstrating that quantum information measures can be meaningfully applied to classical deterministic systems.</description>

Abstract: In accordance with recent progress of fracton topological phases, unusual topological phases of matter hosting fractionalized quasiparticle excitations with mobility constraints, new type of symmetry is studied -- multipole symmetry, associated with conservation of multipoles. Based on algebraic relation between dipole and global charges, we introduce a series of $(d+1)$-dimensional BF theories with $p$-form gauge fields, which admit dipole of spatially extended excitations, and study their physical properties. We elucidate that gauge invariant loops have unusual form, containing linear function of the spatial coordinate, which leads to the position dependent braiding statistics and unusual ground state degeneracy dependence on the system size. We also show that the theories exhibit a mixed 't Hooft anomaly between $p$-form and $(d-p)$-form dipole symmetries, which is canceled by an invertible theory defined in one dimensional higher via anomaly inflow mechanism.</description>

      <title>Quantum hardware demonstrations of relativistic calculations of molecular electric dipole moments: from light to heavy systems using Variational Quantum Eigensolver</title>

Abstract: The quantum-classical hybrid Variational Quantum Eigensolver (VQE) algorithm is recognized to be the method of choice to obtain ground state energies of quantum many-body systems in the noisy intermediate scale quantum (NISQ) era. This study not only extends the VQE algorithm to the relativistic regime, but also calculates a property other than energy, namely the molecular permanent electric dipole moment (PDM). We carry out 18-qubit quantum simulations to obtain ground state energies as well as PDMs of single-valence diatomic molecules, ranging from the light BeH to the heavy radioactive RaH molecule. We investigate the correlation trends in these systems as well as access the precision in our results. Furthermore, we measure the PDM of the moderately heavy SrH and SrF molecules on the optimized unitary coupled cluster state, using the state-of-the-art IonQ Aria-I quantum computer in an active space of 6 qubits. The associated quantum circuits for these computations were extensively optimized in view of limitations imposed by NISQ hardware. To that end, we employ an array of techniques, including the use of point group symmetries, integrating ZX-Calculus into our pipeline-based circuit optimization, and energy sort VQE procedure. Through these methods, we compress our 6-qubit quantum circuit from 280 two-qubit gates to 37 two-qubit gates (with a marginal trade-off of 0.33 and 0.31 percent in the PDM for SrH and SrF in their respective 6-spin orbital active spaces). We anticipate that our proof-of-concept demonstration lays the groundwork for future quantum hardware calculations involving heavy atoms and molecules.</description>

      <title>Determination of All Unknown Pure Quantum States with Two Observables</title>

Abstract: Efficiently extracting information from pure quantum states using minimal observables on the main system is a longstanding and fundamental issue in quantum information theory. Despite the inability of probability distributions of position and momentum to uniquely specify a wavefunction, Peres conjectured a discrete version wherein two complementary observables, analogous to position and momentum and realized as projective measurements onto orthogonal bases, can determine all pure qudits up to a finite set of ambiguities. Subsequent findings revealed the impossibility of uniquely determining $d$-dimenisonal pure states even when neglecting a measure-zero set with any two orthogonal bases, and Peres's conjecture is also correct for $d=3$ but not for $d=4$. In this study, we show that two orthogonal bases are capable of effectively filtering up to $2^{d-1}$ finite candidates by disregarding a measure-zero set, without involving complex numbers in the bases' coefficients. Additionally, drawing inspiration from sequential measurements to directly calculate the target coefficients of the wavefunction using two complementary observables, we show that almost all pure qudits can be uniquely determined by adaptively incorporating a POVM in the middle, followed by measuring the complementary observable.</description>

      <title>Unbalanced penalization: A new approach to encode inequality constraints of combinatorial problems for quantum optimization algorithms</title>

      <description>arXiv:2211.13914v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Solving combinatorial optimization problems of the kind that can be codified by quadratic unconstrained binary optimization (QUBO) is a promising application of quantum computation. Some problems of this class suitable for practical applications such as the traveling salesman problem (TSP), the bin packing problem (BPP), or the knapsack problem (KP) have inequality constraints that require a particular cost function encoding. The common approach is the use of slack variables to represent the inequality constraints in the cost function. However, the use of slack variables considerably increases the number of qubits and operations required to solve these problems using quantum devices. In this work, we present an alternative method that does not require extra slack variables and consists of using an unbalanced penalization function to represent the inequality constraints in the QUBO. This function is characterized by larger penalization when the inequality constraint is not achieved than when it is. We evaluate our approach on the TSP, BPP, and KP, successfully encoding the optimal solution of the original optimization problem near the ground state cost Hamiltonian. Additionally, we employ D-Wave Advantage and D-Wave hybrid solvers to solve the BPP, surpassing the performance of the slack variables approach by achieving solutions for up to 29 items, whereas the slack variables approach only handles up to 11 items. This new approach can be used to solve combinatorial problems with inequality constraints with a reduced number of resources compared to the slack variables approach using quantum annealing or variational quantum algorithms.</description>

      <title>On Groups in the Qubit Clifford Hierarchy</title>

      <description>arXiv:2212.05398v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Here we study the unitary groups that can be constructed using elements from the qubit Clifford Hierarchy. We first provide a necessary and sufficient canonical form that semi-Clifford and generalized semi-Clifford elements must satisfy to be in the Clifford Hierarchy. Then we classify the groups that can be formed from such elements. Up to Clifford conjugation, we classify all such groups that can be constructed using generalized semi-Clifford elements in the Clifford Hierarchy. We discuss a possible minor exception to this classification in the appendix. This may not be a full classification of all groups in the qubit Clifford Hierarchy as it is not currently known if all elements in the Clifford Hierarchy must be generalized semi-Clifford. In addition to the diagonal gate groups found by Cui et al., we show that many non-isomorphic (to the diagonal gate groups) generalized symmetric groups are also contained in the Clifford Hierarchy. Finally, as an application of this classification, we examine restrictions on transversal gates given by the structure of the groups enumerated herein which may be of independent interest.</description>

      <title>Noise level of a ring laser gyroscope in the femto-rad/s range</title>

      <description>arXiv:2301.01386v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Absolute angular rotation rate measurements with sensitivity better than prad/s would be beneficial for fundamental science investigations. On this regard, large frame Earth based ring laser gyroscopes are top instrumentation as far as bandwidth, long--term operation, and sensitivity are concerned. Here, we demonstrate that the GINGERINO active--ring laser upper limiting noise is close to $2 \times 10^{-15}$ rad/s for $\sim 2 \times 10^5$ s of integration time, as estimated by the Allan deviation evaluated in a differential measurement scheme. This is more than a factor 10 better than the theoretical prediction so far accounted for ideal ring lasers shot--noise with the two beams counter--propagating inside the cavity considered as two independent propagating modes. This feature is related to the peculiarity of real ring laser system dynamics that causes phase cross--talking among the two counter--propagating modes. In this context, the independent beam model is, then, not applicable and the measured noise limit falls below the expected one.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2301.13544v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: There is a current interest in quantum thermodynamics in the context of open quantum systems. An important issue is the consistency of quantum thermodynamics, in particular the second law of thermodynamics, i.e., the flow of heat from a hot reservoir to a cold reservoir. Here recent emphasis has been on composite system and in particular the issue regarding the application of local or global master equations. In order to contribute to this discussion we discuss two cases, namely as an example a single qubit and as a simple composite system two coupled qubits driven by two heat reservoirs at different temperatures, respectively. Applying a global Lindblad master equation approach we present explicit expressions for the heat currents in agreement with the second law of thermodynamics. The analysis is carried out in the Born-Markov approximation. We also discuss issues regarding the possible presence of coherences in the steady state.</description>

      <title>Proposal of ensemble qubits with two-atom decay</title>

      <description>arXiv:2302.06781v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We propose and analyze a novel approach to implement ensemble qubits. The required anharmonicity is provided by a simultaneous decay of two atoms (i.e., two-atom decay), which is achieved by fully quantum degenerate parametric amplification. For an atomic ensemble, the two-atom decay generates and stabilizes a 2D quantum manifold, which is spanned by the ground and single-excited superradiant states. Moreover, this nonlinear decay process can strongly suppress transitions to higher-excited superradiant states, and convert residual transitions into an effective decay from the single-excitation superradiant state to the ground state. Our method does not require Rydberg dipole blockade and, thus, strong atom-atom interactions, compared to previous work. This indicates that it can be applied to typical atomic or spin ensembles in simple experimental setups. Remarkably, our idea is compatible with the cavity protection mechanism, and therefore spin dephasing due to inhomogeneous broadening can be strongly suppressed. The presented ensemble qubit provides a new platform for quantum information processing, and also extends the range of applications of atomic or spin ensembles.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2307.05200v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We show how to efficiently simulate pure quantum states in one dimensional systems that have both finite energy density and vanishingly small energy fluctuations. We do so by studying the performance of a tensor network algorithm that produces matrix product states whose energy variance decreases as the bond dimension increases. Our results imply that variances as small as $\propto 1/\log N$ can be achieved with polynomial bond dimension. With this, we prove that there exist states with a very narrow support in the bulk of the spectrum that still have moderate entanglement entropy, in contrast with typical eigenstates that display a volume law. Our main technical tool is the Berry-Esseen theorem for spin systems, a strengthening of the central limit theorem for the energy distribution of product states. We also give a simpler proof of that theorem, together with slight improvements in the error scaling, which should be of independent interest.</description>

Abstract: Quantum state tomography of weak microwave signals is an important part of many protocols in the field of quantum information processing with superconducting circuits. This step typically relies on an accurate $\textit{in-situ}$ estimation of signal losses in the experimental set-up and requires a careful photon number calibration. Here, we present an improved method for the microwave loss estimation inside of a closed cryogenic system. Our approach is based on Planck's law and makes use of independent temperature sweeps of individual parts of the cryogenic set-up. Using this technique, we can experimentally resolve changes in microwave losses of less than 0.1 dB in the cryogenic environment. We discuss potential applications of this approach for precise characterization of quantum-limited superconducting amplifiers and in other prominent experimental settings.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2308.09168v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Noiseless measurement of a single quadrature in systems of parametrically coupled oscillators is theoretically possible by pumping at the sum and difference frequencies of the two oscillators, realizing a backaction-evading (BAE) scheme. Although this would hold true in the simplest scenario for a system with pure three-wave mixing, implementations of this scheme are hindered by unwanted higher-order parametric processes that destabilize the system and add noise. We show analytically that detuning the two pumps from the sum and difference frequencies can stabilize the system and fully recover the BAE performance, enabling operation at otherwise inaccessible cooperativities. We also show that the acceleration demonstrated in a weak signal detection experiment [PRX QUANTUM 4, 020302 (2023)] was only achievable because of this detuning technique.</description>

Abstract: A quantum-enhanced experiment, in which information is transduced from a system of interest and processed on a quantum computer, has the possibility of exponential advantage in sampling tasks over a traditional experiment, where only the measurement outcomes of projective or weak measurements are stored on a classical computer. In this work, we demonstrate that, similar to the measurement induced phase transition~(MIPT) occurring in traditional experiments, quantum-enhanced experiments can also show entanglement phase transitions. We introduce a noisy transduction operation which replaces projective measurements and acts independently on two qubits, recording the quantum state of one qubit in the measurement apparatus, while erasing the quantum state of the other qubit with the environment. We then construct a random brickwork circuit which shows an entanglement transition tuned by the rate of noisy transduction operations. Below the critical rate of noisy transduction, an extensive amount of entanglement is generated between regions of the system and apparatus, while above the critical rate, entanglement satisfies area law scaling. Our work delineates the prerequisites for quantum-enhanced experiments to manifest entanglement transitions, thereby establishing a foundational framework that connects quantum-enhanced sensing with emergent entanglement phenomena.</description>

Abstract: Lattice Gas Cellular Automata (LGCA) is a classical numerical method widely known and applied to simulate several physical phenomena. Among these phenomena, we find fluid flows described by the Navier-Stokes equations. We develop a quantum algorithm that allows for the simulation of fluid dynamic LGCA on a quantum computer. Furthermore, we prove the conservation of the quantities of interest, but finding more quantum invariants than expected. Finally, we develop a phase estimation procedure for detecting quantities of interest such as mass and momentum, avoiding reinitialization of the cell. In addition, we discuss a sublinear encoding of the lattice which admits a unitary streaming but constrains the collision step.</description>

Abstract: The interaction of light and matter at the single-photon level is of central importance in various fields of physics, including, e.g., condensed matter physics, astronomy, quantum optics, and quantum information. Amplification of such quantum light-matter interaction can be highly beneficial to, e.g., improve device performance, explore novel phenomena, and understand fundamental physics, and has therefore been a long-standing goal. Furthermore, simulation of light-matter interaction in the regime of ultrastrong coupling, where the interaction strength is comparable to the bare frequencies of the uncoupled systems, has also become a hot research topic, and considerable progress has been made both theoretically and experimentally in the past decade. In this review, we provide a detailed introduction of recent advances in amplification of quantum light-matter interaction and simulation of ultrastrong light-matter interaction, particularly in cavity and circuit quantum electrodynamics and in cavity optomechanics.</description>

Abstract: Open quantum systems undergo decoherence, which is responsible for the transition from quantum to classical behavior. The time scale in which decoherence takes place can be analyzed using upper limits to its rate. We examine the dynamics of open chaotic quantum systems governed by random Lindblad operators sourced from Gaussian and Ginibre ensembles with Wigner-Dyson symmetry classes. In these systems, the ensemble-averaged purity decays monotonically as a function of time. This decay is governed by the decoherence rate, which is upper-bounded by the dimension of their Hilbert space and is independent of the ensemble symmetry. These findings hold upon mixing different ensembles, indicating the universal character of the decoherence rate limit. Moreover, our findings reveal that open chaotic quantum systems governed by random Lindbladians tend to exhibit the most rapid decoherence, regardless of the initial state. This phenomenon is associated with the concentration of the decoherence rate near its upper bound. Our work identifies primary features of decoherence in dissipative quantum chaos, with applications ranging from quantum foundations to high-energy physics and quantum technologies.</description>

      <title>Saturability of the Quantum Cram\'{e}r-Rao Bound in Multiparameter Quantum Estimation at the Single-Copy Level</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.11567</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.11567v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The quantum Cram\'{e}r-Rao bound (QCRB) as the ultimate lower bound for precision in quantum parameter estimation is only known to be saturable in the multiparameter setting in special cases and under conditions such as full or average commutavity of the symmetric logarithmic derivatives (SLDs) associated with the parameters. Moreover, for general mixed states, collective measurements over infinitely many identical copies of the quantum state are generally required to attain the QCRB. In the important and experimentally relevant single-copy scenario, a necessary condition for saturating the QCRB in the multiparameter setting for general mixed states is the so-called partial commutativity condition on the SLDs. However, it is not known if this condition is also sufficient. This paper establishes necessary and sufficient conditions for saturability of the multiparameter QCRB in the single-copy setting in terms of the commutativity of a set of projected SLDs and the existence of a unitary solution to a system of nonlinear partial differential equations. New necessary conditions that imply partial commutativity are also obtained, which together with another condition become sufficient. Moreover, when the sufficient conditions are satisfied an optimal measurement saturating the QCRB can be chosen to be projective and explicitly characterized. An example is developed to illustrate the case of a multiparameter quantum state where the conditions derived herein are satisfied and can be explicitly verified.</description>

Abstract: In this work we investigate the conditions for quantum back action to result in a phase transition in the information dynamics of a monitored system. We introduce a framework that captures a wide range of experiments encompassing probes comprised of projective measurements and probes which more generally transfer quantum information from the system to a quantum computer. Our framework explicitly uses a model of unitary evolution which couples system, apparatus and environment. Information dynamics is investigated using the R\'enyi and von-Neumann entropies of the evolving state, and we construct a replica theory for them. We identify the possible replica symmetries an experiment can possess and discuss their spontaneous symmetry breaking. In particular, we identify a minimum subgroup whose spontaneous symmetry breaking results in an entanglement transition. This symmetry is only possible when the information in the apparatus is as informative about the dynamics of the system as the information transferred to the environment. We call this requirement the information exchange symmetry and quantify it by a relationship between the entropies. We then show how the entanglement transition can be understood as the spontaneously breaking of the information exchange symmetry and without referring to the replica theory. Information exchange symmetry breaking is then shown to generalize the phenomenology of the measurement-induced phase transition (MIPT). We apply this theory to the brickwork quantum-enhanced experiment introduced in an accompanying Letter [1] in the case where the unitaries are chosen from the Haar measure, and identify a distinct universality from the MIPT. This notion of information exchange symmetry breaking generalizes the MIPT, and provides a framework for understanding the dynamics of quantum information in quantum-enhanced experiments.</description>

Abstract: Polariton condensates occur away from thermal equilibrium, in an open system where heat and particles are continually exchanged with reservoirs. These phenomena have been extensively analyzed in terms of kinetic equations. Based on the collection of knowledge about polariton kinetics provided by these simulations and by experimental works, we constructed a few-level model that captures the main processes involved in the buildup of a ground-state population of polaritons. This allows condensation to be understood as the output of a thermal machine and exposes the thermodynamic constraints on its occurrence. The model consists of a three-level system interacting with a field and connected to a hot and a cold thermal reservoir that represent a non-resonant pump and the lattice phonons. This subsystem can drive a condensate, through polariton-polariton scattering, which produces work in the form of coherent light emission from the microcavity. We obtain a phase diagram as a function of the temperatures of the two baths and investigate the possible types of phase transition that lead to the condensate phase.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.11444v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present a comprehensive analysis of fidelity decay and error accumulation in faulty quantum circuit models. Our work devises an analytical bound for the average fidelity between desired and faulty output states, accounting for errors that may arise during the implementation of two-qubit gates and multi-qubit permutations. It is shown that fidelity decays exponentially with both circuit depth and the number of qubits raised to an architecture-dependent power, and determine the decay rates as a function of the two types of errors. Furthermore, we establish a robust linear relationship between fidelity and the heavy output frequency used in Quantum Volume tests to benchmark quantum processors, under the considered errors protocol. These findings pave the way for predicting the behavior of fidelity in the presence of specific errors and offer insights into the best strategies for increasing Quantum Volume.</description>

      <title>Single-Atom Verification of the Optimal Trade-Off between Speed and Cost in Shortcuts to Adiabaticity</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.15922v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The approach of shortcuts to adiabaticity enables the effective execution of adiabatic dynamics in quantum information processing with enhanced speed. Owing to the inherent trade-off between dynamical speed and the cost associated with the transitionless driving field, executing arbitrarily fast operations becomes impractical. To understand the accurate interplay between speed and energetic cost in this process, we propose theoretically and verify experimentally a new trade-off, which is characterized by a tightly optimized bound within $s$-parameterized phase spaces. Our experiment is carried out in a single ultracold $^{40}$Ca$^{+}$ ion trapped in a harmonic potential. By exactly operating the quantum states of the ion, we execute the Landau-Zener model as an example, where the quantum speed limit as well as the cost are governed by the spectral gap. We witness that our proposed trade-off is indeed tight in scenarios involving both initially eigenstates and initially thermal equilibrium states. Our work helps understanding the fundamental constraints in shortcuts to adiabaticity and illuminates the potential of under-utilized phase spaces that have been traditionally overlooked.</description>

      <title>Trapping polar molecules by surface acoustic waves</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.17879v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We propose a method to trap polar molecules with the electrical force induced by the surface acoustic wave (SAW) on piezoelectric materials. In this approach, the electrical force is perpendicular to the moving direction of the polar molecules, and is used to control the positions of trapped polar molecules in the direction orthogonal to the acoustic transmission. By virtue of an external electrical force, the SAW-induced electrical field can trap the polar molecules into single-layer or multi-layer lattices. The arrangement of molecules can affect the binding energy and localization of the molecule array. Then the one- or two-dimensional trapped polar molecule arrays can be used to construct the Bose-Hubbard (BH) model, whose energy and dynamics are affected by the localizations of the trapped molecules. We find that the phase transitions between the superfluid and Mott insulator based on trapped polar molecule BH model can be modulated by the SAW induced electrical potential.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.06324v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Motivated by a recent prediction [Com. Phys., 6, 195 (2023)] that time-of-flight experiments with ultracold atoms could test different interpretations of quantum mechanics, this work investigates the arrival times predicted by the stochastic interpretation, whereby quantum particles follow definite but non-deterministic and non-differentiable trajectories. The distribution of arrival times is obtained from a Fokker-Planck equation, and confirmed by direct simulation of trajectories. It is found to be in general different from the distribution predicted by the Bohmian interpretation, in which quantum particles follow definite deterministic and differentiable trajectories. This result suggests that trajectory-based interpretations of quantum mechanics could be experimentally discriminated.</description>

      <title>Towards a universal QAOA protocol: Evidence of a scaling advantage in solving some combinatorial optimization problems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.09169</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.09169v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The quantum approximate optimization algorithm (QAOA) is a promising algorithm for solving combinatorial optimization problems (COPs). In this algorithm, there are alternating layers consisting of a mixer and a problem Hamiltonian. Each layer $i=0,\ldots,p-1$ is parameterized by $\beta_i$ and $\gamma_i$. How to find these parameters has been an open question with the majority of the research focused on finding them using classical algorithms. In this work, we present evidence that fixed linear ramp schedules constitute a universal set of QAOA parameters, i.e., a set of $\gamma$ and $\beta$ parameters that rapidly approximate the optimal solution, $x^*$, independently of the COP selected, and that the success probability of finding it, $probability(x^*)$, increases with the number of QAOA layers $p$. We simulate linear ramp QAOA protocols (LR-QAOA) involving up to $N_q=42$ qubits and $p = 400$ layers on random instances of 9 different COPs. The results suggest that $probability(x^*) \approx 1/2^{(\eta N_q / p)}$ for a constant $\eta$. For example, when implementing LR-QAOA with $p=42$, the $probability(x^*)$ for 42-qubit Weighted MaxCut problems (W-MaxCut) increases from $2/2^{42}\approx 10^{-13}$ to an average of 0.13. We compare LR-QAOA, simulated annealing (SA), and branch-and-bound (B\&amp;B) finding a scaling improvement in LR-QAOA. We test LR-QAOA on real hardware using IonQ Aria, Quantinuum H2-1, IBM Brisbane, IBM Kyoto, and IBM Osaka, encoding random weighted MaxCut (W-MaxCut) problems from 5 to 109 qubits and $p=3$ to $100$. Even for the largest case, $N_q=109$ qubits and $p=100$, information about the LR-QAOA optimization protocol is present. The circuit involved requires 21200 CNOT gates. These results show that LR-QAOA effectively finds high-quality solutions for a large variety of COPs and suggest a scaling advantage of quantum computation for combinatorial optimization.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.14624v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The spin-boson model, involving spins interacting with a bath of quantum harmonic oscillators, is a widely used representation of open quantum systems. Trapped ions present a natural platform for simulating the quantum dynamics of such models, thanks to the presence of both high quality internal qubit states and the motional modes of the ions that can simulate the relevant quantum degrees of freedom. In our work, we extend the previous body of work that focused on coherent coupling of the spins and bosons to perform quantum simulations with structured dissipative baths using the motional states of trapped ions. We demonstrate the capability for adjusting the bath's temperature and continuous spectral density by adding randomness to fully programmable control parameters. Subsequently, we simulate the dynamics of various spin-boson models with noise spectral densities constructed from coupling to several dissipative harmonic oscillator modes. The experimental outcomes closely align with theoretical predictions, indicating successful simulation of open quantum systems using a trapped-ion system.</description>

      <title>Accommodating Fabrication Defects on Floquet Codes with Minimal Hardware Requirements</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.15854v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Floquet codes are an intriguing generalisation of stabiliser and subsystem codes, which can provide good fault-tolerant characteristics while benefiting from reduced connectivity requirements in hardware. A recent question of interest has been how to run Floquet codes on devices which have defective -- and therefore unusable -- qubits. This is an under-studied issue of crucial importance for running such codes on realistic hardware. To address this challenge, we introduce a new method of accommodating defective qubits on a wide range of two-dimensional Floquet codes, which requires no additional connectivity in the underlying quantum hardware, no modifications to the original Floquet code's measurement schedule, can accommodate boundaries, and is optimal in terms of the number of qubits and stabilisers removed. We numerically demonstrate that, using this method, the planar honeycomb code is fault tolerant up to a fabrication defect probability of $\approx 12\%$. We find the fault-tolerant performance of this code under defect noise is competitive with that of the surface code, despite its sparser connectivity. We finally propose multiple ways this approach can be adapted to the underlying hardware, through utilising any additional connectivity available, and treating defective auxiliary qubits separately to defective data qubits. Our work therefore serves as a guide for the implementation of Floquet codes in realistic quantum hardware.</description>

Abstract: We present an analytical and numerical study of a class of geometric phase induced by weak measurements. In particular, we analyze the dependence of the geometric phase on the winding ($W$) of the polar angle ($\varphi$), upon a sequence of $N$ weak measurements of increased magnitude ($c$), resulting in the appearance of a multiplicity of critical measurement-strength parameters where the geometric phase becomes stochastic. Adding to the novelty of our approach, we not only analyze the weak-measurement induced geometric phase by a full analytic derivation, valid in the quasicontinuous limit ($N \rightarrow \infty$), but also we analyze the induced geometric phase numerically, thus enabling us to unravel the finite-$N$ interplay of the geometric phase with the measurement strength parameter, and its stability to perturbations in the measurements protocol.</description>

      <title>Autoregressive Transformer Neural Network for Simulating Open Quantum Systems via a Probabilistic Formulation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2009.05580v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The theory of open quantum systems lays the foundations for a substantial part of modern research in quantum science and engineering. Rooted in the dimensionality of their extended Hilbert spaces, the high computational complexity of simulating open quantum systems calls for the development of strategies to approximate their dynamics. In this paper, we present an approach for tackling open quantum system dynamics. Using an exact probabilistic formulation of quantum physics based on positive operator-valued measure (POVM), we compactly represent quantum states with autoregressive transformer neural networks; such networks bring significant algorithmic flexibility due to efficient exact sampling and tractable density. We further introduce the concept of String States to partially restore the symmetry of the autoregressive transformer neural network and improve the description of local correlations. Efficient algorithms have been developed to simulate the dynamics of the Liouvillian superoperator using a forward-backward trapezoid method and find the steady state via a variational formulation. Our approach is benchmarked on prototypical one and two-dimensional systems, finding results which closely track the exact solution and achieve higher accuracy than alternative approaches based on using Markov chain Monte Carlo to sample restricted Boltzmann machines. Our work provides general methods for understanding quantum dynamics in various contexts, as well as techniques for solving high-dimensional probabilistic differential equations in classical setups.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2101.07243v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Symmetries such as gauge invariance and anyonic symmetry play a crucial role in quantum many-body physics. We develop a general approach to constructing gauge invariant or anyonic symmetric autoregressive neural network quantum states, including a wide range of architectures such as Transformer and recurrent neural network (RNN), for quantum lattice models. These networks can be efficiently sampled and explicitly obey gauge symmetries or anyonic constraint. We prove that our methods can provide exact representation for the ground and excited states of the 2D and 3D toric codes, and the X-cube fracton model. We variationally optimize our symmetry incorporated autoregressive neural networks for ground states as well as real-time dynamics for a variety of models. We simulate the dynamics and the ground states of the quantum link model of $\text{U(1)}$ lattice gauge theory, obtain the phase diagram for the 2D $\mathbb{Z}_2$ gauge theory, determine the phase transition and the central charge of the $\text{SU(2)}_3$ anyonic chain, and also compute the ground state energy of the SU(2) invariant Heisenberg spin chain. Our approach provides powerful tools for exploring condensed matter physics, high energy physics and quantum information science.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2209.02814v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Group-based cryptography is a relatively unexplored family in post-quantum cryptography, and the so-called Semidirect Discrete Logarithm Problem (SDLP) is one of its most central problems. However, the complexity of SDLP and its relationship to more well-known hardness problems, particularly with respect to its security against quantum adversaries, has not been well understood and was a significant open problem for researchers in this area. In this paper we give the first dedicated security analysis of SDLP. In particular, we provide a connection between SDLP and group actions, a context in which quantum subexponential algorithms are known to apply. We are therefore able to construct a subexponential quantum algorithm for solving SDLP, thereby classifying the complexity of SDLP and its relation to known computational problems.</description>

Abstract: We scan Paul K.

We take as our starting point what Feyerabend has actually written about quantum mechanics, but we extend our analysis to his general views on realism, objectivity, pluralism, and the relation between physics and philosophy, finding that these more general views could in fact offer many interesting insights for physicists and philosophers working on quantum foundations.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2301.06100v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Repeatedly-monitored quantum walks with a rate $1/\tau$ yield discrete-time trajectories which are inherently random. With these paths the first-hitting time with sharp restart is studied. We find an instability in the optimal mean hitting time, which is not found in the corresponding classical random walk process. This instability implies that a small change in parameters can lead to a rather large change of the optimal restart time. We show that the optimal restart time versus $\tau$, as a control parameter, exhibits sets of staircases and plunges. The plunges, are due to the mentioned instability, which in turn is related to the quantum oscillations of the first-hitting time probability, in the absence of restarts. Furthermore, we prove that there are only two patterns of staircase structures, dependent on the parity of the distance between the target and the source in units of lattice constant. The global minimum of the hitting time, is controlled not only by the restart time, as in classical problems, but also by the sampling time $\tau$. We provide numerical evidence that this global minimum occurs for the $\tau$ minimizing the mean hitting time, given restarts taking place after each measurement. Last but not least, we numerically show that the instability found in this work is relatively robust against stochastic perturbations in the sampling time $\tau$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2303.05647v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the properties of a two-dimensional non-relativistic electron gas (TDEG) constrained on wires along a M\"{o}bius strip. We considered wires around the strip and along the transverse direction, across the width of the strip. For each direction, we investigate how the curvature modifies the electronic states and their corresponding energy spectrum. At the center of the strip, the wires around the surface form quantum rings whose spectrum depends on the strip radius $a$. For wires at the edge of the strip, the inner edge turns into the outer edge. Accordingly, the curvature yields localized states in the middle of the wire. Along the strip width, the effective potential exhibits a parity symmetry breaking leading to the localization of the bound state on one side of the strip.</description>

      <title>A Bregman Proximal Perspective on Classical and Quantum Blahut-Arimoto Algorithms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.04492</link>
      <description>arXiv:2306.04492v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The Blahut-Arimoto algorithm is a well-known method to compute classical channel capacities and rate-distortion functions. Recent works have extended this algorithm to compute various quantum analogs of these quantities. In this paper, we show how these Blahut-Arimoto algorithms are special instances of mirror descent, which is a type of Bregman proximal method, and a well-studied generalization of gradient descent for constrained convex optimization. Using recently developed convex analysis tools, we show how analysis based on relative smoothness and strong convexity recovers known sublinear and linear convergence rates for Blahut-Arimoto algorithms. This Bregman proximal viewpoint allows us to derive related algorithms with similar convergence guarantees to solve problems in information theory for which Blahut-Arimoto-type algorithms are not directly applicable. We apply this framework to compute energy-constrained classical and quantum channel capacities, classical and quantum rate-distortion functions, and approximations of the relative entropy of entanglement, all with provable convergence guarantees.</description>

      <title>Subsystem symmetries, critical Bose surface, and immobile excitations in an extended compass model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.08300</link>
      <description>arXiv:2309.08300v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We propose an extended compass model that hosts subsystem symmetries and has potential experimental relevance with 3d transition metal compounds. The subsystem symmetries strongly constrain the mobility of spin excitations and lead to profound consequences. At the quantum critical point we find the presence of "critical Bose surface" along the entire $k_x$ and $k_y$ axis. Across which we find a nodal-line spin liquid that undergoes nematic instability at low temperatures. In the ferro-quadrupole phase, we find that one excitation is immobile individually analogous to "fractons".</description>

      <title>Floquet engineering of binding in doped and photo-doped Mott insulators</title>

      <description>arXiv:2311.04899v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate the emergence of bound states in chemically and photo-doped Mott insulators, mediated by spin and $\eta$-pairing fluctuations within both 2-leg ladder and 2D systems. To effectively describe the photo and chemically doped state on the same footings, we employ the Schrieffer-Wolff transformation, resulting in a generalized $t$-$J$ model. Our results demonstrate that the binding energies and localization length in the chemically and photo-doped regimes are comparable, with $\eta$-pairing fluctuations not playing a crucial role. Furthermore, we show that manipulating the binding is possible through external periodic driving, a technique known as Floquet engineering, leading to significantly enhanced binding energies. We also roughly estimate the lifetime of photo-doped states under periodic driving conditions based on the Fermi golden rule. Lastly, we propose experimental protocols for realizing Hubbard excitons in cold-atom experiments.</description>

      <title>Quantum-to-classical crossover in the spin glass dynamics of cavity QED simulators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.05682</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.05682v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: By solving the quench dynamics of a frustrated many-body spin-boson problem, we investigate the role of spin size on the dynamical formation of spin glass order. In particular, we observe that quantum and classical spin glasses exhibit markedly different evolution. The former displays a quick relaxation of magnetization together with an exponential dependence of the spin glass order parameter on spin size, while the latter has long-lasting prethermal magnetization and a spin glass order parameter independent of spin size. The quantum-to-classical crossover is sharp and occurs for relatively small spins, highlighting the fragility of the quantum regime. Furthermore, we show that spin glass order is resonantly enhanced when the frequency of the bosonic mediators of the interactions approaches the value of the transverse field. Our predictions are relevant for all spin glass systems with $SU(2)$ degrees of freedom away from equilibrium, and can be examined in recently developed multi-mode cavity QED experiments.</description>

      <title>Optimizing Fictitious States for Bell Inequality Violation in Bipartite Qubit Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.09166</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.09166v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: There is a significant interest in testing quantum entanglement and Bell inequality violation in high-energy experiments. Since the analyses in high-energy experiments are performed with events statistically averaged over phase space, the states used to determine observables depend on the choice of coordinates through an event-dependent basis and are thus not genuine quantum states, but rather "fictitious states." We prove that if Bell inequality violation is observed with a fictitious state, then it implies the same for a quantum sub-state. We further show analytically that the basis which diagonalizes the spin-spin correlations is optimal for constructing fictitious states, and for maximizing the violation of Bell's inequality.</description>

      <title>Far from equilibrium field theory for strongly coupled light and matter: dynamics of frustrated multi-mode cavity QED</title>

      <description>arXiv:2312.11624v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Light-matter interfaces have now entered a new stage marked by the ability to engineer quantum correlated states under driven-dissipative conditions. To propel this new generation of experiments, we are confronted with the need to model non-unitary many-body dynamics in strongly coupled regimes, by transcending traditional approaches in quantum optics. In this work, we contribute to this program by adapting a functional integral technique, conventionally employed in high-energy physics, in order to obtain non-equilibrium dynamics for interacting light-matter systems. Our approach is grounded in constructing 'two-particle irreducible' (2PI) effective actions, which provide a non-perturbative and conserving framework for describing quantum evolution at a polynomial cost in time. We apply our method to complement the analysis of spin glass formation in the context of frustrated multi-mode cavity quantum electrodynamics, initiated in our accompanying work [H. Hosseinabadi, D. Chang, J. Marino, arXiv:2311.05682]. Finally, we outline the capability of the technique to describe other near-term platforms in many-body quantum optics, and its potential to make predictions for this new class of experiments.</description>

      <title>Krylov complexity of density matrix operators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.09522</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.09522v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Quantifying complexity in quantum systems has witnessed a surge of interest in recent years, with Krylov-based measures such as Krylov complexity ($C_K$) and Spread complexity ($C_S$) gaining prominence. In this study, we investigate their interplay by considering the complexity of states represented by density matrix operators. After setting up the problem, we analyze a handful of analytical and numerical examples spanning generic two-dimensional Hilbert spaces, qubit states, quantum harmonic oscillators, and random matrix theories, uncovering insightful relationships. For generic pure states, our analysis reveals two key findings: (I) a correspondence between moment-generating functions (of Lanczos coefficients) and survival amplitudes, and (II) an early-time equivalence between $C_K$ and $2C_S$. Furthermore, for maximally entangled pure states, we find that the moment-generating function of $C_K$ becomes the Spectral Form Factor and, at late-times, $C_K$ is simply related to $NC_S$ for $N\geq2$ within the $N$-dimensional Hilbert space. Notably, we confirm that $C_K = 2C_S$ holds across all times when $N=2$. Through the lens of random matrix theories, we also discuss deviations between complexities at intermediate times and highlight subtleties in the averaging approach at the level of the survival amplitude.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2402.10514v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We introduce a systematic method to spectrally design quasi-one-dimensional crystal models described by the Dirac equation in the low-energy regime. The method is based on the supersymmetric transformation applied to an initially known pseudo-spin-1/2 model. This allows extending the corresponding susy partner so that the new model describes a pseudo-spin-1 system. The spectral design allows the introduction of a flat-band and discrete energies at will into the new model. The results are illustrated in two examples where the Su-Schriefer-Heeger chain is locally converted into a stub lattice.</description>

      <title>Floquet SYK wormholes</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.08394v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the non-equilibrium dynamics of two coupled SYK models, conjectured to be holographically dual to an eternal traversable wormhole in AdS$_2$. We consider different periodic drivings of the parameters of the system. We analyze the energy flows in the wormhole and black hole phases of the model as a function of the driving frequency. Our numerical results show a series of resonant frequencies in which the energy absorption and heating are enhanced significantly and the transmission coefficients drop, signalling a closure of the wormhole. These frequencies correspond to part of the conformal tower of states and to the boundary graviton of the dual gravitational theory. Furthermore, we provide evidence supporting the existence of a hot wormhole phase between the black hole and wormhole phases. When driving the strength of the separate SYK terms we find that the transmission can be enhanced by suitably tuning the driving.</description>

      <title>Optimizing Off-Axis Fields for Two-Axis Magnetometry with Point Defects</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.09747</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.09747v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Vector magnetometry is an essential tool in characterizing the distribution of currents and magnetization in a broad range of systems. Point defect sensors, like the nitrogen vacancy (NV) center in diamond, have demonstrated impressive sensitivity and spatial resolution for detecting these fields. Measuring the vector field at a single point in space using single defects, however, remains an outstanding challenge. We demonstrate that careful optimization of the static bias field can enable simultaneous measurement of multiple magnetic field components with enhanced sensitivity by leveraging the nonlinear Zeeman shift from transverse magnetic fields. This work quantifies the trade-off between the increased frequency shift from second-order Zeeman effects with decreasing contrast as off-axis field components increase, demonstrating the measurement of multiple components of the magnetic field from an exemplar antiferromagnet with a complex magnetic texture.</description>

      <title>Neural Pfaffians: Solving Many Many-Electron Schr\"odinger Equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.14762</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.14762v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Neural wave functions accomplished unprecedented accuracies in approximating the ground state of many-electron systems, though at a high computational cost. Recent works proposed amortizing the cost by learning generalized wave functions across different structures and compounds instead of solving each problem independently. Enforcing the permutation antisymmetry of electrons in such generalized neural wave functions remained challenging as existing methods require discrete orbital selection via non-learnable hand-crafted algorithms. This work tackles the problem by defining overparametrized, fully learnable neural wave functions suitable for generalization across molecules. We achieve this by relying on Pfaffians rather than Slater determinants. The Pfaffian allows us to enforce the antisymmetry on arbitrary electronic systems without any constraint on electronic spin configurations or molecular structure. Our empirical evaluation finds that a single neural Pfaffian calculates the ground state and ionization energies with chemical accuracy across various systems. On the TinyMol dataset, we outperform the `gold-standard' CCSD(T) CBS reference energies by 1.9m$E_h$ and reduce energy errors compared to previous generalized neural wave functions by up to an order of magnitude.</description>
