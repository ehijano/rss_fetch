      <title>Robust Semi-Supervised CT Radiomics for Lung Cancer Prognosis: Cost-Effective Learning with Limited Labels and SHAP Interpretation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.08189</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.08189v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Background: CT imaging is vital for lung cancer management, offering detailed visualization for AI-based prognosis. However, supervised learning SL models require large labeled datasets, limiting their real-world application in settings with scarce annotations.
  Methods: We analyzed CT scans from 977 patients across 12 datasets extracting 1218 radiomics features using Laplacian of Gaussian and wavelet filters via PyRadiomics Dimensionality reduction was applied with 56 feature selection and extraction algorithms and 27 classifiers were benchmarked A semi supervised learning SSL framework with pseudo labeling utilized 478 unlabeled and 499 labeled cases Model sensitivity was tested in three scenarios varying labeled data in SL increasing unlabeled data in SSL and scaling both from 10 percent to 100 percent SHAP analysis was used to interpret predictions Cross validation and external testing in two cohorts were performed.
  Results: SSL outperformed SL, improving overall survival prediction by up to 17 percent. The top SSL model, Random Forest plus XGBoost classifier, achieved 0.90 accuracy in cross-validation and 0.88 externally. SHAP analysis revealed enhanced feature discriminability in both SSL and SL, especially for Class 1 survival greater than 4 years. SSL showed strong performance with only 10 percent labeled data, with more stable results compared to SL and lower variance across external testing, highlighting SSL's robustness and cost effectiveness.
  Conclusion: We introduced a cost-effective, stable, and interpretable SSL framework for CT-based survival prediction in lung cancer, improving performance, generalizability, and clinical readiness by integrating SHAP explainability and leveraging unlabeled data.</description>

      <title>Refraction corrected specular beamforming applied to cortical bone enhances interface visibility of bone-soft tissues interfaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.08497</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.08497v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Ultrasound imaging of the cortex of long bones may enable the measurement of the cortical thickness and the ultrasound wave speed in cortical bone tissue. However, with bone loss, the cortical porosity and the size of the pores increase, resulting in strong ultrasound diffuse scattering whose magnitude can exceed that of the specular reflection from the bone-marrow (endosteal) interface. In this study we adapt to bone a specular beamforming technique proposed to better image a needle in soft tissue. Our approach takes into account both wave refraction and specular reflection physics to enhance the contrast of bone surfaces and reduce speckle from intracortical pores. In vivo ultrasound data were acquired at the center of the human tibia in a plane normal to the bone axis of 11 young healthy volunteeers. Ex vivo ultrasound data were acquired from 16 regions of interest from the femoral diaphysis of three elderly donors (donors 66-98 y.o.) using a 2.5 MHz US transducer. A single-element trans mission synthetic aperture imaging sequence was implemented on a research ultrasound system with a 2.5MHz phased array transducer. Image reconstruction was performed: (A) a delay-and-sum (DAS) algorithm with optimized f-number, correction of refraction at the soft tissue-bone interface and subject-specific ultrasound wave speed and (B) an adaptive algorithm using Snells law of reflection. The improvement of image quality was evaluated with contrast ratios of the average intensities: CEI between the endosteal surface and the center of the cortex. In vivo, specular beamforming improved the visibility of the endosteum (CEI ) by 1 to 13 dB while maintaining the relative contrast between the outer and inner surfaces of the cortex. These results suggest that the visualization of the intra-osseous anatomy can be enhanced if Snells law and wave refraction are taken into account during image reconstruction.</description>

      <title>Rapid MRI-Based Synthetic CT Simulations for Precise tFUS Targeting</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.08688</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.08688v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Accurate targeting is critical for the effectiveness of transcranial focused ultrasound (tFUS) neuromodulation. While CT provides accurate skull acoustic properties, its ionizing radiation and poor soft tissue contrast limit clinical applicability. In contrast, MRI offers superior neuroanatomical visualization without radiation exposure but lacks skull property mapping. This study proposes a novel, fully CT free simulation framework that integrates MRI-derived synthetic CT (sCT) with efficient modeling techniques for rapid and precise tFUS targeting. We trained a deep-learning model to generate sCT from T1-weighted MRI and integrated it with both full-wave (k-Wave) and accelerated simulation methods, hybrid angular spectrum (kWASM) and Rayleigh-Sommerfeld ASM (RSASM). Across five skull models, both full-wave and hybrid pipelines using sCT demonstrated sub-millimeter targeting deviation, focal shape consistency (FWHM ~3.3-3.8 mm), and &lt;0.2 normalized pressure error compared to CT-based gold standard. Notably, the kW-ASM and RS-ASM pipelines reduced simulation time from ~3320 s to 187 s and 34 s respectively, achieving ~94% and ~90% time savings. These results confirm that MRI-derived sCT combined with innovative rapid simulation techniques enables fast, accurate, and radiation-free tFUS planning, supporting its feasibility for scalable clinical applications.</description>

      <title>Ultrasound Autofocusing: Common Midpoint Phase Error Optimization via Differentiable Beamforming</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.03008</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.03008v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In ultrasound imaging, propagation of an acoustic wavefront through heterogeneous media causes phase aberrations that degrade the coherence of the reflected wavefront, leading to reduced image resolution and contrast. Adaptive imaging techniques attempt to correct this phase aberration and restore coherence, leading to improved focusing of the image. We propose an autofocusing paradigm for aberration correction in ultrasound imaging by fitting an acoustic velocity field to pressure measurements, via optimization of the common midpoint phase error (CMPE), using a straight-ray wave propagation model for beamforming in diffusely scattering media. We show that CMPE induced by heterogeneous acoustic velocity is a robust measure of phase aberration that can be used for acoustic autofocusing. CMPE is optimized iteratively using a differentiable beamforming approach to simultaneously improve the image focus while estimating the acoustic velocity field of the interrogated medium. The approach relies solely on wavefield measurements using a straight-ray integral solution of the two-way time-of-flight without explicit numerical time-stepping models of wave propagation. We demonstrate method performance through in silico simulations, in vitro phantom measurements, and in vivo mammalian models, showing practical applications in distributed aberration quantification, correction, and velocity estimation for medical ultrasound autofocusing.</description>

      <title>Introducing Image-Space Preconditioning in the Variational Formulation of MRI Reconstructions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.05312</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.05312v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The aim of the present article is to enrich the comprehension of iterative magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) reconstructions, including compressed sensing (CS) and iterative deep learning (DL) reconstructions, by describing them in the general framework of finite-dimensional inner-product spaces. In particular, we show that image-space preconditioning (ISP) and data-space preconditioning (DSP) can be formulated as non-conventional inner-products. The main gain of our reformulation is an embedding of ISP in the variational formulation of the MRI reconstruction problem (in an algorithm-independent way) which allows in principle to naturally and systematically propagate ISP in all iterative reconstructions, including many iterative DL and CS reconstructions where preconditioning is lacking. The way in which we apply linear algebraic tools to MRI reconstructions as presented in this article is a novelty.
  A secondary aim of our article is to offer a certain didactic material to scientists who are new in the field of MRI reconstruction. Since we explore here some mathematical concepts of reconstruction, we take that opportunity to recall some principles that may be understood for experts, but which may be hard to find in the literature for beginners. In fact, the description of many mathematical tools of MRI reconstruction is fragmented in the literature or sometimes missing because considered as a general knowledge. Further, some of those concepts can be found in mathematic manuals, but not in a form that is oriented toward MRI. For example, we think of the conjugate gradient descent, the notion of derivative with respect to non-conventional inner products, or simply the notion of adjoint. The authors believe therefore that it is beneficial for their field of research to dedicate some space to such a didactic material.</description>
