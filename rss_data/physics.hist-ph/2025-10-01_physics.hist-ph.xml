      <title>Particles before symmetry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.25276</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.25276v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The standard model of particle physics relies heavily on the idea of symmetry. But recently, a new geometry-first picture has been proposed in which the relevant symmetries do not appear explicitly at the ground level of ontology. Here, I extend the initial correspondence to include alternative -- and more transparent -- accounts of spontaneous symmetry breaking and of the Yukawa coupling: both fundamental for particles to have masses. These reformulations allow us to replace explanations that employ typical particle physics ideas and terminology with ones that are phrased geometrically</description>

      <title>Lorentz, Poincar\'e, and Einstein: Rethinking Doppler, Aberration, and the Fresnel Drag</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.26389</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.26389v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper examines Lorentz's 1895 derivations of the classical Doppler formula and Fresnel drag, Einstein's 1905 derivation of the relativistic Doppler effect and aberration, and Einstein's 1907 kinematical route to the exact velocity composition law from which Fresnel drag is obtained as a low-velocity limit. Einstein acknowledged that he had read Lorentz's "Versuch" well before 1905. In 1907, Einstein identified Lorentz's "Versuch" as a crucial precursor to relativity. In that work, Lorentz had already invoked local time to derive Fresnel's drag coefficient from Maxwell's equations. There is a genuine "family resemblance" between Lorentz's and Einstein's treatments in that both preserve the phase of a plane wave under transformation. Yet I demonstrate that this resemblance is only formal. I also discuss the absence of the relativistic Doppler and aberration laws in Poincar\'e's Dynamics of the Electron.</description>

      <title>Diffeomorphism Invariance and Background Independence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.26450</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.26450v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper answers examines the relationship between Diffeomorphism Invariance and Background Independence. First, a review of the relationship between Background Independence, General Relativity (GR) and pre-GR theories are given. Then, a wide range of other conceptions of background independence is discussed. It is shown that the definition of Background Independence is fluid and can mean different things to different philosophers and/or physicists. Most pertinently, the paper addresses the question of what kind of background independence is implied by a mathematical criterion of diffeomorphism invariance or in what sense is diffeomorphism invariance background independence. Lastly, the concept of haecceity in relation to diffeomorphism invariance is discussed.</description>

      <title>A physical approach to qualia and the emergence of conscious observers in qualia space</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2203.10602</link>
      <description>arXiv:2203.10602v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: I propose that qualia are physical because they are directly observable, and revisit the contentious link between consciousness and quantum measurements from a new perspective -- one that does not rely on observers or wave function collapse but instead treats physical measurements as fundamental in a sense resonant with Wheeler's it-from-bit. Building on a mathematical definition of measurement space in physics, I reinterpret it as a model of qualia, effectively equating the measurement problem of quantum mechanics with the hard problem of consciousness. The resulting framework falls within panpsychism, and offers potential solutions to the combination problem. Moreover, some of the mathematical structure of measurement spaces, taken for granted in physics, needs justification for qualia, suggesting that the apparent solidity of physical reality is deeply rooted in how humans process information.</description>
