      <title>Effect of Finite-Temperature $\beta$-Decay Rates on the Rapid Neutron Capture Process</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.08772</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.08772v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: $\beta$-decay is known to play an essential role in the rapid neutron capture process ($r$-process) during $(n, \gamma) \leftrightarrow (\gamma, n)$ equilibrium and freeze-out when the neutron-rich nuclei decay back to stability. Recent systematic theoretical studies on $\beta$-decay at finite temperature indicated that under hot conditions ($T\sim10$~GK), a significant acceleration of $\beta$-decay rates is expected, especially for nuclei near stability. This corresponds to the early stage of the $r$-process. In this study, we investigate the effect of the $\beta$-decays in finite temperature using the rates calculated with the finite-temperature proton-neutron relativistic quasiparticle random-phase approximation (FT-PNRQRPA). We explore a variety of astrophysical conditions and find that the effect on the abundance pattern is significant in hot and moderately neutron-rich conditions such as are expected in magnetorotational supernovae. Accelerated $\beta$-decay rates also increase the heating rate in the early phase, resulting in an additional modification of the final abundance pattern.</description>

      <title>Thermal and magnetic effects on viscosity in Binary Neutron Star mergers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.09104</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.09104v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Astrophysical scenarios such as binary neutron star mergers, proto-neutron stars and core-collapse supernovae involve finite temperatures and strong magnetic fields. Previous studies on the effect of magnetic fields on flavor-equilibration processes such as direct Urca relied on the Fermi surface approximation, which is not a reliable approximation in the neutrino-transparent regime of matter in supernovae or neutron star mergers. In a recent study, we went beyond the Fermi surface approximation, performing the full phase space integral to obtain direct Urca rates in background magnetic field. In this work, we extend these calculations to include collisional broadening effects by employing the recently developed nucleon width approximation. We demonstrate the impact of magnetic fields on the flavor-equilibrium condition for two finite-temperature equations of state with different direct Urca thresholds. We also study the impact of magnetic fields on the bulk viscous dissipation of density oscillations relevant in postmerger scenarios.</description>

      <title>Indirect method for nuclear reactions and the role of the self energy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.09140</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.09140v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: When a nuclear species (e.g., a nucleon or a deuteron nucleus) propagating freely is made to collide with a target nucleus, its trajectory is modified by exchanging variable amounts of energy, mass, linear and angular momentum with the target, according to its interaction with the nuclear medium. By addressing this perturbation away from the free path, one hopes to learn something about the nature of the medium through which our probe propagates. This is the essence of the experimental use of nuclear reactions for the purpose of gathering information about nuclear structure. In order to deal with the structure and the reaction aspects of a specific experiment on the same footing, it is therefore desirable to identify a theoretical construct that embodies the modification of the propagation of a particle in the medium with respect to the free case, and use it both for the determination of the nuclear spectrum (structure) and for the calculation of scattering observables (reaction). A candidate for such an object is the self energy, and we will try in the present lectures to put it at the center stage in the formulation of scattering theory.</description>

      <title>Revealing the temperature effect on the nucleon-nucleon inelastic cross section in isospin-asymmetric nuclear medium</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.09337</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.09337v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The nucleon-nucleon ($NN$) inelastic cross section plays an important role in constraining the nuclear equation of state at high baryon density and in describing the formation and evolution of compact astrophysical objects. In this study, the temperature $T$ dependence of the $\Delta^{++}$ and $\Delta^{-}$ production cross sections in the isospin-symmetric and -asymmetric nuclear medium is investigated within the self-consistent and relativistic Boltzmann--Uehling--Uhlenbeck (RBUU) framework. Two relativistic mean-field parameterizations are employed: the density-dependent parameterization (called DD-ME$\delta$) and the nonlinear-dependent parameterization (called OMEG). Both parameterizations yield similar $T$-dependent baryon effective masses and mass splittings, although the OMEG set exhibits a stronger density dependence, particularly at higher densities ($&gt; 1.5\rho_{0}$). Consequently, at lower densities, the energy, density, temperature, and isospin dependence of both $\Delta^{++}$ and $\Delta^{-}$ production cross sections are comparable for both sets, whereas at higher densities, the OMEG set predicts a stronger temperature and density sensitivity. Moreover, the $T$ dependence of the $NN$ inelastic cross section is enhanced with increasing density, but is suppressed in isospin-asymmetric nuclear matter compared to that in isospin-symmetric nuclear matter. The isospin dependence of the cross section remains nearly $T$-independent at small asymmetries, yet becomes more intricate in highly asymmetric systems. These findings provide valuable testing inputs for improving the thermal treatment of $\Delta$-related dynamical processes in transport models and offer insights into the behavior of $\Delta$ in astrophysical environments, such as core-collapse supernovae and binary neutron star mergers.</description>

      <title>Entanglement and accidental symmetries in the nucleon-nucleon system</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.09466</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.09466v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the connection between accidental symmetries in the nuclear interaction and spin entanglement in two-nucleon scattering. Specifically, we incorporate different levels of Wigner $SU(4)$ and Serber symmetries into leading-order potentials derived from chiral effective field theory. We conduct a quantitative analysis by computing the full $S$ matrix, demonstrating that the neutron-proton spin entanglement can be related to the symmetry properties of the interaction and the presence of certain operators and partial waves. Furthermore, we study the order-by-order evolution of the spin entanglement, up to next-to-next-to-leading order in Weinberg power counting, for both neutron-proton and neutron-neutron scattering. Entanglement suppression is not observed in neutron-neutron scattering, which can be attributed to the Pauli principle and the absence of accidental symmetries in this system. We conclude that entanglement is a useful guide for studying the power counting and symmetries in nuclear interactions derived from effective field theories.</description>

      <title>Probing the Dependence of Partonic Energy Loss on the Initial Energy Density of the Quark Gluon Plasma</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.09523</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.09523v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Considerable evidence now exists for partonic energy loss due to interaction with the hot, dense medium created in ultra-relativistic heavy-ion collisions. A primary signal of this energy loss is the suppression of high transverse momentum $p_{\mathrm{T}}$ hadron yields in A-A collisions relative to appropriately scaled $pp$ collisions at the same energy. Measuring the collision energy dependence of this energy loss is vital to understanding the medium, but it is difficult to disentangle the medium-driven energy loss from the natural kinematic variance of the steeply-falling $p_{\mathrm{T}}$ spectra across different $\sqrt{s_{\mathrm{NN}}}$. To decouple these effects, we utilize a phenomenologically motivated spectrum shift model to estimate the average transverse momentum loss $\Delta p_{\mathrm{T}}$ imparted on high $p_{\mathrm{T}}$ partons in A-A collisions, a proxy for the medium induced energy loss. We observe a striking correlation between $\Delta p_{\mathrm{T}}$ and Glauber-derived estimates of initial state energy density $\varepsilon_{\mathrm{Bj}}$, consistent across two orders of magnitude in collision energy for a variety of nuclear species. To access the path-length dependence of energy loss, we couple our model to geometric event shape estimates extracted from Glauber calculations to produce predictions for high-$p_{\mathrm{T}}$ hadron elliptic flow $v_2$ that agree reasonably with data.</description>

      <title>Exclusive photoproduction of light and heavy vector mesons: thresholds to very high energies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.08845</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.08845v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A reaction model for $\gamma + p \to V + p$, $V=\rho^0, \phi, J/\psi, \Upsilon$, which exposes the quark-antiquark content of the photon in making the transition $\gamma\to {q} \bar{q} + \mathbb P \to V$, where ${q}$ depends on $V$, and couples the intermediate ${q} \bar{q}$ system to the proton's valence quarks via Pomeron ($\mathbb P$) exchange, is used to deliver a unified description of available data -- both differential and total cross sections -- from near threshold to very high energies, $W$, for all the $V$-mesons. For the $\Upsilon$, this means $10\lesssim W/{\rm GeV} \lesssim 2\,000$. Also provided are predictions for the power-law exponents that are empirically used to characterise the large-$W$ behaviour of the total cross sections and slope parameters characterising the near-threshold differential cross sections. Appealing to notions of vector meson dominance, the latter have been interpreted as vector-meson--proton scattering lengths. The body of results indicate that it is premature to link any $\gamma + p \to V + p$ data with, for instance, in-proton gluon distributions, the quantum chromodynamics trace anomaly, or pentaquark production. Further developments in reaction theory and higher precision data are required before the validity of any such links can be assessed.</description>

      <title>Semihard interactions at TeV energies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.08963</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.08963v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the high-energy behavior of the total cross section, $\sigma_{\text{tot}}$, and the ratio of the real to imaginary parts of the scattering amplitude, $\rho$, in both proton-proton and antiproton-proton channels. Our analysis is based on a QCD-inspired model in which the rise of the cross sections is predominantly driven by semihard processes involving gluons. We address the tension between measurements from the ATLAS/ALFA and TOTEM Collaborations, showing that independent analyses of their datasets can provide statistically consistent descriptions of the overall data, even though they do not fully reproduce the central values of the $\rho$ parameter at $\sqrt{s} = 13$ TeV. The slight discrepancy between these central values and the model's predicted values, obtained using an asymptotic dominant crossing-even elastic scattering amplitude, points to the potential presence of an odd component in the semihard amplitude at high energies.</description>

      <title>Emergence of the $\pi(1300)$ Resonance from Lattice QCD</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.09476</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.09476v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The mass of the lightest hadron in nature, the pion, is one seventh of that of the nucleon, and one tenth of the mass of its first excited state, the $\pi(1300)$. This enormous energy difference opens an interesting window into the confinement of quarks and the structure of the lightest hadrons. In this work, we provide the first calculation of resonance parameters of the $\pi(1300)$ from lattice QCD. For this purpose, recently derived state-of-the-art tools are adapted and applied both in the construction of three-hadron operators and for mapping finite-volume spectra to infinite-volume amplitudes, subsequently analytically continuing these to complex energies. For our heavy pion mass ensembles, we find a clear signal of the resonance. Crucial input is provided through Chiral Perturbation Theory, allowing us to robustly extrapolate to the physical point. Applying model averaging, we extract a pole position of $M_{\pi(1300)}=(1169\pm46)-i\,(62_{-62}^{+168})\,\rm MeV$ supporting values from phenomenology.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2507.00587v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We propose an optimized histogram binning strategy to reconstruct nuclear response functions via the Chebyshev expansion bound-state method. Our approach employs a stochastic regularization of the density of states to define adaptive, equal-area bins. Using the deuteron solved in a harmonic-oscillator basis with a chiral interaction, we benchmark on dipole and longitudinal responses, obtaining excellent agreement with exact theory and experiment. This general framework readily extends to other many-body systems and opens the door to new ab initio calculations of lepton-nucleus cross sections in medium-mass nuclei.</description>

      <title>Microscopic pairing in fission dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.00664</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.00664v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Nuclear fission can be modelled as a quantum tunneling process driven by the interplay between the nuclear binding energy and the collective inertia. Within the Wentzel-Kramers-Brillouin formalism, spontaneous fission half-lives can be obtained by minimizing the action integral in the multidimensional space of collective degrees of freedom. Hence, including the relevant collective variables is crucial for properly describing spontaneous fission probabilities. Pairing correlations play an essential role in this evaluation since the collective inertia decreases as the inverse of the square of the pairing gap, and, therefore, they should be considered as a relevant degree of freedom on the same footing as deformation parameters. In this work, we show that the spontaneous fission half-lives in fermium isotopes can be reproduced in a microscopic theory by considering the least-action fission path in a two-dimensional space with constraints on the quadrupole moment and pairing correlations. We consider two microscopic quantities as degrees of freedom associated with pairing: the pairing gap parameter $\Delta$, and the particle number fluctuations $\langle \Delta N^2 \rangle$. Least-action paths, computed using the Dijkstra algorithm, are compared with minimum-energy paths, highlighting the importance of pairing correlations as a dynamical degree of freedom.</description>

Abstract: We present a new method for extracting a mass parameter using time-dependent density functional theory for an arbitrary physical system, provided the adiabatic limit is achievable. This approach works for collective variables also in the presence of a medium, in particular for the nuclei interacting with a neutron background. We apply the method to extract mass parameters of impurities in the neutron star crust, like their inertial masses and quadrupole mass parameters. The extracted mass parameters at various depths of the inner crust are compared with other methods, including the hydrodynamic approach. The presented method opens avenues for the construction of an effective model of neutron star crust grounded in microscopic calculations.</description>

      <title>Compositeness of hadrons, nuclei, and atomic systems</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.12285v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recent observations of exotic hadrons have stimulated the theoretical investigation of the internal structure of hadrons. While all hadrons are ultimately composed of quarks and gluons bound by the strong interaction, quark clustering phenomena can generate hadronic molecules -- weakly bound systems of hadrons -- which are expected to emerge near two-hadron thresholds. However, it should be noted that a pure hadronic molecule is not realized, as the strong interaction induces mixing with other possible configurations. The compositeness of hadrons has been developed as a promising concept to quantitatively characterize the fraction of the hadronic molecular component. Here we summarize the modern understanding of the compositeness to study the internal structure of hadrons and review the application of the compositeness to various quantum systems in different energy scales, such as nuclei and atomic systems, in addition to hadrons.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2505.04906v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Nuclear modifications to collinear parton distribution functions are conventionally quantified by the ratios $ r^{\textrm{A}}_i(x,Q^2) = f^\textrm{A,proton}_i(x,Q^2) / f^\textrm{proton}_i(x,Q^2) $. For a given nucleus $A$, these ratios generally depend on the parton momentum fraction $ x $, the probing scale $ Q^{2} $, and the parton species $ i $. Determining these dependencies relies on a global analysis of diverse experimental data. However, in realistic observables, these dependencies are intricately intertwined, making their extraction challenging. In this paper, we propose a novel approach to effectively image the nuclear modification factors $ r^{\textrm{A}}_i(x,Q^2) $ at the observable level in proton-nucleus collisions at the Large Hadron Collider. Specifically, through a combined study of $ Z $-boson production, $ Z $+jet production, and $ Z+c $-jet production, we separately enhance signals arising from light-quark, gluon, and heavy-flavor (charm) distributions in nuclei. This enables us to effectively image the $ r^{\textrm{A}}_i(x,Q^2) $ for specific parton species. The feasibility of this method is validated through perturbative calculations at next-to-leading order in the strong coupling constant, employing three sets of nuclear PDF parametrizations: EPPS21, nCTEQ15, and TUJU19. Future measurements of these observables are expected to provide more efficient constraints on nuclear PDFs and yield new insights into the detailed partonic structures of nuclei.</description>
