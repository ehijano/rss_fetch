      <title>Photoelectron -- residual-ion entanglement in streaked shake-up ionization of helium</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.03622</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.03622v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Streaked photoelectron emission spectra access the correlated dynamics of photoelectrons and residual target electrons with attosecond temporal resolution. We calculated ab initio single-ionization spectra for photoemission from helium atoms by co-linearly polarized ultrashort XUV and assisting few-femtosecond IR pulses. Distinguishing direct and shake-up ionization resulting in ground-state and excited (n=2,3) He+ residual ions, respectively, we examined the effects of the correlated photoemission dynamics on the photoelectron phase-accumulation as a function of the observable photoelectron detection direction and kinetic energy, and XUV-IR pulse delay. We tracked the dynamical evolution of the residual ion in relative streaked photoemission delays and found dominant contributions for shake-up emission from the residual ion - photoelectron interaction. These are in very good and fair agreement, respectively, for n=2 and n=3 shake-up photoemission along the pulse-polarization directions, with previous experimental and theoretical investigations [Ossiander et. al. 2017] and reveal a strong photoemission-direction dependence for shake-up ionization due to the coupling between the photoelectron and evolving residual-ion charge distribution in the IR-laser field.</description>

      <title>Quantum circuits based on topological pumping in optical lattices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.02984</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.02984v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Gate operations composed in quantum circuits form the basis of digital quantum simulation and quantum processing. While two-qubit gates generally operate between nearest neighbours, many circuits require non-local connectivity, necessitating some form of quantum information transport, such as the repeated application of SWAP gates or qubit shuttling. Preserving motional coherence during such transport remains a key challenge to improve gate fidelity and qubit connectivity, as well as to connect local fermionic modes. Here we combine tuneable gate operations between fermionic potassium-40 atoms - based on superexchange interaction - with their bidirectional transport via topological Thouless pumping in an optical lattice. We demonstrate shuttling of atomic singlet pairs with a single-shift fidelity of 99.57(4)% over 50 lattice sites. We spatially and coherently split a large number of randomly distributed fermionic spin singlet pairs and show $($SWAP$)^\alpha$-gate operations between atoms encountering each other during transport. As a signature of entanglement between fermions separated over large distances and interwoven with each other, we observe multi-frequency singlet-triplet oscillations. Topological pumping is generally applicable to long-lived atomic and molecular states, and specifically overcomes lifetime limitations inherent to transport using state-dependent optical lattices. Our work opens up new avenues for transport of quantum information and offers unprecedented possibilities for engineering connectivity in quantum circuits, including approaches based on fermionic modes, as well as for atom interferometry.</description>

      <title>Regimes of Steady-State Turbulence in a Quantum Fluid</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.03184</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.03184v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We simulate the Gross-Pitaevskii equation to model the development of turbulence in a quantum fluid confined by a cuboid box potential, and forced by shaking along one axis. We observe the development of isotropic turbulence from anisotropic forcing for a broad range of forcing amplitudes, and characterise the states through their Fourier spectra, vortex distributions, and spatial correlations. For weak forcing the steady-state wave-action spectrum exhibits a $k^{-3.5}$ scaling over wavenumber $k$; further decomposition uncovers the same power law in both compressible kinetic energy and quantum pressure, while the bulk superfluid remains phase coherent and free from extended vortices. As the forcing energy exceeds the chemical potential, extended vortices develop in the bulk, disrupting the $k^{-3.5}$ scaling. The spectrum then transitions to a $k^{-7/3}$ regime for compressible kinetic energy only, associated with dense vortex turbulence, and phase coherence limited to the healing length. The strong forcing regime is consistent with an inverse cascade of compressible energy driven by small-scale vortex annihilation.</description>

      <title>Shapiro steps in strongly-interacting Fermi gases</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.03448</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.03448v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We report the observation of Shapiro steps in a periodically driven Josephson junction between strongly-interacting Fermi superfluids of ultracold atoms. We observe quantized plateaus in the current-potential characteristics, the height and width of which mirror the external drive frequency and the junction nonlinear response. Direct measurements of the current-phase relationship showcase how Shapiro steps arise from the synchronization between the relative phase of the two reservoirs and the external drive. Such mechanism is further supported by the detection of periodic phase-slippage processes, in the form of vortex-antivortex pairs. Our results are corroborated by a circuital model and numerical simulations, overall providing a clear understanding of Shapiro dynamics in atomic Fermi superfluids. Our work demonstrates phase-coherent and synchronization effects in driven strongly-interacting superfluids, opening prospects for studying emergent non-equilibrium dynamics in quantum many-body systems under external drives.</description>

      <title>Generating arbitrary superpositions of nonclassical quantum harmonic oscillator states</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.03482</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.03482v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Full coherent control and generation of superpositions of the quantum harmonic oscillator are not only of fundamental interest but are crucial for applications in quantum simulations, quantum-enhanced metrology and continuous-variable quantum computation. The extension of such superpositions to nonclassical states increases their power as a resource for such applications. Here, we create arbitrary superpositions of nonclassical and non-Gaussian states of a quantum harmonic oscillator using the motion of a trapped ion coupled to its internal spin states. We interleave spin-dependent nonlinear bosonic interactions and mid-circuit measurements of the spin that preserve the coherence of the oscillator. These techniques enable the creation of superpositions between squeezed, trisqueezed, and quadsqueezed states, which have never been demonstrated before, with independent control over the complex-valued squeezing parameter and the probability amplitude of each constituent, as well as their spatial separation. We directly observe the nonclassical nature of these states in the form of Wigner negativity following a full state reconstruction. Our methods apply to any system where a quantum harmonic oscillator is coupled to a spin.</description>

      <title>Temperature shift of magnetic-field-dependent photoluminescence features of nitrogen-vacancy ensembles in diamond</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.03608</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.03608v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recently significant attention has been paid to magnetic-field-dependent photoluminescence (PL) features of the negatively charged nitrogen-vacancy (NV) centers in diamond. These features are used for microwave-free sensing and are indicative of the spin-bath properties in the diamond sample. Examinating the temperature dependence of the PL features allows to identify both temperature dependent and independent features, and to utilize them in diamond-based quantum sensing and dynamic nuclear polarization applications. Here, we study the thermal variability of many different features visible in a wide range of magnetic fields. To this end, we first discuss the origin of the features and tentatively assign the previously unidentified features to cross relaxation of NV center containing multi-spin systems. The experimental results are compared with theoretically predicted temperature shifts deduced from a combination of thermal expansion and electron-phonon interactions. A deeper insight into the thermal behavior of a wide array of the features may come with important consequences for various applications in high-precision NV thermometry, gyroscopes, solid-state clocks, and biomagnetic measurements.</description>
