      <title>Terrier: A Deep Learning Repeat Classifier</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.09312</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.09312v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Repetitive DNA sequences underpin genome architecture and evolutionary processes, yet they remain challenging to classify accurately. Terrier is a deep learning model designed to overcome these challenges by classifying repetitive DNA sequences using a publicly available, curated repeat sequence library trained under the RepeatMasker schema. Poor representation of taxa within repeat databases often limits the classification accuracy and reproducibility of current repeat annotation methods, limiting our understanding of repeat evolution and function. Terrier overcomes these challenges by leveraging deep learning for improved accuracy. Trained on Repbase, which includes over 100,000 repeat families -- four times more than Dfam -- Terrier maps 97.1% of Repbase sequences to RepeatMasker categories, offering the most comprehensive classification system available. When benchmarked against DeepTE, TERL, and TEclass2 in model organisms (rice, fruit flies, humans, and mice), Terrier achieved superior accuracy while classifying a broader range of sequences. Further validation in non-model amphibian, flatworm and Northern krill genomes highlights its effectiveness in improving classification in non-model species, facilitating research on repeat-driven evolution, genomic instability, and phenotypic variation.</description>

      <title>The optimization of crop response to climatic stress through modulation of plant stress response mechanisms. Opportunities for biostimulants and plant hormones to meet climate challenges</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.01714</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.01714v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Climate change is a major threat to crop potential and is characterized by both long-term shifts in temperature and precipitation patterns as well as increased occurrence of extreme weather events, these extreme weather events are the most immediate and intractable threat to agriculture. Crop resilience in the face of stress depends upon the speed and effectiveness with which plants and cropping systems sense and respond to that stress. A variety of agronomic practices including breeding, exogenous inputs (nutrients, water, biostimulants and others) and shifts in cultivation practice have been used to influence plant stress response to achieve the goal of increased plant and cropping system resilience. Traditional breeding is a powerful tool that has resulted in stable and long-term cultivar improvements but is often too slow and complex to meet the diverse, complex and unpredictable challenges of climate induced stresses. Increased inputs (water, nutrients, pesticides etc.) and management strategies (cropping system choice, soil management etc.) can alleviate stress but are often constrained by cost and availability of inputs. Exogenous biostimulants, microbials and plant hormones have shown great promise as mechanisms to optimize natural plant resilience resulting in immediate but non-permanent improvements in plant responses to climate induced stresses. The failure to modernize regulatory frameworks for the use of biostimulants in agriculture will constrain the development of safe effective tools and deprive growers of means to respond to the vagaries of climate change. Here we discuss the scientific rationale for eliminating the regulatory barriers that constrain the potential for biostimulants or products that modulate plant regulatory networks to address climate change challenges and propose a framework for enabling legislation to strengthen cropping system resilience.</description>

      <title>Classification of autoimmune diseases from Peripheral blood TCR repertoires by multimodal multi-instance learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.04981</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.04981v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: T cell receptor (TCR) repertoires encode critical immunological signatures for autoimmune diseases, yet their clinical application remains limited by sequence sparsity and low witness rates. We developed EAMil, a multi-instance deep learning framework that leverages TCR sequencing data to diagnose systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) and rheumatoid arthritis (RA) with exceptional accuracy. By integrating PrimeSeq feature extraction with ESMonehot encoding and enhanced gate attention mechanisms, our model achieved state-of-the-art performance with AUCs of 98.95% for SLE and 97.76% for RA. EAMil successfully identified disease-associated genes with over 90% concordance with established differential analyses and effectively distinguished disease-specific TCR genes. The model demonstrated robustness in classifying multiple disease categories, utilizing the SLEDAI score to stratify SLE patients by disease severity as well as to diagnose the site of damage in SLE patients, and effectively controlling for confounding factors such as age and gender. This interpretable framework for immune receptor analysis provides new insights for autoimmune disease detection and classification with broad potential clinical applications across immune-mediated conditions.</description>
