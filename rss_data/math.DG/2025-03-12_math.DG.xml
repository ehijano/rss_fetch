      <title>RCD structures on singular Kahler spaces of complex dimension three</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.08865</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.08865v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let X be a projective variety of complex dimension 3 with log terminal singularities. We prove that every singular Kahler metric on X with bounded Nash entropy and Ricci curvature bounded below induces a compact RCD space homeomorphic to the projective variety X itself. In particular, singular Kahler-Einstein spaces of complex dimension 3 with bounded Nash entropy are compact RCD spaces topologically and holomorphically equivalent to the underlying projective variety. Various compactness theorems are also obtained for 3-dimensional projective varieties with bounded Ricci curvature. Such results establish connections among algebraic, geometric and analytic structures of klt singularities from birational geometry and provide abundant examples of RCD spaces from algebraic geometry via complex Monge-Ampere equations.</description>

      <title>Hypersurfaces of any homogeneous $\mathbb{C}P^3$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.08871</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.08871v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Hypersurfaces are studied and classified under multiple additional assumptions in any Riemannian homogeneous space $(\mathbb{C}P^3, g_a)$, including nearly K\"ahler $\mathbb{C}P^3$. Notably, all extrinsically homogeneous hypersurfaces are classified in all these spaces, with an explicit family of examples. Moreover, for nearly K\"ahler $\mathbb{C}P^3$, all Hopf hypersurfaces are classified. Finally, Codazzi-like hypersurfaces (and in particular parallel and totally geodesic hypersurfaces), totally umbilical hypersurfaces and constant sectional curvature hypersurfaces are proven to not exist in any homogeneous $\mathbb{C}P^3$.</description>

      <title>Covariant derivatives in the representation-valued Bott-Shulman-Stasheff and Weil complex</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.08873</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.08873v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: For a Lie groupoid $G$, the differential forms on its nerve comprise a double complex. A natural question is if this statement extends to forms with values in a representation $V$ of $G$. In this paper, we research two types of covariant derivatives which commute with the simplicial differential, yielding two types of "curved" double complexes of forms with coefficients in $V$. The na\"ive approach is to consider a linear connection $\nabla$ on $V$, in which case $d^\nabla$ commutes with the simplicial differential if and only if $\nabla$ satisfies a certain (restrictive) invariance condition. The heart of this paper focuses on another, more compelling approach: using a multiplicative Ehresmann connection for a bundle of ideals. In this case, we obtain a geometrically richer curved double complex, where the cochain map is given by the horizontal exterior covariant derivative $D$, which generalizes the well-known operator from the theory of principal bundles. Moreover, both differential operators $d^\nabla$ and $D$ are researched in the infinitesimal setting of Lie algebroids, as well as their relationship with the van Est map. We conclude by using the operator $D$ to study the curvature of an (infinitesimal) multiplicative Ehresmann connection.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.09074v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we prove the solvability of the vortex equation on a holomorphic vector bundle over a compact Hermitian manifold using the continuity method, and show the Kobayashi-Hitchin correspondence for holomorphic pairs. This work extends Bradlow's Kobayashi-Hitchin correspondence over compact K\"{a}hler manifolds to compact non-K\"{a}hler manifolds.</description>

      <title>The dimension of harmonic currents on foliated complex surfaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.09152</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.09152v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $\mathcal{F}$ be a singular holomorphic foliation on an algebraic complex surface $S$, with hyperbolic singularities and no foliated cycle. We prove a formula for the transverse Hausdorff dimension of the unique  harmonic current, involving the Furstenberg entropy and the Lyapunov exponent. In particular, we extend Brunella's inequality to every holomorphic foliation $\mathcal{F}$ on $\mathbb P^2$: if $\mathcal{F}$ has degree $d \geq 2$, then the Hausdorff dimension of its harmonic current is smaller than or equal to ${d-1 \over d+2}$, in particular the harmonic current is singular with respect to the Lebesgue measure. We also show that the Hausdorff dimension of the harmonic current of the Jouanolou foliation of degree $2$ is equal to $1/4$, and that the same property holds for topologically conjugate foliations on $\mathbb P^2$.</description>

      <title>An end to end gluing construction for metrics of constant Q-curvature</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.09234v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We produce many new complete, constant Q-curvature metrics on finitely punctured spheres by gluing together known examples. In our construction we truncate one end of each summand and glue the two summands together "end-to-end," where we've truncated them. We use this construction to show that the unmarked moduli space of solutions with a fixed number of punctures is topologically nontrivial provided the number of punctures is at least four.</description>

      <title>A rigidity theorem for Einstein $4$-manifolds with semi-definite sectional curvature, and its consequences</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.09570</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.09570v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Any oriented $4$-dimensional Einstein metric with semi-definite sectional curvature satisfies the pointwise inequality \[ \frac{|s|}{\sqrt{6}}\geq|W^+|+|W^-|, \] where $s$, $W^+$ and $W^-$ are respectively the scalar curvature, the self-dual and anti-self-dual Weyl curvatures. We give a complete characterization of closed $4$-dimensional Einstein metrics with semi-definite sectional curvature saturating this pointwise inequality. We then present further consequences of this circle of ideas, in particular to the study of the geography of non-positively curved closed Einstein and Kaehler-Einstein $4$-manifolds. In the Kaehler-Einstein case, we obtain a sharp Gromov-Lueck type inequality.</description>

      <title>Refined algebraic domains with finite sets in the boundaries</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.09195</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.09195v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Refined algebraic domains are regions in the plane surrounded by finitely many non-singular real algebraic curves which may intersect with normal crossing. We are interested in shapes of such regions with surrounding real algebraic curves. Poincar'e-Reeb Graphs of them are graphs the regions naturally collapse to respecting the projection to a straight line. Such graphs were first formulated by Sorea, for example, around 2020, and regions surrounded by mutually disjoint non-singular real algebraic curves were mainly considered. The author has generalized the studies to several general situations.
  We find classes of such objects defined inductively by adding curves. We respect characteristic finite sets in the curves. We consider regions surrounded by the curves and of a new type. We investigate geometric properties and combinatorial ones of them and discuss important examples. We also previously studied explicit classes defined inductively in this way and review them.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.09455v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Shelukhin constructed a quasimorphism on the universal covering of the group of Hamiltonian diffeomorphisms for a general closed symplectic manifold. In the present paper, we prove the non-extendability of that quasimorphism for certain symplectic manifolds, such as a blow-up of torus and the product of a surface of genus at least two and a closed symplectic manifold. As its application, we prove the non-vanishing of Reznikov's characteristic class for the above symplectic manifolds.</description>

Abstract: We use filtrations of the tangent bundle of a manifold starting with an integrable subbundle to define transverse symbols to the corresponding foliation, define a condition of transversally Rockland and prove that transversally Rockland operators yield a K-homology class. We construct an equivariant KK-class for transversally Rockland transverse symbols and show a Poincare duality type result linking the class of an operator and its symbol.</description>

Abstract: We explore complex Riemannian geometry and Hermitian metrics on complex algebraic varieties and analytic spaces, respectively. In particular, we introduce Hermitian metrics on holomorphic Lie algebroids and examine the associated characteristic foliation with its canonically induced inner product. Furthermore, we study hypercohomologies related to the leaf space, leaves, and certain invariant subspaces arising from the characteristic foliation of a holomorphic Lie algebroid over a Hermitian manifold. Finally, we extend the concept of equivariant de Rham cohomology to the analytic setting.</description>

      <title>Stochastic Optimization Using Ricci Flow</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.04292</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.04292v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper proposes a theoretical framework for modeling and optimizing the bounded functions based on the Fourier series approximation and Ricci flow. Specifically, the initial manifold, $\mathcal{M}_0$ is approximated using Fourier series approximation in conjunction with the center and boundary sampling procedure introduced in the paper. The manifold is iteratively evolved using an algorithm that involves sampling along geodesic hyper-sphere defined by the Riemannian metric tensor. Thus obtained surrogate manifold is optimized by applying inverse Ricci flow i.e. instead of regularizing the manifold, flow allows for the high curvature regions to blow into finite time singularities. This allows for the singularities to occur at potential global optima assuming the deviation of the manifold at any point is smaller than the optimum. In addition, the error bound is established on the accuracy of the surrogate manifold. Finally, the proposed method is tested on stochastic sampling from five benchmark functions to illustrate the utility of this method.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2312.17509v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Manifolds endowed with a parabolic geometry in the sense of Cartan come with natural sequences of differential operators and their analysis provide the so called (curved) BGG sequence of {\v C}ap, Slov{\'a}k and Sou{\v c}ek. The sequences involved do not form an elliptic complex in the sense of Atiyah but enjoy similar properties. The proper framework to study these operators is the filtered calculus associated to the natural filtration of the tangent bundle induced by the parabolic geometry. Such analysis was carried over by Dave and Haller in a very general setting. In this article we use their methods associated with the transversal index theory for filtered manifolds developped by the author in a previous paper to derive curved BGG sequences for foliated manifolds with transverse parabolic geometry.</description>

      <title>Symbolic Approximations to Ricci-flat Metrics Via Extrinsic Symmetries of Calabi-Yau Hypersurfaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.19778</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.19778v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Ever since Yau's non-constructive existence proof of Ricci-flat metrics on Calabi-Yau manifolds, finding their explicit construction remains a major obstacle to development of both string theory and algebraic geometry. Recent computational approaches employ machine learning to create novel neural representations for approximating these metrics, offering high accuracy but limited interpretability. In this paper, we analyse machine learning approximations to flat metrics of Fermat Calabi-Yau n-folds and some of their one-parameter deformations in three dimensions in order to discover their new properties. We formalise cases in which the flat metric has more symmetries than the underlying manifold, and prove that these symmetries imply that the flat metric admits a surprisingly compact representation for certain choices of complex structure moduli. We show that such symmetries uniquely determine the flat metric on certain loci, for which we present an analytic form. We also incorporate our theoretical results into neural networks to reduce Ricci curvature for multiple Calabi--Yau manifolds compared to previous machine learning approaches. We conclude by distilling the ML models to obtain for the first time closed form expressions for Kahler metrics with near-zero scalar curvature.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2502.03756v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Given a conformal action of a discrete group on a Riemann surface, we study the maximization of Laplace and Steklov eigenvalues within a conformal class, considering metrics invariant under the group action. We establish natural conditions for the existence and regularity of maximizers. Our method simplifies previously known techniques for proving existence and regularity results in conformal class optimization. Finally, we provide a complete solution to the equivariant maximization problem for Laplace eigenvalues on the sphere and Steklov eigenvalues on the disk, resolving open questions posed by Arias-Marco et al. (2024) regarding the sharpness of the Hersch-Payne-Schiffer inequality and the maximization of Steklov eigenvalues by the standard disk among planar simply connected domains with $p\text{-rotational}$ symmetry.</description>
