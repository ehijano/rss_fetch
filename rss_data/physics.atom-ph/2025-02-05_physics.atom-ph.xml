      <title>Precision measurement of the last bound states in H$_2$ and determination of the H + H scattering length</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.01877</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.01877v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The binding energies of the five bound rotational levels $J=0-4$ in the highest vibrational level $v=14$ in the X$^1\Sigma_g^+$ ground electronic state of H$_2$ were measured in a three-step ultraviolet-laser experiment. Two-photon UV-photolysis of H$_2$S produced population in these high-lying bound states, that were subsequently interrogated at high precision via Doppler-free spectroscopy of the F$^1\Sigma_g^+$ - X$^1\Sigma_g^+$ system. A third UV-laser was used for detection through auto-ionizing resonances. The experimentally determined binding energies were found to be in excellent agreement with calculations based on non-adiabatic perturbation theory, also including relativistic and quantum electrodynamical contributions. The $s$-wave scattering length of the H + H system is derived from the binding energy of the last bound $J=0$ level via a direct semi-empirical approach, yielding a value of $a_s$ = 0.2724(5) $a_0$, in good agreement with a result from a previously followed theoretical approach. The subtle effect of the $m\alpha^4$ relativity contribution to $a_s$ was found to be significant. In a similar manner a value for the $p$-wave scattering volume is determined via the $J=1$ binding energy yielding $a_p$ = -134.0000(6) $a_0^3$. The binding energy of the last bound state in H$_2$, the ($v=14$, $J=4$) level, is determined at 0.023(4) cm$^{-1}$, in good agreement with calculation. The effect of the hyperfine substructure caused by the two hydrogen atoms at large internuclear separation, giving rise to three distinct dissociation limits, is discussed.</description>

      <title>Hanle Effect for Lifetime Analysis: Li-like Ions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.01509</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.01509v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Accurate lifetime measurements of excited states of highly charged ions (HCIs) are essential for advancing diagnostics in both laboratory and astrophysical plasmas, especially in the X-ray regime. The Hanle effect, which utilizes external magnetic fields to modify photon scattering patterns, provides a powerful technique for these measurements. Previously, this method has been successfully employed for He-like ions. Here, we present a theoretical study of the prospects of the Hanle effect for lifetime determinations of Li-like ions. Our results highlight the potential for plasma diagnostics and X-ray spectral analysis.</description>

      <title>Quantum Metrology via Floquet-Engineered Two-axis Twisting and Turn Dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.08524</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.08524v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: One core of quantum metrology is the utilization of entanglement to enhance measurement precision beyond the standard quantum limit. Here, we utilize the Floquet-engineered two-axis twisting (TAT) and turn dynamics to generate GHZ-like states for quantum metrology. Using both analytical semi-classical and quantum approaches, we find that the desired $N$-particle GHZ-like state can be produced in a remarkably short time $t_\mathrm{opt}\propto \ln{N}/{N}$, and its quantum Fisher information $F^\mathrm{opt}_\mathrm{Q}\propto N^2$ approaches the Heisenberg limit. Owing to the rapid state preparation, it shows outstanding robustness against decoherence. Moreover, using the Floquet-engineered anti-TAT-and-turn, one may implement an efficient interaction-based readout protocol to extract the signal encoded in this GHZ-like state. This Floquet-engineered anti-TAT-and-turn approach offers a viable method to achieve effective time-reversal dynamics to improve measurement precision and resilience against detection noise, all without the need to invert the sign of the nonlinear interaction. This study paves a way for achieving entanglement-enhanced quantum metrology via rapid generation of GHZ-like states at high particle numbers through continuous Floquet engineering.</description>

      <title>State Selective Preparation and Nondestructive Detection of Trapped ${\rm O}_2^+$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.14832</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.14832v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The ability to prepare molecular ions in selected quantum states enables studies in areas such as chemistry, metrology, spectroscopy, quantum information, and precision measurements. Here, we demonstrate $(2+1)$ resonance-enhanced multiphoton ionization (REMPI) of oxygen, both in a molecular beam and in an ion trap. The two-photon transition in the REMPI spectrum is rotationally resolved, allowing ionization from a selected rovibrational state of O$_2$. Fits to this spectrum determine spectroscopic parameters of the O$_2$ $d\,^1\Pi_g$ state and resolve a discrepancy in the literature regarding its band origin. The trapped molecular ions are cooled by co-trapped atomic ions. Fluorescence mass spectrometry nondestructively demonstrates the presence of the photoionized O$_2^+$. We discuss strategies for maximizing the fraction of ions produced in the ground rovibrational state. For $(2+1)$ REMPI through the $d\,^1\Pi_g$ state, we show that the Q(1) transition is preferred for neutral O$_2$ at rotational temperatures below 50~K, while the O(3) transition is more suitable at higher temperatures. The combination of state-selective loading and nondestructive detection of trapped molecular ions has applications in optical clocks, tests of fundamental physics, and control of chemical reactions.</description>
