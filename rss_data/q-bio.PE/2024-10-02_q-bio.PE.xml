      <title>Rate-induced biosphere collapse in the Daisyworld model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.00043</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.00043v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: There is much interest in the phenomenon of rate-induced tipping, where a system changes abruptly when forcings change faster than some critical rate. Here, we demonstrate and analyse rate-induced tipping in the classic "Daisyworld" model. The Daisyworld model considers a hypothetical planet inhabited only by two species of daisies with different reflectivities, and is notable because the daisies lead to an emergent "regulation" of the planet's temperature. The model serves as a useful thought experiment regarding the co-evolution of life and the global environment, and has been widely used in the teaching of Earth system science.
  We show that sufficiently fast changes in insolation (i.e. incoming sunlight) can cause life on Daisyworld to go extinct, even if life could in principle survive at any fixed insolation value among those encountered. Mathematically, this occurs due to the fact that the solution of the forced (nonautonomous) system crosses the stable manifold of a saddle point for the frozen (autonomous) system. The new discovery of rate-induced tipping in such a classic, simple, and well-studied model provides further supporting evidence that rate-induced tipping -- and indeed, rate-induced collapse -- may be common in a wide range of systems.</description>

      <title>Combinatorics of a dissimilarity measure for pairs of draws from discrete probability vectors on finite sets of objects</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.00221</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.00221v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Motivated by a problem in population genetics, we examine the combinatorics of dissimilarity for pairs of random unordered draws of multiple objects, with replacement, from a collection of distinct objects. Consider two draws of size $K$ taken with replacement from a set of $I$ objects, where the two draws represent samples from potentially distinct probability distributions over the set of $I$ objects. We define the set of \emph{identity states} for pairs of draws via a series of actions by permutation groups, describing the enumeration of all such states for a given $K \geq 2$ and $I \geq 2$. Given two probability vectors for the $I$ objects, we compute the probability of each identity state. From the set of all such probabilities, we obtain the expectation for a dissimilarity measure, finding that it has a simple form that generalizes a result previously obtained for the case of $K=2$. We determine when the expected dissimilarity between two draws from the same probability distribution exceeds that of two draws taken from different probability distributions. We interpret the results in the setting of the genetics of polyploid organisms, those whose genetic material contains many copies of the genome ($K &gt; 2$).</description>

      <title>On the correctness of Maximum Parsimony for data with few substitutions in the NNI neighborhood of phylogenetic trees</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.01282</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.01282v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Estimating phylogenetic trees, which depict the relationships between different species, from aligned sequence data (such as DNA, RNA, or proteins) is one of the main aims of evolutionary biology. However, tree reconstruction criteria like maximum parsimony do not necessarily lead to unique trees and in some cases even fail to recognize the \enquote{correct} tree (i.e., the tree on which the data was generated). On the other hand, a recent study has shown that for an alignment containing precisely those binary characters (sites) which require up to two substitutions on a given tree, this tree will be the unique maximum parsimony tree.
  It is the aim of the present paper to generalize this recent result in the following sense: We show that for a tree $T$ with $n$ leaves, as long as $k&lt;\frac{n}{8}+\frac{11}{9}-\frac{1}{18}\sqrt{9\cdot \left(\frac{n}{4}\right)^2+16}$ (or, equivalently, $n&gt;9 k-11+\sqrt{9k^2-22 k+17} $, which in particular holds for all $n\geq 12k$), the maximum parsimony tree for the alignment containing all binary characters which require (up to or precisely) $k$ substitutions on $T$ will be unique in the NNI neighborhood of $T$ and it will coincide with $T$, too. In other words, within the NNI neighborhood of $T$, $T$ is the unique most parsimonious tree for the said alignment. This partially answers a recently published conjecture affirmatively. Additionally, we show that for $n\geq 8$ and for $k$ being in the order of $\frac{n}{2}$, there is always a pair of phylogenetic trees $T$ and $T'$ which are NNI neighbors, but for which the alignment of characters requiring precisely $k$ substitutions each on $T$ in total requires fewer substitutions on $T'$.</description>

      <title>Dominance to egalitarian transition in diverse communities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.08451</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.08451v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Diverse communities of competing species are generally characterized by substantial niche overlap and strongly stochastic dynamics. Abundance fluctuations are proportional to population size, so the dynamics of rare populations is slower. Hence, once a population becomes rare, its abundance gets stuck at low values. Here, we analyze the effect of this phenomenon on community structure. We identify two different phases: a dominance phase, in which a tiny number of species constitute most of the community, and an egalitarian phase, where it takes a finite fraction of all species to constitute most of the community. We demonstrate the validity of the theory using empirical findings for a variety of hyperdiverse communities, and clarify the role of demographic stochasticity in shaping patterns of commonness and rarity.</description>

      <title>Branch length statistics in phylogenetic trees under constant-rate birth-death models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.13403</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.13403v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Phylogenetic trees represent the evolutionary relationships between extant lineages, where extinct or non-sampled lineages are omitted. Extending the work of Stadler and collaborators, this paper focuses on the branch lengths in phylogenetic trees arising under a constant-rate birth-death model. We derive branch length distributions of phylogenetic branches with and without random sampling of individuals of the extant population under two distinct statistical scenarios: a fixed age of the birth-death process and a fixed number of individuals at the time of observation. We find that branches connected to the tree leaves (pendant branches) and branches in the interior of the tree behave very differently under sampling: pendant branches get longer as the sampling probability is decreased, whereas the distribution of interior branches quickly reaches an asymptotic regime.</description>

      <title>AgentBasedModeling.jl: a tool for stochastic simulation of structured population dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.19294</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.19294v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Agent-based models capture heterogeneity among individuals in a population and are widely used in studies of multi-cellular systems, disease, epidemics and demography to name a few. However, existing frameworks consider discrete time-step simulation or assume that agents' states only change as a result of discrete events. In this note, we present AgentBasedModeling$.$jl, a Julia package for simulating stochastic agent-based population models in continuous time. The tool allows to easily specify and simulate agents evolving through generic continuous-time jump-diffusions and interacting via continuous-rate processes. AgentBasedModeling$.$jl provides a powerful methodology for studying the effects of stochasticity on structured population dynamics.</description>
