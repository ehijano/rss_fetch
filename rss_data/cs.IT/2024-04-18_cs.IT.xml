      <title>Low-Complexity Block-Based Decoding Algorithms for Short Block Channels</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.10798</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.10798v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper presents low-complexity block-based encoding and decoding algorithms for short block length channels. In terms of the precise use-case, we are primarily concerned with the baseline 3GPP Short block transmissions in which payloads are encoded by Reed-Muller codes and paired with orthogonal DMRS. In contemporary communication systems, the short block decoding often employs the utilization of DMRS-based least squares channel estimation, followed by maximum likelihood decoding. However, this methodology can incur substantial computational complexity when processing long bit length codes. We propose an innovative approach to tackle this challenge by introducing the principle of block/segment encoding using First-Order RM Codes which is amenable to low-cost decoding through block-based fast Hadamard transforms. The Block-based FHT has demonstrated to be cost-efficient with regards to decoding time, as it evolves from quadric to quasi-linear complexity with a manageable decline in performance. Additionally, by incorporating an adaptive DMRS/data power adjustment technique, we can bridge/reduce the performance gap and attain high sensitivity, leading to a good trade-off between performance and complexity to efficiently handle small payloads.</description>

      <title>Characterization of Capacity and Outage of RIS-aided Downlink Systems under Rician Fading</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.10893</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.10893v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This letter presents optimal beamforming and outage analysis for a Reconfigurable Intelligent Surface (RIS)-aided multiple input single output downlink system under Rician fading on both the direct and the RIS-assisted indirect links. We focus on maximizing the capacity for two transmitter architectures: fully digital (FD) and fully analog (FA). This capacity maximization problem with optimally configured RIS is shown to be $L_1$ norm-maximization with respect to the transmit beamformer. To obtain the optimal FD beamformer, we propose a complex $L_1$-PCA-based algorithm whose complexity is significantly lower than the existing semi-definite relaxation-based solutions. We also propose a low-complexity optimal beamforming algorithm to obtain the FA beamformer solution. Further, we derive analytical upper bounds on the SNR achievable by the proposed algorithms and utilize them to characterize the lower bounds on outage probabilities. The derived bounds are numerically shown to closely match the achievable performance for a low-rank channel matrix and are shown to be exact for a unit-rank channel matrix.</description>

      <title>Algorithms for Computing the Augustin--Csisz\'ar Mutual Information and Lapidoth--Pfister Mutual Information</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.10950</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.10950v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Augustin--Csisz{\' a}r mutual information (MI) and Lapidoth--Pfister MI are well-known generalizations of the Shannon MI, but do not have known closed-form expressions, so they need to be calculated by solving optimization problems. In this study, we propose alternating optimization algorithms for computing these types of MI and present proofs of their global convergence properties. We also provide a novel variational characterization of the Augustin--Csisz{\' a}r MI that is similar to that of the Sibson MI.</description>

      <title>Integrated Communication, Navigation, and Remote Sensing in LEO Networks with Vehicular Applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.10969</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.10969v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Traditionally, communication, navigation, and remote sensing (CNR) satellites are separately performed, leading to resource waste, information isolation, and independent optimization for each functionality. Taking future automated driving as an example, it faces great challenges in providing high-reliable and low-latency lane-level positioning, decimeter-level transportation observation, and huge traffic sensing information downloading. To this end, this article proposes an integrated CNR (ICNR) framework based on low earth orbit (LEO) satellite mega-constellations from the perspective of vehicular applications. After introducing the main working principles of the CNR functionalities to serve as the technological basis, we characterize the potentials of the integration gain in vehicular use cases. Then, we investigate the ICNR framework in different integration levels, which sheds strong light on qualitative performance improvement by sophisticatedly sharing orbit constellation, wireless resource, and data information towards meeting the requirements of vehicular applications. We also instantiate a fundamental numerical case study to demonstrate the integration gain and highlight the main tradeoffs in managing the ICNR networks from the perspective of vehicular applications.</description>

      <title>Approximate Wireless Communication for Lossy Gradient Updates in IoT Federated Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.11035</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.11035v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Federated learning (FL) has emerged as a distributed machine learning (ML) technique that can protect local data privacy for participating clients and improve system efficiency. Instead of sharing raw data, FL exchanges intermediate learning parameters, such as gradients, among clients. This article presents an efficient wireless communication approach tailored for FL parameter transmission, especially for Internet of Things (IoT) devices, to facilitate model aggregation. Our study considers practical wireless channels that can lead to random bit errors, which can substantially affect FL performance. Motivated by empirical gradient value distribution, we introduce a novel received bit masking method that confines received gradient values within prescribed limits. Moreover, given the intrinsic error resilience of ML gradients, our approach enables the delivery of approximate gradient values with errors without resorting to extensive error correction coding or retransmission. This strategy reduces computational overhead at both the transmitter and the receiver and minimizes communication latency. Consequently, our scheme is particularly well-suited for resource-constrained IoT devices. Additionally, we explore the inherent protection of the most significant bits (MSBs) through gray coding in high-order modulation. Our simulations demonstrate that our proposed scheme can effectively mitigate random bit errors in FL performance, achieving similar learning objectives, but with the 50% air time required by existing methods involving error correction and retransmission.</description>

      <title>Optimum Achievable Rates in Two Random Number Generation Problems with $f$-Divergences Using Smooth R\'enyi Entropy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.11097</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.11097v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Two typical fixed-length random number generation problems in information theory are considered for general sources. One is the source resolvability problem and the other is the intrinsic randomness problem. In each of these problems, the optimum achievable rate with respect to the given approximation measure is one of our main concerns and has been characterized using two different information quantities: the information spectrum and the smooth R\'enyi entropy. Recently, optimum achievable rates with respect to $f$-divergences have been characterized using the information spectrum quantity. The $f$-divergence is a general non-negative measure between two probability distributions on the basis of a convex function $f$. The class of f-divergences includes several important measures such as the variational distance, the KL divergence, the Hellinger distance and so on. Hence, it is meaningful to consider the random number generation problems with respect to $f$-divergences. However, optimum achievable rates with respect to $f$-divergences using the smooth R\'enyi entropy have not been clarified yet in both of two problems. In this paper we try to analyze the optimum achievable rates using the smooth R\'enyi entropy and to extend the class of $f$-divergence. To do so, we first derive general formulas of the first-order optimum achievable rates with respect to $f$-divergences in both problems under the same conditions as imposed by previous studies. Next, we relax the conditions on $f$-divergence and generalize the obtained general formulas. Then, we particularize our general formulas to several specified functions $f$. As a result, we reveal that it is easy to derive optimum achievable rates for several important measures from our general formulas. Furthermore, a kind of duality between the resolvability and the intrinsic randomness is revealed in terms of the smooth R\'enyi entropy.</description>

      <title>On the Performance of RIS-assisted Networks with HQAM</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.11136</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.11136v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we investigate the application of hexagonal quadrature amplitude modulation (HQAM) in reconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS)-assisted networks, specifically focusing on its efficiency in reducing the number of required reflecting elements. Specifically, we present analytical expressions for the average symbol error probability (ASEP) and propose a new metric for conditioned energy efficiency, which assesses the network energy consumption while ensuring the ASEP remains below a certain threshold. Additionally, we introduce an innovative detection algorithm for HQAM constellations that implements sphere decoding in O(1) complexity. Finally, our study reveals that HQAM significantly enhances both the ASEP and energy efficiency compared to traditional quadrature amplitude modulation (QAM) schemes.</description>

      <title>Destructive and constructive RIS beamforming in an ISAC-multi-user MIMO network</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.11314</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.11314v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) has already established itself as a promising solution to the spectrum scarcity problem, even more so when paired with a reconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS) as RISs can shape the propagation environment by adjusting their phase-shift coefficients. Albeit the potential performance gain, a RIS also poses a security threat to the system: in this paper, we explore both sides of the RIS presence in a multi-user MIMO (multiple-input multiple-output) ISAC network. We first develop an alternating optimization algorithm, obtaining the active and passive beamforming vectors maximizing the sensing signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) under minimum signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio (SINR) constraints for the communication users and finite power budget. We also investigate the destructive potential of RIS by devising a RIS phase-shift optimization algorithm that minimizes sensing SNR while preserving the same minimum communication SINR previously guaranteed by the system. We further investigate the impact of the RIS's individual element failures on the system performances. The simulation results show that the RIS performance-boosting potential is as good as its destructive one and that both of our optimization strategies show some resilience towards the investigated impairments.</description>

      <title>Batch Array Codes</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.11409v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Batch codes are a type of codes specifically designed for coded distributed storage systems and private information retrieval protocols. These codes have got much attention in recent years due to their ability to enable efficient and secure storage in distributed systems.
  In this paper, we study an array code version of the batch codes, which is called the \emph{batch array code} (BAC). Under the setting of BAC, each node stores a bucket containing multiple code symbols and responds with a locally computed linear combination of the symbols in its bucket during the recovery of a requested symbol. We demonstrate that BACs can support the same type of requests as the original batch codes but with reduced redundancy. Specifically, we establish information theoretic lower bounds on the code lengths and provide several code constructions that confirm the tightness of the lower bounds for certain parameter regimes.</description>

      <title>Low-Density Parity-Check Codes and Spatial Coupling for Quantitative Group Testing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.11463</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.11463v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A non-adaptive quantitative group testing (GT) scheme based on sparse codes-on-graphs in combination with low-complexity peeling decoding was introduced and analyzed by Karimi et al.. In this work, we propose a variant of this scheme based on low-density parity-check codes where the BCH codes at the constraint nodes are replaced by simple single parity-check codes. Furthermore, we apply spatial coupling to both GT schemes, perform a density evolution analysis, and compare their performance with and without coupling. Our analysis shows that both schemes improve with increasing coupling memory, and for all considered cases, it is observed that the LDPC code-based scheme substantially outperforms the original scheme. Simulation results for finite block length confirm the asymptotic density evolution thresholds.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.11024v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper investigates the information geometrical structure of a determinantal point process (DPP). It demonstrates that a DPP is embedded in the exponential family of log-linear models. The extent of deviation from an exponential family is analyzed using the $\mathrm{e}$-embedding curvature tensor, which identifies partially flat parameters of a DPP. On the basis of this embedding structure, the duality related to a marginal kernel and an $L$-ensemble kernel is discovered.</description>

      <title>An Information-Theoretic Analog of the Twin Paradox</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.11862</link>
      <description>arXiv:2309.11862v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We revisit the familiar scenario involving two parties in relative motion, in which Alice stays at rest while Bob goes on a journey at speed $\beta c$ along an arbitrary trajectory and reunites with Alice after a certain period of time. It is a well-known consequence of special relativity that the time that passes until they meet again is different for the two parties and is shorter in Bob's frame by a factor of $\sqrt{1-\beta^2}$. We investigate how this asymmetry manifests from an information-theoretic viewpoint. Assuming that Alice and Bob transmit signals of equal average power to each other during the whole journey, and that additive white Gaussian noise is present at both sides, we show that the maximum number of bits per second that Alice can transmit reliably to Bob is always higher than the one Bob can transmit to Alice. Equivalently, the energy per bit invested by Alice is lower than that invested by Bob, meaning that the traveler is less efficient from the communication perspective, as conjectured by Jarett and Cover.</description>

      <title>Bridging the complexity gap in Tbps-achieving THz-band baseband processing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.16027</link>
      <description>arXiv:2309.16027v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Recent advances in electronic and photonic technologies have allowed efficient signal generation and transmission at terahertz (THz) frequencies. However, as the gap in THz-operating devices narrows, the demand for terabit-per-second (Tbps)-achieving circuits is increasing. Translating the available hundreds of gigahertz (GHz) of bandwidth into a Tbps data rate requires processing thousands of information bits per clock cycle at state-of-the-art clock frequencies of digital baseband processing circuitry of a few GHz. This paper addresses these constraints and emphasizes the importance of parallelization in signal processing, particularly for channel code decoding. By leveraging structured sub-spaces of THz channels, we propose mapping bits to transmission resources using shorter code-words, extending parallelizability across all baseband processing blocks. THz channels exhibit quasi-deterministic frequency, time, and space structures that enable efficient parallel bit mapping at the source and provide pseudo-soft bit reliability information for efficient detection and decoding at the receiver.</description>

      <title>Graph Set-colorings And Hypergraphs In Topological Coding</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2201.13354</link>
      <description>arXiv:2201.13354v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In order to make more complex number-based strings from topological coding for defending against the intelligent attacks equipped with quantum computing and providing effective protection technology for the age of quantum computing, we will introduce set-colored graphs admitting set-colorings that has been considerable cryptanalytic significance, and especially related with hypergraphs. We use the set-coloring of graphs to reflect the intersection of elements, and add other constraint requirements to express more connections between sets (as hyperedges). Since we try to find some easy and effective techniques based on graph theory for practical application, we use intersected-graphs admitting set-colorings defined on hyperedge sets to observe topological structures of hypergraphs, string-type Topcode-matrix, set-type Topcode-matrix, graph-type Topcode-matrix, hypergraph-type Topcode-matrix, matrix-type Topcode-matrix \emph{etc}. We will show that each connected graph is the intersected-graph of some hypergraph and investigate hypergraph's connectivity, colorings of hypergraphs, hypergraph homomorphism, hypernetworks, scale-free network generator, compound hypergraphs having their intersected-graphs with vertices to be hypergraphs (for high-dimensional extension diagram). Naturally, we get various graphic lattices, such as edge-coincided intersected-graph lattice, vertex-coincided intersected-graph lattice, edge-hamiltonian graphic lattice, hypergraph lattice and intersected-network lattice. Many techniques in this article can be translated into polynomial algorithms, since we are aiming to apply hypergraphs and graph set-colorings to homomorphic encryption and asymmetric cryptograph.</description>

      <title>Learning Algorithm Generalization Error Bounds via Auxiliary Distributions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2210.00483</link>
      <description>arXiv:2210.00483v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Generalization error bounds are essential for comprehending how well machine learning models work. In this work, we suggest a novel method, i.e., the Auxiliary Distribution Method, that leads to new upper bounds on expected generalization errors that are appropriate for supervised learning scenarios. We show that our general upper bounds can be specialized under some conditions to new bounds involving the $\alpha$-Jensen-Shannon, $\alpha$-R\'enyi ($0&lt; \alpha &lt; 1$) information between a random variable modeling the set of training samples and another random variable modeling the set of hypotheses. Our upper bounds based on $\alpha$-Jensen-Shannon information are also finite. Additionally, we demonstrate how our auxiliary distribution method can be used to derive the upper bounds on excess risk of some learning algorithms in the supervised learning context {\blue and the generalization error under the distribution mismatch scenario in supervised learning algorithms, where the distribution mismatch is modeled as $\alpha$-Jensen-Shannon or $\alpha$-R\'enyi divergence between the distribution of test and training data samples distributions.} We also outline the conditions for which our proposed upper bounds might be tighter than other earlier upper bounds.</description>

      <title>Precise Asymptotics for Spectral Methods in Mixed Generalized Linear Models</title>

Abstract: In a mixed generalized linear model, the objective is to learn multiple signals from unlabeled observations: each sample comes from exactly one signal, but it is not known which one. We consider the prototypical problem of estimating two statistically independent signals in a mixed generalized linear model with Gaussian covariates. Spectral methods are a popular class of estimators which output the top two eigenvectors of a suitable data-dependent matrix. However, despite the wide applicability, their design is still obtained via heuristic considerations, and the number of samples $n$ needed to guarantee recovery is super-linear in the signal dimension $d$. In this paper, we develop exact asymptotics on spectral methods in the challenging proportional regime in which $n, d$ grow large and their ratio converges to a finite constant. By doing so, we are able to optimize the design of the spectral method, and combine it with a simple linear estimator, in order to minimize the estimation error. Our characterization exploits a mix of tools from random matrices, free probability and the theory of approximate message passing algorithms. Numerical simulations for mixed linear regression and phase retrieval demonstrate the advantage enabled by our analysis over existing designs of spectral methods.</description>

      <title>Information theory for data-driven model reduction in physics and biology</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.06608</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.06608v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Model reduction is the construction of simple yet predictive descriptions of the dynamics of many-body systems in terms of a few relevant variables. A prerequisite to model reduction is the identification of these relevant variables, a task for which no general method exists. Here, we develop a systematic approach based on the information bottleneck to identify the relevant variables, defined as those most predictive of the future. We elucidate analytically the relation between these relevant variables and the eigenfunctions of the transfer operator describing the dynamics. Further, we show that in the limit of high compression, the relevant variables are directly determined by the slowest-decaying eigenfunctions. Our information-based approach indicates when to optimally stop increasing the complexity of the reduced model. Furthermore, it provides a firm foundation to construct interpretable deep learning tools that perform model reduction. We illustrate how these tools work in practice by considering uncurated videos of atmospheric flows from which our algorithms automatically extract the dominant slow collective variables, as well as experimental videos of cyanobacteria colonies in which we discover an emergent synchronization order parameter.</description>

      <title>Semantic Communication for Cooperative Multi-Task Processing over Wireless Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.08483</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.08483v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we have expanded the current status of semantic communication limited to processing one task to a more general system that can handle multiple tasks concurrently. In pursuit of this, we first introduced our definition of the "semantic source", enabling the interpretation of multiple semantics based on a single observation. A semantic encoder design is then introduced, featuring the division of the encoder into a common unit and multiple specific units enabling cooperative multi-task processing. Simulation results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed semantic source and the system design. Our approach employs information maximization (infomax) and end-to-end design principles.</description>
