      <title>A typology of activities over a century of urban growth</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.03263</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.03263v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Contemporary literature on the dynamics of economic activities in growing cities mainly focused on a few years or decades time frames. Using a new geo-historical database constructed from historical directories with about 1 million entries, we present a comprehensive analysis of the dynamics of activities in a major city, Paris, over almost a century (1829-1907). Our analysis suggests that activities that accompany city growth can be classified in different categories according to their dynamics and their scaling with population: (i) linear for everyday needs of residents (food stores, clothing retailers, health care practitioners), (ii) sublinear for public services (legal, administrative, educational), (iii) superlinear for the city's specific features (passing fads, specialization, timely needs). The dynamics of these activities is in addition very sensitive to historical perturbations such as large scale public works or political conflicts. These results shed light on the evolution of activities, a crucial component of growing cities.</description>

      <title>Spectral signatures of structural change in financial networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.03349</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.03349v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The level of systemic risk in economic and financial systems is strongly determined by the structure of the underlying networks of interdependent entities that can propagate shocks and stresses. Since changes in network structure imply changes in risk levels, it is important to identify structural transitions potentially leading to system-wide crises. Methods have been proposed to assess whether a real-world network is in a (quasi-)stationary state by checking the consistency of its structural evolution with appropriate maximum-entropy ensembles of graphs. While previous analyses of this kind have focused on dyadic and triadic motifs, hence disregarding higher-order structures, here we consider closed walks of any length. Specifically, we study the ensemble properties of the spectral radius of random graph models calibrated on real-world evolving networks. Our approach is shown to work remarkably well for directed networks, both binary and weighted. As illustrative examples, we consider the Electronic Market for Interbank Deposit (e-MID), the Dutch Interbank Network (DIN) and the International Trade Network (ITN) in their evolution across the 2008 crisis. By monitoring the deviation of the spectral radius from its ensemble expectation, we find that the ITN remains in a (quasi-)equilibrium state throughout the period considered, while both the DIN and e-MID exhibit a clear out-of-equilibrium behaviour. The spectral deviation therefore captures ongoing topological changes, extending over all length scales, to provide a compact proxy of the resilience of economic and financial networks.</description>

      <title>Ensuring resilience to extreme weather events increases the ambition of mitigation scenarios on solar power and storage uptake: a study on the Italian power system</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.03593</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.03593v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study explores compounding impacts of climate change on power system's load and generation, emphasising the need to integrate adaptation and mitigation strategies into investment planning. We combine existing and novel empirical evidence to model impacts on: i) air-conditioning demand; ii) thermal power outages; iii) hydro-power generation shortages. Using a power dispatch and capacity expansion model, we analyse the Italian power system's response to these climate impacts in 2030, integrating mitigation targets and optimising for cost-efficiency at an hourly resolution. We outline different meteorological scenarios to explore the impacts of both average climatic changes and the intensification of extreme weather events. We find that addressing extreme weather in power system planning will require an extra 5-8 GW of photovoltaic (PV) capacity, on top of the 50 GW of the additional solar PV capacity required by the mitigation target alone. Despite the higher initial investments, we find that the adoption of renewable technologies, especially PV, alleviates the power system's vulnerability to climate change and extreme weather events. Furthermore, enhancing short-term storage with lithium-ion batteries is crucial to counterbalance the reduced availability of dispatchable hydro generation.</description>

      <title>Signature of maturity in cryptocurrency volatility</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.03676</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.03676v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the fluctuations, particularly the inequality of fluctuations, in cryptocurrency prices over the last ten years. We calculate the inequality in the price fluctuations through different measures, such as the Gini and Kolkata indices, and also the $Q$ factor (given by the ratio between the highest value and the average value) of these fluctuations. We compare the results with the equivalent quantities in some of the more prominent national currencies and see that while the fluctuations (or inequalities in such fluctuations) for cryptocurrencies were initially significantly higher than national currencies, over time the fluctuation levels of cryptocurrencies tend towards the levels characteristic of national currencies. We also compare similar quantities for a few prominent stock prices.</description>

      <title>Fast algorithms to improve fair information access in networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.03127</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.03127v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: When information spreads across a network via pairwise sharing, large disparities in information access can arise from the network's structural heterogeneity. Algorithms to improve the fairness of information access seek to maximize the minimum access of a node to information by sequentially selecting new nodes to seed with the spreading information. However, existing algorithms are computationally expensive. Here, we develop and evaluate a set of 10 new scalable algorithms to improve information access in social networks; in order to compare them to the existing state-of-the-art, we introduce both a new performance metric and a new benchmark corpus of networks. Additionally, we investigate the degree to which algorithm performance on minimizing information access gaps can be predicted ahead of time from features of a network's structure. We find that while no algorithm is strictly superior to all others across networks, our new scalable algorithms are competitive with the state-of-the-art and orders of magnitude faster. We introduce a meta-learner approach that learns which of the fast algorithms is best for a specific network and is on average only 20% less effective than the state-of-the-art performance on held-out data, while about 75-130 times faster. Furthermore, on about 20% of networks the meta-learner's performance exceeds the state-of-the-art.</description>

      <title>A Comparative Analysis of Wealth Index Predictions in Africa between three Multi-Source Inference Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.01631</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.01631v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Poverty map inference is a critical area of research, with growing interest in both traditional and modern techniques, ranging from regression models to convolutional neural networks applied to tabular data, images, and networks. Despite extensive focus on the validation of training phases, the scrutiny of final predictions remains limited. Here, we compare the Relative Wealth Index (RWI) inferred by Chi et al. (2022) with the International Wealth Index (IWI) inferred by Lee and Braithwaite (2022) and Esp\'in-Noboa et al. (2023) across six Sub-Saharan African countries. Our analysis focuses on identifying trends and discrepancies in wealth predictions over time. Our results show that the predictions by Chi et al. and Esp\'in-Noboa et al. align with general GDP trends, with differences expected due to the distinct time-frames of the training sets. However, predictions by Lee and Braithwaite diverge significantly, indicating potential issues with the validity of the model. These discrepancies highlight the need for policymakers and stakeholders in Africa to rigorously audit models that predict wealth, especially those used for decision-making on the ground. These and other techniques require continuous verification and refinement to enhance their reliability and ensure that poverty alleviation strategies are well-founded.</description>
