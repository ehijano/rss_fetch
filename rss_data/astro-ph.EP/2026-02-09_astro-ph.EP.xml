      <title>Probing habitable regions with SRG/eROSITA</title>

      <description>arXiv:2602.06124v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Stellar high-energy radiation is a key driver of atmospheric erosion and evolution in exoplanets, directly affecting their long-term habitability. We present a comprehensive study on stellar high-energy radiation and its impact on exoplanetary atmospheres, leveraging data from the \textit{SRG/eROSITA} all-sky survey. Our sample consists of 3750 main-sequence stars identified by cross-matching with \textit{Gaia} DR3. Utilizing X-ray spectral fits from the \textit{eROSITA} catalog, we computed X-ray ($L_X$) and combined extreme-ultraviolet (EUV) luminosities ($L_{\mathrm{EUV}}$), which we used to derive XUV fluxes at the habitable zone ($F_{\mathrm{XUV,HZ}}$). We find that the majority of stars in our sample are significantly more XUV-active than the Sun, with habitable zone fluxes ranging from $10^0$ to $10^5$ erg~cm$^{-2}$~s$^{-1}$. The ratio of $L_{\mathrm{XUV}}/L_{\mathrm{bol}}$ is found to be higher for cooler, magnetically active stars, highlighting their potentially hazardous nature for planetary atmospheres. Applying the energy-limited escape model, we computed atmospheric mass-loss rates for hypothetical earth-like planets located at the habitable zone of each star. We also present local maps for distances up to $500$~pc of the average XUV flux, revealing ``hazard zones'' where stellar radiation could significantly influence planetary atmospheric evolution. This work demonstrates the power of X-ray surveys in constraining the high-energy environments of exoplanets and underscores the critical role of stellar activity in planetary habitability.</description>

      <title>Satellites and small bodies with ALMA: Insights into Solar System formation &amp; evolution</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.06126</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.06126v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Our understanding of the formation and evolution of planetary systems has made major advances in the past decade. This progress has been driven in large part by the Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array (ALMA), which has given us an unprecedented view of Solar System bodies themselves, and of the structure and chemistry of forming exoplanetary systems. Within our own Solar System, ALMA has enabled the detection of new molecules and isotopologues across moons and comets, as well as placing new constraints on the compositions and histories of small bodies through thermal emission observations. In this article, we highlight some key areas where ALMA has contributed to a deeper understanding of our Solar System's formation and evolution, and place these discoveries in the context of our evolving understanding of protoplanetary disks.</description>

      <title>Simulated LSST Observations of Real Metre-scale Impactors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.06314</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.06314v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Using real metre-sized asteroid Earth impactors from the last decade, we ask the question: ``If the Vera C. Rubin Observatory's Legacy Survey of Space and Time (LSST) had been operating over the last 10 years, how many imminent impactors would it have observed and discovered pre-impact?'' We feed 216 large impacts detected by global coverage orbital sensors through the LSST Solar System Survey Simulator Sorcha, and find that it would have made 99 observations of 28 unique objects, and discovered one object four days pre-impact. Recently proposed pipeline modifications would increase this discovery number to seven. Scaling our results to take into account the biases of our reference population, we estimate that LSST will discover 12 +/- 3 imminent impactors over its nominal 10 year survey, with an average warning time of 3.5 days. While this is at the low end of previous estimates of 1 - 10 discoveries per year, the significant increase in warning time compared to the current average (9 hours across 11 impactors) will bring significant opportunities for follow-up telescopic observations, deployment of specialised equipment for fireball observations, and planetary defence operations. We also show that the LSST will provide substantial precovery data for impactors discovered by other surveys, instantly lengthening observation arcs and thereby reducing the orbital and impact location uncertainties. In some cases, these observations may also enable the linkage of telescopic observations with observed fireballs post-impact, providing valuable pre-impact astrometric and photometric data. This has significant implications for both asteroid research and planetary defence.</description>

      <title>Reversal of Spin: Comet 41P/Tuttle-Giacobini-Kresak</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.06403</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.06403v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The rotations of cometary nuclei are known to change in response to outgassing torques. The nucleus of comet 41P/Tuttle-Giacobini-Kresak exhibited particularly dramatic rotational changes when near perihelion in 2017 April. Here, we use archival Hubble Space Telescope observations from 2017 December to study the post-perihelion lightcurve of the nucleus and to assess the nucleus size. From both Hubble photometry and non-gravitational acceleration measurements we find a diminutive nucleus with effective radius r = 500+/-100 m. Systematic optical variations are consistent with a two-peaked (i.e., rotationally symmetric) lightcurve with period 0.60+/-0.01 days, substantially different from periods measured earlier in 2017. The spin of the nucleus likely reversed between perihelion in 2017 April and December as a result of the strong outgassing torque. We infer a dimensionless moment arm k = 0.013, about twice the median value in short-period comets. The lightcurve range of 0.4 magnitudes indicates a projected nucleus axis ratio greater than 1.4:1, while the active fraction of the nucleus decreased from 2.4 in 2001 (suggesting augmentation of the gas production by sublimating coma ice grains) to 0.14 in 2017, a result of long-term modification of the surface. We find that the physical lifetime of this small nucleus to spin-up is short compared to the reported 1500 year dynamical time spent in the current orbit. Two limiting reconciliations of this inequality are suggested. The nucleus could be in a state of unusually strong activity, leading us to over-estimate the average mass loss rate and outgassing torque and so to under-estimate the physical lifetime. Alternatively, the nucleus could be the surviving remnant of a once larger body for which outgassing torques were less effective in changing the spin.</description>

      <title>AB Aur, a Rosetta stone for studies of planet formation (IV): C/O estimates from CS and SO interferometric observations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.06551</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.06551v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Context. Protoplanetary disks are the birthplace of planets. As such, they set the initial chemical abundances available for planetary atmosphere formation. Thus, studying elemental abundances, molecular compositions, and abundance ratios in protoplanetary disks is key to linking planetary atmospheres to their formation sites. Aims. We aim to derive the sulfur abundance and the C/O ratio in the AB Aur disk using interferometric observations of CS and SO. Methods. New NOEMA observations of CS 3-2 towards AB Aur are presented. We used velocity-integrated intensity maps to determine the inclination and position angles. Keplerian masks were constructed for all observed species to assess the presence of non-Keplerian motions. We use the CS/SO ratio to study the C/O ratio. We compare our present and previous interferometric observations of AB Aur with a NAUTILUS disk model to gain insight into the S elemental abundance and C/O ratio. Results. We derive an observational CS/SO ratio ranging from 1.8 to 2.6. Only NAUTILUS models with C/O &gt; 1 can reproduce such ratios. The comparison with models points to strong sulfur depletion, with [S/H]=8e-8, but we note that no single model can simultaneously fit all observed species.</description>

      <title>The effect of JWST/NIRSpec data reduction on the retrieval of WASP-39b atmospheric properties</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.06722</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.06722v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The JWST provides exoplanet transit observations with unprecedented spectral coverage, enabling detailed atmospheric characterisation. However, systematics introduced during data reduction can lead to small but significant uncertainties that propagate into atmospheric retrievals, making it essential to assess their impact on inferred properties.
  We aim to quantify the impact of different JWST/NIRSpec PRISM data-reduction processes as well as the relevance of saturation on the retrieved atmospheric properties of WASP-39b. We also assess whether or not these biases are comparable to those introduced by assumptions made in atmospheric modelling, particularly in the treatment of aerosol extinction.
  We perform nested-sampling Bayesian retrievals using MultiNest and forward models generated with the Planetary Spectrum Generator. Six independently reduced spectra are analysed, considering both the full wavelength range and versions excluding the saturated region. We further test the effect of including three different cloud-opacity parameterisations.
  Differences among JWST/NIRSpec data-reduction pipelines lead to substantial variations in retrieved atmospheric properties of WASP-39b, often exceeding one order of magnitude, comparable to uncertainties from modelling assumptions. Excluding the saturated region reduces inter-pipeline dispersion but increases parameter degeneracies. This highlights the need for robust and homogeneous calibration strategies. The results also confirm that JWST data possess the sensitivity required to probe aerosol spectral behaviour, although such constraints remain strongly dependent on the adopted data-reduction strategy.</description>

      <title>Astrometric follow-up of near-Earth asteroid 2024 YR4 during a Torino scale level 3 alert</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.06890</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.06890v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The discovery of 2024 YR4 presented the planetary defense community with the most significant impact threat in almost two decades, reaching level 3 on the Torino scale. The community, now mature and well-organized, responded with a global observational effort. Astrometric measurements, forming the basis for orbital refinement and impact prediction, were a central component of this response. In this paper, we present the astrometric data collected by the international community, from the time of discovery until the object became too faint for all existing observational assets, including JWST. We also discuss the coordination role played by the International Asteroid Warning Network, and the importance of publicly available image archives to enable precovery searches.</description>

      <title>Real time, cross platform visualizations with zero dependencies for the N-body package REBOUND</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.06735</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.06735v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Visualizations have become an indispensable part of the scientific process. A vibrant ecosystem of visualization tools exists, catering to a wide variety of different needs. Real-time visualizations of numerical simulations offer scientists immediate feedback about the status of their simulations and can also be valuable educational and outreach tools. Developing a visualization tool with support for different operating systems, CPU/GPU architectures, and programming languages can be a challenge. It is common to use one or more graphics or UI libraries to act as abstraction layers and hide the underlying complexity. Whereas external libraries greatly simplify the initial programming effort, we argue that relying on them introduces new dependencies and problems, such as a higher entry barriers for new developers and users, and uncertainty regarding long-term support. In this paper we present a new approach for real time visualizations which we have implemented for the N-body package REBOUND. We propose to use a web browser to handle GPU accelerated rendering. This enables us to offer 3D, interactive visualizations on all major operating systems. What makes our new approach unique is that we achieve this without the need for any external libraries. We utilize WebAssembly to reuse existing OpenGL visualization code. Using communication via HTTP and a custom built-in web server, we are able to provide both local and remote real time visualizations. In addition to the browser based real time visualization, our approach offers other additional operating modes, including simulations running entirely within the browser, visualizations within jupyter notebooks, and traditional standalone visualizations using OpenGL. We focus on the implementation in REBOUND but the concepts and ideas discussed can be applied to many other areas in need of scientific and non-scientific real time visualizations.</description>

      <title>Dilution of accreted planetary matter in hot DA white dwarfs according to their mass</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.06738</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.06738v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A large proportion of observed white dwarfs (WDs) show evidence of debris disks, remnants of the former planetary systems, and/or signatures of heavy elements in their atmospheres, induced by the accretion of planetary matter onto their surfaces. The observed abundances are the result of the balance between the accretion flux and the dilution of this planetary material by internal transport processes. A recent study showed that more massive DA WDs are less polluted than smaller mass ones. It was suggested that the reason could be related to the formation of planetary systems when these stars were on the main sequence. The aim of this work is to test how internal dilution processes, including thermohaline convection, change with WD masses, and whether such an effect could account for variations in the observed pollution. We computed the efficiency of atomic diffusion and thermohaline convection after the accretion of heavy elements onto WDs using static DA models with various masses, effective temperatures, and hydrogen contents. We confirm that thermohaline convection is always more efficient in diluting accreted elements than atomic diffusion, as previously shown in the literature. However, we find that element dilution by thermohaline convection is less efficient in massive WDs than in smaller mass ones, due to their larger internal density. We showed that the differences in observed heavy element pollution in WDs according to their masses cannot be explained by the dilution induced by atomic diffusion and thermohaline mixing alone. Indeed, the pollution by planetary system accretion should be more easily detectable in massive WDs than in low-mass ones. We discuss other processes that should be taken into account before drawing any conclusion about the occurrences of planetary systems according to the mass of the star on the main sequence.</description>

      <title>Transformation of orientation and rotation angles of synchronous satellites: Application to the Galilean moons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.05935</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.05935v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The orientation and rotation of a synchronous satellite can be referred to both its Laplace plane and the ICRF equatorial plane, in terms of Euler angles or spin axis Cartesian coordinates and Earth equatorial coordinates, respectively. We computed second-order analytical expressions to make the transformation between the two systems and applied them to the Galilean satellites (Io, Europa, Ganymede, and Callisto). If one term of the spin axis Cartesian coordinates series is dominant, trigonometric series can be generated for the inertial and orbital obliquities, node longitude and offset with respect to the Cassini plane. Since the transformation does not require any fit of amplitudes and frequencies on numerical series, the physical meaning of the frequencies is preserved from the input series and the amplitudes can be directly related to the geophysical parameters of interest. We provide tables for the coordinates and angles' series assuming that the satellites are entirely solid, and considering two different orbital theories. The possible amplitude ranges for the main terms are also examined in the case where a liquid layer is assumed in the interior model. We use our transformation method to propose an updated IAU WG solution which would result in an improvement with respect to zero obliquity models used so far. This method will also be useful for the interpretation of future Earth-based radar observations or JUICE data.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2601.00962v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The giant planet-metallicity correlation revealed that planetary formation depends on the stellar properties. There is growing evidence that it is also valid for smaller hot planets, but it is not clear whether elements other than iron also influence the properties of planetary systems. To investigate this, we determined the abundances of 13 chemical elements (Na, Mg, Al, Si, Ca, Sc, Ti, V, Cr, Mn, Co, Ni and Cu) for a sample of 561 Kepler exoplanet-hosting stars using high-resolution Keck/HIRES spectra. We find that stars in systems having only large or hot planets are enriched in some elements relative to those having only small or warm planets, respectively, with this signature being related to the underlying stellar metallicity. This Kepler sample is composed of stars belonging to the Galactic low- and high-$\alpha$ sequences, corresponding to the chemical thin and thick disks. Our results reveal that stars enhanced in $\alpha$-elements may facilitate the formation of large planets in metal-poor environments although the iron abundance is still a limiting factor. We also investigated chemical abundances as a function of elemental condensation temperatures and found that there is a diversity of slopes regardless of the exoplanetary systems hosted by the star. We confirmed that the Sun is depleted in refractory elements relative to the solar twins in our sample, all of which host a diversity of exoplanets, suggesting that this depletion is caused by processes not related to planet formation.</description>

      <title>Perihelion Asymmetry in the Water Production Rate of the Interstellar Object 3I/ATLAS</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.15443</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.15443v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: 3I/ATLAS is an interstellar object whose activity provides critical insights into its composition and origin. However, due to its orbital geometry, the object is too close to the Sun near perihelion to be observed from the ground, and space-based measurements are therefore required. Here we characterize the water production rate of 3I/ATLAS using SOHO/SWAN Lyman-$\alpha$ observations from 2025 November to December (heliocentric distances 1.4 to 2.2 au) with 3D Monte Carlo modeling. We report a peak post-perihelion water production rate of $Q_{\mathrm{H_2O}} \approx 4 \times 10^{28}$ molecules~s$^{-1}$, corresponding to a minimum active fraction of $\sim$30\% (assuming a maximum nucleus radius of 2.8 km). Comparison of our post-perihelion measurements with published pre-perihelion results reveals a heliocentric asymmetry, with an $r^{-5.9 \pm 0.8}$ scaling for the inbound rise, followed by a shallower $r^{-3.3 \pm 0.3}$ scaling during the outbound decline, where $r$ is heliocentric distance. The post-perihelion behavior indicates that the water production of 3I/ATLAS was driven primarily by the varying solar insolation acting on a stable active area. Combined with other evidence, including comparison with the hyperactive comet 103P/Hartley 2, our findings suggest that its water production is likely dominated by a distributed source of icy grains. Furthermore, it displayed remarkable stability in the activity with no signs of outbursts or rapid depletion of water production.</description>

      <title>Sulfur Enrichment in Close-in Exoplanet Atmospheres Induced by Pebble Drift across the Salt Line</title>

Abstract: Observations of JWST have revealed that several close-in exoplanets have sulfur-rich atmospheres through SO$_2$ detections. Atmospheric sulfur is often thought to originate from solid accretion during planet formation, whereas recent simultaneous detections of SO$_2$ and NH$_3$ challenge this conventional scenario. In this study, we propose that ammonium salts, such as NH$_4$SH tentatively detected in comets and molecular clouds, play a significant role in producing sulfur-rich disk gases, which serve as the ingredient of giant planet atmospheres. We simulated the radial transport of dust containing volatile ices and ammonium salts, along with the dissociation, sublimation, and recondensation of these materials, thereby predicting the atmospheric chemical structures and transmission spectra of planets inheriting these compositions. Assuming that ammonium salts sequester 20% of the elemental nitrogen and sulfur budgets, our results reveal that they enhance sulfur and nitrogen abundances in disk gases to 2-10 times the solar values near the salt dissociation line. Photochemical simulations demonstrate that SO$_2$, NS, H$_2$S, NO, and NH$_3$ become the dominant N and S chemical species in the atmospheres on planets that inherited the gas compositions inside H$_2$O snowline. SO$_2$ features clearly appear in the infrared transmission spectra when the salt-bearing grains enhance the sulfur abundance of disk gas by pebble drift. Our model provides a novel scenario that explains the SO$_2$ detected in some exoplanet atmospheres solely from disk gas accretion. Volatile-element ratios, particularly N/S and C/O, would provide a key to disentangle our scenario from the conventional solid-accretion scenario.</description>

      <title>On the stability of viscous Riemann ellipsoids</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.05658</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.05658v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The present study investigates the linear stability of Riemann ellipsoids in both the inviscid limit and in the presence of weak viscosity. In the inviscid regime, we derive a generalised Poincare equation governing small fluid oscillations and construct a family of polynomial solutions that extends the classical results of Cartan to flows with a uniform strain field. This formulation provides an analytic dispersion relation for three-dimensional ellipsoidal disturbances and remains computationally efficient at arbitrary harmonic degree, in contrast to the virial tensor method or to short-wavelength (WKB) approximations. The viscous effects are incorporated through a boundary-layer analysis based on Prandtls theory, leading to first-order viscous corrections to the inviscid spectrum and allowing a systematic investigation of viscosity-driven instabilities. Stability diagrams are presented over the space of admissible Riemann ellipsoids, illustrating the roles of rotation, internal strain, and diffusion, with implications for rotating shear flows in geophysical and astrophysical contexts.</description>
