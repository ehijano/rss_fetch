      <title>On the Nature of Discrete Space-Time Part 2: Special Relativity in Discrete Space-Time</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.08234</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.08234v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper -- Part 2 of our series on discrete spacetime -- we first provide a review of the previously published Part 1 that included the first important steps in the development of a new model of discrete spacetime (DST): the Isotropic Model of DST. The review starts with a description of the most important and oft-cited problems associated with DST models and how the Isotropic Model of DST solves these problems. We then summarize the derivations of the equations describing time dilation, length contraction and spatial distances in DST that were developed in Part 1. Following the review is the main part of the paper that includes the development of the DST versions of the Lorentz transformation equations and the derivation of the relativistic velocity addition rule, the construction of Minkowski spacetime in DST, and the resolution of Zeno's Stadium Paradox. Important physical phenomena unique to the Isotropic Model are discussed: the fact that light experiences space and time in DST, and the uncertainty in the position of a particle upon the sudden termination of its travel.</description>

      <title>Lorentzian correction for the evolution of the CMB temperature</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.08240</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.08240v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Observational evidence consistently shows that the universe is spatially flat and undergoes Lorentzian time dilation as a function of redshift. In combination, such discoveries suggest that a Minkowskian description of cosmology might be technically viable. The thermal evolution that transpires in a conformal spacetime is herein derived. The description is constrained by the energy conservation of a unified cosmic fluid. The resulting model puts forth a Lorentzian correction for the temperature of the CMB as a function of redshift, which improves current data fitting without adding any free parameter. Furthermore, it sheds light upon the early galaxy formation problem: our model predicts up to 0.86 Gyr older objects within the first two billion years of the structure evolution in the universe.</description>

      <title>The Theory of Thermodynamic Relativity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.08242</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.08242v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce the theory of thermodynamic relativity, a unified framework for describing both entropies and velocities, and their respective disciplines of thermodynamics and kinematics, which share a surprisingly identical description with relativity. This is the first study to generalize relativity in a thermodynamic context, leading naturally to anisotropic and nonlinear adaptations of relativity; thermodynamic relativity constitutes a new path of generalization, as compared to the traditional passage from special to general theory based on curved spacetime. We show that entropy and velocity are characterized by three identical postulates, providing the basis of a broader framework of relativity: (1) no privileged reference frame with zero value; (2) existence of an invariant and fixed value for all reference frames; and (3) existence of stationarity. The postulates lead to a unique way of addition for entropies and for velocities, called kappa addition. The theory provides a systematic method of constructing a generalized framework of the theory of relativity, based on the kappa addition, fully consistent with both thermodynamics and kinematics. From the generality of the kappa addition, we focus on the cases corresponding to linear special relativity. Then, we show how the thermodynamic relativity leads to the addition of entropies in nonextensive thermodynamics and the addition of velocities in the isotropic special relativity of Einstein, as in two extreme cases, while intermediate cases correspond to an anisotropic adaptation of relativity. Using thermodynamic relativity for velocities, we construct the anisotropic special relativity (asymmetric Lorentz transformation, nondiagonal metric, energy momentum velocity relations). Then, we discuss the consequences of the anisotropy in known relativistic effects: (1) matter antimatter asymmetry, (2) time dilation, and (3) Doppler effect.</description>

      <title>Finite mathematics as the most general (fundamental) mathematics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2203.09482</link>
      <description>arXiv:2203.09482v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The purpose of this paper is to explain at the simplest possible level why finite mathematics based on a finite ring of characteristic $p$ is more general (fundamental) than standard mathematics. The belief of most mathematicians and physicists that standard mathematics is the most fundamental arose for historical reasons. However, simple {\it mathematical} arguments show that standard mathematics (involving the concept of infinities) is a degenerate case of finite mathematics in the formal limit $p\to\infty$: standard mathematics arises from finite mathematics in the degenerate case when operations modulo a number are discarded. Quantum theory based on a finite ring of characteristic $p$ is more general than standard quantum theory because the latter is a degenerate case of the former in the formal limit $p\to\infty$.</description>
