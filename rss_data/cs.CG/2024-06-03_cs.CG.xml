      <title>Parallel Redundancy Removal in lrslib with Application to Projections</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.00065</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.00065v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We describe a parallel implementation in lrslib for removing redundant halfspaces and finding a minimum representation for an H-representation of a convex polyhedron. By a standard transformation, the same code works for V-representations. We use this approach to speed up the redundancy removal step in Fourier-Motzkin elimination. Computational results are given including a comparison with Clarkson's algorithm, which is particularly fast on highly redundant inputs.</description>

      <title>Smooth Surfaces via Nets of Geodesics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2109.01429</link>
      <description>arXiv:2109.01429v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The goal of this study is to provide a method for computing the following: Given a network of curves in 3d (satisfying a condition at the intersection points), compute efficiently a smooth surface such that the curves are geodesics on it. This work can serve as a base for engineers who wish to implement computations of such surfaces in Computer Aided Design (CAD) software or other applications. The motivation for this study was the following hypothesis and observation together with the desire to improve CAD interfaces. The hypothesis and observation is that artists draw projections of geodesics to illustrate 3d objects: for example projections of nets of curves can be seen in drawings of Rembrandt. In addition, this observation is supported by research in cognitive sciences: in a seminal work by the late David Knill he suggested that the human visual system incorporates a geodesic constraint in the processing of reflected contours.</description>

      <title>Packing, Hitting, and Colouring Squares</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2206.02185</link>
      <description>arXiv:2206.02185v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Given a finite family of squares in the plane, the packing problem asks for the maximum number $\nu$ of pairwise disjoint squares among them, while the hitting problem for the minimum number $\tau$ of points hitting all of them. Clearly, $\tau \ge \nu$. Both problems are known to be NP-hard, even for families of axis-parallel unit squares.
  The main results of this work provide the first non-trivial bounds for the $\tau / \nu$ ratio for not necessarily axis-parallel squares. We establish an upper bound of $6$ for unit squares and $10$ for squares of varying sizes. The worst ratios we can provide with examples are $3$ and $4$, respectively. For comparison, in the axis-parallel case, the supremum of the considered ratio is in the interval $[\frac{3}{2},2]$ for unit squares and $[\frac{3}{2},4]$ for squares of varying sizes. The methods we introduced for the $\tau/\nu$ ratio can also be used to relate the chromatic number $\chi$ and clique number $\omega$ of squares by bounding the $\chi/\omega$ ratio by $6$ for unit squares and $9$ for squares of varying sizes.
  The $\tau / \nu$ and $\chi/\omega$ ratios have already been bounded before by a constant for "fat" objects, the fattest and simplest of which are disks and squares. However, while disks have received significant attention, specific bounds for squares have remained essentially unexplored. This work intends to fill this gap.</description>
