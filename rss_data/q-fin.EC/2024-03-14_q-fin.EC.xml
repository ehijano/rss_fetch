      <title>Valuation of Power Purchase Agreements for Corporate Renewable Energy Procurement</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.08846</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.08846v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Corporate renewable power purchase agreements (PPAs) are long-term contracts that enable companies to source renewable energy without having to develop and operate their own capacities. Typically, producers and consumers agree on a fixed per-unit price at which power is purchased. The value of the PPA to the buyer depends on the so called capture price defined as the difference between this fixed price and the market value of the produced volume during the duration of the contract. To model the capture price, practitioners often use either fundamental or statistical approaches to model future market prices, which both have their inherent limitations. We propose a new approach that blends the logic of fundamental electricity market models with statistical learning techniques. In particular, we use regularized inverse optimization in a quadratic fundamental bottom-up model of the power market to estimate the marginal costs of different technologies as a parametric function of exogenous factors. We compare the out-of-sample performance in forecasting the capture price using market data from three European countries and demonstrate that our approach outperforms established statistical learning benchmarks. We then discuss the case of a photovoltaic plant in Spain to illustrate how to use the model to value a PPA from the buyer's perspective.</description>

      <title>Measuring the bioeconomy economically: exploring the connections between concepts, methods, data, indicators and their limitations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.08886</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.08886v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Despite its relevance, measuring the contributions of the bioeconomy to national economies remains an arduous task that faces limitations. Part of the difficulty is associated with the lack of a clear and widely accepted concept of the bioeconomy and moves on to the connections between methods, data and indicators. The present study aims to define the concepts of bioeconomy and to explore the connections between concepts, methods, data and indicators when measuring the bioeconomy economically, and the limitations involved in this process. The bioeconomy concepts were defined based on a literature review and a content analysis of 84 documents selected through snowballing procedures to find articles measuring 'how big is the bioeconomy?'. The content of the 84 documents was uploaded to the QDA Miner software and coded according to the bioeconomy concept, the methods or models used, the data sources accessed, the indicators calculated, and the limitations reported by the authors. The results of the occurrence and co-occurrence of the codes were extracted and analyzed statistically, indicating that the measurement of bioeconomy (i) need recognize and pursue the proposed concept of holistic bioeconomy; (ii) rarely considered aspects of holistic bioeconomy (3.5%); (iii) is primarily based on the concept of biomass-based bioeconomy (BmBB) (94%); (iv) the association with the concept of biosphere (BsBB) appeared in 26% of the studies; (v) the biotech-based bioeconomy (BtBB) was the least frequent (1.2%); (vi) there is a diversity of methods and models, but the most common are those traditionally used to measure macroeconomic activities, especially input-output models; (vii) depending on the prevailing methods, the data comes from various official statistical databases, such as national accounts and economic activity classification systems;...</description>

      <title>Entangled vs. Separable Choice</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.09045</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.09045v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study joint probabilistic choice rules that describe the behavior of two decision makers, each facing a possibly different menu. These choice rules are separable when they can be factored into autonomous choices from each individual solely correlated through their individual probabilistic choice rules. Despite recent interest in studying such rules, a complete characterization of the restrictions on them remains an open question. A reasonable conjecture is that such restrictions on separable joint choice can be factored into individual choice restrictions. We name these restrictions separable and show that this conjecture is true if and only if the probabilistic choice rule of at least one decision maker uniquely identifies the distribution over deterministic choice rules. Otherwise, entangled choice rules exist that satisfy separable restrictions yet are not separable. The possibility of entangled choice complicates the characterization of separable choice since one needs to augment the separable restrictions with the new emerging ones.</description>

      <title>Study on Standardizing Working Time: A Case of XYZ Retail Store in Bandung, Indonesia</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.09138</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.09138v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Work time standardization helps to find and reduce wasteful movements and time in the workplace, such as chatting, mobile phone use, insufficient rest, or unproductive tasks. This study aims to map the process of displaying products from the warehouse to the shelves and calculate and determine the standard working time of employees of the Operations Division of PT XYZ Branch who oversee displaying X Milk and Y Bread. The data was collected six times in three weeks, including interviews and observations, and took a sample of 20 pieces on each product to carry out data analysis such as data sufficiency tests and control charts. Several time deviations were found in the display process of X Milk products on all observation days in different activities. Whereas in the process of displaying Y Bread, only the deviation of working time was found on the 4th observation day, which proves that the process needs to have a standard working time so that the activity work time is more controlled. Therefore, the analysis is carried out with the calculation of performance rating, time allowance, normal time, and standard time. The result of the standard time calculation for the display process of X Milk products is 15.83 minutes and Y Bread is 9.18 minutes for each product of 20 units.</description>

      <title>Zonal vs. Nodal Pricing: An Analysis of Different Pricing Rules in the German Day-Ahead Market</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.09265</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.09265v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The European electricity market is based on large pricing zones with a uniform day-ahead price. The energy transition leads to shifts in supply and demand and increasing redispatch costs. In an attempt to ensure efficient market clearing and congestion management, the EU Commission has mandated the Bidding Zone Review (BZR) to reevaluate the configuration of European bidding zones. Based on a unique data set published in the context of the BZR, we compare various pricing rules for the German power market. We compare market clearing and pricing for national, zonal, and nodal models, including their generation costs and associated redispatch costs. Moreover, we investigate different non-uniform pricing rules and their economic implications for the German electricity market. Our results indicate that the differences in the average prices in different zones are small. The total costs across different configurations are similar and the reduction of standard deviations in prices is also small based on this data set. A nodal pricing rule leads to the lowest total costs. We also analyze the quality of different pricing rules and their differences with respect to the quality of the price signals and the necessary uplift payments. While the study focuses on Germany, the analysis is relevant beyond and feeds into the broader discussion about pricing rules.</description>

      <title>Global Shipyard Capacities Limiting the Ramp-Up of Global Hydrogen-based Transportation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.09272</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.09272v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Decarbonizing the global energy system requires significant expansions of renewable energy technologies. Given that cost-effective renewable sources are not necessarily situated in proximity to the largest energy demand centers globally, the maritime transportation of low-carbon energy carriers, such as renewable-based hydrogen or ammonia, will be needed. However, whether existent shipyards possess the required capacity to provide the necessary global fleet has not yet been answered. Therefore, this study estimates global tanker demand based on projections for global hydrogen demand, while comparing these projections with historic shipyard production. Our findings reveal a potential bottleneck until 2033-2039 if relying on liquefied hydrogen exclusively. This bottleneck could be circumvented by increasing local hydrogen production, utilizing pipelines, or liquefied ammonia as an energy carrier for hydrogen. Furthermore, the regional concentration of shipyard locations raises concerns about diversification. Increasing demand for container vessels could substantially hinder the scale-up of maritime hydrogen transport.</description>

      <title>Climate Immobility Traps: A Household-Level Test</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.09470</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.09470v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The complex relationship between climate shocks, migration, and adaptation hampers a rigorous understanding of the heterogeneous mobility outcomes of farm households exposed to climate risk. To unpack this heterogeneity, the analysis combines longitudinal multi-topic household survey data from Nigeria with a causal machine learning approach, tailored to a conceptual framework bridging economic migration theory and the poverty traps literature. The results show that pre-shock asset levels, in situ adaptive capacity, and cumulative shock exposure drive not just the magnitude but also the sign of the impact of agriculture-relevant weather anomalies on the mobility outcomes of farming households. While local adaptation acts as a substitute for migration, the roles played by wealth constraints and repeated shock exposure suggest the presence of climate-induced immobility traps.</description>

      <title>Inequality of Opportunity and Income Redistribution</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2209.00534</link>
      <description>arXiv:2209.00534v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We examine how redistribution decisions respond to the source of luck when there is uncertainty about its role in determining opportunities and outcomes. We elicit redistribution decisions from a representative U.S. sample who observe worker outcomes and whether luck could determine earnings directly (``lucky outcomes'') or indirectly by providing one of the workers with a relative advantage (``lucky opportunities''). We find that participants redistribute less and are less responsive to changes in the importance of luck in environments with lucky opportunities. We show that individuals rely on a simple heuristic when assessing the impact of unequal opportunities, which leads them to underappreciate the extent to which small differences in opportunities can have a large impact on outcomes. These findings have implications for models of redistribution attitudes and help explain the gap between lab evidence on support for redistribution and inequality trends.</description>

      <title>Generative artificial intelligence enhances creativity but reduces the diversity of novel content</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.00506</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.00506v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Creativity is core to being human. Generative artificial intelligence (GenAI) holds promise for humans to be more creative by offering new ideas, or less creative by anchoring on GenAI ideas. We study the causal impact of GenAI on the production of a creative output in an online experimental study where some writers are could obtain ideas for a story from a GenAI platform. Access to GenAI ideas causes an increase in the writer's creativity with stories being evaluated as better written and more enjoyable, especially among less creative writers. However, GenAI-enabled stories are more similar to each other than stories by humans alone. Our results have implications for researchers, policy-makers and practitioners interested in bolstering creativity, but point to potential downstream consequences from over-reliance.</description>
