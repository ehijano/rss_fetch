      <title>Leveraging deterministic weather forecasts for in-situ probabilistic temperature predictions via deep learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.02141</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.02141v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose a neural network approach to produce probabilistic weather forecasts from a deterministic numerical weather prediction. Our approach is applied to operational surface temperature outputs from the Global Deterministic Prediction System up to ten-day lead times, targeting METAR observations in Canada and the United States. We show how postprocessing performance is improved by training a single model for multiple lead times. Multiple strategies to condition the network for the lead time are studied, including a supplementary predictor and an embedding. The proposed model is evaluated for accuracy, spread, distribution calibration, and its behavior under extremes. The neural network approach decreases CRPS by 15% and has improved distribution calibration compared to a naive probabilistic model based on past forecast errors. Our approach increases the value of a deterministic forecast by adding information about the uncertainty, without incurring the cost of simulating multiple trajectories. It applies to any gridded forecast including the recent machine learning-based weather prediction models. It requires no information regarding forecast spread and can be trained to generate probabilistic predictions from any deterministic forecast.</description>

      <title>Stable Boundary Layers with Subsidence: Scaling and Similarity of the Truly Steady State</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.01751</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.01751v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The stable boundary layer (SBL) subjected to large-scale subsidence is studied through large-eddy simulations (LESs) with fixed surface temperature and a linear subsidence velocity profile. These boundary layers reach a truly steady state, where thermal equilibrium is established by a balance between surface cooling and subsidence-induced heating. We identify three governing dimensionless groups by scaling the governing equations with the geostrophic wind and Coriolis frequency, and systematically investigate the impact of these external parameters on global flow properties and mean profiles in the steady state. The SBL depth, low-level jet, and the magnitude of the turbulent momentum flux are reduced when the subsidence rate or Buoyancy number increases, while surface heat flux is enhanced. The shape of normalized mean profiles of temperature and heat flux is mainly determined by the subsidence rate, while they collapse for varying buoyancy and surface Rossby numbers. We develop empirical correlations for the stability parameter $h_{\theta}/L_O$ and a thermal shape factor, and propose a new unidirectional geostrophic drag law, to form a closed set of equations that estimates relevant flow properties from external parameters. The estimation errors compared to the LES data are less than 5% for friction velocity and surface heat flux, and at most 10% for the SBL depth $h_{\theta}$. Within the surface layer, dimensionless velocity and temperature gradients in the steady SBL with subsidence show acceptable agreement to Monin-Obukhov similarity theory, while the collapse is improved when a recently proposed mixed scaling parameter, that includes $h_{\theta}/L_O$, is used.</description>

      <title>Long-term foehn reconstruction combining unsupervised and supervised learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.01818</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.01818v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Foehn winds, characterized by abrupt temperature increases and wind speed changes, significantly impact regions on the leeward side of mountain ranges, e.g., by spreading wildfires. Understanding how foehn occurrences change under climate change is crucial. Unfortunately, foehn cannot be measured directly but has to be inferred from meteorological measurements employing suitable classification schemes. Hence, this approach is typically limited to specific periods for which the necessary data are available. We present a novel approach for reconstructing historical foehn occurrences using a combination of unsupervised and supervised probabilistic statistical learning methods. We utilize in-situ measurements (available for recent decades) to train an unsupervised learner (finite mixture model) for automatic foehn classification. These labeled data are then linked to reanalysis data (covering longer periods) using a supervised learner (lasso or boosting). This allows to reconstruct past foehn probabilities based solely on reanalysis data. Applying this method to ERA5 reanalysis data for six stations across Switzerland and Austria achieves accurate hourly reconstructions of north and south foehn occurrence, respectively, dating back to 1940. This paves the way for investigating how seasonal foehn patterns have evolved over the past 83 years, providing valuable insights into climate change impacts on these critical wind events.</description>

      <title>Beyond Ensemble Averages: Leveraging Climate Model Ensembles for Subseasonal Forecasting</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2211.15856</link>
      <description>arXiv:2211.15856v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Producing high-quality forecasts of key climate variables, such as temperature and precipitation, on subseasonal time scales has long been a gap in operational forecasting. This study explores an application of machine learning (ML) models as post-processing tools for subseasonal forecasting. Lagged numerical ensemble forecasts (i.e., an ensemble where the members have different initialization dates) and observational data, including relative humidity, pressure at sea level, and geopotential height, are incorporated into various ML methods to predict monthly average precipitation and two-meter temperature two weeks in advance for the continental United States. For regression, quantile regression, and tercile classification tasks, we consider using linear models, random forests, convolutional neural networks, and stacked models (a multi-model approach based on the prediction of the individual ML models). Unlike previous ML approaches that often use ensemble mean alone, we leverage information embedded in the ensemble forecasts to enhance prediction accuracy. Additionally, we investigate extreme event predictions that are crucial for planning and mitigation efforts. Considering ensemble members as a collection of spatial forecasts, we explore different approaches to using spatial information. Trade-offs between different approaches may be mitigated with model stacking. Our proposed models outperform standard baselines such as climatological forecasts and ensemble means. In addition, we investigate feature importance, trade-offs between using the full ensemble or only the ensemble mean, and different modes of accounting for spatial variability.</description>
