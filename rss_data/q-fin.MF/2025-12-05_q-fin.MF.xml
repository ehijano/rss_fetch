      <title>Risk aversion of insider and dynamic asymmetric information</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.05011</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.05011v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper studies a Kyle-Back model with a risk-averse insider possessing exponential utility and a dynamic stochastic signal about the asset's terminal fundamental value. While the existing literature considers either risk-neutral insiders with dynamic signals or risk-averse insiders with static signals, we establish equilibrium when both features are present. Our approach imposes no restrictions on the magnitude of the risk aversion parameter, extending beyond previous work that requires sufficiently small risk aversion. We employ a weak conditioning methodology to construct a Schr\"{o}dinger bridge between the insider's signal and the asset price process, an approach that naturally accommodates stochastic signal evolution and removes risk aversion constraints.
  We derive necessary conditions for equilibrium, showing that the optimal insider strategy must be continuous with bounded variation. Under these conditions, we characterize the market-maker pricing rule and insider strategy that achieve equilibrium. We obtain explicit closed-form solutions for important cases including deterministic and quadratic signal volatilities, demonstrating the tractability of our framework.</description>

      <title>Coordinated Mean-Field Control for Systemic Risk</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.04704</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.04704v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We develop a robust linear-quadratic mean-field control framework for systemic risk under model uncertainty, in which a central bank jointly optimizes interest rate policy and supervisory monitoring intensity against adversarial distortions. Our model features multiple policy instruments with interactive dynamics, implemented via a variance weight that depends on the policy rate, generating coupling effects absent in single-instrument models. We establish viscosity solutions for the associated HJB--Isaacs equation, prove uniqueness via comparison principles, and provide verification theorems. The linear-quadratic structure yields explicit feedback controls derived from a coupled Riccati system, preserving analytical tractability despite adversarial uncertainty. Simulations reveal distinct loss-of-control regimes driven by robustness-breakdown and control saturation, alongside a pronounced asymmetry in sensitivity between the mean and variance channels. These findings demonstrate the importance of instrument complementarity in systemic risk modeling and control.</description>

      <title>Risk premium and rough volatility</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.11897</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.11897v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: One the one hand, rough volatility has been shown to provide a consistent framework to capture the properties of stock price dynamics both under the historical measure and for pricing purposes. On the other hand, market price of volatility risk is a well-studied object in Financial Economics, and empirical estimates show it to be stochastic rather than deterministic. Starting from a rough volatility model under the historical measure, we take up this challenge and provide an analysis of the impact of such a non-deterministic risk for pricing purposes.</description>

      <title>De Finetti's problem with fixed transaction costs and regime switching</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.05839</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.05839v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we examine a modified version of de Finetti's optimal dividend problem, incorporating fixed transaction costs and altering the surplus process by introducing two-valued drift and two-valued volatility coefficients. This modification aims to capture the transitions or adjustments in the company's financial status. We identify the optimal dividend strategy, which maximizes the expected total net dividend payments (after accounting for transaction costs) until ruin, as a two-barrier impulsive dividend strategy. Notably, the optimal strategy can be explicitly determined for almost all scenarios involving different drifts and volatility coefficients. Our primary focus is on exploring how changes in drift and volatility coefficients influence the optimal dividend strategy.</description>
