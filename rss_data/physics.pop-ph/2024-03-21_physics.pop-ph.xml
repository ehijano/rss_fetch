      <title>Terrestrial Life in Light of the Copernican Principle</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.12051</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.12051v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Although many solar systems have been discovered, only one example of life is known. Thus, terrestrial life represents merely one data point. Consequently, extrapolating from terrestrial life to life elsewhere in the galaxy and beyond is often seen as a limitation in the search for different forms of life. Essentially, attempting to extrapolate from terrestrial life to life elsewhere implies that terrestrial life is representative of all life, reflecting a geocentric viewpoint. However, in accordance with the Copernican principle, the opposite holds true. Asserting that terrestrial life must differ from other forms of life in the universe is, in fact, the geocentric viewpoint. For if life elsewhere is not like terrestrial life, then it is ipso facto different life; more precisely, if terrestrial life does not represent general life, then that life must represent special life, which the principle states it is not. This study employs the Copernican principle as a probability assessment, addressing critiques rooted in the implicit assumption of the existence of different extraterrestrial forms of life. If various fundamental forms of life indeed exist, then differences in the probabilities of their emergence can be expected, forming a probability scale. This holds significance because it not only allows for insights into the characteristics of the majority of life elsewhere but also facilitates the establishment of boundaries for categories of life as we do not know it. Thus, the Copernican-Darwinian principle provides a valuable tool for astrobiology and the search for life in the galaxy and beyond.</description>

      <title>A Plethora of the Earth-like Planet: Ramifications of a Fuzzy World</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.12441</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.12441v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: One primary reason for the formulation of the term Earth-like planet and the search for such planets in the galaxy is because life has arisen in such a world. Thus, this search seems justifiable as it is known here what one is looking for. However, the Earth-like concept represents an attempt to set up sharp boundaries for an inhabited planet, even though nature often comes as continua. The analyses in this work show that the term does not represent a clear-cut entity as a general Earth-likeness cannot be abstracted. Thus, the complex variation of environment and life means that the singular term Earth-like planet is more appropriately treated as a fuzzy world. Such a fuzzification has the consequence of the term being not only more limited than assumed but may even be deceptive, as an Earth-like planet on one hand can be in a segment in which it does not seem particularly Earth-like, but still possesses life, but on the other hand can appear very Earth-like but not possess life anyway. An atmosphere can provide a biosignature by being displaced from thermodynamic equilibrium, derived from antagonistic adaptation, in which life as a double-edged sword, on one hand, continuously makes the external environment less favourable for itself, while on the other, increasing its capacity to do so. Yet, there is an issue with using this as a search criterion for potentially inhabited worlds, as such planets can give impressions that do not reflect what has gone on; they can even give a ghost biosignature. These novel analyses do not represent a limitation in the search for Earth-like planets, as the plethora of Earth-like planets shows the possibility that the number of inhabited worlds can be large, but do represent a limitation in the search for life on such worlds.</description>
