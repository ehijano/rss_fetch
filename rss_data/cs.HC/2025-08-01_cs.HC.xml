      <title>Knowledge Is More Than Performance: How Knowledge Diversity Drives Human-Human and Human-AI Interaction Synergy and Reveals Pure-AI Interaction Shortfalls</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.22889</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.22889v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Conversations transform individual knowledge into collective insight, allowing groups of humans and increasingly groups of artificial intelligence (AI) agents to collaboratively solve complex problems. Whether interactions between AI agents can replicate the synergy observed in human discussions remains an open question. To investigate this, we systematically compared four conversational configurations: pairs of large language models (LLM-LLM), trios of LLMs, trios of humans, and mixed human-LLM pairs. After agents answered questions individually, they engaged in open-ended discussions and then reconsidered their initial answers. Interactions involving humans consistently led to accuracy improvements after the conversations, benefiting both stronger and weaker participants. By contrast, purely LLM-based pairs and trios exhibited declines in accuracy, demonstrating limited conversational synergy. Analysis of participants' confidence and answer-switching behavior revealed that knowledge diversity is a critical factor enabling collaborative improvement. Crucially, the lack of gains in LLM-LLM interactions did not stem from a fundamental limitation of the models' ability to collaborate, but from highly similar knowledge states that left little room for productive exchange. Our findings argue for a paradigm shift in AI development: rather than optimizing individual models solely for standalone performance, explicitly cultivating diversity across agents, even at the cost of slightly lower individual accuracy, may yield AI collaborators that are more effective in group settings with humans or other AI systems.</description>

      <title>Evaluating LLMs for Visualization Generation and Understanding</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.22890</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.22890v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Information Visualization has been utilized to gain insights from complex data. In recent times, Large Language models (LLMs) have performed very well in many tasks. In this paper, we showcase the capabilities of different popular LLMs to generate code for visualization based on simple prompts. We also analyze the power of LLMs to understand some common visualizations by answering questions. Our study shows that LLMs could generate code for some simpler visualizations such as bar and pie charts. Moreover, they could answer simple questions about visualizations. However, LLMs also have several limitations. For example, some of them had difficulty generating complex visualizations, such as violin plot. LLMs also made errors in answering some questions about visualizations, for example, identifying relationships between close boundaries and determining lengths of shapes. We believe that our insights can be used to improve both LLMs and Information Visualization systems.</description>

      <title>Real-time energy monitoring infrastructure for residential collective self-consumption operations using Linky meter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.22891</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.22891v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: As part of the energy transition and the rise in energy prices, the number of collective self-consumption operations in France is steadily increasing. However, energy flow monitoring currently relies on historical ''day+1'' data provided by Linky meters, which does not offer real time feedback to help participants adapt their energy consumption behaviors. This article introduces a new open-source infrastructure for real-time monitoring based on Linky meter data, enabling participants to make informed decisions and take timely actions. It includes a description of the xKy device, applied to a collective self-consumption operation involving nine participants, supported by the Energy Transition Observatory (OTE). The project encompasses the implementation of gateways in participants' homes and the development and operation of real-time monitoring website, aimed at increasing participants' self-consumption rate.</description>

      <title>Hybrid EEG--Driven Brain--Computer Interface: A Large Language Model Framework for Personalized Language Rehabilitation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.22892</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.22892v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Conventional augmentative and alternative communication (AAC) systems and language-learning platforms often fail to adapt in real time to the user's cognitive and linguistic needs, especially in neurological conditions such as post-stroke aphasia or amyotrophic lateral sclerosis. Recent advances in noninvasive electroencephalography (EEG)--based brain-computer interfaces (BCIs) and transformer--based large language models (LLMs) offer complementary strengths: BCIs capture users' neural intent with low fatigue, while LLMs generate contextually tailored language content. We propose and evaluate a novel hybrid framework that leverages real-time EEG signals to drive an LLM-powered language rehabilitation assistant. This system aims to: (1) enable users with severe speech or motor impairments to navigate language-learning modules via mental commands; (2) dynamically personalize vocabulary, sentence-construction exercises, and corrective feedback; and (3) monitor neural markers of cognitive effort to adjust task difficulty on the fly.</description>

      <title>Invisible Architectures of Thought: Toward a New Science of AI as Cognitive Infrastructure</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.22893</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.22893v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Contemporary human-AI interaction research overlooks how AI systems fundamentally reshape human cognition pre-consciously, a critical blind spot for understanding distributed cognition. This paper introduces "Cognitive Infrastructure Studies" (CIS) as a new interdisciplinary domain to reconceptualize AI as "cognitive infrastructures": foundational, often invisible systems conditioning what is knowable and actionable in digital societies. These semantic infrastructures transport meaning, operate through anticipatory personalization, and exhibit adaptive invisibility, making their influence difficult to detect. Critically, they automate "relevance judgment," shifting the "locus of epistemic agency" to non-human systems. Through narrative scenarios spanning individual (cognitive dependency), collective (democratic deliberation), and societal (governance) scales, we describe how cognitive infrastructures reshape human cognition, public reasoning, and social epistemologies. CIS aims to address how AI preprocessing reshapes distributed cognition across individual, collective, and cultural scales, requiring unprecedented integration of diverse disciplinary methods. The framework also addresses critical gaps across disciplines: cognitive science lacks population-scale preprocessing analysis capabilities, digital sociology cannot access individual cognitive mechanisms, and computational approaches miss cultural transmission dynamics. To achieve this goal CIS also provides methodological innovations for studying invisible algorithmic influence: "infrastructure breakdown methodologies", experimental approaches that reveal cognitive dependencies by systematically withdrawing AI preprocessing after periods of habituation.</description>

      <title>When no one shows up (at first): Navigating the uncertainties of participatory workshops in interdisciplinary research</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.22894</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.22894v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This reflective paper explores often-unspoken challenges of designing and facilitating co-design and participatory workshops, offering practical strategies for early career researchers (ECRs) navigating these methods. Drawing from personal experience conducting a series of workshops titled: How to Think About Equity in the AI Ecosystem. It follows the full arc of the workshop experience, from conceptualization and activity planning to participant recruitment and facilitation, offering a grounded account of what happens when participation does not go as expected. The paper examines the methodological challenges of engaging non-expert participants, particularly when operating without institutional support, financial incentives, or integration into larger events. Despite initial difficulties such as low attendance, the workshop fostered rich discussions among a demographically diverse group and ultimately led to one participant volunteering to co-facilitate a subsequent session. This transition from participant to co-facilitator exemplifies the redistribution of epistemic authority, positioning lived experience as central to research and engagement practices. By reframing perceived failure as a productive site of learning, the paper offers practical strategies for ECRs working across disciplines who often navigate unfamiliar methodological terrains, contributing to broader conversations on the realities of doing interdisciplinary, participatory work in practice.</description>

      <title>Brain motor intention Extraction Amplifier: Non-invasive brain-muscle interface</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.22895</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.22895v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Brain-computer interfaces (BCIs) enable real-time interaction between the brain and external devices by decoding neural signals. However, existing motor-based BCI paradigms, like motor imagery BCI, face challenges with imprecise labeling in real-world use. This mismatch between EEG signals and true behavioral intentions leads to pseudo-labels, undermining decoding accuracy and system robustness. To overcome this bottleneck, this paper first proposes a novel motor intention extraction framework based on a non-invasive brain-muscle interface (BMuI)($\text{BCI} = \frac{\text{Brain}}{\text{Computer}} \text{ Interface} = \frac{\text{Brain}}{\not\text{Muscle}}\! \text{ (BMuI)} \times \!\frac{\not\text{Muscle}}{\text{Computer}}\! \text{ Interface}$). This method simulates the neural pathway from the brain to the muscles in order to capture and enhance the weak motor intention signals originating in the brain. It then uses EMG as a high-fidelity relay medium to achieve more accurate intention recognition and transmission. To systematically validate the feasibility and effectiveness of this approach, we conducted both offline experiments (to repeatedly verify feasibility) and online experiments (to construct a real-time interactive system and evaluate its performance). The results show that BMuI is feasible, achieving a prediction accuracy of 0.8314; in the online experiment, all participants are able to successfully control the Unity virtual arm.</description>

      <title>iLearnRobot: An Interactive Learning-Based Multi-Modal Robot with Continuous Improvement</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.22896</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.22896v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: It is crucial that robots' performance can be improved after deployment, as they are inherently likely to encounter novel scenarios never seen before. This paper presents an innovative solution: an interactive learning-based robot system powered by a Multi-modal Large Language Model(MLLM). A key feature of our system is its ability to learn from natural dialogues with non-expert users. We also propose chain of question to clarify the exact intent of the question before providing an answer and dual-modality retrieval modules to leverage these interaction events to avoid repeating same mistakes, ensuring a seamless user experience before model updates, which is in contrast to current mainstream MLLM-based robotic systems. Our system marks a novel approach in robotics by integrating interactive learning, paving the way for superior adaptability and performance in diverse environments. We demonstrate the effectiveness and improvement of our method through experiments, both quantitively and qualitatively.</description>

      <title>RecUserSim: A Realistic and Diverse User Simulator for Evaluating Conversational Recommender Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.22897</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.22897v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Conversational recommender systems (CRS) enhance user experience through multi-turn interactions, yet evaluating CRS remains challenging. User simulators can provide comprehensive evaluations through interactions with CRS, but building realistic and diverse simulators is difficult. While recent work leverages large language models (LLMs) to simulate user interactions, they still fall short in emulating individual real users across diverse scenarios and lack explicit rating mechanisms for quantitative evaluation. To address these gaps, we propose RecUserSim, an LLM agent-based user simulator with enhanced simulation realism and diversity while providing explicit scores. RecUserSim features several key modules: a profile module for defining realistic and diverse user personas, a memory module for tracking interaction history and discovering unknown preferences, and a core action module inspired by Bounded Rationality theory that enables nuanced decision-making while generating more fine-grained actions and personalized responses. To further enhance output control, a refinement module is designed to fine-tune final responses. Experiments demonstrate that RecUserSim generates diverse, controllable outputs and produces realistic, high-quality dialogues, even with smaller base LLMs. The ratings generated by RecUserSim show high consistency across different base LLMs, highlighting its effectiveness for CRS evaluation.</description>

      <title>Voice-guided Orchestrated Intelligence for Clinical Evaluation (VOICE): A Voice AI Agent System for Prehospital Stroke Assessment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.22898</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.22898v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We developed a voice-driven artificial intelligence (AI) system that guides anyone - from paramedics to family members - through expert-level stroke evaluations using natural conversation, while also enabling smartphone video capture of key examination components for documentation and potential expert review. This addresses a critical gap in emergency care: current stroke recognition by first responders is inconsistent and often inaccurate, with sensitivity for stroke detection as low as 58%, causing life-threatening delays in treatment. Three non-medical volunteers used our AI system to assess ten simulated stroke patients, including cases with likely large vessel occlusion (LVO) strokes and stroke-like conditions, while we measured diagnostic accuracy, completion times, user confidence, and expert physician review of the AI-generated reports. The AI system correctly identified 84% of individual stroke signs and detected 75% of likely LVOs, completing evaluations in just over 6 minutes. Users reported high confidence (median 4.5/5) and ease of use (mean 4.67/5). The system successfully identified 86% of actual strokes but also incorrectly flagged 2 of 3 non-stroke cases as strokes. When an expert physician reviewed the AI reports with videos, they identified the correct diagnosis in 100% of cases, but felt confident enough to make preliminary treatment decisions in only 40% of cases due to observed AI errors including incorrect scoring and false information. While the current system's limitations necessitate human oversight, ongoing rapid advancements in speech-to-speech AI models suggest that future versions are poised to enable highly accurate assessments. Achieving human-level voice interaction could transform emergency medical care, putting expert-informed assessment capabilities in everyone's hands.</description>

      <title>A visual analytics tool for taxonomy-based trajectory data exploration</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.22899</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.22899v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The analysis of spatio-temporal data presents significant challenges due to the complexity and heterogeneity of movement patterns. This project proposes a data analytics tool that combines data visualization and statistical computation to facilitate spatio-temporal data analysis through a multi-level approach. The tool categorizes moving objects into distinct taxonomies using Machine Learning models, adding meaningful structure to the analysis. Two case studies demonstrate the methodology's effectiveness. The first analyzed Arctic fox trajectories, successfully identifying and labeling foxes with Geometric or Kinematic-based behaviors, further categorized into Curvature and Acceleration groups. Statistical indicators revealed that foxes with Acceleration-based behavior showed constant, steady acceleration, while those with Curvature-based behavior exhibited acceleration peaks and sudden deceleration. The second case study examined tropical cyclone data, labeling trajectories with Speed, Curvature, and hybrid Geometric-based behaviors through unique statistical variables. Analysis of hybrid Geometric behavior (Curvature and Indentation combined) identified specific angles with the highest impact on hurricane shape and geometry. The proposed method and tool demonstrate that spatio-temporal data, despite inherent complexity, can be analyzed and explained in detail, providing a theoretical and practical blueprint applicable to multiple domains.</description>

      <title>Tool or Trouble? Exploring Student Attitudes Toward AI Coding Assistants</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.22900</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.22900v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This exploratory study examines how AI code assistants shape novice programmers' experiences during a two-part exam in an introductory programming course. In the first part, students completed a programming task with access to AI support; in the second, they extended their solutions without AI. We collected Likert-scale and open-ended responses from 20 students to evaluate their perceptions and challenges. Findings suggest that AI tools were perceived as helpful for understanding code and increasing confidence, particularly during initial development. However, students reported difficulties transferring knowledge to unaided tasks, revealing possible overreliance and gaps in conceptual understanding. These insights highlight the need for pedagogical strategies that integrate AI meaningfully while reinforcing foundational programming skills.</description>

      <title>Accelerated and Optimized Search of Imperceptible Color Vibration for Embedding Information into LCD images</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.22901</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.22901v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large, high-resolution displays are installed throughout the city as public displays. By superimposing invisible information on the images of these displays, large numbers of devices with cameras and sensors can communicate with the displays without prior pairing. Several applications have been proposed, such as operating robots or communicating information to users by displaying 2D codes on images. However, the display of 2D codes has the problem of compromising the appearance of displayed content.
  Abe et al. proposed a method of communicating with devices by superimposing invisible information using color vibration on images displayed on off-the-shelf liquid-crystal displays (LCD). Using this method, we can embed the information for devices in images without interfering with the displayed content. Abe et al. uses a simple serial loop operation to search for color pairs comprising a color vibration, which requires a very long processing time due to the huge search space.
  In this paper, we propose an accelerated and optimized search method for color pairs that constitute the imperceptible color vibration for embedding information on LCD images. To achieve fast color pair search, we parallelized the search process, which is previously done individually, by using arrays representing the amount of movement and an operation to extract elements from the array that satisfy the conditions. In addition, we investigate the amount of information that can be superimposed on nine color images using the imperceptible color vibration and clarify the applicability of embedding information into images using the color vibration.</description>

      <title>Toward the Autonomous AI Doctor: Quantitative Benchmarking of an Autonomous Agentic AI Versus Board-Certified Clinicians in a Real World Setting</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.22902</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.22902v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Background: Globally we face a projected shortage of 11 million healthcare practitioners by 2030, and administrative burden consumes 50% of clinical time. Artificial intelligence (AI) has the potential to help alleviate these problems. However, no end-to-end autonomous large language model (LLM)-based AI system has been rigorously evaluated in real-world clinical practice. In this study, we evaluated whether a multi-agent LLM-based AI framework can function autonomously as an AI doctor in a virtual urgent care setting. Methods: We retrospectively compared the performance of the multi-agent AI system Doctronic and board-certified clinicians across 500 consecutive urgent-care telehealth encounters. The primary end points: diagnostic concordance, treatment plan consistency, and safety metrics, were assessed by blinded LLM-based adjudication and expert human review. Results: The top diagnosis of Doctronic and clinician matched in 81% of cases, and the treatment plan aligned in 99.2% of cases. No clinical hallucinations occurred (e.g., diagnosis or treatment not supported by clinical findings). In an expert review of discordant cases, AI performance was superior in 36.1%, and human performance was superior in 9.3%; the diagnoses were equivalent in the remaining cases. Conclusions: In this first large-scale validation of an autonomous AI doctor, we demonstrated strong diagnostic and treatment plan concordance with human clinicians, with AI performance matching and in some cases exceeding that of practicing clinicians. These findings indicate that multi-agent AI systems achieve comparable clinical decision-making to human providers and offer a potential solution to healthcare workforce shortages.</description>

      <title>A blessing or a burden? Exploring worker perspectives of using a social robot in a church</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.22903</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.22903v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent technological advances have allowed robots to assist in the service sector, and consequently accelerate job and sector transformation. Less attention has been paid to the use of robots in real-world organisations where social benefits, as opposed to profits, are the primary motivator. To explore these opportunities, we have partnered with a working church and visitor attraction. We conducted interviews with 15 participants from a range of stakeholder groups within the church to understand worker perspectives of introducing a social robot to the church and analysed the results using reflexive thematic analysis. Findings indicate mixed responses to the use of a robot, with participants highlighting the empathetic responsibility the church has towards people and the potential for unintended consequences. However, information provision and alleviation of menial or mundane tasks were identified as potential use cases. This highlights the need to consider not only the financial aspects of robot introduction, but also how social and intangible values shape what roles a robot should take on within an organisation.</description>

      <title>SketchMind: A Multi-Agent Cognitive Framework for Assessing Student-Drawn Scientific Sketches</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.22904</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.22904v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Scientific sketches (e.g., models) offer a powerful lens into students' conceptual understanding, yet AI-powered automated assessment of such free-form, visually diverse artifacts remains a critical challenge. Existing solutions often treat sketch evaluation as either an image classification task or monolithic vision-language models, which lack interpretability, pedagogical alignment, and adaptability across cognitive levels. To address these limitations, we present SketchMind, a cognitively grounded, multi-agent framework for evaluating and improving student-drawn scientific sketches. SketchMind comprises modular agents responsible for rubric parsing, sketch perception, cognitive alignment, and iterative feedback with sketch modification, enabling personalized and transparent evaluation. We evaluate SketchMind on a curated dataset of 3,575 student-generated sketches across six science assessment items with different highest order of Bloom's level that require students to draw models to explain phenomena. Compared to baseline GPT-4o performance without SRG (average accuracy: 55.6%), and with SRG integration achieves 77.1% average accuracy (+21.4% average absolute gain). We also demonstrate that multi-agent orchestration with SRG enhances SketchMind performance, for example, GPT-4.1 gains an average 8.9% increase in sketch prediction accuracy, outperforming single-agent pipelines across all items. Human evaluators rated the feedback and co-created sketches generated by \textsc{SketchMind} with GPT-4.1, which achieved an average of 4.1 out of 5, significantly higher than those of baseline models (e.g., 2.3 for GPT-4o). Experts noted the system's potential to meaningfully support conceptual growth through guided revision. Our code and (pending approval) dataset will be released to support reproducibility and future research in AI-driven education.</description>

      <title>Exploring LLM-generated Culture-specific Affective Human-Robot Tactile Interaction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.22905</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.22905v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: As large language models (LLMs) become increasingly integrated into robotic systems, their potential to generate socially and culturally appropriate affective touch remains largely unexplored. This study investigates whether LLMs-specifically GPT-3.5, GPT-4, and GPT-4o --can generate culturally adaptive tactile behaviours to convey emotions in human-robot interaction. We produced text based touch descriptions for 12 distinct emotions across three cultural contexts (Chinese, Belgian, and unspecified), and examined their interpretability in both robot-to-human and human-to-robot scenarios. A total of 90 participants (36 Chinese, 36 Belgian, and 18 culturally unspecified) evaluated these LLM-generated tactile behaviours for emotional decoding and perceived appropriateness. Results reveal that: (1) under matched cultural conditions, participants successfully decoded six out of twelve emotions-mainly socially oriented emotions such as love and Ekman emotions such as anger, however, self-focused emotions like pride and embarrassment were more difficult to interpret; (2) tactile behaviours were perceived as more appropriate when directed from human to robot than from robot to human, revealing an asymmetry in social expectations based on interaction roles; (3) behaviours interpreted as aggressive (e.g., anger), overly intimate (e.g., love), or emotionally ambiguous (i.e., not clearly decodable) were significantly more likely to be rated as inappropriate; and (4) cultural mismatches reduced decoding accuracy and increased the likelihood of behaviours being judged as inappropriate.</description>

      <title>Automated Label Placement on Maps via Large Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.22952</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.22952v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Label placement is a critical aspect of map design, serving as a form of spatial annotation that directly impacts clarity and interpretability. Despite its importance, label placement remains largely manual and difficult to scale, as existing automated systems struggle to integrate cartographic conventions, adapt to context, or interpret labeling instructions. In this work, we introduce a new paradigm for automatic label placement (ALP) that formulates the task as a data editing problem and leverages large language models (LLMs) for context-aware spatial annotation. To support this direction, we curate MAPLE, the first known benchmarking dataset for evaluating ALP on real-world maps, encompassing diverse landmark types and label placement annotations from open-source data. Our method retrieves labeling guidelines relevant to each landmark type leveraging retrieval-augmented generation (RAG), integrates them into prompts, and employs instruction-tuned LLMs to generate ideal label coordinates. We evaluate four open-source LLMs on MAPLE, analyzing both overall performance and generalization across different types of landmarks. This includes both zero-shot and instruction-tuned performance. Our results demonstrate that LLMs, when guided by structured prompts and domain-specific retrieval, can learn to perform accurate spatial edits, aligning the generated outputs with expert cartographic standards. Overall, our work presents a scalable framework for AI-assisted map finishing and demonstrates the potential of foundation models in structured data editing tasks.

      <title>ChatVis: Large Language Model Agent for Generating Scientific Visualizations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.23096</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.23096v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are rapidly increasing in capability, but they still struggle with highly specialized programming tasks such as scientific visualization. We present an LLM assistant, ChatVis, that aids the LLM to generate Python code for ParaView scientific visualization tasks, without the need for retraining or fine-tuning the LLM. ChatVis employs chain-of-thought prompt simplification, retrieval-augmented prompt generation using a vector database of documentation and code examples, and error checking with iterative prompt feedback to correct errors until a visualization is produced. An integral part of our approach is a benchmark suite of canonical visualization tasks, ParaView regression tests, and scientific use cases that includes comprehensive evaluation metrics. We evaluate our visualization assistant by comparing results with a variety of top-performing unassisted LLMs. We find that all the metrics are significantly improved with ChatVis.</description>

      <title>Accessibility Scout: Personalized Accessibility Scans of Built Environments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.23190</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.23190v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Assessing the accessibility of unfamiliar built environments is critical for people with disabilities. However, manual assessments, performed by users or their personal health professionals, are laborious and unscalable, while automatic machine learning methods often neglect an individual user's unique needs. Recent advances in Large Language Models (LLMs) enable novel approaches to this problem, balancing personalization with scalability to enable more adaptive and context-aware assessments of accessibility. We present Accessibility Scout, an LLM-based accessibility scanning system that identifies accessibility concerns from photos of built environments. With use, Accessibility Scout becomes an increasingly capable "accessibility scout", tailoring accessibility scans to an individual's mobility level, preferences, and specific environmental interests through collaborative Human-AI assessments. We present findings from three studies: a formative study with six participants to inform the design of Accessibility Scout, a technical evaluation of 500 images of built environments, and a user study with 10 participants of varying mobility. Results from our technical evaluation and user study show that Accessibility Scout can generate personalized accessibility scans that extend beyond traditional ADA considerations. Finally, we conclude with a discussion on the implications of our work and future steps for building more scalable and personalized accessibility assessments of the physical world.</description>

      <title>Silent Impact: Tracking Tennis Shots from the Passive Arm</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.23215</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.23215v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Wearable technology has transformed sports analytics, offering new dimensions in enhancing player experience. Yet, many solutions involve cumbersome setups that inhibit natural motion. In tennis, existing products require sensors on the racket or dominant arm, causing distractions and discomfort. We propose Silent Impact, a novel and user-friendly system that analyzes tennis shots using a sensor placed on the passive arm. Collecting Inertial Measurement Unit sensor data from 20 recreational tennis players, we developed neural networks that exclusively utilize passive arm data to detect and classify six shots, achieving a classification accuracy of 88.2% and a detection F1 score of 86.0%, comparable to the dominant arm. These models were then incorporated into an end-to-end prototype, which records passive arm motion through a smartwatch and displays a summary of shots on a mobile app. User study (N=10) showed that participants felt less burdened physically and mentally using Silent Impact on the passive arm. Overall, our research establishes the passive arm as an effective, comfortable alternative for tennis shot analysis, advancing user-friendly sports analytics.</description>

      <title>Real-time Generation of Various Types of Nodding for Avatar Attentive Listening System</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.23298</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.23298v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In human dialogue, nonverbal information such as nodding and facial expressions is as crucial as verbal information, and spoken dialogue systems are also expected to express such nonverbal behaviors. We focus on nodding, which is critical in an attentive listening system, and propose a model that predicts both its timing and type in real time. The proposed model builds on the voice activity projection (VAP) model, which predicts voice activity from both listener and speaker audio. We extend it to prediction of various types of nodding in a continuous and real-time manner unlike conventional models. In addition, the proposed model incorporates multi-task learning with verbal backchannel prediction and pretraining on general dialogue data. In the timing and type prediction task, the effectiveness of multi-task learning was significantly demonstrated. We confirmed that reducing the processing rate enables real-time operation without a substantial drop in accuracy, and integrated the model into an avatar attentive listening system. Subjective evaluations showed that it outperformed the conventional method, which always does nodding in sync with verbal backchannel. The code and trained models are available at https://github.com/MaAI-Kyoto/MaAI.</description>

      <title>Breaking the mould of Social Mixed Reality -- State-of-the-Art and Glossary</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.23454</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.23454v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This article explores a critical gap in Mixed Reality (MR) technology: while advances have been made, MR still struggles to authentically replicate human embodiment and socio-motor interaction. For MR to enable truly meaningful social experiences, it needs to incorporate multi-modal data streams and multi-agent interaction capabilities. To address this challenge, we present a comprehensive glossary covering key topics such as Virtual Characters and Autonomisation, Responsible AI, Ethics by Design, and the Scientific Challenges of Social MR within Neuroscience, Embodiment, and Technology. Our aim is to drive the transformative evolution of MR technologies that prioritize human-centric innovation, fostering richer digital connections. We advocate for MR systems that enhance social interaction and collaboration between humans and virtual autonomous agents, ensuring inclusivity, ethical design and psychological safety in the process.</description>

      <title>Automated Feedback on Student-Generated UML and ER Diagrams Using Large Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.23470</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.23470v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: UML and ER diagrams are foundational in computer science education but come with challenges for learners due to the need for abstract thinking, contextual understanding, and mastery of both syntax and semantics. These complexities are difficult to address through traditional teaching methods, which often struggle to provide scalable, personalized feedback, especially in large classes. We introduce DUET (Diagrammatic UML &amp; ER Tutor), a prototype of an LLM-based tool, which converts a reference diagram and a student-submitted diagram into a textual representation and provides structured feedback based on the differences. It uses a multi-stage LLM pipeline to compare diagrams and generate reflective feedback. Furthermore, the tool enables analytical insights for educators, aiming to foster self-directed learning and inform instructional strategies. We evaluated DUET through semi-structured interviews with six participants, including two educators and four teaching assistants. They identified strengths such as accessibility, scalability, and learning support alongside limitations, including reliability and potential misuse. Participants also suggested potential improvements, such as bulk upload functionality and interactive clarification features. DUET presents a promising direction for integrating LLMs into modeling education and offers a foundation for future classroom integration and empirical evaluation.</description>

      <title>Digital literacy interventions can boost humans in discerning deepfakes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.23492</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.23492v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Deepfakes, i.e., images generated by artificial intelligence (AI), can erode trust in institutions and compromise election outcomes, as people often struggle to discern real images from deepfakes. Improving digital literacy can help address these challenges, yet scalable and effective approaches remain largely unexplored. Here, we compare the efficacy of five digital literacy interventions to boost people's ability to discern deepfakes: (1) textual guidance on common indicators of deepfakes; (2) visual demonstrations of these indicators; (3) a gamified exercise for identifying deepfakes; (4) implicit learning through repeated exposure and feedback; and (5) explanations of how deepfakes are generated with the help of AI. We conducted an experiment with N=1,200 participants from the United States to test the immediate and long-term effectiveness of our interventions. Our results show that our interventions can boost deepfake discernment by up to 13 percentage points while maintaining trust in real images. Altogether, our approach is scalable, suitable for diverse populations, and highly effective for boosting deepfake detection while maintaining trust in truthful information.</description>

      <title>Agency Among Agents: Designing with Hypertextual Friction in the Algorithmic Web</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.23585</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.23585v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Today's algorithm-driven interfaces, from recommendation feeds to GenAI tools, often prioritize engagement and efficiency at the expense of user agency. As systems take on more decision-making, users have less control over what they see and how meaning or relationships between content are constructed. This paper introduces "Hypertextual Friction," a conceptual design stance that repositions classical hypertext principles--friction, traceability, and structure--as actionable values for reclaiming agency in algorithmically mediated environments. Through a comparative analysis of real-world interfaces--Wikipedia vs. Instagram Explore, and Are.na vs. GenAI image tools--we examine how different systems structure user experience, navigation, and authorship. We show that hypertext systems emphasize provenance, associative thinking, and user-driven meaning-making, while algorithmic systems tend to obscure process and flatten participation. We contribute: (1) a comparative analysis of how interface structures shape agency in user-driven versus agent-driven systems, and (2) a conceptual stance that offers hypertextual values as design commitments for reclaiming agency in an increasingly algorithmic web.</description>

      <title>Evaluating Large Language Models (LLMs) in Financial NLP: A Comparative Study on Financial Report Analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.22936</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.22936v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities across a wide variety of Financial Natural Language Processing (FinNLP) tasks. However, systematic comparisons among widely used LLMs remain underexplored. Given the rapid advancement and growing influence of LLMs in financial analysis, this study conducts a thorough comparative evaluation of five leading LLMs, GPT, Claude, Perplexity, Gemini and DeepSeek, using 10-K filings from the 'Magnificent Seven' technology companies. We create a set of domain-specific prompts and then use three methodologies to evaluate model performance: human annotation, automated lexical-semantic metrics (ROUGE, Cosine Similarity, Jaccard), and model behavior diagnostics (prompt-level variance and across-model similarity). The results show that GPT gives the most coherent, semantically aligned, and contextually relevant answers; followed by Claude and Perplexity. Gemini and DeepSeek, on the other hand, have more variability and less agreement. Also, the similarity and stability of outputs change from company to company and over time, showing that they are sensitive to how prompts are written and what source material is used.</description>

      <title>LLM-Assisted Cheating Detection in Korean Language via Keystrokes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.22956</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.22956v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper presents a keystroke-based framework for detecting LLM-assisted cheating in Korean, addressing key gaps in prior research regarding language coverage, cognitive context, and the granularity of LLM involvement. Our proposed dataset includes 69 participants who completed writing tasks under three conditions: Bona fide writing, paraphrasing ChatGPT responses, and transcribing ChatGPT responses. Each task spans six cognitive processes defined in Bloom's Taxonomy (remember, understand, apply, analyze, evaluate, and create). We extract interpretable temporal and rhythmic features and evaluate multiple classifiers under both Cognition-Aware and Cognition-Unaware settings. Temporal features perform well under Cognition-Aware evaluation scenarios, while rhythmic features generalize better under cross-cognition scenarios. Moreover, detecting bona fide and transcribed responses was easier than paraphrased ones for both the proposed models and human evaluators, with the models significantly outperforming the humans. Our findings affirm that keystroke dynamics facilitate reliable detection of LLM-assisted writing across varying cognitive demands and writing strategies, including paraphrasing and transcribing LLM-generated responses.</description>

      <title>Beyond Rigid AI: Towards Natural Human-Machine Symbiosis for Interoperative Surgical Assistance</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.23088</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.23088v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Emerging surgical data science and robotics solutions, especially those designed to provide assistance in situ, require natural human-machine interfaces to fully unlock their potential in providing adaptive and intuitive aid. Contemporary AI-driven solutions remain inherently rigid, offering limited flexibility and restricting natural human-machine interaction in dynamic surgical environments. These solutions rely heavily on extensive task-specific pre-training, fixed object categories, and explicit manual-prompting. This work introduces a novel Perception Agent that leverages speech-integrated prompt-engineered large language models (LLMs), segment anything model (SAM), and any-point tracking foundation models to enable a more natural human-machine interaction in real-time intraoperative surgical assistance. Incorporating a memory repository and two novel mechanisms for segmenting unseen elements, Perception Agent offers the flexibility to segment both known and unseen elements in the surgical scene through intuitive interaction. Incorporating the ability to memorize novel elements for use in future surgeries, this work takes a marked step towards human-machine symbiosis in surgical procedures. Through quantitative analysis on a public dataset, we show that the performance of our agent is on par with considerably more labor-intensive manual-prompting strategies. Qualitatively, we show the flexibility of our agent in segmenting novel elements (instruments, phantom grafts, and gauze) in a custom-curated dataset. By offering natural human-machine interaction and overcoming rigidity, our Perception Agent potentially brings AI-based real-time assistance in dynamic surgical environments closer to reality.</description>

      <title>User Experience Estimation in Human-Robot Interaction Via Multi-Instance Learning of Multimodal Social Signals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.23544</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.23544v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In recent years, the demand for social robots has grown, requiring them to adapt their behaviors based on users' states. Accurately assessing user experience (UX) in human-robot interaction (HRI) is crucial for achieving this adaptability. UX is a multi-faceted measure encompassing aspects such as sentiment and engagement, yet existing methods often focus on these individually. This study proposes a UX estimation method for HRI by leveraging multimodal social signals. We construct a UX dataset and develop a Transformer-based model that utilizes facial expressions and voice for estimation. Unlike conventional models that rely on momentary observations, our approach captures both short- and long-term interaction patterns using a multi-instance learning framework. This enables the model to capture temporal dynamics in UX, providing a more holistic representation. Experimental results demonstrate that our method outperforms third-party human evaluators in UX estimation.</description>

      <title>Human-Exoskeleton Kinematic Calibration to Improve Hand Tracking for Dexterous Teleoperation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.23592</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.23592v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Hand exoskeletons are critical tools for dexterous teleoperation and immersive manipulation interfaces, but achieving accurate hand tracking remains a challenge due to user-specific anatomical variability and donning inconsistencies. These issues lead to kinematic misalignments that degrade tracking performance and limit applicability in precision tasks. We propose a subject-specific calibration framework for exoskeleton-based hand tracking that uses redundant joint sensing and a residual-weighted optimization strategy to estimate virtual link parameters. Implemented on the Maestro exoskeleton, our method improves joint angle and fingertip position estimation across users with varying hand geometries. We introduce a data-driven approach to empirically tune cost function weights using motion capture ground truth, enabling more accurate and consistent calibration across participants. Quantitative results from seven subjects show substantial reductions in joint and fingertip tracking errors compared to uncalibrated and evenly weighted models. Qualitative visualizations using a Unity-based virtual hand further confirm improvements in motion fidelity. The proposed framework generalizes across exoskeleton designs with closed-loop kinematics and minimal sensing, and lays the foundation for high-fidelity teleoperation and learning-from-demonstration applications.</description>

      <title>Improving annotator selection in Active Learning using a mood and fatigue-aware Recommender System</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.23756</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.23756v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This study centers on overcoming the challenge of selecting the best annotators for each query in Active Learning (AL), with the objective of minimizing misclassifications. AL recognizes the challenges related to cost and time when acquiring labeled data, and decreases the number of labeled data needed. Nevertheless, there is still the necessity to reduce annotation errors, aiming to be as efficient as possible, to achieve the expected accuracy faster. Most strategies for query-annotator pairs do not consider internal factors that affect productivity, such as mood, attention, motivation, and fatigue levels. This work addresses this gap in the existing literature, by not only considering how the internal factors influence annotators (mood and fatigue levels) but also presenting a new query-annotator pair strategy, using a Knowledge-Based Recommendation System (RS). The RS ranks the available annotators, allowing to choose one or more to label the queried instance using their past accuracy values, and their mood and fatigue levels, as well as information about the instance queried. This work bases itself on existing literature on mood and fatigue influence on human performance, simulating annotators in a realistic manner, and predicting their performance with the RS. The results show that considering past accuracy values, as well as mood and fatigue levels reduces the number of annotation errors made by the annotators, and the uncertainty of the model through its training, when compared to not using internal factors. Accuracy and F1-score values were also better in the proposed approach, despite not being as substantial as the aforementioned. The methodologies and findings presented in this study begin to explore the open challenge of human cognitive factors affecting AL.</description>

Abstract: In the context of evolving supply chain management, the significance of efficient inventory management has grown substantially for businesses. However, conventional manual and experience-based approaches often struggle to meet the complexities of modern market demands. This research introduces an intelligent inventory management system to address challenges related to inaccurate data, delayed monitoring, and overreliance on subjective experience in forecasting. The proposed system integrates bar code and distributed flutter application technologies for intelligent perception, alongside comprehensive big data analytics to enable data-driven decision-making. Through meticulous analysis, system design, critical technology exploration, and simulation validation, the effectiveness of the proposed system is successfully demonstrated. The intelligent system facilitates second-level monitoring, high-frequency checks, and artificial intelligence-driven forecasting, consequently enhancing the automation, precision, and intelligence of inventory management. This system contributes to cost reduction and optimized inventory sizes through accurate predictions and informed decisions, ultimately achieving a mutually beneficial scenario.

      <title>EEG-SCMM: Soft Contrastive Masked Modeling for Cross-Corpus EEG-Based Emotion Recognition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.09186</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.09186v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Emotion recognition using electroencephalography (EEG) signals has attracted increasing attention in recent years. However, existing methods often lack generalization in cross-corpus settings, where a model trained on one dataset is directly applied to another without retraining, due to differences in data distribution and recording conditions. To tackle the challenge of cross-corpus EEG-based emotion recognition, we propose a novel framework termed Soft Contrastive Masked Modeling (SCMM). Grounded in the theory of emotional continuity, SCMM integrates soft contrastive learning with a hybrid masking strategy to effectively capture emotion dynamics (refer to short-term continuity). Specifically, in the self-supervised learning stage, we propose a soft weighting mechanism that assigns similarity scores to sample pairs, enabling fine-grained modeling of emotional transitions and capturing the temporal continuity of human emotions. To further enhance representation learning, we design a similarity-aware aggregator that fuses complementary information from semantically related samples based on pairwise similarities, thereby improving feature expressiveness and reconstruction quality. This dual design contributes to a more discriminative and transferable representation, which is crucial for robust cross-corpus generalization. Extensive experiments on the SEED, SEED-IV, and DEAP datasets show that SCMM achieves state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance, outperforming the second-best method by an average accuracy of 4.26% under both same-class and different-class cross-corpus settings.

      <title>AI vs. Human Paintings? Deciphering Public Interactions and Perceptions towards AI-Generated Paintings on TikTok</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.11911</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.11911v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: With the development of generative AI technology, a vast array of AI-generated paintings (AIGP) have gone viral on social media like TikTok. However, some negative news about AIGP has also emerged. For example, in 2022, numerous painters worldwide organized a large-scale anti-AI movement because of the infringement in generative AI model training. This event reflected a social issue that, with the development and application of generative AI, public feedback and feelings towards it may have been overlooked. Therefore, to investigate public interactions and perceptions towards AIGP on social media, we analyzed user engagement level and comment sentiment scores of AIGP using human painting videos as a baseline. In analyzing user engagement, we also considered the possible moderating effect of the aesthetic quality of Paintings. Utilizing topic modeling, we identified seven reasons, including hyperrealistic quality, ambivalent reactions, perceived theft of art, etc., leading to negative public perceptions of AIGP. Our work may provide instructive suggestions for future generative AI technology development and avoid potential crises in human-AI collaboration.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.07486v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We define "visual story-writing" as using visual representations of story elements to support writing and revising narrative texts. To demonstrate this approach, we developed a text editor that automatically visualizes a graph of entity interactions, movement between locations, and a timeline of story events. Interacting with these visualizations results in suggested text edits: for example, connecting two characters in the graph creates an interaction between them, moving an entity updates their described location, and rearranging events on the timeline reorganizes the narrative sequence. Through two user studies on narrative text editing and writing, we found that visuals supported participants in planning high-level revisions, tracking story elements, and exploring story variations in ways that encourage creativity. Broadly, our work lays the foundation for writing support, not just through words, but also visuals.</description>

Abstract: Autonomous agents powered by Large Language Models are transforming AI, creating an imperative for the visualization field to embrace agentic frameworks. However, our field's focus on a human in the sensemaking loop raises critical questions about autonomy, delegation, and coordination for such \textit{agentic visualization} that preserve human agency while amplifying analytical capabilities. This paper addresses these questions by reinterpreting existing visualization systems with semi-automated or fully automatic AI components through an agentic lens. Based on this analysis, we extract a collection of design patterns for agentic visualization, including agentic roles, communication and coordination. These patterns provide a foundation for future agentic visualization systems that effectively harness AI agents while maintaining human insight and control.</description>

      <title>Ragged Blocks: Rendering Structured Text with Style</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.06460</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.06460v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Whether it be source code in a programming language, prose in natural language, or otherwise, text is highly structured. Currently, text visualizations are confined either to _flat, line-based_ decorations, which can convey only limited information about textual structure, or _nested boxes_, which convey structure but often destroy the typographic layout of the underlying text. We hypothesize that the lack of rich styling options limits the kinds of information that are displayed alongside text, wherever it may be displayed.
  In this paper, we show that it is possible to achieve arbitrarily nested decorations while minimally disturbing the underlying typographic layout. Specifically, we present a layout algorithm that generates _ragged blocks_, or _rocks_, which are rectilinear polygons that allow nested text to be compactly rendered even when styled with borders and padding. Our layout algorithm is evaluated on a benchmark suite comprising representative source code files in multiple programming languages. The (ragged block) layouts produced by our algorithm are substantially more compact than the (rectangular block) layouts produced by conventional techniques, when uniformly styling every element in the syntax tree with borders and padding.</description>

      <title>Multidimensional Assessment of Takeover Performance in Conditionally Automated Driving</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.22252</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.22252v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: When automated driving systems encounter complex situations beyond their operational capabilities, they issue takeover requests, prompting drivers to resume vehicle control and return to the driving loop as a critical safety backup. However, this control transition places significant demands on drivers, requiring them to promptly respond to takeover requests while executing high-quality interventions. To ensure safe and comfortable control transitions, it is essential to develop a deep understanding of the key factors influencing various takeover performance aspects. This study evaluates drivers' takeover performance across three dimensions: response efficiency, user experience, and driving safety - using a driving simulator experiment. EXtreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost) models are used to investigate the contributions of two critical factors, i.e., Situational Awareness (SA) and Spare Capacity (SC), in predicting various takeover performance metrics by comparing the predictive results to the baseline models that rely solely on basic Driver Characteristics (DC). The results reveal that (i) higher SA enables drivers to respond to takeover requests more quickly, particularly for reflexive responses; and (ii) SC shows a greater overall impact on takeover quality than SA, where higher SC generally leads to enhanced subjective rating scores and objective execution trajectories. These findings highlight the distinct yet complementary roles of SA and SC in shaping performance components, offering valuable insights for optimizing human-vehicle interactions and enhancing automated driving system design.</description>

      <title>VRISE: A Virtual Reality Platfrom for Immersive and Interactive Surveying Education</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.22810</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.22810v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Surveying is a core component of civil engineering education, requiring students to engage in hands-on spatial measurement, instrumentation handling, and field-based decision-making. However, traditional instruction often poses logistical and cognitive challenges that can hinder accessibility and student engagement. While virtual laboratories have gained traction in engineering education, few are purposefully designed to support flexible, adaptive learning in surveying. To address this gap, we developed Virtual Reality for Immersive and Interactive Surveying Education (VRISE), an immersive virtual reality laboratory that replicates ground-based and aerial surveying tasks through customizable, accessible, and user-friendly modules. VRISE features interactive experiences such as differential leveling with a digital level equipment and waypoint-based drone navigation, enhanced by input smoothing, adaptive interfaces, and real-time feedback to accommodate diverse learning styles. Evaluation across multiple user sessions demonstrated consistent gains in measurement accuracy, task efficiency, and interaction quality, with a clear progression in skill development across the ground-based and aerial surveying modalities. By reducing cognitive load and physical demands, even in tasks requiring fine motor control and spatial reasoning, VRISE demonstrates the potential of immersive, repeatable digital environments to enhance surveying education, broaden participation, and strengthen core competencies in a safe and engaging setting.</description>

      <title>How AI Ideas Affect the Creativity, Diversity, and Evolution of Human Ideas: Evidence From a Large, Dynamic Experiment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.13481</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.13481v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Exposure to large language model output is rapidly increasing. How will seeing AI-generated ideas affect human ideas? We conducted an experiment (800+ participants, 40+ countries) where participants viewed creative ideas that were from ChatGPT or prior experimental participants and then brainstormed their own idea. We varied the number of AI-generated examples (none, low, or high exposure) and if the examples were labeled as 'AI' (disclosure). Our dynamic experiment design -- ideas from prior participants in an experimental condition are used as stimuli for future participants in the same experimental condition -- speaks to the interdependent process of cultural creation: creative ideas are built upon prior ideas. Hence, we capture the compounding effects of having LLMs 'in the culture loop'. We find that high AI exposure (but not low AI exposure) did not affect the creativity of individual ideas but did increase the average amount and rate of change of collective idea diversity. AI made ideas different, not better. There were no main effects of disclosure. We also found that self-reported creative people were less influenced by knowing an idea was from AI and that participants may knowingly adopt AI ideas when the task is difficult.

      <title>EducationQ: Evaluating LLMs' Teaching Capabilities Through Multi-Agent Dialogue Framework</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.14928</link>

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) increasingly serve as educational tools, yet evaluating their teaching capabilities remains challenging due to the resource-intensive, context-dependent, and methodologically complex nature of teacher-student interactions. We introduce EducationQ, a multi-agent dialogue framework that efficiently assesses teaching capabilities through simulated dynamic educational scenarios, featuring specialized agents for teaching, learning, and evaluation. Testing 14 LLMs across major AI Organizations (OpenAI, Meta, Google, Anthropic, and others) on 1,498 questions spanning 13 disciplines and 10 difficulty levels reveals that teaching effectiveness does not correlate linearly with model scale or general reasoning capabilities - with some smaller open-source models outperforming larger commercial counterparts in teaching contexts. This finding highlights a critical gap in current evaluations that prioritize knowledge recall over interactive pedagogy. Our mixed-methods evaluation, combining quantitative metrics with qualitative analysis and expert case studies, identifies distinct pedagogical strengths employed by top-performing models (e.g., sophisticated questioning strategies, adaptive feedback mechanisms). Human expert evaluations show 78% agreement with our automated qualitative analysis of effective teaching behaviors, validating our methodology. EducationQ demonstrates that LLMs-as-teachers require specialized optimization beyond simple scaling, suggesting next-generation educational AI prioritize targeted enhancement of specific pedagogical effectiveness.</description>

      <title>Prompt Engineering Techniques for Mitigating Cultural Bias Against Arabs and Muslims in Large Language Models: A Systematic Review</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.18199</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.18199v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Large language models have demonstrated remarkable capabilities across various domains, yet concerns about cultural bias - particularly towards Arabs and Muslims - pose significant ethical challenges by perpetuating harmful stereotypes and marginalization. Despite growing recognition of bias in LLMs, prompt engineering strategies specifically addressing Arab and Muslim representation remain understudied. This mixed-methods systematic review examines such techniques, offering evidence-based guidance for researchers and practitioners. Following PRISMA guidelines and Kitchenham's systematic review methodology, we analyzed 8 empirical studies published between 2021-2024 investigating bias mitigation strategies. Our findings reveal five primary prompt engineering approaches: cultural prompting, affective priming, self-debiasing techniques, structured multi-step pipelines, and parameter-optimized continuous prompts. Although all approaches show potential for reducing bias, effectiveness varied substantially across studies and bias types. Evidence suggests that certain bias types may be more resistant to prompt-based mitigation than others. Structured multi-step pipelines demonstrated the highest overall effectiveness, achieving up to 87.7% reduction in bias, though they require greater technical expertise. Cultural prompting offers broader accessibility with substantial effectiveness. These results underscore the accessibility of prompt engineering for mitigating cultural bias without requiring access to model parameters. The limited number of studies identified highlights a significant research gap in this critical area. Future research should focus on developing culturally adaptive prompting techniques, creating Arab and Muslim-specific evaluation resources, and integrating prompt engineering with complementary debiasing methods to address deeper stereotypes while maintaining model utility.</description>
