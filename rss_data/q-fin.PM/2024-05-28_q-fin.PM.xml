      <title>DSPO: An End-to-End Framework for Direct Sorted Portfolio Construction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.15833</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.15833v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In quantitative investment, constructing characteristic-sorted portfolios is a crucial strategy for asset allocation. Traditional methods transform raw stock data of varying frequencies into predictive characteristic factors for asset sorting, often requiring extensive manual design and misalignment between prediction and optimization goals. To address these challenges, we introduce Direct Sorted Portfolio Optimization (DSPO), an innovative end-to-end framework that efficiently processes raw stock data to construct sorted portfolios directly. DSPO's neural network architecture seamlessly transitions stock data from input to output while effectively modeling the intra-dependency of time-steps and inter-dependency among all tradable stocks. Additionally, we incorporate a novel Monotonical Logistic Regression loss, which directly maximizes the likelihood of constructing optimal sorted portfolios. To the best of our knowledge, DSPO is the first method capable of handling market cross-sections with thousands of tradable stocks fully end-to-end from raw multi-frequency data. Empirical results demonstrate DSPO's effectiveness, yielding a RankIC of 10.12\% and an accumulated return of 121.94\% on the New York Stock Exchange in 2023-2024, and a RankIC of 9.11\% with a return of 108.74\% in other markets during 2021-2022.</description>

      <title>Intertemporal Cost-efficient Consumption</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.16336</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.16336v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We aim to provide an intertemporal, cost-efficient consumption model that extends the consumption optimization inspired by the Distribution Builder, a tool developed by Sharpe, Johnson, and Goldstein. The Distribution Builder enables the recovery of investors' risk preferences by allowing them to select a desired distribution of terminal wealth within their budget constraints.
  This approach differs from the classical portfolio optimization, which considers the agent's risk aversion modeled by utility functions that are challenging to measure in practice. Our intertemporal model captures the dependent structure between consumption periods using copulas. This strategy is demonstrated using both the Black-Scholes and CEV models.</description>

      <title>Asset and Factor Risk Budgeting: A Balanced Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.11132</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.11132v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Portfolio optimization methods have evolved significantly since Markowitz introduced the mean-variance framework in 1952. While the theoretical appeal of this approach is undeniable, its practical implementation poses important challenges, primarily revolving around the intricate task of estimating expected returns. As a result, practitioners and scholars have explored alternative methods that prioritize risk management and diversification. One such approach is Risk Budgeting, where portfolio risk is allocated among assets according to predefined risk budgets. The effectiveness of Risk Budgeting in achieving true diversification can, however, be questioned, given that asset returns are often influenced by a small number of risk factors. From this perspective, one question arises: is it possible to allocate risk at the factor level using the Risk Budgeting approach? First, we introduce a comprehensive framework to address this question by introducing risk measures directly associated with risk factor exposures and demonstrating the desirable mathematical properties of these risk measures, making them suitable for optimization. Then, we propose a novel framework to find portfolios that effectively balance the risk contributions from both assets and factors. Leveraging standard stochastic algorithms, our framework enables the use of a wide range of risk measures to construct diversified portfolios.</description>
