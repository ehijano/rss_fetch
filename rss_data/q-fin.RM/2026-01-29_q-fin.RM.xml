      <title>Incorporating data drift to perform survival analysis on credit risk</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.20533</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.20533v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Survival analysis has become a standard approach for modelling time to default by time-varying covariates in credit risk. Unlike most existing methods that implicitly assume a stationary data-generating process, in practise, mortgage portfolios are exposed to various forms of data drift caused by changing borrower behaviour, macroeconomic conditions, policy regimes and so on. This study investigates the impact of data drift on survival-based credit risk models and proposes a dynamic joint modelling framework to improve robustness under non-stationary environments. The proposed model integrates a longitudinal behavioural marker derived from balance dynamics with a discrete-time hazard formulation, combined with landmark one-hot encoding and isotonic calibration. Three types of data drift (sudden, incremental and recurring) are simulated and analysed on mortgage loan datasets from Freddie Mac. Experiments and corresponding evidence show that the proposed landmark-based joint model consistently outperforms classical survival models, tree-based drift-adaptive learners and gradient boosting methods in terms of discrimination and calibration across all drift scenarios, which confirms the superiority of our model design.</description>

      <title>Exploring different subtypes of recurrent event Cox-regression models in modelling lifetime default risk: A tutorial</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.01044</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.01044v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In the pursuit of modelling a loan's probability of default (PD) over its lifetime, repeat default events are often ignored when using Cox Proportional Hazard (PH) models. Excluding such events may produce biased and inaccurate PD-estimates, which can compromise financial buffers against future losses. Accordingly, we investigate a few subtypes of Cox-models that can incorporate recurrent default events. We explore both the Andersen-Gill (AG) and the Prentice-Williams-Peterson (PWP) spell-time models using real-world data as an illustration. These models are compared against a baseline that deliberately ignores recurrent events, called the time to first default (TFD) model. Our models are evaluated using Harrell's c-statistic, adjusted Cox-Sell residuals, and a novel extension of time-dependent receiver operating characteristic analysis. From these Cox-models, we demonstrate how to derive a portfolio-level term-structure of default risk, which is a series of marginal PD-estimates over the average loan's lifetime. While the TFD- and PWP-models do not differ significantly across all diagnostics, the AG-model underperformed expectations. We believe that our pedagogical tutorial, as accompanied by a codebase, would be of great value to practitioner and regulator alike. Accordingly, our work enhances the current practice of using Cox-modelling in producing timeous and accurate PD-estimates under IFRS 9.</description>

      <title>A tail-shape actuarial index based on equal level relationships between Value at Risk and Expected Shortfall</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.13562</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.13562v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We introduce a new actuarial tail-shape index, the $\theta$-index, based on a probability equal level relationship between Value at Risk and Expected Shortfall. The index is defined at each tail probability level as the parameter value for which Value at Risk coincides with Flexible Expected Shortfall, that is a convex mixture of Expected Shortfall and the mean. This yields a level-dependent, scale-free measure of upper tail behaviour. We study basic theoretical properties of the $\theta$-index and introduce a partial order for comparing loss distributions, characterized by the monotonicity of right-tail spread ratios. Additionally, the index leads to characterizations of the tail behaviour of a loss distribution as consistent to the generalized Pareto model, through a direct connection to the mean excess function. Moreover, we derive Euler risk contributions for the $\theta$-index and use probability equal level relationships to compute Value at Risk allocations in a more stable way. Finally, the $\theta$-index is examined as a diagnostic tool for distinguishing tail regimes and its capabilities are illustrated using the Danish fire insurance dataset.</description>
