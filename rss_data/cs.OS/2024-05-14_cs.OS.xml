      <title>Optimizing Task Scheduling in Heterogeneous Computing Environments: A Comparative Analysis of CPU, GPU, and ASIC Platforms Using E2C Simulator</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.08187</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.08187v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Efficient task scheduling in heterogeneous computing environments is imperative for optimizing resource utilization and minimizing task completion times. In this study, we conducted a comprehensive benchmarking analysis to evaluate the performance of four scheduling algorithms First Come, First-Served (FCFS), FCFS with No Queuing (FCFS-NQ), Minimum Expected Completion Time (MECT), and Minimum Expected Execution Time (MEET) across varying workload scenarios. We defined three workload scenarios: low, medium, and high, each representing different levels of computational demands. Through rigorous experimentation and analysis, we assessed the effectiveness of each algorithm in terms of total completion percentage, energy consumption, wasted energy, and energy per completion. Our findings highlight the strengths and limitations of each algorithm, with MECT and MEET emerging as robust contenders, dynamically prioritizing tasks based on comprehensive estimates of completion and execution times. Furthermore, MECT and MEET exhibit superior energy efficiency compared to FCFS and FCFS-NQ, underscoring their suitability for resource-constrained environments. This study provides valuable insights into the efficacy of task scheduling algorithms in heterogeneous computing environments, enabling informed decision-making to enhance resource allocation, minimize task completion times, and improve energy efficiency</description>

      <title>HookChain: A new perspective for Bypassing EDR Solutions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.16856</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.16856v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In the current digital security ecosystem, where threats evolve rapidly and with complexity, companies developing Endpoint Detection and Response (EDR) solutions are in constant search for innovations that not only keep up but also anticipate emerging attack vectors. In this context, this article introduces the HookChain, a look from another perspective at widely known techniques, which when combined, provide an additional layer of sophisticated evasion against traditional EDR systems. Through a precise combination of IAT Hooking techniques, dynamic SSN resolution, and indirect system calls, HookChain redirects the execution flow of Windows subsystems in a way that remains invisible to the vigilant eyes of EDRs that only act on Ntdll.dll, without requiring changes to the source code of the applications and malwares involved. This work not only challenges current conventions in cybersecurity but also sheds light on a promising path for future protection strategies, leveraging the understanding that continuous evolution is key to the effectiveness of digital security. By developing and exploring the HookChain technique, this study significantly contributes to the body of knowledge in endpoint security, stimulating the development of more robust and adaptive solutions that can effectively address the ever-changing dynamics of digital threats. This work aspires to inspire deep reflection and advancement in the research and development of security technologies that are always several steps ahead of adversaries.
  UNDER CONSTRUCTION RESEARCH: This paper is not the final version, as it is currently undergoing final tests against several EDRs. We expect to release the final version by August 2024.</description>
