      <title>Gross-Neveu-Yukawa SO(2) and SO(3) tensorial criticality</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.16842</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.16842v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the relativistic SO(2)- and SO(3)-invariant Gross-Neveu-Yukawa field theories for real, rank-two, symmetric, traceless tensor order parameters coupled to $N_{\text{f}}$ flavors of two-component Dirac fermions. These field theories arise as an effective description of fractionalized spin-orbital liquids. The two theories are the simplest and special cases of the more general class of field theories with SO($N$) symmetric tensor order parameter coupled to Dirac fermions, in which the symmetry is low enough to allow only one, and not the usual two quartic self-interaction terms. Using two-loop renormalization group near the upper critical dimension, we demonstrate that the theory exhibits a new critical fixed point and the concomitant continuous phase transition for any value of $N_{\text{f}}$. We discuss the crucial role of the symmetry-allowed sextic self-interactions in the selection of the ground state configuration in the case of SO(3). The universal quantities such as the the anomalous dimensions of order parameters and fermions, the correlation length exponent, and the mass gap ratio between order parameter and fermion masses are computed up to $\epsilon^{2}$ order.</description>

      <title>Robust translational invariance in topological bands against lattice potentials and disorders</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.16862</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.16862v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We theoretically show that the continuous magnetic translational invariance within the Hilbert (sub-)space of a single Landau level (LL) can persist even in the presence of a superlattice electrostatic potential modulation, while such invariance is broken in the full real-space Hilbert space. This is due to the interplay of the superlattice constant and the fundamental length scale of the quantum Hall fluids. In particular for the lowest LL (LLL), when the spacing of superlattice is below the magnetic length, continuous magnetic translational symmetry is very robust. For the fractional quantum Hall phases, the continuous translational symmetry is preserved when the superlattice spacing is below the corresponding fundamental lengths which we can now quantitatively define, which is different from the length scale from the quantum metric. Moreover, our analysis implies that the dynamics of the anyonic excitations can be robust against the long wavelength part of the disorder, and we discuss the related experimental ramifications.</description>

      <title>Abnormally enhanced Hall Lorenz number in the magnetic Weyl semimetal NdAlSi</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.17156</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.17156v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In Landau's celebrated Fermi liquid theory, electrons in a metal obey the Wiedemann--Franz law at the lowest temperatures. This law states that electron heat and charge transport are linked by a constant $L_0$, i.e., the Sommerfeld value of the Lorenz number ($L$). Such relation can be violated at elevated temperatures where the abundant inelastic scattering leads to a reduction of the Lorenz number ($L &lt; L_0$). Here, we report a rare case of remarkably enhanced Lorenz number ($L &gt; L_0$) discovered in the magnetic topological semimetal NdAlSi. Measurements of the transverse electrical and thermal transport coefficients reveal that the Hall Lorenz number $L_{xy}$ in NdAlSi starts to deviate from the canonical value far above its magnetic ordering temperature. Moreover, $L_{xy}$ displays strong nonmonotonic temperature and field dependence, reaching its maximum value close to 2$L_0$ in an intermediate parameter range. Further analysis excludes charge-neutral excitations as the origin of enhanced $L_{xy}$. Alternatively, we attribute it to the Kondo-type elastic scattering off localized 4$f$ electrons, which creates a peculiar energy distribution of the quasiparticle relaxation time. Our results provide insights into the perplexing transport phenomena caused by the interplay between charge and spin degrees of freedom.</description>

      <title>Quasiparticle interference in altermagnets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.17185</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.17185v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A novel collinear magnetic phase, termed ``altermagnetism,'' has recently been delimited, characterized by zero net magnetization and momentum-dependent collinear spin-splitting. To understand the intriguing physical effects of altermagnets and explore their potential applications, it is crucial to analyze both the geometric and spin configurations of altermagnetic Fermi surfaces. Here, we conduct a comprehensive study of the quasiparticle interference (QPI) effects induced by both nonmagnetic and magnetic impurities in metallic altermagnets, incorporating the influence of Zeeman splitting and spin-orbit coupling. By examining the QPI patterns for various spin polarizations of magnetic impurities and different spin-probe channels, we identify a series of distinctive signatures that can be used to characterize altermagnetic Fermi surfaces. These predicted signatures can be directly compared with experimental results obtained through spin-resolved scanning tunneling spectroscopy.</description>

      <title>Topological domain-wall pump with $\mathbb{Z}_2$ spontaneous symmetry breaking</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.17219</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.17219v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A domain-wall pump by an extended cluster model of $S=1/2$ spins is proposed with local $U(1)$ gauge invariance. Its snapshot ground state is gapped and doubly degenerated due to $\mathbb{Z}_2$ invariance, which is broken by an infinitesimal boundary magnetic field. The ground state associated with the spontaneous symmetry breaking (SSB) is still symmetry-protected with additional spatial inversion that is characterized by the $\mathbb{Z}_2$ Berry phase. We investigate the topological domain-wall pump with/without boundaries. The topological pump associated with the inversion symmetry-breaking path induces a non-trivial Chern number of bulk and a singular behavior of edge states of the domain-wall. Generalization to the multi-spin interaction is also explicitly given.</description>

      <title>From the Shastry-Sutherland model to the $J_1$-$J_2$ Heisenberg model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.17452</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.17452v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose a generalized Shastry-Sutherland model which bridges the Shastry-Sutherland model and the $J_1$-$J_2$ Heisenberg model. By employing large scale Density Matrix Renormalization Group and Fully Augmented Matrix Product State calculations, combined with careful finite-size scaling, we find the phase transition between the plaquette valence bond state (PVBS) and Neel anti-ferromagnetic (AFM) phase in the pure Shastry-Sutherland model is a weak first one. This result indicates the existence of an exotic tri-critical point in the PVBS to AFM transition line in the phase diagram, as the transition in the $J_1$-$J_2$ Heisenberg model was previously determined to be continuous. We determine the location of the tri-critical point in the phase diagram at which first-order transition turns to continuous. Our generalized Shastry-Sutherland model provides not only a valuable platform to explore exotic phases and phase transitions but also more realistic description of Shastry-Sutherland materials like SrCu$_2$(BO$_3$)$_2$.</description>

Abstract: The peculiarities of phase states of the triplet boson model for orthonickelates are investigated analytically and by means of numerical simulations. The conditions of thermodynamic stability of homogeneous phases are found. It is shown that the description of the phase inhomogeneous state in the mean-field approximation qualitatively agrees with the observed state of the system in numerical simulations by the classical Monte Carlo method</description>

      <title>Influence of the Dirac Sea on Phase Transitions in Monolayer Graphene under Strong Magnetic Fields</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.16986</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.16986v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recent scanning tunneling microscopy experiments have found Kekul\'e-Distorted (KD) ordering in graphene subjected to strong magnetic fields, a departure from the antiferromagnetic (AF) state identified in earlier transport experiments on double-encapsulated devices with larger dielectric screening constant $\epsilon$. This variation suggests that the magnetic anisotropic energy is sensitive to dielectric screening constant. To calculate the magnetic anisotropic energy without resorting to perturbation theory, we adopted a two-step approach. First, we derived the bare valley-sublattice dependent interaction coupling constants from microscopic calculations and account for the leading logarithmic divergences arising from quantum fluctuations by solving renormalization group flow equations in the absence of magnetic field from the carbon lattice scale up to the much larger magnetic length. Subsequently, we used these renormalized coupling constants to perform non-perturbative, self-consistent Hartree-Fock calculations. Our results demonstrate that the ground state at neutrality ($\nu=0$) transitions from a AF state to a spin-singlet KD state when dielectric screening and magnetic fields become small, consistent with experimental observations. For filling fraction $\nu=\pm1$, we predict a transitions from spin-polarized charge-density wave states to spin-polarized KD state when dielectric screening and magnetic fields become small. Our self-consistent Hartree-Fock calculations, which encompass a large number of Landau levels, reveal that the magnetic anisotropic energy receives substantial contributions from the Dirac sea when $\epsilon$ is small. Our work provides insights into how the Dirac sea, which contributes to one electron per graphene unit cell, affects the small magnetic anisotropic energy in graphene.</description>

      <title>High-precision Quantum Monte-Carlo study of charge transport in a lattice model of molecular organic semiconductors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.17460</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.17460v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We use first-principle Quantum Monte-Carlo (QMC) simulations and numerical exact diagonalization to analyze the low-frequency charge carrier mobility within a simple tight-binding model of molecular organic semiconductors on a two-dimensional triangular lattice. These compounds feature transient localization, an unusual charge transport mechanism driven by dynamical disorder. The challenges of studying the transient localization of charge carriers in the low-frequency/long-time limit from first principles are discussed. We demonstrate that a combination of high-precision QMC data with prior estimates of frequency-dependent charge carrier mobility based on the static disorder approximation for phonon fields allows for improved estimates of mobility in the low-frequency limit. We also point out that a simple relaxation time approximation for charge mobility in organic semiconductors is not consistent with the QMC data. Physical similarities with charge transport in quark-gluon plasma are highlighted.</description>

      <title>$\mu$SR evidence of a marked exchange interaction effect on the local spin dynamics of Tb-based molecular nanomagnets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.17496</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.17496v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We report on the spin dynamics of two Terbium-based molecular nanomagnets, Tb-SQ and Tb-Trp, investigated by means of longitudinal muon spin relaxation ($\mu$SR) measurements as a function of applied field, flanked by AC susceptibility characterization. In the two molecules Tb(III) magnetic ion has an isotructural coordination sphere, but in the former the Tb(III) is coordinated by an organic paramagnetic ligand (SQ), while the latter is coordinated by a diamagnetic one (Trp). Thus Tb-SQ presents an exchange interaction between the Tb(III) ion and a radical while Tb-Trp does not. Both the samples exhibit a muon spin-lattice relaxation rate $\lambda_1(T, B_L)$ peak in the temperature range 10-25 K at all applied longitudinal magnetic fields $B_L = 50, 150, 300$ mT. In Tb-SQ, $\lambda_1(T, B_L)$ displays a BPP-like behavior led by three different correlations times: the first, dominating for $T\geq15K$, follows a thermally activated law $\tau_c =\tau_0 \exp(\sigma_A / k_B T)$ with energy barrier $\sigma_A/k_B$, while the second and third ones, dominating respectively for $8&lt;T&lt;15$ K and $T&lt;8$ K, follow a power-law-like behavior $\tau_c = c_0 T^{-\alpha}$ with two different values of $c_0$ and $\alpha$. On the other hand, the temperature and field behavior of $\lambda_1(T, B_L)$ in Tb-Trp strongly deviates from a BPP law, displaying a strongly anomalous character. Our results indicate that, in the absence of an exchange interaction and maintaining all the other relevant interactions constants, the local spin dynamics of single ion magnets strongly differ from the one observed in the presence of such interaction. The combination of $\mu$SR and AC susceptibility allows us to disentangle the different Orbach, Raman and direct mechanisms which are the key ingredients that control the spin dynamics in Tb-SQ, and evidence the potentiality of $\mu$SR in elucidating complex spin dynamics.</description>

      <title>Tilted stripes origin in ${\mathrm{La}}_{1.88}{\mathrm{Sr}}_{0.12}{\mathrm{CuO}}_{4}$ revealed by anisotropic next-nearest neighbor hopping</title>

      <description>arXiv:2107.10264v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Spin- and charge- stripe order has been extensively studied in the superconducting cuprates, among which underdoped ${\mathrm{La}}_{2-x}{\mathrm{Sr}}_{x}{\mathrm{CuO}}_{4}$ (LSCO) is an archetype with static spin stripes at low temperatures. An intriguing, but not completely understood, phenomenon in LSCO is that the stripes are tilted away from the high-symmetry Cu-Cu directions. Using high-resolution neutron scattering on LSCO with $x=0.12$, we find two coexisting phases at low temperatures, one with static spin stripes and the other with fluctuating ones, both sharing the same tilt angle. Our numerical calculations using the doped Hubbard model elucidate the tilting's origin, attributing it to anisotropic next-nearest neighbor hopping $t^{\prime}$, consistent with the material's slight orthorhombicity. Our results underscore the model's success in describing specific details of the ground state of this real material and highlight the role of $t^\prime$ in the Hamiltonian, revealing the delicate interplay between stripes and superconductivity across theoretical and experimental contexts.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2401.17097v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Hilbert space fragmentation is an ergodicity breaking phenomenon, in which Hamiltonian shatters into exponentially many dynamically disconnected sectors. In many fragmented systems, these sectors can be labelled by statistically localized integrals of motion, which are {\em nonlocal} operators. We study the paradigmatic nearest-neighbor pair hopping (PH) model exhibiting the so-called strong fragmentation. We show that this model hosts local integrals of motion (LIOMs), which correspond to frozen density modes with long wavelengths. The latter modes become subdiffusive when longer-range pair hoppings are allowed. Finally, we make a connection with a tilted (Stark) chain. Contrary to the dipole-conserving effective models, the tilted chain is shown to support either Hamiltonian or dipole moment as an LIOM. Numerical results are obtained from a numerical algorithm, in which finding LIOMs is reduced to the data compression problem.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.11509v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Fermions and hardcore bosons share the same restriction: no more than one particle can occupy a single site in a lattice system. Specifically, in one dimension, two systems can share the same matrix representation. In this work, we investigate both the fermion and hardcore-boson models with nearest-neighbor (NN) interaction in a ring lattice. We construct the exact eigenstates of the hardcore-boson model with resonant NN interaction and show that they possess off-diagonal long-range order (ODLRO) in the thermodynamic limit. In comparison, the fermionic counterpart does not support such a feature due to the different particle statistics, although they share an identical energy spectrum. In addition, we examine the effect of the periodic boundary condition on the dynamics of the condensate states through numerical simulations.</description>

Abstract: TeNPy (short for 'Tensor Network Python') is a python library for the simulation of strongly correlated quantum systems with tensor networks. The philosophy of this library is to achieve a balance of readability and usability for new-comers, while at the same time providing powerful algorithms for experts. The focus is on MPS algorithms for 1D and 2D lattices, such as DMRG ground state search, as well as dynamics using TEBD, TDVP, or MPO evolution.

      <title>Bond disorder in extended Heisenberg-Kitaev models: Spin textures and in-gap states in the high-field regime</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.12656</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.12656v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the effect of bond disorder in extended Heisenberg-Kitaev models on the honeycomb lattice, relevant for materials such as $\alpha$-RuCl$_3$, in the semiclassical limit using a combination of T-matrix and real-space spin-wave approaches. Focusing on the regime of large applied magnetic field, we discuss two distinct but related disorder-induced phenomena, namely spin textures in the vicinity of isolated impurities and magnetic excitations below the bulk gap. A finite impurity concentration smears the field-tuned phase transition and turns the isolated in-gap states into impurity bands. As a result, there is a large field regime above the bulk transition into the high-field phase where impurity-induced states fill the bulk spin gap. We illustrate the field dependence of these in-gap states for parameters relevant for $\alpha$-RuCl$_3$, and we connect our results to heat-transport and NMR data which indicated their presence.</description>

      <title>Signature of preformed pairs in angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.14490</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.14490v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We use density matrix renormalization group (DMRG) and variational exact diagonalization (VED) to calculate the single-electron removal spectral weight for the Hubbard-Holstein model at low electron densities. Tuning the strength of the electron-phonon coupling and of the Hubbard repulsion allows us to contrast the results for a liquid of polarons versus a liquid of bipolarons. The former shows spectral weight up to the Fermi energy, as expected for a metal. The latter has a gap in its spectral weight, set by the bipolaron binding energy, although this is also a (strongly correlated) metal. This difference suggests that angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy could be used to identify liquids of pre-formed pairs. Furthermore, we show that the one-dimensional liquid of incoherent bipolarons is well approximated by a "Bose sea" of bosons that are hard-core in momentum space, occupying the momenta inside the Fermi sea but otherwise non-interacting. This new proposal for a strongly-correlated many-body wavefunction opens the way for studying various other properties of incoherent (non-superconducting) liquids of pre-formed pairs in any dimension.</description>

      <title>Corrections to Conformal Charge at BKT Transitions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.01683v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The conformal anomaly is key to describing the physics of interacting field theories in two dimensions, and has been shown to obtain finite-size corrections that are useful to numerical and experimental studies. At Berezinskii-Kosterlitz-Thouless transitions, the corrections are logarithmic with previously unknown universal coefficients. In this paper, I reveal the universal, $1^{st}$-order correction to the conformal anomaly for finite-sized systems at BKT transitions. This term results solely from topological defects that are irrelevant in the infrared limit. I compare the result with careful observations of entanglement for the quantum Heisenberg model with periodic boundary conditions in one spatial dimension.</description>

      <title>Cubic Dirac Semimetals: General Theory and Application to Rare-Earth Magnets</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.09699v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Rare-earth magnets with parent cubic symmetry exhibit unique topological properties. However, the origin of these behaviors remains presently unclear. Here, we develop minimal models for Dirac semimetals (DSMs) with accidental band crossings and higher-order topology in cubic systems, incorporating candidate magnetic order to analyze bulk, surface, and hinge state characteristics. In certain cubic-symmetric DSMs, we identify an effective Z2 chiral symmetry which significantly impacts surface and hinge-localized states. Our results highlight distinct features in surface state dispersions, Fermi arcs, polarization dependence, and band splitting that correlate with photoemission data in rare-earth monopnictides. We also suggest candidate materials and experimental tests for further validation. These findings advance our understanding of surface states in rare-earth magnets with parent cubic symmetries and illuminate the role of DSM physics in these systems.</description>

      <title>Aperiodic defects in periodic solids</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.03373v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: To date, computational methods for modeling defects (vacancies, adsorbates, etc.) rely on periodic supercells in which the defect is far enough from its repeated image such that they can be assumed non-interacting. Yet, the relative proximity and periodic repetition of the defect's images may lead to spurious, unphysical artifacts, especially if the defect is charged and/or open-shell, causing a very slow convergence to the thermodynamic limit (TDL). In this Letter, we introduce a "defectless" embedding formalism such that the embedding field is computed in a pristine, primitive-unit-cell calculation. Subsequently, a single (i.e. "aperiodic") defect, which can also be charged, is introduced inside the embedded fragment. By eliminating the need for compensating background charges and periodicity of the defect, we circumvent all associated unphysicalities and numerical issues, achieving a very fast convergence to the TDL. Furthermore, using the toolbox of post-Hartree-Fock methods, this scheme can be straightforwardly applied to study strongly correlated defects, localized excited states and other problems, for which existing periodic protocols do not provide a satisfactory description.</description>

      <title>Accurate and convergent energetics of color centers by wavefunction theory</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.05092v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Ab initio description of point defects in semiconductors, characterized by in-gap states of significant multideterminant character, presents a longstanding theoretical challenge for density functional theory (DFT) methods. In this study, we devise a wavefunction theory (WFT) based ab initio methodology as a competing alternative approach. Specifically, we apply perturbation theory (NEVPT2 level) on top of a defect-localized many-body wavefunction (CASSCF level), which provides a balanced description of dynamic and static correlation effects, respectively. This quantum chemical methodology, exemplified for the NV$^-$ center in diamond in this study, is not only used for the calculation of energies and properties, but also for geometry optimization, performed for each electronic state individually. By relaxing cluster models of increasing size and investigating convergence behavior, we quantitatively reproduce (i) the full energy spectrum of NV$^-$ including the recently characterized high-energy states, (ii) the effect of Jahn-Teller distortion on measurable properties, (iii) the fine structure of ground and excited states, (iv) the pressure dependence of zero-phonon lines. Our findings showcase that applying conventional wave-function-based quantum chemistry on carefully crafted clusters can be a robust routine tool for discussing defect-state energetics.</description>

      <title>Phase diagram of non-Hermitian BCS superfluids in a dissipative asymmetric Hubbard model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.16482</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.16482v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate the non-Hermitian (NH) attractive Fermi-Hubbard model with asymmetric hopping and complex-valued interactions, which can be realized by collective one-body loss and two-body loss. By means of the NH BCS theory, we find that the weak asymmetry of the hopping does not affect the BCS superfluidity since it only affects the imaginary part of the eigenvalues of the BdG Hamiltonian. Systematic analysis in the d-dimensional hypercubic lattices clarifies that the singularity in the density of states affects the phase boundary between the normal and dissipation-induced superfluid states. Our results can be tested in ultracold atoms by using the photoassociation techniques and a nonlocal Rabi coupling with local losses and postselecting null measurement outcomes with the use of the quantum-gas microscope.</description>

      <title>Superconductivity from spin-canting fluctuations in rhombohedral graphene</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.17036v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Rhombohedral graphene multilayers host various broken-symmetry metallic phases as well as superconductors whose pairing mechanism and order parameter symmetry remain unsettled. Strikingly, experiments have revealed prominent new superconducting regions in rhombohedral bilayer and trilayer graphene devices with proximity-induced Ising spin-orbit coupling. We propose that these superconductors descend from a common spin-canted normal state that spontaneously breaks a U(1) spin symmetry and thus supports soft magnon modes. In particular, we show that these soft modes can mediate pairing through inter-band scattering events that are symmetry-forbidden in the absence of spin-orbit coupling, thus providing a promising explanation for spin-orbit-enabled pairing. Numerous other experimental observations -- including nontrivial dependence of superconductivity on the spin-orbit coupling strength, in-plane magnetic fields, and Fermi surface structure -- also naturally follow from our scenario.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.04632v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The development of multifunctional devices calls for the discovery of new layered materials with novel electronic properties. f-electron systems naturally host a rich set of competing and intertwining phases owning to the presence of strong spin-orbit coupling, electron-electron interactions, and hybridization between itinerant and local electrons. However, very little attention has been devoted to exploring the f-electron family of compounds for new promising layered material candidates. Here, we identify 295 rare earth compounds from across the lanthanide series of elements that exhibit a spectrum of lattice symmetries and electronic properties. In particular, we find metallic compounds and insulating systems with band gaps covering a 0.1 eV to 5.3 eV range which opens new possibilities in infrared quantum sensors, designer photocatalysts, and tunable transistors. The inclusion of 4f-states in a layered system also suggests the possibility of 2D confined heavy-fermion superconductivity and topological semimetals. Our study serves as a springboard to further systematic theoretical investigation of correlation-driven properties of the 4f and other 2D materials composed of heavy elements.</description>

      <title>Thickness-dependent Topological Phases and Flat Bands in Rhombohedral Multilayer Graphene</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.11359v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Rhombohedral multilayer graphene has emerged as an extraordinary platform for investigating exotic quantum states, such as superconductivity and fractional quantum anomalous Hall effects, mainly due to the existence of topological surface flatbands. Despite extensive research efforts, a systematic spectroscopic investigation on the evolution of its electronic structure from thin layers to bulk remains elusive. Using state-of-the-art angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy with submicron spatial resolution, we directly probe and trace the thickness evolution of the topological electronic structures of rhombohedral multilayer graphene. As the layer number increases, the gapped subbands transform into the 3D Dirac nodes that spirals in the momentum space; while the flatbands are constantly observed around Fermi level, and eventually evolve into the topological drumhead surface states. This unique thickness-dependent topological phase transition can be well captured by the 3D generalization of 1D Su-Schrieffer-Heeger chain in thin layers, to the topological Dirac nodal spiral semimetal in the bulk limit. Our findings establish a solid foundation for exploring the exotic quantum phases with nontrivial topology and correlation effects in rhombohedral multilayer graphene.</description>

      <title>Orbital Description of Landau Levels</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.13071v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We construct a minimal lattice model to provide an orbital description of lowest and first Landau levels. With the maximally localized Wannier functions with $s$, $p_-$, $p_+$ orbital characteristics, a three-orbital model is developed, where the lowest two Chern bands are flat with $\mathcal{C}=1$. This model can be viewed as consecutive band inversions between these Wannier states at $\Gamma$ and $K$ in momentum space, which adiabatically connects the atomic insulator limit to Landau level physics. Interestingly, many-body exact diagonalization and entanglement spectrum analysis suggest that the Abelian states can appear in the 1/3-filled lowest Chern band, while the signatures of the non-Abelian states are found in the half-filled first Chern band. This construction can be further extended to realize flat Chern bands resembling the higher Landau levels. Our results offer a new perspective to understand the lattice analogue of Landau levels, potentially enabling the realization of the fascinating topological phenomena at higher temperatures.</description>
