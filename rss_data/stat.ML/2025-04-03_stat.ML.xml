      <title>Dynamic Assortment Selection and Pricing with Censored Preference Feedback</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.02324</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.02324v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this study, we investigate the problem of dynamic multi-product selection and pricing by introducing a novel framework based on a \textit{censored multinomial logit} (C-MNL) choice model. In this model, sellers present a set of products with prices, and buyers filter out products priced above their valuation, purchasing at most one product from the remaining options based on their preferences. The goal is to maximize seller revenue by dynamically adjusting product offerings and prices, while learning both product valuations and buyer preferences through purchase feedback. To achieve this, we propose a Lower Confidence Bound (LCB) pricing strategy. By combining this pricing strategy with either an Upper Confidence Bound (UCB) or Thompson Sampling (TS) product selection approach, our algorithms achieve regret bounds of $\tilde{O}(d^{\frac{3}{2}}\sqrt{T/\kappa})$ and $\tilde{O}(d^{2}\sqrt{T/\kappa})$, respectively. Finally, we validate the performance of our methods through simulations, demonstrating their effectiveness.</description>

      <title>Analytical Discovery of Manifold with Machine Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.02511</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.02511v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Understanding low-dimensional structures within high-dimensional data is crucial for visualization, interpretation, and denoising in complex datasets. Despite the advancements in manifold learning techniques, key challenges-such as limited global insight and the lack of interpretable analytical descriptions-remain unresolved. In this work, we introduce a novel framework, GAMLA (Global Analytical Manifold Learning using Auto-encoding). GAMLA employs a two-round training process within an auto-encoding framework to derive both character and complementary representations for the underlying manifold. With the character representation, the manifold is represented by a parametric function which unfold the manifold to provide a global coordinate. While with the complementary representation, an approximate explicit manifold description is developed, offering a global and analytical representation of smooth manifolds underlying high-dimensional datasets. This enables the analytical derivation of geometric properties such as curvature and normal vectors. Moreover, we find the two representations together decompose the whole latent space and can thus characterize the local spatial structure surrounding the manifold, proving particularly effective in anomaly detection and categorization. Through extensive experiments on benchmark datasets and real-world applications, GAMLA demonstrates its ability to achieve computational efficiency and interpretability while providing precise geometric and structural insights. This framework bridges the gap between data-driven manifold learning and analytical geometry, presenting a versatile tool for exploring the intrinsic properties of complex data sets.</description>

      <title>Online Multivariate Regularized Distributional Regression for High-dimensional Probabilistic Electricity Price Forecasting</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.02518</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.02518v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Probabilistic electricity price forecasting (PEPF) is a key task for market participants in short-term electricity markets. The increasing availability of high-frequency data and the need for real-time decision-making in energy markets require online estimation methods for efficient model updating. We present an online, multivariate, regularized distributional regression model, allowing for the modeling of all distribution parameters conditional on explanatory variables. Our approach is based on the combination of the multivariate distributional regression and an efficient online learning algorithm based on online coordinate descent for LASSO-type regularization. Additionally, we propose to regularize the estimation along a path of increasingly complex dependence structures of the multivariate distribution, allowing for parsimonious estimation and early stopping. We validate our approach through one of the first forecasting studies focusing on multivariate probabilistic forecasting in the German day-ahead electricity market while using only online estimation methods. We compare our approach to online LASSO-ARX-models with adaptive marginal distribution and to online univariate distributional models combined with an adaptive Copula. We show that the multivariate distributional regression, which allows modeling all distribution parameters - including the mean and the dependence structure - conditional on explanatory variables such as renewable in-feed or past prices provide superior forecasting performance compared to modeling of the marginals only and keeping a static/unconditional dependence structure. Additionally, online estimation yields a speed-up by a factor of 80 to over 400 times compared to batch fitting.</description>

      <title>On Model Protection in Federated Learning against Eavesdropping Attacks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.02114</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.02114v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this study, we investigate the protection offered by federated learning algorithms against eavesdropping adversaries. In our model, the adversary is capable of intercepting model updates transmitted from clients to the server, enabling it to create its own estimate of the model. Unlike previous research, which predominantly focuses on safeguarding client data, our work shifts attention protecting the client model itself. Through a theoretical analysis, we examine how various factors, such as the probability of client selection, the structure of local objective functions, global aggregation at the server, and the eavesdropper's capabilities, impact the overall level of protection. We further validate our findings through numerical experiments, assessing the protection by evaluating the model accuracy achieved by the adversary. Finally, we compare our results with methods based on differential privacy, underscoring their limitations in this specific context.</description>

      <title>Towards Interpretable Soft Prompts</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.02144</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.02144v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Soft prompts have been popularized as a cheap and easy way to improve task-specific LLM performance beyond few-shot prompts. Despite their origin as an automated prompting method, however, soft prompts and other trainable prompts remain a black-box method with no immediately interpretable connections to prompting. We create a novel theoretical framework for evaluating the interpretability of trainable prompts based on two desiderata: faithfulness and scrutability. We find that existing methods do not naturally satisfy our proposed interpretability criterion. Instead, our framework inspires a new direction of trainable prompting methods that explicitly optimizes for interpretability. To this end, we formulate and test new interpretability-oriented objective functions for two state-of-the-art prompt tuners: Hard Prompts Made Easy (PEZ) and RLPrompt. Our experiments with GPT-2 demonstrate a fundamental trade-off between interpretability and the task-performance of the trainable prompt, explicating the hardness of the soft prompt interpretability problem and revealing odd behavior that arises when one optimizes for an interpretability proxy.</description>

      <title>On the Geometry of Receiver Operating Characteristic and Precision-Recall Curves</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.02169</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.02169v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the geometry of Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) and Precision-Recall (PR) curves in binary classification problems. The key finding is that many of the most commonly used binary classification metrics are merely functions of the composition function $G := F_p \circ F_n^{-1}$, where $F_p(\cdot)$ and $F_n(\cdot)$ are the class-conditional cumulative distribution functions of the classifier scores in the positive and negative classes, respectively. This geometric perspective facilitates the selection of operating points, understanding the effect of decision thresholds, and comparison between classifiers. It also helps explain how the shapes and geometry of ROC/PR curves reflect classifier behavior, providing objective tools for building classifiers optimized for specific applications with context-specific constraints. We further explore the conditions for classifier dominance, present analytical and numerical examples demonstrating the effects of class separability and variance on ROC and PR geometries, and derive a link between the positive-to-negative class leakage function $G(\cdot)$ and the Kullback--Leibler divergence. The framework highlights practical considerations, such as model calibration, cost-sensitive optimization, and operating point selection under real-world capacity constraints, enabling more informed approaches to classifier deployment and decision-making.</description>

      <title>Bridging the Theoretical Gap in Randomized Smoothing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.02412</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.02412v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Randomized smoothing has become a leading approach for certifying adversarial robustness in machine learning models. However, a persistent gap remains between theoretical certified robustness and empirical robustness accuracy. This paper introduces a new framework that bridges this gap by leveraging Lipschitz continuity for certification and proposing a novel, less conservative method for computing confidence intervals in randomized smoothing. Our approach tightens the bounds of certified robustness, offering a more accurate reflection of model robustness in practice. Through rigorous experimentation we show that our method improves the robust accuracy, compressing the gap between empirical findings and previous theoretical results. We argue that investigating local Lipschitz constants and designing ad-hoc confidence intervals can further enhance the performance of randomized smoothing. These results pave the way for a deeper understanding of the relationship between Lipschitz continuity and certified robustness.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2504.02479v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose a decentralized reinforcement learning solution for multi-agent shepherding of non-cohesive targets using policy-gradient methods. Our architecture integrates target-selection with target-driving through Proximal Policy Optimization, overcoming discrete-action constraints of previous Deep Q-Network approaches and enabling smoother agent trajectories. This model-free framework effectively solves the shepherding problem without prior dynamics knowledge. Experiments demonstrate our method's effectiveness and scalability with increased target numbers and limited sensing capabilities.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2504.02589v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we propose a new geometric approach for knowledge graph completion via low rank tensor approximation. We augment a pretrained and well-established Euclidean model based on a Tucker tensor decomposition with a novel hyperbolic interaction term. This correction enables more nuanced capturing of distributional properties in data better aligned with real-world knowledge graphs. By combining two geometries together, our approach improves expressivity of the resulting model achieving new state-of-the-art link prediction accuracy with a significantly lower number of parameters compared to the previous Euclidean and hyperbolic models.</description>

      <title>Variational Online Mirror Descent for Robust Learning in Schr\"odinger Bridge</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.02618</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.02618v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Sch\"odinger bridge (SB) has evolved into a universal class of probabilistic generative models. In practice, however, estimated learning signals are often uncertain, and the reliability promised by existing methods is often based on speculative optimal-case scenarios. Recent studies regarding the Sinkhorn algorithm through mirror descent (MD) have gained attention, revealing geometric insights into solution acquisition of the SB problems. In this paper, we propose a variational online MD (OMD) framework for the SB problems, which provides further stability to SB solvers. We formally prove convergence and a regret bound for the novel OMD formulation of SB acquisition. As a result, we propose a simulation-free SB algorithm called Variational Mirrored Schr\"odinger Bridge (VMSB) by utilizing the Wasserstein-Fisher-Rao geometry of the Gaussian mixture parameterization for Schr\"odinger potentials. Based on the Wasserstein gradient flow theory, the algorithm offers tractable learning dynamics that precisely approximate each OMD step. In experiments, we validate the performance of the proposed VMSB algorithm across an extensive suite of benchmarks. VMSB consistently outperforms contemporary SB solvers on a range of SB problems, demonstrating the robustness predicted by our theory.</description>

      <title>Incorporating the ChEES Criterion into Sequential Monte Carlo Samplers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.02627</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.02627v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) methods are a powerful but computationally expensive way of performing non-parametric Bayesian inference. MCMC proposals which utilise gradients, such as Hamiltonian Monte Carlo (HMC), can better explore the parameter space of interest if the additional hyper-parameters are chosen well. The No-U-Turn Sampler (NUTS) is a variant of HMC which is extremely effective at selecting these hyper-parameters but is slow to run and is not suited to GPU architectures. An alternative to NUTS, Change in the Estimator of the Expected Square HMC (ChEES-HMC) was shown not only to run faster than NUTS on GPU but also sample from posteriors more efficiently. Sequential Monte Carlo (SMC) samplers are another sampling method which instead output weighted samples from the posterior. They are very amenable to parallelisation and therefore being run on GPUs while having additional flexibility in their choice of proposal over MCMC. We incorporate (ChEEs-HMC) as a proposal into SMC samplers and demonstrate competitive but faster performance than NUTS on a number of tasks.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2504.02646v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study how to use naturally available user feedback, such as clicks, to optimize large language model (LLM) pipelines for generating personalized sentences using prompts. Naive approaches, which estimate the policy gradient in the prompt space, suffer either from variance caused by the large action space of prompts or bias caused by inaccurate reward predictions. To circumvent these challenges, we propose a novel kernel-based off-policy gradient method, which estimates the policy gradient by leveraging similarity among generated sentences, substantially reducing variance while suppressing the bias. Empirical results on our newly established suite of benchmarks demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach in generating personalized descriptions for movie recommendations, particularly when the number of candidate prompts is large.</description>

      <title>STOOD-X methodology: using statistical nonparametric test for OOD Detection Large-Scale datasets enhanced with explainability</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.02685</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.02685v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Out-of-Distribution (OOD) detection is a critical task in machine learning, particularly in safety-sensitive applications where model failures can have serious consequences. However, current OOD detection methods often suffer from restrictive distributional assumptions, limited scalability, and a lack of interpretability. To address these challenges, we propose STOOD-X, a two-stage methodology that combines a Statistical nonparametric Test for OOD Detection with eXplainability enhancements. In the first stage, STOOD-X uses feature-space distances and a Wilcoxon-Mann-Whitney test to identify OOD samples without assuming a specific feature distribution. In the second stage, it generates user-friendly, concept-based visual explanations that reveal the features driving each decision, aligning with the BLUE XAI paradigm. Through extensive experiments on benchmark datasets and multiple architectures, STOOD-X achieves competitive performance against state-of-the-art post hoc OOD detectors, particularly in high-dimensional and complex settings. In addition, its explainability framework enables human oversight, bias detection, and model debugging, fostering trust and collaboration between humans and AI systems. The STOOD-X methodology therefore offers a robust, explainable, and scalable solution for real-world OOD detection tasks.</description>

      <title>Semiparametric Counterfactual Regression</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.02694v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study counterfactual regression, which aims to map input features to outcomes under hypothetical scenarios that differ from those observed in the data. This is particularly useful for decision-making when adapting to sudden shifts in treatment patterns is essential. We propose a doubly robust-style estimator for counterfactual regression within a generalizable framework that accommodates a broad class of risk functions and flexible constraints, drawing on tools from semiparametric theory and stochastic optimization. Our approach uses incremental interventions to enhance adaptability while maintaining consistency with standard methods. We formulate the target estimand as the optimal solution to a stochastic optimization problem and develop an efficient estimation strategy, where we can leverage rapid development of modern optimization algorithms. We go on to analyze the rates of convergence and characterize the asymptotic distributions. Our analysis shows that the proposed estimators can achieve $\sqrt{n}$-consistency and asymptotic normality for a broad class of problems. Numerical illustrations highlight their effectiveness in adapting to unseen counterfactual scenarios while maintaining parametric convergence rates.</description>

Given a target coverage parameter $\delta$, and sample access to an arbitrary distribution $D$, we want to output a confidence set $S \subset \mathbb{R}^d$ such that $S$ achieves $\delta$ coverage of $D$, i.e., $\mathbb{P}_{y \sim D} \left[ y \in S \right] \ge \delta$, and the volume of $S$ is as small as possible. This is a central problem in high-dimensional statistics with applications in finding confidence sets, uncertainty quantification, and support estimation.
  In the most general setting, this problem is statistically intractable, so we restrict our attention to competing with sets from a concept class $C$ with bounded VC-dimension. An algorithm is competitive with class $C$ if, given samples from an arbitrary distribution $D$, it outputs in polynomial time a set that achieves $\delta$ coverage of $D$, and whose volume is competitive with the smallest set in $C$ with the required coverage $\delta$. This problem is computationally challenging even in the basic setting when $C$ is the set of all Euclidean balls. Existing algorithms based on coresets find in polynomial time a ball whose volume is $\exp(\tilde{O}( d/ \log d))$-factor competitive with the volume of the best ball.
  Our main result is an algorithm that finds a confidence set whose volume is $\exp(\tilde{O}(d^{2/3}))$ factor competitive with the optimal ball having the desired coverage. The algorithm is improper (it outputs an ellipsoid). Combined with our computational intractability result for proper learning balls within an $\exp(\tilde{O}(d^{1-o(1)}))$ approximation factor in volume, our results provide an interesting separation between proper and (improper) learning of confidence sets.</description>

      <title>Utility Theory of Synthetic Data Generation</title>

Abstract: Synthetic data algorithms are widely employed in industries to generate artificial data for downstream learning tasks. While existing research primarily focuses on empirically evaluating utility of synthetic data, its theoretical understanding is largely lacking. This paper bridges the practice-theory gap by establishing relevant utility theory in a statistical learning framework. It considers two utility metrics: generalization and ranking of models trained on synthetic data. The former is defined as the generalization difference between models trained on synthetic and on real data. By deriving analytical bounds for this utility metric, we demonstrate that the synthetic feature distribution does not need to be similar as that of real data for ensuring comparable generalization of synthetic models, provided proper model specifications in downstream learning tasks. The latter utility metric studies the relative performance of models trained on synthetic data. In particular, we discover that the distribution of synthetic data is not necessarily similar as the real one to ensure consistent model comparison. Interestingly, consistent model comparison is still achievable even when synthetic responses are not well generated, as long as downstream models are separable by a generalization gap. Finally, extensive experiments on non-parametric models and deep neural networks have been conducted to validate these theoretical findings.</description>

      <title>Rate-Optimal Rank Aggregation with Private Pairwise Rankings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.16792</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.16792v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In various real-world scenarios, such as recommender systems and political surveys, pairwise rankings are commonly collected and utilized for rank aggregation to derive an overall ranking of items. However, preference rankings can reveal individuals' personal preferences, highlighting the need to protect them from exposure in downstream analysis. In this paper, we address the challenge of preserving privacy while ensuring the utility of rank aggregation based on pairwise rankings generated from a general comparison model. A common privacy protection strategy in practice is the use of the randomized response mechanism to perturb raw pairwise rankings. However, a critical challenge arises because the privatized rankings no longer adhere to the original model, resulting in significant bias in downstream rank aggregation tasks. To address this, we propose an adaptive debiasing method for rankings from the randomized response mechanism, ensuring consistent estimation of true preferences and enhancing the utility of downstream rank aggregation. Theoretically, we provide insights into the relationship between overall privacy guarantees and estimation errors in private ranking data, and establish minimax rates for estimation errors. This enables the determination of optimal privacy guarantees that balance consistency in rank aggregation with privacy protection. We also investigate convergence rates of expected ranking errors for partial and full ranking recovery, quantifying how privacy protection affects the specification of top-$K$ item sets and complete rankings. Our findings are validated through extensive simulations and a real-world application.</description>

      <title>Adaptive Student's t-distribution with method of moments moving estimator for nonstationary time series</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.03069</link>
      <description>arXiv:2304.03069v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The real life time series are usually nonstationary, bringing a difficult question of model adaptation. Classical approaches like ARMA-ARCH assume arbitrary type of dependence. To avoid their bias, we will focus on recently proposed agnostic philosophy of moving estimator: in time $t$ finding parameters optimizing e.g. $F_t=\sum_{\tau&lt;t} (1-\eta)^{t-\tau} \ln(\rho_\theta (x_\tau))$ moving log-likelihood, evolving in time. It allows for example to estimate parameters using inexpensive exponential moving averages (EMA), like absolute central moments $m_p=E[|x-\mu|^p]$ evolving for one or multiple powers $p\in\mathbb{R}^+$ using $m_{p,t+1} = m_{p,t} + \eta (|x_t-\mu_t|^p-m_{p,t})$. Application of such general adaptive methods of moments will be presented on Student's t-distribution, popular especially in economical applications, here applied to log-returns of DJIA companies. While standard ARMA-ARCH approaches provide evolution of $\mu$ and $\sigma$, here we also get evolution of $\nu$ describing $\rho(x)\sim |x|^{-\nu-1}$ tail shape, probability of extreme events - which might turn out catastrophic, destabilizing the market.</description>

      <title>Convex optimization over a probability simplex</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.09046</link>
      <description>arXiv:2305.09046v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We propose a new iteration scheme, the Cauchy-Simplex, to optimize convex problems over the probability simplex $\{w\in\mathbb{R}^n\ |\ \sum_i w_i=1\ \textrm{and}\ w_i\geq0\}$. Specifically, we map the simplex to the positive quadrant of a unit sphere, envisage gradient descent in latent variables, and map the result back in a way that only depends on the simplex variable. Moreover, proving rigorous convergence results in this formulation leads inherently to tools from information theory (e.g., cross-entropy and KL divergence). Each iteration of the Cauchy-Simplex consists of simple operations, making it well-suited for high-dimensional problems. In continuous time, we prove that $f(x_T)-f(x^*) = {O}(1/T)$ for differentiable real-valued convex functions, where $T$ is the number of time steps and $w^*$ is the optimal solution. Numerical experiments of projection onto convex hulls show faster convergence than similar algorithms. Finally, we apply our algorithm to online learning problems and prove the convergence of the average regret for (1) Prediction with expert advice and (2) Universal Portfolios.</description>

      <title>Extension of the Dip-test Repertoire -- Efficient and Differentiable p-value Calculation for Clustering</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.12050</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.12050v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Over the last decade, the Dip-test of unimodality has gained increasing interest in the data mining community as it is a parameter-free statistical test that reliably rates the modality in one-dimensional samples. It returns a so called Dip-value and a corresponding probability for the sample's unimodality (Dip-p-value). These two values share a sigmoidal relationship. However, the specific transformation is dependent on the sample size. Many Dip-based clustering algorithms use bootstrapped look-up tables translating Dip- to Dip-p-values for a certain limited amount of sample sizes. We propose a specifically designed sigmoid function as a substitute for these state-of-the-art look-up tables. This accelerates computation and provides an approximation of the Dip- to Dip-p-value transformation for every single sample size. Further, it is differentiable and can therefore easily be integrated in learning schemes using gradient descent. We showcase this by exploiting our function in a novel subspace clustering algorithm called Dip'n'Sub. We highlight in extensive experiments the various benefits of our proposal.</description>

      <title>Prevalidated ridge regression is a highly-efficient drop-in replacement for logistic regression for high-dimensional data</title>

      <description>arXiv:2401.15610v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Logistic regression is a ubiquitous method for probabilistic classification. However, the effectiveness of logistic regression depends upon careful and relatively computationally expensive tuning, especially for the regularisation hyperparameter, and especially in the context of high-dimensional data. We present a prevalidated ridge regression model that closely matches logistic regression in terms of classification error and log-loss, particularly for high-dimensional data, while being significantly more computationally efficient and having effectively no hyperparameters beyond regularisation. We scale the coefficients of the model so as to minimise log-loss for a set of prevalidated predictions derived from the estimated leave-one-out cross-validation error. This exploits quantities already computed in the course of fitting the ridge regression model in order to find the scaling parameter with nominal additional computational expense.</description>

      <title>TowerDebias: A Novel Unfairness Removal Method Based on the Tower Property</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.08297</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.08297v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Decision-making processes have increasingly come to rely on sophisticated machine learning tools, raising critical concerns about the fairness of their predictions with respect to sensitive groups. The widespread adoption of commercial "black-box" models necessitates careful consideration of their legal and ethical implications for consumers. When users interact with such black-box models, a key challenge arises: how can the influence of sensitive attributes, such as race or gender, be mitigated or removed from its predictions? We propose towerDebias (tDB), a novel post-processing method designed to reduce the influence of sensitive attributes in predictions made by black-box models. Our tDB approach leverages the Tower Property from probability theory to improve prediction fairness without requiring retraining of the original model. This method is highly versatile, as it requires no prior knowledge of the original algorithm's internal structure and is adaptable to a diverse range of applications. We present a formal fairness improvement theorem for tDB and showcase its effectiveness in both regression and classification tasks using multiple real-world datasets.</description>

      <title>Local Learning for Covariate Selection in Nonparametric Causal Effect Estimation with Latent Variables</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.16315</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.16315v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Estimating causal effects from nonexperimental data is a fundamental problem in many fields of science. A key component of this task is selecting an appropriate set of covariates for confounding adjustment to avoid bias. Most existing methods for covariate selection often assume the absence of latent variables and rely on learning the global network structure among variables. However, identifying the global structure can be unnecessary and inefficient, especially when our primary interest lies in estimating the effect of a treatment variable on an outcome variable. To address this limitation, we propose a novel local learning approach for covariate selection in nonparametric causal effect estimation, which accounts for the presence of latent variables. Our approach leverages testable independence and dependence relationships among observed variables to identify a valid adjustment set for a target causal relationship, ensuring both soundness and completeness under standard assumptions. We validate the effectiveness of our algorithm through extensive experiments on both synthetic and real-world data.</description>

      <title>Hypergraph Representations of scRNA-seq Data for Improved Clustering with Random Walks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.11760</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.11760v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Analysis of single-cell RNA sequencing data is often conducted through network projections such as coexpression networks, primarily due to the abundant availability of network analysis tools for downstream tasks. However, this approach has several limitations: loss of higher-order information, inefficient data representation caused by converting a sparse dataset to a fully connected network, and overestimation of coexpression due to zero-inflation. To address these limitations, we propose conceptualizing scRNA-seq expression data as hypergraphs, which are generalized graphs in which the hyperedges can connect more than two vertices. In the context of scRNA-seq data, the hypergraph nodes represent cells and the edges represent genes. Each hyperedge connects all cells where its corresponding gene is actively expressed and records the expression of the gene across different cells. This hypergraph conceptualization enables us to explore multi-way relationships beyond the pairwise interactions in coexpression networks without loss of information. We propose two novel clustering methods: (1) the Dual-Importance Preference Hypergraph Walk (DIPHW) and (2) the Coexpression and Memory-Integrated Dual-Importance Preference Hypergraph Walk (CoMem-DIPHW). They outperform established methods on both simulated and real scRNA-seq datasets. The improvement brought by our proposed methods is especially significant when data modularity is weak. Furthermore, CoMem-DIPHW incorporates the gene coexpression network, cell coexpression network, and the cell-gene expression hypergraph from the single-cell abundance counts data altogether for embedding computation. This approach accounts for both the local level information from single-cell level gene expression and the global level information from the pairwise similarity in the two coexpression networks.</description>

      <title>CoHiRF: A Scalable and Interpretable Clustering Framework for High-Dimensional Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.00380</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.00380v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Clustering high-dimensional data poses significant challenges due to the curse of dimensionality, scalability issues, and the presence of noisy and irrelevant features. We propose Consensus Hierarchical Random Feature (CoHiRF), a novel clustering method designed to address these challenges effectively. CoHiRF leverages random feature selection to mitigate noise and dimensionality effects, repeatedly applies K-Means clustering in reduced feature spaces, and combines results through a unanimous consensus criterion. This iterative approach constructs a cluster assignment matrix, where each row records the cluster assignments of a sample across repetitions, enabling the identification of stable clusters by comparing identical rows. Clusters are organized hierarchically, enabling the interpretation of the hierarchy to gain insights into the dataset. CoHiRF is computationally efficient with a running time comparable to K-Means, scalable to massive datasets, and exhibits robust performance against state-of-the-art methods such as SC-SRGF, HDBSCAN, and OPTICS. Experimental results on synthetic and real-world datasets confirm the method's ability to reveal meaningful patterns while maintaining scalability, making it a powerful tool for high-dimensional data analysis.</description>

      <title>Theoretical Insights in Model Inversion Robustness and Conditional Entropy Maximization for Collaborative Inference Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.00383</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.00383v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: By locally encoding raw data into intermediate features, collaborative inference enables end users to leverage powerful deep learning models without exposure of sensitive raw data to cloud servers. However, recent studies have revealed that these intermediate features may not sufficiently preserve privacy, as information can be leaked and raw data can be reconstructed via model inversion attacks (MIAs). Obfuscation-based methods, such as noise corruption, adversarial representation learning, and information filters, enhance the inversion robustness by obfuscating the task-irrelevant redundancy empirically. However, methods for quantifying such redundancy remain elusive, and the explicit mathematical relation between this redundancy minimization and inversion robustness enhancement has not yet been established. To address that, this work first theoretically proves that the conditional entropy of inputs given intermediate features provides a guaranteed lower bound on the reconstruction mean square error (MSE) under any MIA. Then, we derive a differentiable and solvable measure for bounding this conditional entropy based on the Gaussian mixture estimation and propose a conditional entropy maximization (CEM) algorithm to enhance the inversion robustness. Experimental results on four datasets demonstrate the effectiveness and adaptability of our proposed CEM; without compromising feature utility and computing efficiency, plugging the proposed CEM into obfuscation-based defense mechanisms consistently boosts their inversion robustness, achieving average gains ranging from 12.9\% to 48.2\%.

      <title>Optimal Invariant Bases for Atomistic Machine Learning</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.23515v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The representation of atomic configurations for machine learning models has led to the development of numerous descriptors, often to describe the local environment of atoms. However, many of these representations are incomplete and/or functionally dependent. Incomplete descriptor sets are unable to represent all meaningful changes in the atomic environment. Complete constructions of atomic environment descriptors, on the other hand, often suffer from a high degree of functional dependence, where some descriptors can be written as functions of the others. These redundant descriptors do not provide additional power to discriminate between different atomic environments and increase the computational burden. By employing techniques from the pattern recognition literature to existing atomistic representations, we remove descriptors that are functions of other descriptors to produce the smallest possible set that satisfies completeness. We apply this in two ways: first we refine an existing description, the Atomistic Cluster Expansion. We show that this yields a more efficient subset of descriptors. Second, we augment an incomplete construction based on a scalar neural network, yielding a new message-passing network architecture that can recognize up to 5-body patterns in each neuron by taking advantage of an optimal set of Cartesian tensor invariants. This architecture shows strong accuracy on state-of-the-art benchmarks while retaining low computational cost. Our results not only yield improved models, but point the way to classes of invariant bases that minimize cost while maximizing expressivity for a host of applications.</description>
