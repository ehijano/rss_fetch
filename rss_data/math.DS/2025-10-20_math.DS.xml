      <description>arXiv:2510.15057v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We develop an early-warning signal for bifurcations of one-dimensional random difference equations with additive bounded noise, based on the asymptotic behaviour of the stationary density near a boundary of its support. We demonstrate the practical use in numerical examples.</description>

      <title>On mixing and dense periodicity on spaces with a free arc</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.15073</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.15073v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the dynamics of continuous maps on compact metric spaces containing a free interval (an open subset homeomorphic to the interval $(0,1)$). We provide a new proof of a result of M. Dirb\'ak, \v{L}. Snoha, V. \v{S}pitalsk\'y [Ergodic Theory Dynam. Systems, vol. 33 (2013), no. 6, pp. 1786--1812] saying that every continuous and transitive, but non-minimal map of a space with a free interval is relatively mixing, non-invertible, has positive topological entropy, and dense periodic points. The key simplification comes from short proofs of two facts. The first says that every weakly mixing map of a space with a free interval must be mixing and have positive entropy. The second says that a transitive but not minimal map of a space with a free interval has dense periodic points and is non-invertible.</description>

      <title>Partially hyperbolic diffeormorphisms, ergodicity, and transverse foliations in dimension 3</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.15176</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.15176v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We give a complete topological classification of transitive partially hyperbolic diffeomorphisms in 3-manifolds in terms of Anosov flows, completing a program proposed by Pujals. In particular, this also allows to give a full answer to the ergodicity conjecture of Hertz-Hertz-Ures for partially hyperbolic diffeomorphisms in dimension 3. This is achieved by showing a general result about pairs of transverse $2$-dimensional foliations in 3-manifolds with Gromov hyperbolic leaves which may be of independent interest.</description>

      <title>Impact of memory on clustering in spontaneous particle aggregation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.15335</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.15335v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The effect of short-term and long-term memory on spontaneous aggregation of organisms is investigated using a stochastic agent-based model. Each individual modulates the amplitude of its random motion according to the perceived local density of neighbors. Memory is introduced via a chain of $K$~internal variables that allow agents to retain information about previously encountered densities. The parameter $K$ controls the effective length of memory. A formal mean-field limit yields a macroscopic Fokker--Planck equation, which provides a continuum description of the system in the large-population limit. Steady states of this equation are characterized to interpret the emergence and morphology of clusters. Systematic stochastic simulations in one- and two-dimensional spatial domains reveal that short- or moderate-term memory promotes coarsening, resulting in a smaller number of larger clusters, whereas long-term memory inhibits aggregation and increases the proportion of isolated individuals. Statistical analysis demonstrates that extended memory reduces the agents' responsiveness to environmental stimuli, explaining the transition from aggregation to dispersion as $K$ increases. These findings identify memory as a key factor controlling the collective organization of self-driven agents and provide a bridge between individual-level dynamics and emergent spatial patterns.</description>

      <title>The Return Map of the Cross Section of Horizontally Short Lattice Surfaces is Weakly Mixing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.15450</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.15450v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We prove that the return map of the unstable horocycle flow on the space of horizontally short translation surfaces associated to a lattice surface $(X, \omega)$ is weakly mixing. This extends a result of Cheung-Quas for the square torus to all lattice surfaces. The proof adapts their criterion for weakly mixing and uses quantitative bounds for Siegel-Veech transforms restricted to the Poincar\'e section of horizontally short surfaces.</description>

      <title>The Complex Dimensions of Every Sierpinski Carpet Modification of Dust Type</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.15496</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.15496v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate modified Sierpi\'nski Carpet fractals, constructed by dividing a square into a square $n \times n$ grid, removing a subset of the squares at each step, and then repeating that process for each square remaining in that grid. If enough squares are removed and in the proper places, we get ``Dust Type'' carpets, which have a path-connected complement and are themselves not path-connected. We study these fractals using the Fractal Zeta Functions, first introduced by Michel Lapidus, Goran Radunovi\'c, and Darko \^Zubrini\'c in their book \emph{Fractal Zeta Functions and Fractal Drums}, from which we devised an analytical and combinatorial algorithm to compute the complex dimensions of every Sierpi\'nski Carpet modification of Dust Type.</description>

      <title>Gurevic pressure and equidistribution for amenable extensions of countable state Markov shifts</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.15663</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.15663v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We obtain a weighted equidistribution theorem for amenable skew product extensions of countable state Markov shifts satisfying the BIP property. We also show, without requiring the BIP property, that Gurevic pressure for an amenable skew product agrees with the Gurevic pressure for the abelianized system. This had been proved by Dougall and Sharp in the case where the base is a subshift of finite type. The equality of Gurevi\v{c} pressures is a key part of the proof of the equidistribution result.</description>

      <title>Machine Learning of Nonlinear Waves: Data-Driven Methods for Computer-Assisted Discovery of Equations, Symmetries, Conservation Laws, and Integrability</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.15069</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.15069v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The purpose of this article is to provide a perspective - admittedly, a rather subjective one - of recent developments at the interface of machine learning/data-driven methods and nonlinear wave studies. We review some recent pillars of the rapidly evolving landscape of scientific machine learning, including deep learning, data-driven equation discovery, and operator learning, among others. We then showcase these methods in applications ranging from learning lattice dynamical models and reduced order modeling of effective dynamics to discovery of conservation laws and potential identification of integrability of ODE and PDE models. Our intention is to make clear that these machine learning methods are complementary to the preexisting powerful tools of the nonlinear waves community, and should be integrated into this toolkit to augment and enable mathematical discoveries and computational capabilities in the age of data.</description>

      <title>Two Roads to Koopman Operator Theory for Control: Infinite Input Sequences and Operator Families</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.15166</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.15166v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Koopman operator, originally defined for dynamical systems without input, has inspired many applications in control. Yet, the theoretical foundations underpinning this progress in control remain underdeveloped. This paper investigates the theoretical structure and connections between two extensions of Koopman theory to control: (i) Koopman operator via infinite input sequences and (ii) the Koopman control family. Although these frameworks encode system information in fundamentally different ways, we show that under certain conditions on the function spaces they operate on, they are equivalent. The equivalence is both in terms of the actions of the Koopman-based formulations in each framework as well as the function values on the system trajectories. Our analysis provides constructive tools to translate between the frameworks, offering a unified perspective for Koopman methods in control.</description>

      <title>A simple lemma concerning the Doeblin minorization condition and its applications to limit theorems for inhomogeneous Markov chains</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.15323</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.15323v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this short note we provide an elementary proof that a certain type of nonuniform sequential Doeblin minorization condition implies non-uniform sequential "geometric" ergodicity. Using this result several limit theorems for inhomogeneous Markov chains follow immediately from existing results [7,8,12]. We then focus our attention to Markov chains in random dynamical environment and deduce effective mixing rates which imply limit theorems for such processes by using the methods of [16] (which were formulated in a dynamical setup). The crucial part of the proof is to obtain effective convergence rates towards the random equivariant distribution, which has its own interest and yields, for instance, effective mixing times estimates together with results for the corresponding skew products</description>

      <title>Topological invariance of Liouville structures for taut foliations and Anosov flows</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.15325</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.15325v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Building on the work of Eliashberg and Thurston, we associate to a taut foliation on a closed oriented $3$-manifold $M$ a Liouville structure on the thickening $[-1,1] \times M$, under suitable hypotheses. Our main result shows that this Liouville structure is a topological invariant of the foliation: two such foliations which are topologically conjugated induce exact symplectomorphic Liouville structures. Specializing to the case of weak foliations of Anosov flows, we obtain that under natural orientability conditions, the Liouville structures originally introduced by Mitsumatsu are invariant under orbit equivalence. Our methods also imply that two orbit equivalent Anosov flows are deformation equivalent through projectively Anosov flows. The proofs combine two main technical ingredients: (1) a careful smoothing scheme for topological conjugacies between $C^1$-foliations, and (2) a refinement of a deep result of Vogel on the uniqueness of contact structures approximating a foliation.
  In an appendix, this smoothing scheme is used to construct new examples of collapsed Anosov flows, providing a key step to complete the classification of transitive partially hyperbolic diffeomorphisms in dimension three.</description>

      <title>Synchronization of nonlinearly coupled Stuart-Landau oscillators on networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.15658</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.15658v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The dynamics of coupled Stuart-Landau oscillators play a central role in the study of synchronization phenomena. Previous works have focused on linearly coupled oscillators in different configurations, such as all-to-all or generic complex networks, allowing for both reciprocal or non-reciprocal links. The emergence of synchronization can be deduced by proving the linear stability of the limit cycle solution for the Stuart-Landau model; the linear coupling assumption allows for a complete analytical treatment of the problem, mostly because the linearized system turns out to be autonomous. In this work, we analyze Stuart-Landau oscillators coupled through nonlinear functions on both undirected and directed networks; synchronization now depends on the study of a non-autonomous linear system and thus novel tools are required to tackle the problem. We provide a complete analytical description of the system for some choices of the nonlinear coupling, e.g., in the resonant case. Otherwise, we develop a semi-analytical framework based on Jacobi-Anger expansion and Floquet theory, which allows us to derive precise conditions for the emergence of complete synchronization. The obtained results extend the classical theory of coupled oscillators and pave the way for future studies of nonlinear interactions in networks of oscillators and beyond.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.14967v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A multidimensional sofic shift is called countably covered if it has an SFT cover containing only countably many configurations. In contrast to the one-dimensional setting, not all countable sofic shifts are countably covered. We investigate the existence of countable covers for gap width shifts, where the number of nonzero symbols in a configuration is bounded by a function of the minimum distance between two such symbols. As our main results, we characterize those one-dimensional gap width shifts whose two-dimensional lift is a countably covered sofic shift, and show that a large class of two-dimensional gap width shifts are countably covered.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.18936v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We give a condition for absolute continuity of self-similar measures in arbitrary dimensions. This allows us to construct the first explicit absolutely continuous examples of inhomogeneous self-similar measures in dimension one and two. In fact, for $d\geq 1$ and any given rotations in $O(d)$ acting irreducibly on $\mathbb{R}^d$ as well as any distinct translations, all having algebraic coefficients, we construct absolutely continuous self-similar measures with the given rotations and translations. We furthermore strengthen Varj\'u's result for Bernoulli convolutions, treat complex Bernoulli convolutions and in dimension $\geq 3$ improve the condition on absolute continuity by Lindenstrauss-Varj\'u. Moreover, self-similar measures of contracting on average measures are studied, which may include expanding similarities in their support.</description>

      <title>A Novel Route to Oscillations via non-central SNICeroclinic Bifurcation: Unfolding the Separatrix Loop Between a Saddle-Node and a Saddle</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.12298</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.12298v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we investigate saddle-node to saddle separatrix--loops that we term SNICeroclinic bifurcations. They are generic codimension-two bifurcations involving a heteroclinic loop between one non-hyperbolic and one hyperbolic saddle. A particular codimension-three case is the non-central SNICeroclinic bifurcation. We unfold this bifurcation in the minimal dimension (planar) case where the non-hyperbolic point is assumed to undergo a saddle-node bifurcation. Applying the method of Poincar\'e return maps, we present a minimal set of perturbations that captures all qualitatively distinct behaviors near a non-central SNICeroclinic loop. Specifically, we study how variation of the three unfolding parameters leads to transitions from heteroclinic and homoclinic loops, saddle-node on an invariant circle (SNIC), and periodic orbits as well as equilibria. We show that although the bifurcation has been largely unexplored in applications, it can act as an organizing center for transitions between various types of saddle-node and saddle separatrix loops. It is also a generic route to oscillations that are both born and destroyed via global bifurcations, compared to the commonly observed scenarios involving local (Hopf) and in some cases global (homoclinic or SNIC) bifurcations.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2509.09520v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: For Anosov diffeomorphisms on the $3$-torus which are strongly partially hyperbolic with expanding center, we construct systems of strong unstable and center stable Margulis measures which are holonomy-invariant. This allows us to obtain a characterization of the measures of maximal unstable entropy in terms of their conditional measures along the strong unstable leaves. Moreover, we show that the Margulis systems identify with Pollicott-Ruelle (co)-resonant states for the action on 2-forms. This shows that the unstable topological entropy and a measure of maximal unstable entropy can be retrieved from the spectral approach.</description>

Abstract: Let $X_p, p\in\cP$ be a sequence of independent random variables s.t. $\bbP(X_p=\pm 1)=1/2$. Let $\te_j=\prod_{p|j}X_p$ if $j$ is square free and $\te_j=0$ otherwise. Denote $S_n=\sum_{\ell=1}^n\te_\ell$. The from this point of view proving limit theorems for $S_n$ is natural problem, since $S_n$ mimics the behavior of $e^{\sqrt{\ln(\beta)}}$. It is a natural guiding conjecture that $S_n/\sqrt n$ obeys the central limit theorem (CLT). However,
  S. Chatterjee conjectured (as expressed in \cite{[25]}) that the CLT should not hold. Chatterjee's conjecture was proved by Harper \cite{[17]}, and by now it is a direct consequence of a more recent breakthrough by Harper \cite{Har20} that $\frac{S_n}{b_n}\to 0$ in $L^1$, where $b_n=(n^{1/2}(\ln(\ln(n)))^{-1/4})u_n, u_n\to\infty$. In particular $S_n/\sqrt n\to 0$. Nevertheless, the question whether there exists a sequence $a_n=o(b_n)$ such that $S_n/a_n$ converges to some limit remains a mystery. Note that the corresponding problem in the Steinhaus Setting was recently resolved by \cite{Gor1}. In this paper make an attempt to shed some light on the convergence of $S_n/a_n$. Additionally, we obtain explicit estimates on hight moments of $S_n$ without restrictions on the size of the moment compared to $n$ like in \cite[Theorem 1.2]{Har19}, which is of independent interest. This is achieved by a martingale argument together with the Burkholder inequality, and it has applications in a natural number theoretic combinatorial problem. Using martingale techniques we will also obtain exponential concentration inequalities for $S_n$ (in the large deviations regime)</description>
