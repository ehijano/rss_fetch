      <title>DiffusionVel: Multi-Information Integrated Velocity Inversion Using Generative Diffusion Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.21776</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.21776v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Full waveform inversion (FWI) is capable of reconstructing subsurface properties with high resolution from seismic data. However, conventional FWI faces challenges such as cycle-skipping and high computational costs. Recently, deep learning method has emerged as a promising solution for efficient velocity estimation. We develop DiffusionVel, a data-driven technique based on the state-of-the-art generative diffusion models (GDMs) with integration of multiple information including seismic data, background velocity, geological knowledge, and well logs. We use two separate conditional GDMs, namely the seismic-data GDM and the well-log GDM, and an unconditional GDM, i.e., the geology-oriented GDM, to adapt the generated velocity model to the constraints of seismic data, well logs, and prior geological knowledge, respectively. Besides, the background velocity can be incorporated into the generated velocity model with a low-pass filter. The generation of these GDM are then combined together with a weighted summation in the sampling process. We can flexibly control the constraints from each information by adjusting the weighting factors. We make a comprehensive comparison between the proposed DiffusionVel and three previously-developed methods including conventional FWI, InversionNet, and VelocityGAN by using the OpenFWI datasets and the Hess VTI model example. The test results demonstrate that the proposed DiffusionVel method predicts the velocity model reasonably by integrating multiple information effectively.</description>

      <title>Machine Learning and Seismic Attributes for Petroleum Prospect Generation and Evaluation: An Example from Offshore Australia</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.21960</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.21960v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The growing number of seismic and elastic attributes poses a challenge, making the full benefit from each attribute in characterizing geological formation very difficult, if not impossible. Various approaches are routinely employed to select the best attributes for specific purposes. Machine learning (ML) algorithms have demonstrated good capabilities in combining appropriate attributes to address reservoir characterization problems. This study aims to use and combine seismic and elastic attributes to detect hydrocarbon-saturated reservoirs, source rock, and seal rocks in the Poseidon field, Offshore Australia. A large number of attributes are extracted from seismic data and from impedance data. Artificial Neural Networks (ANN) are implemented to combine the extracted attributes and convert them into Resistivity volume, and Gamma Ray volume from which Shale probability volume, Sand volume probability volume, Effective Porosity volume, and Gas Chimney Probability Cubes. The cubes are deployed for a detailed analysis of the petroleum system in the area. The produced Shale volume and Resistivity cube helped delineate the seal rock and source rock in the area. Next, the reservoir intervals were identified using Porosity, Shale, and Resistivity volumes. A pre-trained Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) is trained using another carefully selected attribute set to detect subtle faults that hydrocarbons might migrated through from source rock to trap. The integration of all the extracted cubes contributed to find new prospects in the area and assess their geological probability of success. The proposed approach stands out for its multi-physical attribute integration, Machine Learning and Human expertise incorporation, possible applicability to other fields.</description>

      <title>Constrained Transformer-Based Porous Media Generation to Spatial Distribution of Rock Properties</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.21462</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.21462v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Pore-scale modeling of rock images based on information in 3D micro-computed tomography data is crucial for studying complex subsurface processes such as CO2 and brine multiphase flow during Geologic Carbon Storage (GCS). While deep learning models can generate 3D rock microstructures that match static rock properties, they have two key limitations: they don't account for the spatial distribution of rock properties that can have an important influence on the flow and transport characteristics (such as permeability and relative permeability) of the rock and they generate structures below the representative elementary volume (REV) scale for those transport properties. Addressing these issues is crucial for building a consistent workflow between pore-scale analysis and field-scale modeling. To address these challenges, we propose a two-stage modeling framework that combines a Vector Quantized Variational Autoencoder (VQVAE) and a transformer model for spatial upscaling and arbitrary-size 3D porous media reconstruction in an autoregressive manner. The VQVAE first compresses and quantizes sub-volume training images into low-dimensional tokens, while we train a transformer to spatially assemble these tokens into larger images following specific spatial order. By employing a multi-token generation strategy, our approach preserves both sub-volume integrity and spatial relationships among these sub-image patches. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our multi-token transformer generation approach and validate it using real data from a test well, showcasing its potential to generate models for the porous media at the well scale using only a spatial porosity model. The interpolated representative porous media that reflect field-scale geological properties accurately model transport properties, including permeability and multiphase flow relative permeability of CO2 and brine.</description>

      <title>Organic compounds in metallic hydrogen</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.21772</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.21772v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Metallic hydrogen is the most common condensed material in the universe, comprising the centre of gas giant planets. However, experimental studies are extremely challenging, and most of our understanding of this material has been led by theory. Chemistry in this environment has not been probed experimentally, so here we examine hydrocarbon chemistry in metallic hydrogen using density functional theory calculations. We find that carbon and oxygen react with metallic hydrogen to produce an entirely new type of hydrocarbon chemistry based on sixfold coordinated carbon with organic-style molecules CH6, C2H8, C3H10 OH3 NH4 and CH4OH. These are charged molecules stabilised by the metallic environment. Their associated electric fields are screened, giving oscillation in the surrounding electron and proton densities. In view of the excess hydrogen we refer to them as hypermethane, hyperethane etc. The relationship to traditional chemistry is that the metallic background acts as an electron donor and stabilizes negatively charged ions. This enables the formation of six covalent bonds per carbon atom, or three per oxygen atom. This demonstrates that organic chemistry may take place in very different environments from those found on earth, and may be common throughout the universe.</description>
