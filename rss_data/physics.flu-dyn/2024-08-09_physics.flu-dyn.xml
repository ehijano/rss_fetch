      <title>Proper orthogonal decomposition analysis of square lid driven cavity flows containing particle suspensions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.04047</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.04047v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Continual perturbations to the flow field in the square lid driven cavity can significantly impact both its stability and the dynamic characteristics of the system. In this study, the effect of these perturbations are analyzed via computational fluid dynamics simulations of a square, two-dimensional, lid driven cavity containing varying area fractions of suspended particles. The evolution over time of these particle-particle and particle-fluid interactions generate two-dimensional disturbance velocity changes in the flow field. In order to better understand the characteristics and effects of these changes, proper orthogonal decomposition analysis is performed on the velocity difference flow field to determine the dominant flow structures over the simulation time domain. The resulting eigenvectors and eigenvalues represent the varying dominant flow structures and their respective dominance over the simulation time, respectively. This is carried out at particle suspension area fractions from 10\% - 50\% and for Reynolds numbers of 100, 400, 700, and 1000. Critical flow regimes and particle suspension area fractions are discussed in order to characterize the stability of this particle-in-fluid system.</description>

      <title>Asymmetry of imploding detonations in thin channels</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.04153</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.04153v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The factors that influence the symmetry of an imploding detonation are investigated experimentally and theoretically. Detonations in sub-atmospheric acetylene-oxygen were initiated and made to converge in an apparatus that followed that of Lee and Lee (Phys Fluids 8:2148-2152, 1965). The width of the test section was controlled with a wave-shaping insert, which formed the test section against the viewing window, creating an effectively two-dimensional problem with a channel width comparable to the detonation cell size. The convergence of the detonation was observed via self-luminous open-shutter photography and high-speed videography. The resulting videos were analyzed to quantify the wave speed, degree of asymmetry, and direction and magnitude of the offset in the center of convergence. To determine the experimental parameters that influence the symmetry of the imploding wave, the wave-shaping insert was intentionally canted by 0.3{\deg}-0.6{\deg}, accentuating the asymmetry of the imploding detonation. The experiment was modeled using a Huygens construction wherein the detonation is treated as a collection of wavelets, each assumed to propagate locally at a velocity determined by the channel width. The results of the model reproduced the observed offsets in detonation convergence from the center of the apparatus, confirming that velocity deficits resulting from the narrow channel width control the observed asymmetry.</description>

      <title>Contact angle hysteresis and static friction for 2-dimensional droplets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.04240</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.04240v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Contact angle hysteresis of droplets will be examined in light of static friction between liquid drop and solid surface. Unlike frictions in solid-solid interfaces, pinning forces at contact points (2D) or contact lines (3D) would be the cause of friction. We will define coefficients of static friction and relate them with advancing and receding contact angles for the case of 2-dimensional droplets. In our work sessile drops in an inclined plane, and pendent drops in a slanted ceiling will all be analyzed within a single framework with the inclination angle as a free parameter. We can then visualize the gradual change of shapes of a droplet put on a plane as the inclination angle changes adiabatically to make a complete turn. We also point out that there could be two distinct stable configurations of pendent droplets for the same physical conditions, i.e. the bifurcation.</description>

      <title>The oscillating and vibrating cylinder: a benchmark to study low Mach number aeroacoustics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.04250</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.04250v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Hydrodynamic and acoustic scales separate as the Mach number decreases, making the modelling of aeroacoustic phenomena singular in this flow regime. The benchmark of the flow developing around an oscillating and vibrating cylinder is one of the scarce configuration that is fully analytically tractable, and is thus precious in the validation of new theories or solvers. This work carefully derives the complete incompressible flow solution for this case, extending the axisymmetric results of the literature to more complex cylinder motion. High-order finite element method solution of the incompressible Navier-Stokes equations provide a reference to validate the analytical formulae derived here. Both analytical and numerical investigations agree on an independence of the configuration to the Reynolds number. Up to the critical Reynolds number, found to lie above $10^4$, the hydrodynamic solution of this configuration is solely governed by the Stokes number. The exact expression of the sound radiated in the far field is computed by accounting for the cylinder scattering by means of tailored Green's functions.</description>

      <title>Energy Method and Stability of Shear Flows: an Elementary Tutorial</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.04269</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.04269v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper provides a pedagogical introduction to the classical nonlinear stability analysis of the plane Poiseuille and Couette flows. The whole procedure is kept as simple as possible by presenting all the logical steps involved in the application of the energy method and leading to the Euler-Lagrange equations. Then, the eigenvalue problems needed for the evaluation of the nonlinear energy threshold of the Reynolds number for stability are formulated for transverse modes and for longitudinal modes. Such formulations involve the streamfunction and, in the case of longitudinal modes, also the streamwise component of velocity. An accurate numerical solution of the eigenvalue problems, based on Galerkin's method of weighted residuals with the test functions expressed in terms of Chebyshev polynomials, is discussed in details. The numerical codes developed for the software Mathematica 14 (\copyright{} Wolfram Research, Inc.) are also presented. A critical analysis of the obtained results is finally proposed.</description>

      <title>Vorticity blowup in compressible Euler equations in $\mathbb{R}^d, d \geq 3$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.04319</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.04319v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We prove finite-time vorticity blowup in the compressible Euler equations in $\mathbb{R}^d$ for any $d \geq 3$, starting from smooth, localized, and non-vacuous initial data. This is achieved by lifting the vorticity blowup result from [CCSV24] in $\mathbb{R}^2$ to $\mathbb{R}^d$ and utilizing the axisymmetry in $\mathbb{R}^d$. At the time of the first singularity, both vorticity blowup and implosion occur on a sphere $S^{d-2}$. Additionally, the solution exhibits a non-radial implosion, accompanied by a stable swirl velocity that is sufficiently strong to initially dominate the non-radial components and to generate the vorticity blowup.</description>

      <title>Anderson localization of walking droplets</title>

      <description>arXiv:2310.16000v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Understanding the ability of particles to maneuver through disordered environments is a central problem in innumerable settings, from active matter and biology to electronics. Macroscopic particles ultimately exhibit diffusive motion when their energy exceeds the characteristic potential barrier of the random landscape. In stark contrast, wave-particle duality causes electrons in sufficiently disordered media to come to rest even when the potential is weak -- a remarkable phenomenon known as Anderson localization. Here, we present a hydrodynamic active system with wave-particle features, a millimetric droplet self-guided by its own wave field over a submerged random topography, whose dynamics exhibits localized statistics analogous to those of electronic systems. Consideration of an ensemble of particle trajectories reveals a suppression of diffusion when the guiding wave field extends over the disordered topography. We rationalize mechanistically the emergent statistics by virtue of the wave-mediated resonant coupling between the droplet and topography, which produces an attractive wave potential about the localization region. This hydrodynamic analog, which demonstrates how a classical particle may localize like a wave, suggests new directions for future research in various areas, including active matter, wave localization, many-body localization, and topological matter.</description>

      <title>A mathematical model for wind-generated particle-fluid flow fields with an application to the helicopter cloud problem</title>

      <description>arXiv:2402.14028v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We develop a model for the interaction of a fluid flowing above an otherwise static particle bed, with generally the particles being entrained or detrained into the fluid from the upper surface of the particle bed, and thereby forming a fully two phase fluidized cloud above the particle bed. The flow in this large scale fluidized region is treated as a two-phase flow, whilst the key processes of entrainment and detrainment from the particle bed are treated by examining the local dynamical force balances on the particles in a thin transition layer at the interface between the fully fluidized region and the static particle bed. This detailed consideration leads to the formation of an additional macroscopic boundary condition at this interface, which closes the two phase flow problem in the bulk fluidized region above. We then introduce an elementary model of the well known helicopter brownout problem, and use the theory developed in the first part of the paper to fully analyse this model, both analytically and numerically.</description>

      <title>Bubble collapse near a wall. Part 1: An experimental study on the impact of shock waves and microjet on the wall pressure</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.03479</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.03479v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This study examines the pressure exerted by a cavitation bubble collapsing near a rigid wall. A laser-generated bubble in a water basin undergoes growth, collapse, second growth, and final collapse. Shock waves and liquid jets from non-spherical collapses are influenced by the stand-off ratio ${\gamma}$, defined as the bubble centroid distance from the wall divided by the bubble radius. We detail shock mechanisms, such as tip or torus collapse, for various ${\gamma}$ values. High-speed and Schlieren imaging visualize the microjet and shock waves. The microjet's evolution is tracked for large ${\gamma}$, while shock waves are captured in composite images showing multiple shock positions. Quantitative analyses of the microjet interface, shock wave velocities, and impact times are reported. Wall-mounted sensors and a needle hydrophone measure pressure and compare with high-speed observations to assess the dominant contributions to pressure changes with ${\gamma}$, revealing implications for cavitation erosion mechanisms.</description>

      <title>Propagating terrace in a two-tubes model of gravitational fingering</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.05981</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.05981v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study a semi-discrete model for the two-dimensional incompressible porous medium (IPM) equation describing gravitational fingering phenomenon. The model consists of a system of advection-reaction-diffusion equations on concentration, velocity and pressure, describing motion of miscible liquids under the Darcy's law in two vertical tubes (real lines) and interflow between them. Our analysis reveals the structure of gravitational fingers in this simple setting - the mixing zone consists of space-time regions of constant intermediate concentrations and the profile of propagation is characterized by two consecutive traveling waves which we call a terrace. We prove the existence of such a propagating terrace for the parameters corresponding to small distances between the tubes. This solution shows the possible mechanism of slowing down the fingers' growth due to convection in the transversal direction. The main tool in the proof is a reduction to pressure-free transverse flow equilibrium (TFE) model using geometrical singular perturbation theory and the persistence of stable and unstable manifolds under small perturbations.</description>

      <title>Robust and accurate simulations of flows over orography using non-conforming meshes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.07759</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.07759v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We systematically validate the static local mesh refinement capabilities of a recently proposed IMEX-DG scheme implemented in the framework of the deal.II library. Non-conforming meshes are employed in atmospheric flow simulations to increase the resolution around complex orography. A number of numerical experiments based on classical benchmarks with idealized as well as real orography profiles demonstrate that simulations with the refined mesh are stable for long lead times and no spurious effects arise at the interfaces of mesh regions with different resolutions. Moreover, correct values of the momentum flux are retrieved and the correct large-scale orographic response is established. Hence, large-scale orography-driven flow features can be simulated without loss of accuracy using a much lower total amount of degrees of freedom. In a context of spatial resolutions approaching the hectometric scale in numerical weather prediction models, these results support the use of locally refined, non-conforming meshes as a reliable and effective tool to greatly reduce the dependence of atmospheric models on orographic wave drag parametrizations.</description>
