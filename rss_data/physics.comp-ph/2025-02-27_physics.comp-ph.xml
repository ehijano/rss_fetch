      <title>Breaking Performance Barriers: Massive-Scale Simulations of 2D Ising and Blume-Capel Models on Rack-Scale Multi-GPU Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.18624</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.18624v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present high-performance implementations of the two-dimensional Ising and Blume-Capel models for large-scale, multi-GPU simulations. Our approach takes full advantage of the NVIDIA GB200 NVL72 system, which features up to $72$ GPUs interconnected via high-bandwidth NVLink, enabling direct GPU-to-GPU memory access across multiple nodes. By utilizing Fabric Memory and an optimized Monte Carlo kernel for the Ising model, our implementation supports simulations of systems with linear sizes up to $L=2^{23}$, corresponding to approximately $70$ trillion spins. This allows for a peak processing rate of nearly $1.15 \times 10^5$ lattice updates per nanosecond-setting a new performance benchmark for Ising model simulations. Additionally, we introduce a custom protocol for computing correlation functions, which strikes an optimal balance between computational efficiency and statistical accuracy. This protocol enables large-scale simulations without incurring prohibitive runtime costs. Benchmark results show near-perfect strong and weak scaling up to $64$ GPUs, demonstrating the effectiveness of our approach for large-scale statistical physics simulations.</description>

      <title>Meta-GGA dielectric-dependent and range-separated screened hybrid functional for reliable prediction of material properties</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.18616</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.18616v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose a range-separated hybrid exchange-correlation functional to calculate solid-state material properties. The functional mixes Hartree-Fock exchange with the semilocal exchange of the meta-generalized gradient approximation (meta-GGA) and the fraction of Hartree-Fock exchange is determined from the dielectric function. First-principles calculations and comparison with other meta-GGA approximations show that the functional leads to reasonably good performance for the band gap and optical properties. We also show that the present functional also successfully resolves the well-known ``band gap problem'' of narrow gap Cu-based semiconductors, such as Cu3SbSe4 and Cu3AsSe4, where, in general, a considerably large band inversion energy leads to a ``false'' negative or metallic band gap for all other methods. Furthermore, reasonable accuracy for the occupied d-bands and transition energies is also obtained for bulk solids. Thus, overall, our results demonstrate the predictive power of range-separated meta-GGA hybrid functionals for quantum materials simulations.</description>

      <title>PyTorchFire: A GPU-Accelerated Wildfire Simulator with Differentiable Cellular Automata</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.18738</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.18738v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Accurate and rapid prediction of wildfire trends is crucial for effective management and mitigation. However, the stochastic nature of fire propagation poses significant challenges in developing reliable simulators. In this paper, we introduce PyTorchFire, an open-access, PyTorch-based software that leverages GPU acceleration. With our redesigned differentiable wildfire Cellular Automata (CA) model, we achieve millisecond-level computational efficiency, significantly outperforming traditional CPU-based wildfire simulators on real-world-scale fires at high resolution. Real-time parameter calibration is made possible through gradient descent on our model, aligning simulations closely with observed wildfire behavior both temporally and spatially, thereby enhancing the realism of the simulations. Our PyTorchFire simulator, combined with real-world environmental data, demonstrates superior generalizability compared to supervised learning surrogate models. Its ability to predict and calibrate wildfire behavior in real-time ensures accuracy, stability, and efficiency. PyTorchFire has the potential to revolutionize wildfire simulation, serving as a powerful tool for wildfire prediction and management.</description>

      <title>Efficient optimization of neural network backflow for ab-initio quantum chemistry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.18843</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.18843v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The ground state of second-quantized quantum chemistry Hamiltonians is key to determining molecular properties. Neural quantum states (NQS) offer flexible and expressive wavefunction ansatze for this task but face two main challenges: highly peaked ground-state wavefunctions hinder efficient sampling, and local energy evaluations scale quartically with system size, incurring significant computational costs. In this work, we develop algorithmic improvements for optimizing these wave-functions which includes compact subspace construction, truncated local energy evaluations, improved stochastic sampling, and physics-informed modifications. We apply these improvements to the neural network backflow (NNBF) ansatz finding that they lead to improved accuracy and scalability. Using these techniques, we find NNBF surpasses traditional methods like CCSD and CCSD(T), outperform existing NQS approaches, and achieve competitive energies compared to state-of-the-art quantum chemistry methods such as HCI, ASCI, and FCIQMC. An ablation study highlights the contribution of each enhancement, showing significant gains in energy accuracy and computational efficiency. We also examine the dependence of NNBF expressiveness on the inverse participation ratio (IPR), observing that more delocalized states are generally harder to approximate.</description>

      <title>Formulation and Analysis of Blended Atomistic to Higher-Order Continuum Coupling Methods for Crystalline Defects</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.18854</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.18854v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Concurrent multiscale methods play an important role in modeling and simulating materials with defects, aiming to achieve the balance between accuracy and efficiency. Atomistic-to-continuum (a/c) coupling methods, a typical class of concurrent multiscale methods, link atomic-scale simulations with continuum mechanics. Existing a/c methods adopt the classic second-order Cauchy-Born approximation as the continuum mechanics model. In this work, we employ a higher-order Cauchy-Born model to study the potential accuracy improvement of the coupling scheme. In particular, we develop an energy-based blended atomistic to higher-order continuum method and present a rigorous a priori error analysis. We show that the overall accuracy of the energy-based blended method is not actually improved due the coupling interface error which is of lower order and may not be improved. On the contrast, higher order accuracy is achieved by the force-based blended atomistic to higher-order continuum method. Our theoretical results are demonstrated by a detailed numerical study.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2502.18985v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The algorithm-specific graph and circuit etching are two strategies for compiling a graph state to implement quantum computation. Benchmark testing exposed limitations to the proto-compiler, Jabalizer giving rise to Etch (https://github.com/QSI-BAQS/Etch), an open-source, circuit-etching tool for transpiling a quantum circuit to a graph state. The viability of circuit etching is evaluated, both as a resource allocation strategy for distilling magic states and as an alternative to the algorithm-specific graph strategy as realised in Jabalizer. Experiments using Etch to transpile IQP circuits to an equivalent graph state resulted in higher ratios of Pauli qubits to non-Pauli qubit than required for efficient magic state distillation. Future research directions for the algorithm-specific graph and circuit-etching strategies are proposed.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2502.19113v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this work, we propose a path integral-inspired formalism for computing the quantum thermal expectation values of spins, when subject to magnetic fields that can be time-dependent and can accommodate the presence of Heisenberg exchange interactions between the spins. This generalises the formalism presented in our previous work [Phys. Rev. Research 5, 043075 (2023)] and paves the way towards the realisation of large-scale atomistic simulations, for which this method should reveal its true efficiency gains, when compared to exact quantum methods. We compare our results with exact/numerical diagonalisation methods, where possible, to confirm the range of accuracy of our model.</description>

      <title>Topology optimization of a superabsorbing thin-film semiconductor metasurface</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.19352v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We demonstrate a computational inverse design method for optimizing broadband-absorbing metasurfaces made of arbitrary dispersive media. Our figure of merit is the time-averaged instantaneous power dissipation in a single unit cell within a periodic array. Its time-domain formulation allows capturing the response of arbitrary dispersive media over any desired spectral range. Employing the time-domain adjoint method within a topology optimization framework enables the design of complex metasurface structures exhibiting unprecedented broadband absorption. We applied the method to a thin-film Silicon-on-insulator configuration and explored the impact of structural and (time-domain inherent) excitation parameters on performance over the visible-ultraviolet. Since our incorporated material model can represent any linear material, the method can also be applied to other all-dielectric, plasmonic, or hybrid configurations.</description>

      <title>Neutron Beam Shaping by Ghost Projection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.19376</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.19376v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a method to shape a neutron beam and project any specified target image using a single universal patterned mask that is transversely displaced. The method relies on "ghost projection", which is a reversed form of classical ghost imaging. A set of sub-mask regions that combine to construct the required beam shape is computed; illumination of each region with the determined exposure time projects the shaped beam. We demonstrate this method experimentally, using the Dingo neutron imaging beamline at the OPAL nuclear research reactor (Australia). The ability to shape a neutron beam "on demand" allows selective dose delivery away from sensitive areas of samples, such as in cultural heritage artifacts. It also benefits irradiation techniques, e.g., in testing resilience of electronic components for space and defense technologies or neutron therapies.</description>

Abstract: In this paper, we introduce a novel approach to solve the many-body Schrodinger equation by the tensor neural network. Based on the tensor product structure, we can do the direct numerical integration by using fixed quadrature points for the functions constructed by the tensor neural network within tolerable computational complexity. Especially, we design several types of efficient numerical methods to treat the variable-coupled Coulomb potentials with high accuracy. The corresponding machine learning method is built for solving many-body Schrodinger equation. Some numerical examples are provided to validate the accuracy and efficiency of the proposed algorithms.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2501.11962v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Molecular dynamics (MD)-based path sampling algorithms are a very important class of methods used to study the energetics and kinetics of rare (bio)molecular events. They sample the highly informative but highly unlikely reactive trajectories connecting different metastable states of complex (bio)molecular systems. The metadynamics of paths (MoP) method proposed by Mandelli, Hirshberg, and Parrinello [Pys. Rev. Lett. 125 2, 026001 (2020)] is based on the Onsager-Machlup path integral formalism. This provides an analytical expression for the probability of sampling stochastic trajectories of given duration. In practice, the method samples reactive paths via metadynamics simulations performed directly in the phase space of all possible trajectories. Its parallel implementation is in principle infinitely scalable, allowing arbitrarily long trajectories to be simulated. Paving the way for future applications to study the thermodynamics and kinetics of protein-ligand (un)binding, a problem of great pharmaceutical interest, we present here the efficient implementation of MoP in the HPC-oriented biomolecular simulation software GROMACS. Our benchmarks on a membrane protein (150,000 atoms) show an unprecedented weak scaling parallel efficiency of over 70% up to 3200 GPUs on the pre-exascale JUWELS Booster machine at the J\"ulich Supercomputing Center.</description>

      <title>Learning atomic forces from uncertainty-calibrated adversarial attacks</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.18314v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Adversarial approaches, which intentionally challenge machine learning models by generating difficult examples, are increasingly being adopted to improve machine learning interatomic potentials (MLIPs). While already providing great practical value, little is known about the actual prediction errors of MLIPs on adversarial structures and whether these errors can be controlled. We propose the Calibrated Adversarial Geometry Optimization (CAGO) algorithm to discover adversarial structures with user-assigned errors. Through uncertainty calibration, the estimated uncertainty of MLIPs is unified with real errors. By performing geometry optimization for calibrated uncertainty, we reach adversarial structures with the user-assigned target MLIP prediction error. Integrating with active learning pipelines, we benchmark CAGO, demonstrating stable MLIPs that systematically converge structural, dynamical, and thermodynamical properties for liquid water and water adsorption in a metal-organic framework within only hundreds of training structures, where previously many thousands were typically required.</description>

      <title>Artificial Intelligence for Science in Quantum, Atomistic, and Continuum Systems</title>

Abstract: Advances in artificial intelligence (AI) are fueling a new paradigm of discoveries in natural sciences. Today, AI has started to advance natural sciences by improving, accelerating, and enabling our understanding of natural phenomena at a wide range of spatial and temporal scales, giving rise to a new area of research known as AI for science (AI4Science). Being an emerging research paradigm, AI4Science is unique in that it is an enormous and highly interdisciplinary area. Thus, a unified and technical treatment of this field is needed yet challenging. This work aims to provide a technically thorough account of a subarea of AI4Science; namely, AI for quantum, atomistic, and continuum systems. These areas aim at understanding the physical world from the subatomic (wavefunctions and electron density), atomic (molecules, proteins, materials, and interactions), to macro (fluids, climate, and subsurface) scales and form an important subarea of AI4Science. A unique advantage of focusing on these areas is that they largely share a common set of challenges, thereby allowing a unified and foundational treatment. A key common challenge is how to capture physics first principles, especially symmetries, in natural systems by deep learning methods. We provide an in-depth yet intuitive account of techniques to achieve equivariance to symmetry transformations. We also discuss other common technical challenges, including explainability, out-of-distribution generalization, knowledge transfer with foundation and large language models, and uncertainty quantification. To facilitate learning and education, we provide categorized lists of resources that we found to be useful. We strive to be thorough and unified and hope this initial effort may trigger more community interests and efforts to further advance AI4Science.</description>

      <title>Kinetic data-driven approach to turbulence subgrid modeling</title>

Abstract: Numerical simulations of turbulent flows are well known to pose extreme computational challenges due to the huge number of dynamical degrees of freedom required to correctly describe the complex multi-scale statistical correlations of the velocity. On the other hand, kinetic mesoscale approaches based on the Boltzmann equation, have the potential to describe a broad range of flows, stretching well beyond the special case of gases close to equilibrium, which results in the ordinary Navier-Stokes dynamics. Here we demonstrate that, by properly tuning, a kinetic approach can statistically reproduce the quantitative dynamics of the larger scales in turbulence, thereby providing an alternative, computationally efficient and physically rooted approach towards subgrid scale (SGS) modeling in turbulence. More specifically we show that by leveraging on data from fully resolved Direct Numerical Simulation (DNS) we can learn a collision operator for the discretized Boltzmann equation solver (the lattice Boltzmann method), which effectively implies a turbulence subgrid closure model. The mesoscopic nature of our formulation makes the learning problem fully local in both space and time, leading to reduced computational costs and enhanced generalization capabilities. We show that the model offers superior performance compared to traditional methods, such as the Smagorinsky model, being less dissipative and, therefore, being able to more closely capture the intermittency of higher-order velocity correlations. This foundational work lays the basis for extending the proposed framework to different turbulent flow settings and -- most importantly -- to develop new classes of hybrid data-driven kinetic-based models capable of faithfully capturing the complex macroscopic dynamics of diverse physical systems such as emulsions, non-Newtonian fluid and multiphase systems.</description>

      <title>Group Conductivity and Nonadiabatic Born Effective Charges of Disordered Metals, Warm Dense Matter, and Hot Dense Plasma</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.16230</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.16230v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The average ionization state is a critical parameter in plasma models for charged particle transport, equation of state, and optical response. The dynamical or nonadiabatic Born effective charge (NBEC), calculated via first principles time-dependent density functional theory, provides exact ionic partitioning of bulk electron response for both metallic and insulating materials. The NBEC can be trivially transformed into a ''group conductivity," that is, the electron conductivity ascribed to a subset of ions. We show that for disordered metallic systems, such as warm dense matter (WDM) and hot dense plasma, the static limit of the NBEC is different from the average ionization state, but that the ionization state can be extracted from the group conductivity even in mixed systems. We demonstrate this approach using a set of archetypical examples, including cold and warm aluminium, low- and high- density WDM carbon, and a WDM carbon-beryllium-hydrogen mixture.</description>

      <title>Simulating quantum emitters in arbitrary photonic environments using FDTD: beyond the semi-classical regime</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.16118</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.16118v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We propose a numerical algorithm that integrates quantum two-level systems (TLSs) into the finite-difference time-domain (FDTD) framework for simulating quantum emitters in arbitrary 3D photonic environments. Conventional methods struggle with these systems due to their semi-classical nature and spurious self-interactions that arise when a TLS is driven by its own radiation field. We address these issues by determining the correct electric field for driving the TLS, as well as the current source used in FDTD for modeling photon emission. Our method, focusing on single-excitation states, employs a total field-incident field (TF-IF) technique to eliminate self-interactions, enabling precise simulations of photon emission and scattering. The algorithm also successfully models complex phenomena such as resonant energy transfer, superradiance, and vacuum Rabi splitting. This powerful computational tool is expected to substantially advance research in nanophotonics, quantum physics, and beyond.</description>

      <title>Multi-scale physics of cryogenic liquid helium-4: Inverse coarse-graining properties of smoothed particle hydrodynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.14244</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.14244v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Our recent numerical studies on cryogenic liquid helium-4 strongly indicate the features of multiscale physics that can be identified using the Landau's two-fluid model. This study presents the possibility that two-fluid models based on classical and quantum hydrodynamics have a relationship between the scale transformation using filtering in large eddy simulations (LES) and the inverse scale transformation using smoothed particle hydrodynamics (SPH). We show that the spin angular momentum conservation term, which we previously introduced into the two-fluid model as a quantum mechanical correction, formally corresponds to the subgrid-scale (SGS) model, which can be derived from the scale transformation of the two-fluid model from quantum to classical hydrodynamics. Our theoretical analysis shows that solving the two-fluid model based on classical hydrodynamics using SPH can reproduce the microscopic fluctuations even at the macroscopic scale because the truncation errors owing to the smoothing kernel approximation can substitute the microscopic fluctuations. In particular, the fluctuations can be amplified according to the size of the kernel radius at the macroscopic scale. Our further theoretical analysis shows that the Condiff viscosity model can serve as an SGS model and incorporate the quantum vortex interactions into the two-fluid model. Our results and discussion provide new insights into the microscopic composition of the cryogenic liquid helium-4 within a multiscale framework. First, a normal fluid can be a mixture of inviscid and viscous fluid particles. Second, a flow identified as a normal fluid on the microscopic scale because of the presence of molecular viscosity is still classified as an inviscid fluid on the hydrodynamic scale because its viscosity is insufficient to produce eddy viscosity.</description>

      <title>ByteQC: GPU-Accelerated Quantum Chemistry Package for Large-Scale Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.17963</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.17963v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Applying quantum chemistry algorithms to large-scale systems requires substantial computational resources scaled with the system size and the desired accuracy. To address this, ByteQC, a fully-functional and efficient package for large-scale quantum chemistry simulations, has been open-sourced at https://github.com/bytedance/byteqc, leveraging recent advances in computational power and many-body algorithms.
  Regarding computational power, several standard algorithms are efficiently implemented on modern GPUs, ranging from mean-field calculations (Hartree-Fock and density functional theory) to post-Hartree-Fock methods such as M{\o}ller-Plesset perturbation theory, random phase approximation, coupled cluster methods, and quantum Monte Carlo methods. For the algorithmic approach, we also employ a quantum embedding method, which significantly expands the tractable system size while preserving high accuracy at the gold-standard level.
  All these features have been systematically benchmarked. For standalone algorithms, the benchmark results demonstrate up to a 60$\times$ speedup when compared to 100-core CPUs. Additionally, the tractable system sizes have been significantly expanded: 1,610 orbitals for coupled cluster with single and double excitations (1,380 orbitals with perturbative triple excitations), 11,040 orbitals for M{\o}ller-Plesset perturbation theory of second order, 37,120 orbitals for mean-field calculations under open boundary conditions, and over 100,000 orbitals for periodic boundary conditions. For the advanced quantum embedding feature, two representative examples are demonstrated: the water cluster problem (2,752 orbitals) and a water monomer adsorbed on a boron nitride surface (3,929 orbitals), achieving the gold-standard accuracy.</description>
