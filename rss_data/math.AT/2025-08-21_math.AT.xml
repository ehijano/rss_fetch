      <title>String topology via the coHochschild complex and local intersections</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.15684</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.15684v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We construct an algebraic model for the Chas--Sullivan product and the Goresky--Hingston coproduct in string topology. The construction takes as its initial input a simplicial complex equipped with a local pairing on its simplicial chains, for instance, a homology manifold with its local intersection pairing. We define the two string topology operations on the coHochschild complex of a suitable coalgebra of chains, making use of local higher homotopies that control the compatibility of the pairing with the diagonal approximation coproduct. In the case of a closed oriented smooth manifold, we prove that our algebraic operations coincide, up to chain homotopy, with their geometric counterparts. The local nature of our constructions allows for arguments based on the method of acyclic models.</description>

      <title>Topological potentials guiding protein self-assembly</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.15321</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.15321v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The simulated self-assembly of molecular building blocks into functional complexes is a key area of study in computational biology and materials science. Self-assembly simulations of proteins, driven by short-range non-polar interactions, can find the biologically correct assembly as the energy minimizing state. Short-ranged potentials produce rugged energy landscapes however, which lead to simulations becoming trapped in non-functional, local minimizers.
  Successful self-assembly simulations depend both on the physical realism of the driving potentials as well as their ability to efficiently explore the configuration space.
  We introduce a long-range topological potential, quantified via weighted total persistence, and combine it with the morphometric approach to solvation-free energy. This combination improves the assembly success rate in simulations of the tobacco mosaic virus dimer and other protein complexes by up to sixteen-fold compared with the morphometric model alone. It further enables successful simulation in systems that don't otherwise assemble during the examined timescales.
  Compared to previous topology-based work, which has been primarily descriptive, our approach uses topological measures as an active energetic bias that is independent of electrostatics or chemical specificity and depends only on atomic coordinates. Therefore the method can, in principle, be applied to arbitrary systems where such coordinates are optimized. Integrating topological descriptions into an energy function offers a general strategy for overcoming kinetic barriers in molecular simulations, with potential applications in drug design, materials development, and the study of complex self-assembly processes.</description>

      <title>Milnor fibrations and oriented matroids</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.15331</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.15331v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce a combinatorial model for the Milnor fibration of a complexified real arrangement using oriented matroids. It is a poset quasi-fibration, a notion recently introduced by the first author, whose domain is a subdivision of the Salvetti complex stemming from a natural subdivision of the dual oriented matroid complex. This yields a concrete finite regular CW complex which is homotopy equivalent to the Milnor fiber of the complexified real arrangement and implies that the homotopy type of the Milnor fiber of a complexified real arrangement only depends on the underlying combinatorial structure given by its oriented matroid. Moreover, our construction works for any oriented matroid, disregarding realizability, so we obtain a notion of a combinatorial Milnor fibration for any oriented matroid.</description>

      <title>The nine model category structures on the category of sets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.15731</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.15731v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We give a proof of the folklore theorem, attributed to Goodwillie, that there are precisely nine model structures on the category $\mathsf{Set}$ of sets. This result is deduced from a complete study of lifting problems and the ensuing classification of all weak factorization systems on $\mathsf{Set}$. Moreover, we determine the Quillen equivalences between these model structures and exhibit an explicit example of equivalent model structures that cannot be realized by a single Quillen adjunction.</description>

Abstract: We study transformations between discrete Morse functions on a finite simplicial complex via birth-death transitions--elementary chain maps between discrete Morse complexes that either create or cancel pairs of critical simplices.We prove that any two discrete Morse functions f1, f2 on a finite simplicial complex K are linked by a finite sequence of such transitions.As applications, we present alternative proofs of several of Forman's fundamental results in discrete Morse theory and study the topology of the space of discrete Morse functions.</description>

      <title>Group actions on contractible $2$-complexes I</title>

      <description>arXiv:2102.11458v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this series of two articles, we prove that every action of a finite group $G$ on a finite and contractible $2$-complex has a fixed point. The proof goes by constructing a nontrivial representation of the fundamental group of each of the acyclic $2$-dimensional $G$-complexes constructed by Oliver and Segev. In the first part we develop the necessary theory and cover the cases where $G=\mathrm{PSL}_2(2^n)$, $G=\mathrm{PSL}_2(q)$ with $q\equiv 3\pmod 8$ or $G=\mathrm{Sz}(2^n)$. The cases $G=\mathrm{PSL}_2(q)$ with $q\equiv 5\pmod 8$ are addressed in the second part.</description>

Abstract: In this second part we prove that, if $G$ is one of the groups $\mathrm{PSL}_2(q)$ with $q&gt;5$ and $q\equiv 5\pmod {24}$ or $q\equiv 13 \pmod{24}$, then the fundamental group of every acyclic $2$-dimensional, fixed point free and finite $G$-complex admits a nontrivial representation in a unitary group $\mathrm{U}(m)$. This completes the proof of the following result: every action of a finite group on a finite and contractible $2$-complex has a fixed point.</description>

      <title>On bi-enriched $\infty$-categories</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.09832v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We extend Lurie's definition of enriched $\infty$-categories to notions of left enriched, right enriched and bienriched $\infty$-categories, which generalize the concepts of closed left tensored, right tensored and bitensored $\infty$-categories and share many desirable features with them. We use bienriched $\infty$-categories to endow the $\infty$-category of enriched functors with enrichment that generalizes both the internal hom of the tensor product of enriched $\infty$-categories when the latter exists, and the free cocompletion under colimits and tensors. As an application we construct enriched Kan-extensions from operadic Kan-extensions, compute the monad for enriched functors, prove an end formula for morphism objects of enriched $\infty$-categories of enriched functors and a coend formula for the relative tensor product of enriched profunctors and construct transfer of enrichment from scalar extension of presentably bitensored $\infty$-categories. In particular, we develop an independent theory of enriched $\infty$-categories for Lurie's model of enriched $\infty$-categories.</description>

      <title>Cohomotopy, Framed Links, and Abelian Anyons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.11896</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.11896v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We establish a natural identification of cobordism classes of framed links with the fundamental group of the group-completed configuration space of points in the plane, by appeal to Okuyama's previously underappreciated interval configuration model for the latter. Under Segal's theorem, these classes are integers generated by the Hopf generator in the 2-cohomotopy of the 3-sphere, and we identify these knot-theoretically with the writhe sum of the linking and framing number of links. We observe that this link invariant is the properly regularized Wilson line observable of abelian Chern-Simons theory, and show, in consequence of the main theorem, that this arises equivalently as the expectation value of pure quantum states on the group algebra, under link sum, of cobordism classes of framed links. Observing that these quantum states regard framed links as worldlines of anyons in that they assign a fixed complex phase factor to each crossing (braiding) of strands, we close with an outlook on implications for the identification of anyonic solitons in 2D electron gases as exotic flux quantized in Cohomotopy instead of in ordinary cohomology.</description>

      <title>Homotopy types of Hom complexes of graph homomorphisms whose codomains are square-free</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.19039</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.19039v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Given finite simple graphs $G$ and $H$, the Hom complex $\mathrm{Hom}(G,H)$ is a polyhedral complex having the graph homomorphisms $G\to H$ as the vertices. We determine the homotopy type of each connected component of $\mathrm{Hom}(G,H)$ when $H$ is square-free, meaning that it does not contain the $4$-cycle graph $C_4$ as a subgraph. Specifically, for a connected $G$ and a square-free $H$, we show that each connected component of $\mathrm{Hom}(G,H)$ is homotopy equivalent to a wedge sum of circles. We further show that, given any graph homomorphism $f\colon G\to H$ to a square-free $H$, one can determine the homotopy type of the connected component of $\mathrm{Hom}(G,H)$ containing $f$ algorithmically.</description>
