      <title>Neural Dynamics Model of Visual Decision-Making: Learning from Human Experts</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.02390</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.02390v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Uncovering the fundamental neural correlates of biological intelligence, developing mathematical models, and conducting computational simulations are critical for advancing new paradigms in artificial intelligence (AI). In this study, we implemented a comprehensive visual decision-making model that spans from visual input to behavioral output, using a neural dynamics modeling approach. Drawing inspiration from the key components of the dorsal visual pathway in primates, our model not only aligns closely with human behavior but also reflects neural activities in primates, and achieving accuracy comparable to convolutional neural networks (CNNs). Moreover, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) identified key neuroimaging features such as structural connections and functional connectivity that are associated with performance in perceptual decision-making tasks. A neuroimaging-informed fine-tuning approach was introduced and applied to the model, leading to performance improvements that paralleled the behavioral variations observed among subjects. Compared to classical deep learning models, our model more accurately replicates the behavioral performance of biological intelligence, relying on the structural characteristics of biological neural networks rather than extensive training data, and demonstrating enhanced resilience to perturbation.</description>

      <title>SNNAX -- Spiking Neural Networks in JAX</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.02842</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.02842v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs) simulators are essential tools to prototype biologically inspired models and neuromorphic hardware architectures and predict their performance. For such a tool, ease of use and flexibility are critical, but so is simulation speed especially given the complexity inherent to simulating SNN. Here, we present SNNAX, a JAX-based framework for simulating and training such models with PyTorch-like intuitiveness and JAX-like execution speed. SNNAX models are easily extended and customized to fit the desired model specifications and target neuromorphic hardware. Additionally, SNNAX offers key features for optimizing the training and deployment of SNNs such as flexible automatic differentiation and just-in-time compilation. We evaluate and compare SNNAX to other commonly used machine learning (ML) frameworks used for programming SNNs. We provide key performance metrics, best practices, documented examples for simulating SNNs in SNNAX, and implement several benchmarks used in the literature.</description>

      <title>Brain-Inspired Online Adaptation for Remote Sensing with Spiking Neural Network</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.02146</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.02146v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: On-device computing, or edge computing, is becoming increasingly important for remote sensing, particularly in applications like deep network-based perception on on-orbit satellites and unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs). In these scenarios, two brain-like capabilities are crucial for remote sensing models: (1) high energy efficiency, allowing the model to operate on edge devices with limited computing resources, and (2) online adaptation, enabling the model to quickly adapt to environmental variations, weather changes, and sensor drift. This work addresses these needs by proposing an online adaptation framework based on spiking neural networks (SNNs) for remote sensing. Starting with a pretrained SNN model, we design an efficient, unsupervised online adaptation algorithm, which adopts an approximation of the BPTT algorithm and only involves forward-in-time computation that significantly reduces the computational complexity of SNN adaptation learning. Besides, we propose an adaptive activation scaling scheme to boost online SNN adaptation performance, particularly in low time-steps. Furthermore, for the more challenging remote sensing detection task, we propose a confidence-based instance weighting scheme, which substantially improves adaptation performance in the detection task. To our knowledge, this work is the first to address the online adaptation of SNNs. Extensive experiments on seven benchmark datasets across classification, segmentation, and detection tasks demonstrate that our proposed method significantly outperforms existing domain adaptation and domain generalization approaches under varying weather conditions. The proposed method enables energy-efficient and fast online adaptation on edge devices, and has much potential in applications such as remote perception on on-orbit satellites and UAV.</description>

      <title>A Low-Cost Real-Time Spiking System for Obstacle Detection based on Ultrasonic Sensors and Rate Coding</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.02680</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.02680v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Since the advent of mobile robots, obstacle detection has been a topic of great interest. It has also been a subject of study in neuroscience, where flying insects and bats could be considered two of the most interesting cases in terms of vision-based and sound-based mechanisms for obstacle detection, respectively. Currently, many studies focus on vision-based obstacle detection, but not many can be found regarding sound-based obstacle detection. This work focuses on the latter approach, which also makes use of a Spiking Neural Network to exploit the advantages of these architectures and achieve an approach closer to biology. The complete system was tested through a series of experiments that confirm the validity of the spiking architecture for obstacle detection. It is empirically demonstrated that, when the distance between the robot and the obstacle decreases, the output firing rate of the system increases in response as expected, and vice versa. Therefore, there is a direct relation between the two. Furthermore, there is a distance threshold between detectable and undetectable objects which is also empirically measured in this work. An in-depth study on how this system works at low level based on the Inter-Spike Interval concept was performed, which may be useful in the future development of applications based on spiking filters.</description>

      <title>Spiking Wavelet Transformer</title>

Abstract: Spiking neural networks (SNNs) offer an energy-efficient alternative to conventional deep learning by emulating the event-driven processing manner of the brain. Incorporating Transformers with SNNs has shown promise for accuracy. However, they struggle to learn high-frequency patterns, such as moving edges and pixel-level brightness changes, because they rely on the global self-attention mechanism. Learning these high-frequency representations is challenging but essential for SNN-based event-driven vision. To address this issue, we propose the Spiking Wavelet Transformer (SWformer), an attention-free architecture that effectively learns comprehensive spatial-frequency features in a spike-driven manner by leveraging the sparse wavelet transform. The critical component is a Frequency-Aware Token Mixer (FATM) with three branches: 1) spiking wavelet learner for spatial-frequency domain learning, 2) convolution-based learner for spatial feature extraction, and 3) spiking pointwise convolution for cross-channel information aggregation - with negative spike dynamics incorporated in 1) to enhance frequency representation. The FATM enables the SWformer to outperform vanilla Spiking Transformers in capturing high-frequency visual components, as evidenced by our empirical results. Experiments on both static and neuromorphic datasets demonstrate SWformer's effectiveness in capturing spatial-frequency patterns in a multiplication-free and event-driven fashion, outperforming state-of-the-art SNNs. SWformer achieves a 22.03% reduction in parameter count, and a 2.52% performance improvement on the ImageNet dataset compared to vanilla Spiking Transformers. The code is available at: https://github.com/bic-L/Spiking-Wavelet-Transformer.</description>

      <title>CoLaNET -- A Spiking Neural Network with Columnar Layered Architecture for Classification</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.01230</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.01230v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In the present paper, I describe a spiking neural network (SNN) architecture which, can be used in wide range of supervised learning classification tasks. It is assumed, that all participating signals (the classified object description, correct class label and SNN decision) have spiking nature. The distinctive feature of this architecture is a combination of prototypical network structures corresponding to different classes and significantly distinctive instances of one class (=columns) and functionally differing populations of neurons inside columns (=layers). The other distinctive feature is a novel combination of anti-Hebbian and dopamine-modulated plasticity. The plasticity rules are local and do not use the backpropagation principle. Besides that, as in my previous studies, I was guided by the requirement that the all neuron/plasticity models should be easily implemented on modern neurochips. I illustrate the high performance of my network on the MNIST benchmark.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2302.13696v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We propose a new high-performance activation function, Moderate Adaptive Linear Units (MoLU), for the deep neural network. The MoLU is a simple, beautiful and powerful activation function that can be a good main activation function among hundreds of activation functions. Because the MoLU is made up of the elementary functions, not only it is a diffeomorphism (i.e. analytic over whole domains), but also it reduces the training time.</description>

      <title>Kolmogorov Arnold Networks in Fraud Detection: Bridging the Gap Between Theory and Practice</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.10263</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.10263v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This study evaluates the applicability of Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks (KAN) in fraud detection, finding that their effectiveness is context-dependent. We propose a quick decision rule using Principal Component Analysis (PCA) to assess the suitability of KAN: if data can be effectively separated in two dimensions using splines, KAN may outperform traditional models; otherwise, other methods could be more appropriate. We also introduce a heuristic approach to hyperparameter tuning, significantly reducing computational costs. These findings suggest that while KAN has potential, its use should be guided by data-specific assessments.</description>
