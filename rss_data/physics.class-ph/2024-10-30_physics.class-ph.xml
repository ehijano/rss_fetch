      <title>Description of electromagnetic fields in inhomogeneous accelerating sections. II Fields in the regular part</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.23119</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.23119v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this work we present the results of calculation of the electric field distribution in the inhomogeneous accelerating section on the base of generalized coupled modes theory. It was shown that the proposed coupled differential equations correctly describe electromagnetic field distribution in the regular part of the section under consideration, which is an analogue of the one being developed at CERN.</description>

      <title>A Steady Loop Current Does Not Radiate</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.13221</link>
      <description>arXiv:2308.13221v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: According to mainstream electrodynamics, a steady loop current does not radiate. Edward, Kenyon, and Lemon took the approximated electric field formula (the magnetic one is trivial) for a moving point charge and showed that the electric field of a steady loop current could be partitioned into a static field falling with the square of distance and an integral of an exact differential (also called total differential, full differential, or perfect differential), thus no radiation was omitted. Inspired by their work, we do the same to the electric and magnetic fields without approximation.</description>

      <title>Exact solutions for radiative transfer with partial frequency redistribution</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.15621</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.15621v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The construction of exact solutions for radiative transfer in a plane-parallel medium has been addressed by Hemsch and Ferziger in 1972 for a partial frequency redistribution model of the formation of spectral lines consisting in a linear combination of frequency coherent and fully incoherent scattering. The method of solution is based on an eigenfunction expansion of the radiation field, leading to two singular integral equations with a Cauchy-type kernel, that have to be solved one after the other. We reconsider this problem, using as starting point the integral formulation of the radiative transfer equation, where the terms involving the coupling between the two scattering mechanisms are clearly displayed, as well as the primary source of photons. With an inverse Laplace transform, we recover the singular integral equations previously established and with Hilbert transforms, as in the previous work, recast them as boundary value problems in the complex plane. Their solutions are presented in detail for an infinite and a semi-infinite medium. The coupling terms are carefully analyzed and consistency with either the coherent or the incoherent limit is systematically checked. We recover the important results of the previous work that an exact solution exists for an infinite medium, whereas for a semi-infinite medium, which requires the introduction of half-space auxiliary functions, the solution is given by a Fredholm integral equation to be solved numerically. The solutions of the singular integral equations are used to construct explicit expressions providing the radiation field for an arbitrary primary source and for the Green function. An explicit expression is given for the radiation field emerging from a semi-infinite medium.</description>

      <title>Deep noise squeezing in parametrically driven resonators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.03758</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.03758v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Here we investigate white noise squeezing in the frequency domain of classical parametrically-driven resonators with added noise. We use Green's functions to analyse the response of resonators to added noise. In one approach, we obtain the Green's function approximately using the first-order averaging method, while in the second approach, exactly, using Floquet theory. We characterize the noise squeezing by calculating the statistical properties of the real and imaginary parts of the Fourier transform of the resonators response to added noise. In a single parametric resonator, due to correlation, the squeezing limit of $-6$~dB can be reached even with detuning at the instability threshold in a single parametrically-driven resonator. We also applied our techniques to investigate squeezing in a dynamical system consisting a parametric resonator linearly coupled to a harmonic resonator. In this system, we were able to observe deep squeezing at around $-40$~dB in one of the quadratures of the harmonic resonator response. We noticed that this occurs near a Hopf bifurcation to parametric instability, which is only possible when the dynamics of the coupled resonators cannot be decomposed into normal modes. Finally, we also showed that our analysis of squeezing based on Floquet theory can be applied to multiple coupled resonators with parametric modulation and multiple noise inputs.</description>
