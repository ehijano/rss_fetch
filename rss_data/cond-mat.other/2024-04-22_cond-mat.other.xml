      <description>arXiv:2404.12392v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Review of the author's data, partly still unpublished, on studying of liquid tellurium and cesium are given. No proofs indicating phase transitions in liquids were found. New developments in studying the liquid-liquid phase transition are briefly described. Some relevant ethical problems are exposed in the bibliography section.</description>

Abstract: Topological quantum materials can exhibit unconventional surface states and anomalous transport properties. Still, their applications in spintronic devices are restricted as they require the growth of high-quality thin films with bulk-like properties. Here, we study 10--30 nm thick epitaxial ferromagnetic Co$_{\rm 2}$MnGa films with high structural order and very high values of the anomalous Hall conductivity, $\sigma_{\rm xy}=1.35\times10^{5}$ $\Omega^{-1} m^{-1}$ and the anomalous Hall angle, $\theta_{\rm H}=15.8\%$, both comparable to bulk values. We observe a dramatic crystalline orientation dependence of the Gilbert damping constant of a factor of two and a giant intrinsic spin Hall conductivity, $\mathit{\sigma_{\rm SHC}}=(6.08\pm 0.02)\times 10^{5}$ ($\hbar/2e$) $\Omega^{-1} m^{-1}$, an order of magnitude higher than literature values of multilayer Co$_{\rm 2}$MnGa stacks [1-3] and single-layer Ni, Co, Fe [4], and Ni$_{\rm 80}$Fe$_{\rm 20}$~[4,5]. As a consequence, spin-orbit-torque driven auto-oscillations of a 30 nm thick magnetic film are observed for the first time, at an ultralow threshold current density of $J_{th}=6.2\times10^{11}$ $Am^{-2}$. Theoretical calculations of the intrinsic spin Hall conductivity, originating from a strong Berry curvature, corroborate the results and yield values comparable to the experiment. Our results open up for the design of spintronic devices based on single layers of magnetic topological quantum materials.</description>

      <title>Theory of Optomechanical Locking in Driven-Dissipative Coupled Polariton Condensates</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.08420</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.08420v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The ubiquitous phenomenon of synchronization is inherently characteristic of dynamical dissipative non-linear systems. In particular, synchronization has been theoretically and experimentally demonstrated for exciton-polariton condensates with time-independent coupling. Unlike that case, we theoretically investigate the effects of a fixed mechanical harmonic driving, i.e., a coherent phonon population, that induces time modulation in the coupling of two coupled condensates. Our model applies both to electrically generated modulation, through coherent bulk acoustic waves, and to self-induced optomechanical vibrations. We consider linear as well as quadratic phonon-displacement-induced modulations of the polariton coupling. Peculiar asynchronously locked phases are found and analyzed in the context of synchronization and Josephson-type oscillations phenomena that appear in the non-driven case. Notably, Arnold tongues corresponding to the asynchronously locked phases emerge at condensate detunings that correspond to integer numbers of the mechanical frequency and also to rational fractions of it. Unlocked quasiperiodic and chaotic regimes can also be reached. In particular, the phonon-induced fractional locking frequencies arrange in a Farey sequence that produces a devil's staircase of the steady-state dressed detuning between the condensates. Importantly, both polariton-polariton and reservoir-polariton interactions facilitate the realization of coherent phonon-induced asynchronously locked phases. The relation to recent experiments on optomechanically driven condensates in arrays of polariton traps is discussed.</description>

      <title>Classical action for the height within the Kardar-Parisi-Zhang (KPZ) equation for surface growth</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.06481</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.06481v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this work we write down a classical (not quantum) action for the surface height for the Kardar-Parisi-Zhang (KPZ) equation for surface growth. We do so starting with the regular Martin-Siggia-Rose (MSR) action (which is quantum - contains the constraint field) and integrate out the quantum constraint field exactly. We analyze the classical action, we thereby obtain, within the gaussian and one loop approximations and find various instabilities to rough surfaces. The gaussian analysis predicts instabilities to rough surfaces below two dimensions while one loop predicts stronger surface stability to roughness and instabilities to roughness below one dimension rather than two dimensions. The one loop analysis shows that the KPZ action is incomplete and that we generate additional terms (not found in the initial action) in the action perturbatively. In the supplement we also modify the KPZ equation for growing surfaces to include the effect of surface tilt on the noise (that is have multiplicatively coupled noise).</description>

      <title>Instability of quadratic band degeneracies and the emergence of Dirac points</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.05886</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.05886v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Consider the Schr\"{o}dinger operator $H = -\Delta + V$, where the potential $V$ is $\mathbb{Z}^2$-periodic and invariant under spatial inversion, complex conjugation, and $\pi/2$ rotation. We show that, under typical small linear deformations of $V$, the quadratic band degeneracy points occurring over the high-symmetry quasimomentum $\boldsymbol{M}$ (see [24, 25]) each split into two separated degeneracies over perturbed quasimomenta $\boldsymbol{D}^+$ and $\boldsymbol{D}^-$, and that these degeneracies are Dirac points. The local character of the degenerate dispersion surfaces about the emergent Dirac points are tilted, elliptical cones. Correspondingly, the dynamics of wavepackets spectrally localized near either $\boldsymbol{D}^+$ or $\boldsymbol{D}^-$ are governed by a system of Dirac equations with an advection term. Generalizations are discussed.</description>
