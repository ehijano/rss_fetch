      <title>Efficient Sampling of Temporal Networks with Preserved Causality Structure</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.09856</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.09856v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we extend the classical Color Refinement algorithm for static networks to temporal (undirected and directed) networks. This enables us to design an algorithm to sample synthetic networks that preserves the $d$-hop neighborhood structure of a given temporal network. The higher $d$ is chosen, the better the temporal neighborhood structure of the original network is preserved. Specifically, we provide efficient algorithms that preserve time-respecting ("causal") paths in the networks up to length $d$, and scale to real-world network sizes. We validate our approach theoretically (for Degree and Katz centrality) and experimentally (for edge persistence, causal triangles, and burstiness). An experimental comparison shows that our method retains these key temporal characteristics more effectively than existing randomization methods.</description>

      <title>Demo: Interactive Visualization of Semantic Relationships in a Biomedical Project's Talent Knowledge Graph</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.09909</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.09909v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present an interactive visualization of the Cell Map for AI Talent Knowledge Graph (CM4AI TKG), a detailed semantic space comprising approximately 28,000 experts and 1,000 datasets focused on the biomedical field. Our tool leverages transformer-based embeddings, WebGL visualization techniques, and generative AI, specifically Large Language Models (LLMs), to provide a responsive and user-friendly interface. This visualization supports the exploration of around 29,000 nodes, assisting users in identifying potential collaborators and dataset users within the health and biomedical research fields. Our solution transcends the limitations of conventional graph visualization tools like Gephi, particularly in handling large-scale interactive graphs. We utilize GPT-4o to furnish detailed justifications for recommended collaborators and dataset users, promoting informed decision-making. Key functionalities include responsive search and exploration, as well as GenAI-driven recommendations, all contributing to a nuanced representation of the convergence between biomedical and AI research landscapes. In addition to benefiting the Bridge2AI and CM4AI communities, this adaptable visualization framework can be extended to other biomedical knowledge graphs, fostering advancements in medical AI and healthcare innovation through improved user interaction and data exploration. The demonstration is available at: https://jiawei-alpha.vercel.app/.</description>

      <title>Sympathy over Polarization: A Computational Discourse Analysis of Social Media Posts about the July 2024 Trump Assassination Attempt</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.09950</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.09950v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: On July 13, 2024, at the Trump rally in Pennsylvania, someone attempted to assassinate Republican Presidential Candidate Donald Trump. This attempt sparked a large-scale discussion on social media. We collected posts from X (formerly known as Twitter) one week before and after the assassination attempt and aimed to model the short-term effects of such a ``shock'' on public opinions and discussion topics. Specifically, our study addresses three key questions: first, we investigate how public sentiment toward Donald Trump shifts over time and across regions (RQ1) and examine whether the assassination attempt itself significantly affects public attitudes, independent of the existing political alignments (RQ2). Finally, we explore the major themes in online conversations before and after the crisis, illustrating how discussion topics evolved in response to this politically charged event (RQ3). By integrating large language model-based sentiment analysis, difference-in-differences modeling, and topic modeling techniques, we find that following the attempt the public response was broadly sympathetic to Trump rather than polarizing, despite baseline ideological and regional disparities.</description>

      <title>Multiplex Nodal Modularity: A novel network metric for the regional analysis of amnestic mild cognitive impairment during a working memory binding task</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.09805</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.09805v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Modularity is a well-established concept for assessing community structures in various single and multi-layer networks, including those in biological and social domains. Biological networks, such as the brain, are known to exhibit group structure at a variety of scales -- local, meso, and global scale. Modularity, while useful in describing mesoscale brain organization, is limited as a metric to a global scale describing the overall strength of community structure. This approach, while valuable, overlooks important localized variations in community structure at the node level. To address this limitation, we extended modularity to individual nodes. This novel measure of nodal modularity ($nQ$) captures both meso and local scale changes in modularity. We hypothesized that $nQ$ illuminates granular changes in the brain due to diseases such as Alzheimer's disease (AD), which are known to disrupt the brain's modular structure. We explored $nQ$ in multiplex networks of a visual short-term memory binding task in fMRI and DTI data in the early stages of AD. Observed changes in $nQ$ in fMRI and DTI networks aligned with known trajectories of AD and were linked to common biomarkers of the disease, including amyloid-$\beta$ and tau. Additionally, $nQ$ clearly differentiated MCI from MCI converters showing indications that $nQ$ may be a useful diagnostic tool for characterizing disease stages. Our findings demonstrate the utility of $nQ$ as a measure of localized group structure, providing novel insights into temporal and disease related variability at the node level. Given the widespread application of modularity as a global measure, $nQ$ represents a significant advancement, providing a granular measure of network organization applicable to a wide range of disciplines.</description>
