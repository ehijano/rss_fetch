      <title>On the injectivity of certain homomorphisms between extensions of $\widehat{\mathcal{G}}^{(\lambda)}$ by $\widehat{\mathbb{G}}_m$ over a $\mathbb{Z}_{(p)}$-algebra</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.11278</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.11278v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $\widehat{\mathcal{G}}^{(\lambda)}$ be a formal group scheme which deforms $\widehat{\mathbb{G}}_a$ to $\widehat{\mathbb{G}}_m$. And let $\psi^{(l)}:\widehat{\mathcal{G}}^{(\lambda)}\rightarrow\widehat{\mathcal{G}}^{(\lambda^{p^l})}$ be the $l$-th Frobenius-type homomorphism determined by $\lambda$. We show that the homomorphism $(\psi^{(l)})^\ast:H^2_0(\widehat{\mathcal{G}}^{(\lambda^{p^l})},\widehat{\mathbb{G}}_m)\rightarrow H^2_0(\widehat{\mathcal{G}}^{(\lambda)},\widehat{\mathbb{G}}_m)$ induced by $\psi^{(l)}$ is injective over a $\mathbb{Z}_{(p)}$-algebra under a suitable restriction on $\lambda$. In this situation, the Cartier dual of $\mathrm{Ker}(\psi^{(l)})$, which is a finite group scheme of order $p^l$, is described over a $\mathbb{Z}/(p^n)$-algebra.</description>

      <title>Hopf algebras in the cohomology of $\mathcal{A}_g$, $\mathrm{GL}_n(\mathbb{Z})$, and $\mathrm{SL}_n(\mathbb{Z})$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.11528</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.11528v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We describe a bigraded cocommutative Hopf algebra structure on the weight zero compactly supported rational cohomology of the moduli space of principally polarized abelian varieties. By relating the primitives for the coproduct to graph cohomology, we deduce that $\dim H^{2g+k}_c(\mathcal{A}_g)$ grows at least exponentially with $g$ for $k = 0$ and for all but finitely many positive integers $k$. Our proof relies on a new result of independent interest; we use a filtered variant of the Waldhausen construction to show that Quillen's spectral sequence abutting to the cohomology of $BK(\mathbb{Z})$ is a spectral sequence of Hopf algebras. From the same construction, we also deduce that $\dim H^{\binom{n}{2} - n - k}(\mathrm{SL}_n(\mathbb{Z}))$ grows at least exponentially with $n$, for $k = -1$ and for all but finitely many non-negative integers $k$.</description>

      <title>Isotrivial elliptic surfaces in positive characteristic</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.11602</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.11602v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study relatively minimal surfaces equipped with an isotrivial elliptic fibration in positive characteristic by means of the notion of equivariantly normal curves introduced and developed recently by Brion. Such surfaces are isomorphic to a contracted product $E\times^G X$, where $E$ is an elliptic curve, $G$ is a finite subgroup scheme of $E$ and $X$ is a $G$-normal curve. Using this description, we compute their Betti numbers to determine their birational classes. This allow us to complete the classification of maximal automorphism groups of surfaces in any characteristic. When $G$ is diagonalizable, we compute additional invariants to study the structure of their Picard schemes.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.11603</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.11603v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We construct and study relations between Chern classes and Galois cohomology classes in the Gal(C/R)-equivariant cohomology of real algebraic varieties with no real points. We give applications to the topology of their sets of complex points, and to sums of squares problems. In particular, we show that -1 is a sum of 2 squares in the function field of any smooth projective real algebraic surface with no real points and with vanishing geometric genus, as well as higher-dimensional generalizations of this result.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.11638v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study cones of pseudoeffective cycles on the blow up of $({\mathbb P}^1)^n$ at points in very general position, proving some results concerning their structure. In particular we show that in some cases they turn out to be generated by exceptional classes and fiber classes relatively to the projections onto a smaller number of copies of projective lines.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.11666v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We find sharp upper bounds on the order of the automorphism group of a hypersurface in complex projective space in every dimension and degree. In each case, we prove that the hypersurface realizing the upper bound is unique up to isomorphism and provide explicit generators for the automorphism group. Similar results were recently proven independently by S. Yang, X. Yu, and Z. Zhu using different methods.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.11860</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.11860v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this article we study the relation between Arinkin's Poincar\'e sheaf on the compactified Jacobian over an integral nodal curve and the classical Poincar\'e bundle on the Jacobian of the normalization. This is applied to derive a formula for the Fourier-Mukai transform of complexes on the compactified Jacobian that come from pushforward along the normalization map. This is achieved via a third intermediate geometry: the parabolic modules introduced by Bhosle and Cook, which enode encode fiber jumps at the nodes.</description>

Abstract: In this paper, we develop a theory of diminished multiplier ideal on singular varieties which notion was introduced by Lehmann, and we prove a result regarding the termination of certain class of flips with scaling of an ample divisor with bounded index if $\kappa_{\sigma}(K_X+\Delta)\ge \dim X-1$ holds using the theory of diminished multiplier ideal.</description>

      <title>Some remarks on smooth projective varieties of small degree and codimension</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.11933</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.11933v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The purpose of this note is twofold. First, we give a quick proof of Ballico-Chiantini's theorem stating that a Fano or Calabi-Yau variety of dimension at least 4 in codimension two is a complete intersection. Second, we improve Barth-Van de Ven's result asserting that if the degree of a smooth projective variety of dimension $n$ is less than approximately $0.63 \cdot n^{1/2}$, then it is a complete intersection. We show that the degree bound can be improved to approximately $0.79 \cdot n^{2/3}$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.11997v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We construct irrational irreducible components of the Hilbert scheme of points of affine n-dimensional space, for n at least 12. We start with irrational components of the Hilbert scheme of curves in P^3 and use methods developed by Jelisiejew to relate these to irreducible components of the Hilbert schemes of points of A^n. The result solves Problem XX of [J. Jelisiejew, Open problems in deformations of Artinian algebras, Hilbert schemes and around, arXiv:2307.08777, 2023].</description>

      <title>Degenerations and Fibrations of K3 Surfaces: Lattice Polarisations and Mirror Symmetry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.12009</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.12009v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Tyurin degenerations of K3 surfaces are degenerations whose central fibre consists of a pair of rational surfaces glued along a smooth elliptic curve. We study the lattice theory of such Tyurin degenerations, establishing a notion of lattice polarisation that is compatible with existing definitions for the general fibre and the rational surfaces comprising the central fibre. We separately consider elliptically fibred K3 surfaces, where the base of the fibration admits a splitting into a pair of discs with specified monodromy around the boundary. In this setting we establish a notion of lattice polarisation for the induced elliptic fibrations over discs, which is compatible with the existing definition for K3 surfaces. Finally, we discuss the mirror symmetric correspondence between these two settings.</description>

      <title>Linear Singer-Hopf conjecture</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.12012</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.12012v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: If $X$ is a closed $2n$-dimensional aspherical manifold, i.e., the universal cover of $X$ is contractible, then the Singer-Hopf conjecture predicts that $(-1)^n\chi(X)\geq 0$. We prove this conjecture when $X$ is a complex projective manifold whose fundamental group admits an almost faithful linear representation over any field. In fact, we prove a much stronger statement that if $X$ is a complex projective manifold with large fundamental group and $\pi_1(X)$ admits an almost faithful linear representation, then $\chi(X, {P})\geq 0$ for any perverse sheaf ${P}$ on $X$.
  To prove the main result, we introduce a vanishing cycle functor of multivalued one-forms. Then using techniques from non-abelian Hodge theories in both archimedean and non-archimedean settings, we deduce the desired positivity from the geometry of pure and mixed period maps.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.12020v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Given a finite group scheme $G$ over a field and a $G$-variety $X$, we obtain a criterion for $X$ to be $G$-normal in the sense of \cite{Br24}. When $G$ is diagonalizable, we describe the local structure of $G$-normal varieties in codimension $1$ and their dualizing sheaf. As an application, we obtain a version of the Hurwitz formula for $G$-normal varieties, where $G$ is linearly reductive.</description>

      <title>Theory of weights for log convergent cohomologies II: the case of a proper SNCL scheme in characteristic $p&gt;0$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.12045</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.12045v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: For a flat $p$-adic formal family $S$ of log points over a complete discrete valuation ring with perfect residue field of mixed characteristics $(0,p)$ and for a simple normal crossing log scheme $X$ over an exact closed log subscheme of $S$ defined by an element of the maximal ideal of the dvr, we construct two fundamental filtered complexes in the convergent topos the underlying scheme of $X$ over the underlying scheme of $S$. We prove that they are canonically isomorphisc. Because one of the complex is shown to calculate the log convergent cohomology sheaf of $X/S$, the filtered complex produces the weight filtration on the log convergent cohomology sheaf if the underlying scheme of $X$ is proper over the underlying scheme of $S$. We give a comparison theorem between the projection of the filtered complex in the Zariski topos of the underlying scheme of $X$ and the isozariskian weight-filtered complex constructed in the author's previous work.</description>

For generic values of the parameters, this family is associated to the $q$-difference sixth Painlev\'e equation. We show that different limiting forms of this family give Segre surfaces that are isomorphic as affine varieties to the the monodromy manifolds of each Painlev\'e differential equation.</description>

      <title>Elliptic Quantum Toroidal Algebras, Z-algebra Structure and Representations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.11177</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.11177v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce a new elliptic quantum toroidal algebra U_{q,\kappa,p}(g_tor) associated with an arbitrary toroidal algebra g_tor. We show that U_{q,\kappa,p}(g_tor) contains two elliptic quantum algebras associated with a corresponding affine Lie algebra bg as subalgebras. They are analogue of the horizontal and the vertical subalgebras in the quantum toroidal algebra U_{q,\kappa}(g_tor). A Hopf algebroid structure is introduced as a co-algebra structure of U_{q,\kappa,p}(g_tor) using the Drinfeld comultiplication. We also investigate the Z-algebra structure of U_{q,\kappa,p}(g_tor) and show that the Z-algebra governs the irreducibility of the level (k(\not=0),l)-infinite dimensional U_{q,\kappa,p}(g_tor)-modules in the same way as in the elliptic quantum group U_{q,p}(g). As an example, we construct the level (1,l) irreducible representation of U_{q,\kappa,p}(g_tor) for the simply laced gtor. We also construct the level (0,1) representation of U_{q,\kappa,p}(g_N,tor) and discuss a conjecture on its geometric interpretation as an action on the torus equivariant elliptic cohomology of the affine A_{N-1} quiver variety.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.11193v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We expose the elliptic quantum groups in the Drinfeld realization associated with both the affine Lie algebra \g and the toroidal algebra \g_tor. There the level-0 and level \not=0 representations appear in a unified way so that one can define the vertex operators as intertwining operators of them. The vertex operators are key for many applications such as a derivation of the elliptic weight functions, integral solutions of the (elliptic) q-KZ equation and a formulation of algebraic analysis of the elliptic solvable lattice models. Identifying the elliptic weight functions with the elliptic stable envelopes we make a correspondence between the level-0 representation of the elliptic quantum group and the equivariant elliptic cohomology. We also emphasize a characterization of the elliptic quantum groups as $q$-deformations of the W-algebras.</description>

      <title>K-theory and lozalizing invariants of large categories</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.12169</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.12169v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper we introduce and study the so-called continuous $K$-theory for a certain class of "large" stable $\infty$-categories, more precisely, for dualizable presentable categories. For compactly generated categories, the continuous $K$-theory is simply the usual (non-connective) $K$-theory of the full subcategory of compact objects. More generally, we show that any localizing invariant of small stable $\infty$-categories can be uniquely extended to a localizing invariant of dualizable categories.
  We compute the continuous $K$-theory for categories of sheaves on locally compact Hausdorff spaces. Using the special case for sheaves on the real line, we give an alternative proof of the theorem of Kasprowski and Winges \cite{KW19} on the commutation of $K$-theory with infinite products for small stable $\infty$-categories.
  We also study the general theory of dualizable categories. In particular, we give an "explicit" proof of Ramzi's theorem \cite{Ram} on $\omega_1$-presentability of the category of dualizable categories. Among other things, we prove that dualizability is equivalent to "flatness" in the category of presentable stable categories.</description>

      <title>The sign of scalar curvature on K\"ahler blowups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.12189</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.12189v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We show that if $(M,\omega)$ is a compact K\"ahler manifold with positive/negative scalar curvature, then the blowup of $M$ at any point also furnishes a positive/negative scalar curvature K\"ahler metric in classes which make the exceptional divisor small. In the case of K\"ahler surfaces with positive scalar curvature, this extends a result of N. Hitchin to surfaces and answers a conjecture of C. LeBrun in the affirmative, as a result completing the classification of such surfaces.</description>

Abstract: We prove that the smallest degree of an apolar 0-dimensional scheme of a general cubic form in $n+1$ variables is at most $2n+2$, when $n\geq 8$, and therefore smaller than the rank of the form. For the general reducible cubic form the smallest degree of an apolar subscheme is $n+2$, while the rank is at least $2n$.</description>

Abstract: We construct a theory of the derived PD-Hirsch extension of the log crystalline complex of a log smooth scheme and we construct a fundamental filtered dga $(H_{{\rm zar},{\rm TW}},P)$ and a fundamental filtered complex $(H_{\rm zar},P)$ for a simple normal crossing log scheme $X$ over a family of log points by using the log crystalline method in order to overcome obstacles arising from the incompatibility of the p-adic Steenbrink complexes in [M] and [Nak4] with the cup product of the log crystalline complex of $X$. When the base log scheme is the log point of a perfect field of characteristic $p&gt;0$, we prove that $(H_{{\rm zar},{\rm TW}},P)$ and $(H_{\rm zar},P)$ is canonically isomorphic to Kim and Hain's filtered dga and their filtered complex in [KH], respectively.</description>

      <title>Crystalline prisms: Reflections and diffractions, present and past</title>

      <description>arXiv:2204.06621v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Let $Y/S$ be a $p$-completely smooth morphism of $p$-torsion free $p$-adic formal schemes endowed with a Frobenius lift, and let $\overline Y/\overline S$ denote its reduction modulo $p$. We show that the category of crystals on the prismatic site of $\overline Y/S$ is equivalent to the category of $O_Y$-modules with integrable and quasi-nilpotent $p$-connection, and that the cohomology of such a crystal is computed by the associated $p$-de Rham complex. More generally, if $X$ is a closed subscheme of $\overline Y$, smooth over $\overline S$, then the prismatic envelope $\Delta_X(Y)$ of $X$ in $Y$ admits such a $p$-connection, the category of prismatic crystals on $X/S$ is equivalent to the category of $O_ {\Delta_X(Y)}$-modules with compatible integrable and quasi-nilpotent $p$-connection, and the cohomology of such a crystal is again computed by its $p$-de Rham complex. We also give a geometric construction of the ``prismatic Sen operator.'' Namely, we show that a lifting of $X$ (mod $p^2$) in $Y$ defines a vector field on the reduction modulo $p$ of $\Delta_X(Y)$ and on a ``diffracted'' Higgs complex which calculates the mod $p$ prismatic and de Rham cohomologies of $X$. Surprisingly, this complex is not the reduction modulo $p$ of the afore-mentioned $p$-de Rham complexbut is rather its ``$\alpha$-transform.'' As a consequence, we get a fairly explicit description of the action of the group scheme $G^\gamma$ on $R\Gamma(X, \Omega^\bullet_{X/S})$, Drinfeld's strengthening of the Deligne-Illusie decomposition theorem. We also explain how earlier work by several authors relating Higgs fields, $p$-connections, and connections can be placed in the prismatic context.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2207.08209v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Every action of a finite group scheme $G$ on a variety admits a projective equivariant model, but not necessarily a normal one. As a remedy, we introduce and explore the notion of $G$-normalization. In particular, every curve equipped with a $G$-action has a unique projective $G$-normal model, characterized by the invertibility of ideal sheaves of all orbits. Also, $G$-normal curves occur naturally in some questions on surfaces in positive characteristics.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2211.13660v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider the moduli space of stable parabolic Higgs bundles of rank $r$ and fixed determinant, and having full flag quasi-parabolic structures over an arbitrary parabolic divisor on a smooth complex projective curve $X$ of genus $g$, with $g\,\geq\, 2$. The group $\Gamma$ of $r$-torsion points of the Jacobian of $X$ acts on this moduli space. We describe the connected components of the various fixed point loci of this moduli under non-trivial elements from $\Gamma$. When the Higgs field is zero, or in other words when we restrict ourselves to the moduli of stable parabolic bundles, we also compute the orbifold Euler characteristic of the corresponding global quotient orbifold. We also describe the Chen--Ruan cohomology groups of this orbifold under certain conditions on the rank and degree, and describe the Chen--Ruan product structure in special cases.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2302.08707v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper we consider curves on a cone that pass through the vertex and are also triple covers of the base of the cone, which is a general smooth curve of genus $\gamma$ and degree $e$ in $\mathbb{P}^{e-\gamma}$. Using the free resolution of the ideal of such a curve found by Catalisano and Gimigliano, and a technique concerning deformations of curves introduced by Ciliberto, we show that the deformations of such curves remain on cones over a deformation of the base curve. This allows us to prove that for $\gamma \geq 3$ and $e \geq 4\gamma + 5$ there exists a non-reduced component $\mathcal{H}$ of the Hilbert scheme of smooth curves of genus $3e + 3\gamma$ and degree $3e+1$ in $\mathbb{P}^{e-\gamma+1}$. We show that $\dim T_{[X]} \mathcal{H} = \dim \mathcal{H} + 1 = (e - \gamma + 1)^2 + 7e + 5$ for a general point $[X] \in \mathcal{H}$.</description>

      <title>The moduli space of cactus flower curves and the virtual cactus group</title>

      <description>arXiv:2308.06880v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The space $ \ft_n = \C^n/\C $ of $n$ points on the line modulo translation has a natural compactification $ \overline \ft_n $ as a matroid Schubert variety. In this space, pairwise distances between points can be infinite; it is natural to imagine points at infinite distance from each other as living on different projective lines. We call such a configuration of points a ``flower curve'', since we picture the projective lines joined into a flower. Within $ \ft_n $, we have the space $ F_n = \C^n \setminus \Delta / \C $ of $ n$ distinct points. We introduce a natural compatification $ \overline F_n $ along with a map $ \overline F_n \rightarrow \overline \ft_n $, whose fibres are products of genus 0 Deligne-Mumford spaces. We show that both $\overline \ft_n$ and $\overline F_n$, are special fibers of $1$-parameter families whose generic fibers are, respectively, Losev-Manin and Deligne-Mumford moduli spaces of stable genus $0$ curves with $n+2$ marked points.
  We find combinatorial models for the real loci $ \overline \ft_n(\BR) $ and $ \overline F_n(\BR) $. Using these models, we prove that these spaces are aspherical and that their equivariant fundamental groups are the virtual symmetric group and the virtual cactus groups, respectively. The degeneration of a twisted real form of the Deligne-Mumford space to $\overline F_n(\mathbb{R})$ gives rise to a natural homomorphism from the affine cactus group to the virtual cactus group.</description>

Abstract: We prove in this paper the smoothability of cycles modulo rational equivalence in the Whitney range, that is, when the dimension is strictly smaller than the codimension. We introduce and study the class of cycles obtained as ``flat pushforwards of Chern classes" (or equivalently, flat pushforwards of products of divisors) and prove that they are smoothable in the Whitney range. Our main result is that all cycles (of any dimension) on a smooth projective variety are flat pushforwards of Chern classes. In the case of abelian varieties, one can even restrict to smooth pushforwards of Chern classes.</description>

      <title>Crepant resolutions of stratified varieties via gluing</title>

      <description>arXiv:2311.07539v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Let $X$ be a variety with a stratification $\mathcal{S}$ into smooth locally closed subvarieties such that $X$ is locally a product along each stratum (e.g., a symplectic singularity). We prove that assigning to each open subset $U \subset X$ the set of isomorphism classes of locally projective crepant resolutions of $U$ defines an $\mathcal{S}$-constructible sheaf of sets. Thus, for each stratum $S$ and basepoint $s \in S$, the fundamental group acts on the set of germs of projective crepant resolutions at $s$, leaving invariant the germs extending to the entire stratum. Global locally projective crepant resolutions correspond to compatible such choices for all strata. For example, if the local projective crepant resolutions are unique, they automatically glue uniquely.
  We give criteria for a locally projective crepant resolution $\rho: \tilde X \to X$ to be globally projective. We show that the sheafification of the presheaf $U \mapsto \operatorname{Pic}(\rho^{-1}(U)/U)$ of relative Picard classes is also constructible. The resolution is globally projective only if there exist local relatively ample bundles whose classes glue to a global section of this sheaf. The obstruction to lifting this section to a global ample line bundle is encoded by a gerbe on the singularity $X$. We show the gerbes are automatically trivial if $X$ is a symplectic quotient singularity.
  Our main results hold in the more general setting of partial crepant resolutions, that need not have smooth source.
  We apply the theory to symmetric powers and Hilbert schemes of surfaces with du Val singularities, finite quotients of tori, multiplicative and Nakajima quiver varieties, as well as to canonical threefold singularities.</description>

Abstract: Let $X\subset \P^5$ be a smooth cubic fourfold. A well known conjecture asserts that $X$ is rational if and only if there an Hodge theoretically associated K3 surface $S$. The surface $S$ can be associated to $X$ in two other different ways. If there is an equivalence of categories $\sA_X \simeq D^b(S,\alpha)$ where $\sA_X$ is the Kuznetsov component of $D^b(X)$ and $\alpha$ is a Brauer class, or if there is an isomorphism between the transcendental motive $t(X)$ and the (twisted ) transcendental motive of a K3 surface$S$. In this note we consider families of cubic fourfolds with a finite group of automorphisms and describe the cases where there is an associated K3 surface in one of the above senses.</description>

Abstract: A conjecture of Hirose, Watanabe, and Yoshida offers a characterization of when a standard graded strongly $F$-regular ring is Gorenstein, in terms of an $F$-pure threshold. We prove this conjecture under the additional hypothesis that the anti-canonical cover of the ring is Noetherian. Moreover, under this hypothesis on the anti-canonical cover, we give a similar criterion for when a normal $F$-pure (resp. log canonical) singularity is quasi-Gorenstein, in terms of an $F$-pure (resp. log canonical) threshold.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2301.10525v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Let $X$ denote the `conifold smoothing', the symplectic Weinstein manifold which is the complement of a smooth conic in $T^*S^3$, or equivalently the plumbing of two copies of $T^*S^3$ along a Hopf link. Let $Y$ denote the `conifold resolution', by which we mean the complement of a smooth divisor in $\mathcal{O}(-1) \oplus \mathcal{O}(-1) \to \mathbb{P}^1$. We prove that the compactly supported symplectic mapping class group of $X$ splits off a copy of an infinite rank free group, in particular is infinitely generated; and we classify spherical objects in the bounded derived category $D(Y)$ (the three-dimensional `affine $A_1$-case'). Our results build on work of Chan-Pomerleano-Ueda and Toda, and both theorems make essential use of working on the `other side' of the mirror.</description>

      <title>A fusion construction of local L-factors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.00913</link>
      <description>arXiv:2303.00913v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We propose a new conjectural way to calculate the local $L$-factor $L=L_\chi(\pi,\rho,s)$ where $\pi$ is a representation of a $p$-adic group $G$, $\rho$ is an algebraic representation of the dual group $G^{\vee}$ and $\chi$ is an algebraic character of $G$ satisfying a positivity condition.
  A method going back to Godement and Jacquet yields a description of $L$ using as an input a certain space ${\mathcal S}_\rho$ of functions on $G$ depending on $\rho$. A (partly conjectural) description of ${\mathcal S}_\rho$ involving trace of Frobenius functions associated to perverse sheaves on the loop space of a semigroup containing $G$ was developed %by Bouthier, Ngo and Sakellaridis, partly based on an earlier work of Braverman and Kazhdan. Here we propose a different, more general conjectural description of ${\mathcal S}_\rho$: it also refers to trace of Frobenius functions but instead of the loop space of a semi-group we work with the ramified global Grassmannian fibering over the configuration space of points on a global curve defined by Beilinson-Drinfeld and Gaitsgory (a relation between two approaches is discussed in the appendix).
  Our main result asserts validity of our conjectures where $\pi$ is generated by an Iwahori fixed vector: we show that in this case it is compatible with the standard formula for $L$ involving local Langlands correspondence which is known for such representations $\pi$.
  The proof is based on properties of the coherent realization of the affine Hecke category.</description>

      <title>Homological mirror symmetry for complete intersections in algebraic tori</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.06955</link>
      <description>arXiv:2303.06955v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We prove one direction of homological mirror symmetry for complete intersections in algebraic tori, in all dimensions. The mirror geometry is not a space but a LG model, i.e. a pair given by a space and a regular function. We show that the Fukaya category of the complete intersection is equivalent to the category of matrix factorizations of the LG pair. Our approach yields new results also in the hypersurface setting, which was treated earlier by Gammage and Shende. Our argument depends on breaking down the complete intersection into smaller more manageable pieces, i.e. finite covers of products of higher dimensional pairs-of-pants, thus implementing a program first suggested by Seidel.</description>

      <title>Superelliptic jacobians and central simple representations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.12022</link>
      <description>arXiv:2305.12022v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Let f(x) be a polynomial of degree at least 5 with complex coefficients and without repeated roots. Let p be an odd prime. Suppose that all the coefficients of f(x) lie in a subfield K such that:
  1) K contains a primitive p-th root of unity;
  2) f(x) is irreducible over K;
  3) the Galois group \Gal(f) of f(x) acts doubly transitively on the set of roots of f(x);
  4) the index of every maximal subgroup of Gal(f) does not divide deg(f)-1.
  Then the endomorphism ring of the Jacobian of the superelliptic curve y^p=f(x) is isomorphic to the pth cyclotomic ring for all primes p&gt;deg(f).</description>

      <title>On real hyperelliptic solutions of focusing modified KdV equation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.04904</link>
      <description>arXiv:2309.04904v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the real hyperelliptic solutions of the focusing modified KdV (MKdV) equation of the genus three. Since the complex hyperelliptic solutions of the focusing MKdV equation over $\mathbb{C}$ are associated with the real gauged MKdV equation, we present a novel construction of the real hyperelliptic solutions of the gauged MKdV equation. When the gauge field is constant, it can be regarded as the real solution of the focusing MKdV equation, and thus we also discuss the behavior of the gauge field numerically.</description>

      <title>Explicit arithmetic Eisenstein cocycles: the toric case</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.00294</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.00294v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We construct cocycles for $GL_n(\mathbb{Q})$ valued in cup products of units on the $n$-dimensional algebraic torus $\mathbb{G}_m^n$ over an arbitrary DVR, viewed in Milnor $K$-theory or motivic cohomology. We show how various combinatorially-defined complexes encoding linear algebraic data capture the structure of these cup products inside motivic complexes, and examine some properties of the resulting classes. This generalizes work of Sharifi and Venkatesh in the case $n=2$, in which case pullbacks of the resulting cocycle to an arithmetic base are of central importance in the Sharifi conjectures.</description>
