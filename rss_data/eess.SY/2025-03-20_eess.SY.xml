      <title>Pervasive Sensing for Livestock Health and Activity Monitoring: Current Methods and Techniques</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.15674</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.15674v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Pervasive sensing is transforming health and activity monitoring by enabling continuous and automated data collection through advanced sensing modalities. While extensive research has been conducted on human subjects, its application in livestock remains underexplored. In large-scale agriculture, real-time monitoring of biological signals and behavioral patterns can facilitate early disease detection, optimize feeding and breeding strategies, and ensure compliance with welfare standards. This survey examines key sensing technologies -- including structural vibration, radio frequency (RF), computer vision, and wearables -- highlighting their benefits and challenges in livestock monitoring. By comparing these approaches, we provide insights into their effectiveness, limitations, and potential for integration into modern smart farming systems. Finally, we discuss research gaps and future directions to advance pervasive sensing in livestock health and activity monitoring.</description>

      <title>Disturbance Observers for Robust Backup Control Barrier Functions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.15734</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.15734v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Designing safe controllers is crucial and notoriously challenging for input-constrained safety-critical control systems. Backup control barrier functions offer an approach for the construction of safe controllers online by considering the flow of the system under a backup controller. However, in the presence of model uncertainties, the flow cannot be accurately computed, making this method insufficient for safety assurance. To tackle this shortcoming, we integrate backup control barrier functions with a disturbance observer and estimate the flow under a reconstruction of the disturbance while refining this estimate over time. We prove that the controllers resulting from the proposed Disturbance Observer Backup Control Barrier Function (DO-bCBF) approach guarantee safety, are robust to unknown disturbances, and satisfy input constraints.</description>

      <title>A Unified Stability Analysis of Safety-Critical Control using Multiple Control Barrier Functions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.15823</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.15823v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Ensuring liveness and safety of autonomous and cyber-physical systems remains a fundamental challenge, particularly when multiple safety constraints are present. This letter advances the theoretical foundations of safety-filter Quadratic Programs (QP) and Control Lyapunov Function (CLF)-Control Barrier Function (CBF) controllers by establishing a unified analytical framework for studying their stability properties. We derive sufficient feasibility conditions for QPs with multiple CBFs and formally characterize the conditions leading to undesirable equilibrium points at possible intersecting safe set boundaries. Additionally, we introduce a stability criterion for equilibrium points, providing a systematic approach to identifying conditions under which they can be destabilized or eliminated. Our analysis extends prior theoretical results, deepening the understanding of the conditions of feasibility and stability of CBF-based safety filters and the CLF-CBF QP framework.</description>

      <title>Privacy-Preserving Utilization of Distribution System Flexibility for Enhanced TSO-DSO Interoperability: A Novel Machine Learning-Based Optimal Power Flow Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.15966</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.15966v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Due to the transformation of the power system, the effective use of flexibility from the distribution system (DS) is becoming crucial for efficient network management. Leveraging this flexibility requires interoperability among stakeholders, including Transmission System Operators (TSOs) and Distribution System Operators (DSOs). However, data privacy concerns among stakeholders present significant challenges for utilizing this flexibility effectively. To address these challenges, we propose a machine learning (ML)-based method in which the technical constraints of the DSs are represented by ML models trained exclusively on non-sensitive data. Using these models, the TSO can solve the optimal power flow (OPF) problem and directly determine the dispatch of flexibility-providing units (FPUs), in our case, distributed generators (DGs), in a single round of communication. To achieve this, we introduce a novel neural network (NN) architecture specifically designed to efficiently represent the feasible region of the DSs, ensuring computational effectiveness. Furthermore, we incorporate various PQ charts rather than idealized ones, demonstrating that the proposed method is adaptable to a wide range of FPU characteristics. To assess the effectiveness of the proposed method, we benchmark it against the standard AC-OPF on multiple DSs with meshed connections and multiple points of common coupling (PCCs) with varying voltage magnitudes. The numerical results indicate that the proposed method achieves performant results while prioritizing data privacy. Additionally, since this method directly determines the dispatch of FPUs, it eliminates the need for an additional disaggregation step. By representing the DSs technical constraints through ML models trained exclusively on non-sensitive data, the transfer of sensitive information between stakeholders is prevented.</description>

      <title>Aging-aware Energy Management for Residential Multi-Carrier Energy Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.16139</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.16139v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the context of building electrification, the operation of distributed energy resources integrating multiple energy carriers (electricity, heat, mobility) poses a significant challenge. Such an operation calls for an energy management system that decides the set points of the primary control layer in the best way possible. This has to fulfill user requirements, minimize costs, and balance local generation with energy storage. Such storage enables building flexibility. This paper presents a novel aging-aware strategy for electrified buildings. The energy management algorithm presented incorporates physics-based battery aging models to enhance the operational performance, making explicit the trade-off between the grid cost and battery degradation. The proposed algorithm can be used to improve grid costs or to protect the batteries (static or electric vehicles). This energy management algorithm can control different cathode chemistries as well as aged and fresh batteries, improving costs with respect to benchmarks for these cases.</description>

      <title>A Unifying Complexity-Certification Framework for Branch-and-Bound Algorithms for Mixed-Integer Linear and Quadratic Programming</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.16235</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.16235v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In model predictive control (MPC) for hybrid systems, solving optimization problems efficiently and with guarantees on worst-case computational complexity is critical, particularly in real-time applications. These optimization problems often take the form of mixed-integer linear programs (MILPs) or mixed-integer quadratic programs (MIQPs) that depend on system parameters. A common approach for solving such problems is the branch-and-bound (B&amp;B) method. This paper extends existing complexity certification methods by presenting a unified complexity-certification framework for B&amp;B-based MILP and MIQP solvers, specifically for the family of multi-parametric MILP and MIQP problems that arise in, e.g., hybrid MPC applications. The framework provides guarantees on worst-case computational measures, including the maximum number of iterations or relaxations B&amp;B algorithms require to reach optimality. It systematically accounts for different branching and node selection strategies, as well as heuristics integrated into B&amp;B, ensuring a comprehensive certification framework. By offering theoretical guarantees and practical insights for solver customization, the proposed framework enhances the reliability of B&amp;B for real-time application. The usefulness of the proposed framework is demonstrated through numerical experiments on both random MILPs and MIQPs, as well as on MIQPs arising from a hybrid MPC problem.</description>

      <title>Evaluation of Torque Ripple and Tooth Forces of a Skewed PMSM by 2D and 3D FE Simulations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.16279</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.16279v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, various skewing configurations for a permanent magnet synchronous machine are evaluated by comparing torque ripple amplitudes and tooth forces. Since high-frequency pure tones emitted by an electrical machine significantly impact a vehicle's noise, vibration, and harshness (NVH) behavior, it is crucial to analyze radial forces. These forces are examined and compared across different skewing configurations and angles using the Maxwell stress tensor in 2D and 3D finite-element (FE) simulations. In addition to conventional investigations in 2D FE simulations, 3D FE simulations are executed. These 3D FE simulations show that axial forces occur at the transition points between the magnetic segments of a linear step skewed rotor.</description>

      <title>Finite Sample Analysis of System Poles for Ho-Kalman Algorithm</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.16331</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.16331v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper investigates the error analysis of system pole estimation in $n$-dimensional discrete-time Linear Time-Invariant systems with $m$ outputs and $p$ inputs, using the classical Ho-Kalman algorithm based on finite input-output sample data. Building upon prior work, we establish end-to-end estimation guarantees for system poles under both single-trajectory and multiple-trajectory settings. Specifically, we prove that, with high probability, the estimation error of system poles decreases at a rate of at least $\mathcal{O}\{T^{-\frac{1}{2n}}\}$ in the single-trajectory case and $\mathcal{O}\{N^{-\frac{1}{2n}}\}$ in the multiple-trajectory case, where $T$ is the length of a single trajectory, and $N$ is the number of trajectories. Furthermore, we reveal that in both settings, achieving a constant estimation accuracy for system poles requires the sample size to grow super-polynomially with respect to the larger of the two ratios, $ \max\{n/m, n/p\} $. Numerical experiments are conducted to validate the non-asymptotic results of system pole estimation.</description>

      <title>Parallel Domain-Decomposition Algorithms for Complexity Certification of Branch-and-Bound Algorithms for Mixed-Integer Linear and Quadratic Programming</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.16411</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.16411v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: When implementing model predictive control (MPC) for hybrid systems with a linear or a quadratic performance measure, a mixed-integer linear program (MILP) or a mixed-integer quadratic program (MIQP) needs to be solved, respectively, at each sampling instant. Recent work has introduced the possibility to certify the computational complexity of branch-and-bound (B&amp;B) algorithms when solving MILP and MIQP problems formulated as multi-parametric MILPs (mp-MILPs) and mp-MIQPs. Such a framework allows for computing the worst-case computational complexity of standard B&amp;B-based MILP and MIQP solvers, quantified by metrics such as the total number of LP/QP iterations and B&amp;B nodes. These results are highly relevant for real-time hybrid MPC applications. In this paper, we extend this framework by developing parallel, domain-decomposition versions of the previously proposed algorithm, allowing it to scale to larger problem sizes and enable the use of high-performance computing (HPC) resources. Furthermore, to reduce peak memory consumption, we introduce two modifications to the existing (serial) complexity certification framework, integrating them into the proposed parallel algorithms. Numerical experiments show that the parallel algorithms significantly reduce computation time while maintaining the correctness of the original framework.</description>

      <title>Performance-bounded Online Ensemble Learning Method Based on Multi-armed bandits and Its Applications in Real-time Safety Assessment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.15581</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.15581v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Ensemble learning plays a crucial role in practical applications of online learning due to its enhanced classification performance and adaptable adjustment mechanisms. However, most weight allocation strategies in ensemble learning are heuristic, making it challenging to theoretically guarantee that the ensemble classifier outperforms its base classifiers. To address this issue, a performance-bounded online ensemble learning method based on multi-armed bandits, named PB-OEL, is proposed in this paper. Specifically, multi-armed bandit with expert advice is incorporated into online ensemble learning, aiming to update the weights of base classifiers and make predictions. A theoretical framework is established to bound the performance of the ensemble classifier relative to base classifiers. By setting expert advice of bandits, the bound exceeds the performance of any base classifier when the length of data stream is sufficiently large. Additionally, performance bounds for scenarios with limited annotations are also derived. Numerous experiments on benchmark datasets and a dataset of real-time safety assessment tasks are conducted. The experimental results validate the theoretical bound to a certain extent and demonstrate that the proposed method outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods.</description>

      <title>Regulation of a continuously monitored quantum harmonic oscillator with inefficient detectors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.15694</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.15694v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the control problem of regulating the purity of a quantum harmonic oscillator in a Gaussian state via weak measurements. Specifically, we assume time-invariant Hamiltonian dynamics and that control is exerted via the back-action induced from monitoring the oscillator's position and momentum observables; the manipulation of the detector measurement strengths regulates the purity of the target Gaussian quantum state. After briefly drawing connections between Gaussian quantum dynamics and stochastic control, we focus on the effect of inefficient detectors and derive closed-form expressions for the transient and steady-state dynamics of the state covariance. We highlight the degradation of attainable purity that is due to inefficient detectors, as compared to that dictated by the Robertson-Schr\"odinger uncertainty relation. Our results suggest that quantum correlations can enhance the purity at steady-state. The quantum harmonic oscillator represents a basic system where analytic formulae may provide insights into the role of inefficient measurements in quantum control; the gained insights are pertinent to measurement-based quantum engines and cooling experiments.</description>

      <title>Prediction of Permissioned Blockchain Performance for Resource Scaling Configurations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.15769</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.15769v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Blockchain is increasingly offered as blockchain-as-a-service (BaaS) by cloud service providers. However, configuring BaaS appropriately for optimal performance and reliability resorts to try-and-error. A key challenge is that BaaS is often perceived as a ``black-box,'' leading to uncertainties in performance and resource provisioning. Previous studies attempted to address this challenge; however, the impacts of both vertical and horizontal scaling remain elusive. To this end, we present machine learning-based models to predict network reliability and throughput based on scaling configurations. In our evaluation, the models exhibit prediction errors of ~1.9%, which is highly accurate and can be applied in the real-world.</description>

      <title>Control Pneumatic Soft Bending Actuator with Online Learning Pneumatic Physical Reservoir Computing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.15819</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.15819v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The intrinsic nonlinearities of soft robots present significant control but simultaneously provide them with rich computational potential. Reservoir computing (RC) has shown effectiveness in online learning systems for controlling nonlinear systems such as soft actuators. Conventional RC can be extended into physical reservoir computing (PRC) by leveraging the nonlinear dynamics of soft actuators for computation. This paper introduces a PRC-based online learning framework to control the motion of a pneumatic soft bending actuator, utilizing another pneumatic soft actuator as the PRC model. Unlike conventional designs requiring two RC models, the proposed control system employs a more compact architecture with a single RC model. Additionally, the framework enables zero-shot online learning, addressing limitations of previous PRC-based control systems reliant on offline training. Simulations and experiments validated the performance of the proposed system. Experimental results indicate that the PRC model achieved superior control performance compared to a linear model, reducing the root-mean-square error (RMSE) by an average of over 37% in bending motion control tasks. The proposed PRC-based online learning control framework provides a novel approach for harnessing physical systems' inherent nonlinearities to enhance the control of soft actuators.</description>

      <title>Development of a Magnetorheological Hand Exoskeleton Featuring High Force-to-power Ratio for Enhancing Grip Endurance</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.15915</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.15915v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Hand exoskeletons have significant potential in labor-intensive fields by mitigating hand grip fatigue, enhancing hand strength, and preventing injuries.However, most traditional hand exoskeletons are driven by motors whose output force is limited under constrained installation conditions. In addition, they also come with the disadvantages of high power consumption, complex and bulky assistive systems, and high instability.In this work, we develop a novel hand exoskeleton integrated with magnetorheological (MR) clutches that offers a high force-to-power ratio to improve grip endurance. The clutch features an enhanced structure design, a micro roller enhancing structure, which can significantly boost output forces. The experimental data demonstrate that the clutch can deliver a peak holding force of 380 N with a consumption of 1.48 W, yielding a force-to-power ratio of 256.75N/W, which is 2.35 times higher than the best reported actuator used for hand exoskeletons. The designed MR hand exoskeleton is highly integrated and comprises an exoskeleton frame, MR clutches, a control unit, and a battery. Evaluations through static grip endurance tests and dynamic carrying and lifting tests confirm that the MR hand exoskeleton can effectively reduce muscle fatigue, extend grip endurance, and minimize injuries. These findings highlight its strong potential for practical applications in repetitive tasks such as carrying and lifting in industrial settings.</description>

Abstract: In the rapidly evolving landscape of digital assets and blockchain technologies, the necessity for robust, scalable, and secure data management platforms has never been more critical. This paper introduces a novel software architecture designed to meet these demands by leveraging the inherent strengths of cloud-native technologies and modular micro-service based architectures, to facilitate efficient data management, storage and access, across different stakeholders. We detail the architectural design, including its components and interactions, and discuss how it addresses common challenges in managing blockchain data and digital assets, such as scalability, data siloing, and security vulnerabilities. We demonstrate the capabilities of the platform by employing it into multiple real-life scenarios, namely providing data in near real-time to scientists in help with their research. Our results indicate that the proposed architecture not only enhances the efficiency and scalability of distributed data management but also opens new avenues for innovation in the research reproducibility area. This work lays the groundwork for future research and development in machine learning operations systems, offering a scalable and secure framework for the burgeoning digital economy.</description>

      <title>Control Lyapunov Function Design via Configuration-Constrained Polyhedral Computing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.16076</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.16076v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper proposes novel approaches for designing control Lyapunov functions (CLFs) for constrained linear systems. We leverage recent configuration-constrained polyhedral computing techniques to devise piecewise affine convex CLFs. Additionally, we generalize these methods to uncertain systems with both additive and multiplicative disturbances. The proposed design methods are capable of approximating the infinite horizon cost function of both nominal and min-max optimal control problems by solving a single, one-stage, convex optimization problem. As such, these methods find practical applications in explicit controller design as well as in determining terminal regions and cost functions for nominal and min-max model predictive control (MPC). Numerical examples illustrate the effectiveness of this approach.</description>

      <title>Learn to Bid as a Price-Maker Wind Power Producer</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.16107</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.16107v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Wind power producers (WPPs) participating in short-term power markets face significant imbalance costs due to their non-dispatchable and variable production. While some WPPs have a large enough market share to influence prices with their bidding decisions, existing optimal bidding methods rarely account for this aspect. Price-maker approaches typically model bidding as a bilevel optimization problem, but these methods require complex market models, estimating other participants' actions, and are computationally demanding. To address these challenges, we propose an online learning algorithm that leverages contextual information to optimize WPP bids in the price-maker setting. We formulate the strategic bidding problem as a contextual multi-armed bandit, ensuring provable regret minimization. The algorithm's performance is evaluated against various benchmark strategies using a numerical simulation of the German day-ahead and real-time markets.</description>

      <title>Flight Testing an Optionally Piloted Aircraft: a Case Study on Trust Dynamics in Human-Autonomy Teaming</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.16227</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.16227v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper examines how trust is formed, maintained, or diminished over time in the context of human-autonomy teaming with an optionally piloted aircraft. Whereas traditional factor-based trust models offer a static representation of human confidence in technology, here we discuss how variations in the underlying factors lead to variations in trust, trust thresholds, and human behaviours. Over 200 hours of flight test data collected over a multi-year test campaign from 2021 to 2023 were reviewed. The dispositional-situational-learned, process-performance-purpose, and IMPACTS homeostasis trust models are applied to illuminate trust trends during nominal autonomous flight operations. The results offer promising directions for future studies on trust dynamics and design-for-trust in human-autonomy teaming.</description>

      <title>Worst-Case Services and State-Based Scheduling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2108.06062</link>
      <description>arXiv:2108.06062v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we shed new light on a classical scheduling problem: given a slot-timed, constant-capacity server, what short-run scheduling decisions must be made to provide long-run service guarantees to competing flows of unit-sized tasks? We model each flow's long-run guarantee as a worst-case service that maps each queued arrival vector recording the flow's cumulative task arrivals, including those initially queued, to a worst-case acceptable departure vector lower-bounding its cumulative served tasks. We show that these maps are states that can be updated as tasks arrive and are served, introduce state-based scheduling, find the schedulability condition necessary and sufficient to maintain all flows' long-run guarantees, and use this condition to identify all short-run scheduling decisions that preserve schedulability. Our framework is general but computationally complex. To reduce complexity, we consider three specializations. First, we show that when satisfactory short-run scheduling decisions exist, at least one can be efficiently identified by maximizing the server's capacity slack, a generalization of the earliest-deadline-first rule. Second, we show that a special class of worst-case services, min-plus services, can be efficiently specified and updated using properties of the min-plus algebra. Finally, we show that efficiency can be further improved by restricting attention to a min-plus service subclass, dual-curve services. This last specialization turns out to be a dynamic extension of service curves that maintains all essential features of our framework while approaching near practical viability.</description>

      <title>On the Stability of Undesirable Equilibria in the Quadratic Program Framework for Safety-Critical Control</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.08027</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.08027v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Control Lyapunov functions (CLFs) and Control Barrier Functions (CBFs) have been used to develop provably safe controllers by means of quadratic programs (QPs). This framework guarantees safety in the form of trajectory invariance with respect to a given set, but it can introduce undesirable equilibrium points to the closed loop system, which can be asymptotically stable. In this work, we present a detailed study of the formation and stability of equilibrium points with the CLF-CBF-QP framework with multiple CBFs. In particular, we prove that undesirable equilibrium points occur for most systems, and their stability is dependent on the CLF and CBF geometrical properties. We introduce the concept of CLF-CBF compatibility for a system, regarding a CLF-CBF pair inducing no stable equilibrium points other than the CLF global minimum on the corresponding closed-loop dynamics. Sufficient conditions for CLF-CBF compatibility for LTI and drift-less full-rank systems with quadratic CLF and CBFs are derived, and we propose a novel control strategy to induce smooth changes in the CLF geometry at certain regions of the state space in order to satisfy the CLF-CBF compatibility conditions, aiming to achieve safety with respect to multiple safety objectives and quasi-global convergence of the trajectories towards the CLF minimum. Numeric simulations illustrate the applicability of the proposed method.</description>

      <title>Intelligent Agricultural Greenhouse Control System Based on Internet of Things and Machine Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.09488</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.09488v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This study endeavors to conceptualize and execute a sophisticated agricultural greenhouse control system grounded in the amalgamation of the Internet of Things (IoT) and machine learning. Through meticulous monitoring of intrinsic environmental parameters within the greenhouse and the integration of machine learning algorithms, the conditions within the greenhouse are aptly modulated. The envisaged outcome is an enhancement in crop growth efficiency and yield, accompanied by a reduction in resource wastage. In the backdrop of escalating global population figures and the escalating exigencies of climate change, agriculture confronts unprecedented challenges. Conventional agricultural paradigms have proven inadequate in addressing the imperatives of food safety and production efficiency. Against this backdrop, greenhouse agriculture emerges as a viable solution, proffering a controlled milieu for crop cultivation to augment yields, refine quality, and diminish reliance on natural resources [b1]. Nevertheless, greenhouse agriculture contends with a gamut of challenges. Traditional greenhouse management strategies, often grounded in experiential knowledge and predefined rules, lack targeted personalized regulation, thereby resulting in resource inefficiencies. The exigencies of real-time monitoring and precise control of the greenhouse's internal environment gain paramount importance with the burgeoning scale of agriculture. To redress this challenge, the study introduces IoT technology and machine learning algorithms into greenhouse agriculture, aspiring to institute an intelligent agricultural greenhouse control system conducive to augmenting the efficiency and sustainability of agricultural production.</description>

      <title>Toward Neuronal Implementations of Delayed Optimal Control</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.02555v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Animal sensorimotor behavior is frequently modeled using optimal controllers. However, it is unclear how the neural circuits within the animal's nervous system implement optimal controller-like behavior. In this work, we study the question of implementing a delayed linear quadratic regulator with linear dynamical "neurons" on a muscle model. We show that for any second-order controller, there are three minimal neural circuit configurations that implement the same controller. Furthermore, the firing rate characteristics of each circuit can vary drastically, even as the overall controller behavior is preserved. Along the way, we introduce concepts that bridge controller realizations to neural implementations that are compatible with known neuronal delay structures.</description>

      <title>Human Balancing on a Log: A Switched Multi-Layer Controller</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.02957</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.02957v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the task of balancing a human on a log that is fixed in place. Balancing on a log is substantially more challenging than balancing on a flat surface due to increased instability -- nonetheless, we are able to balance by composing simple (e.g., PID, LQR) controllers in a bio-inspired switched multi-layer configuration. The controller consists of an upper-layer LQR planner (akin to the central nervous system) that coordinates ankle and hip torques, and lower-layer PID trackers (akin to local motor units) that follow this plan subject to nonlinear dynamics. The controller switches between three operational modes depending on the state of the human. The efficacy of the controller is verified in simulation, where our controller is able to stabilize the human for a variety of initial conditions and disturbances. We also introduce a controller that outputs muscle activations to perform the same balancing task.</description>

      <title>Privacy Preserving Mechanisms for Coordinating Airspace Usage in Advanced Air Mobility</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.03582</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.03582v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Advanced Air Mobility (AAM) operations are expected to transform air transportation while challenging current air traffic management practices. By introducing a novel market-based mechanism, we address the problem of on-demand allocation of capacity-constrained airspace to AAM vehicles with heterogeneous and private valuations. We model airspace and air infrastructure as a collection of contiguous regions with constraints on the number of vehicles that simultaneously enter, stay, or exit each region. Vehicles request access to the airspace with trajectories spanning multiple regions at different times. We use the graph structure of our airspace model to formulate the allocation problem as a path allocation problem on a time-extended graph. To ensure the cost information of AAM vehicles remains private, we introduce a novel mechanism that allocates each vehicle a budget of "air-credits" and anonymously charges prices for traversing the edges of the time-extended graph. We seek to compute a competitive equilibrium that ensures that: (i) capacity constraints are satisfied, (ii) a strictly positive resource price implies that the sector capacity is fully utilized, and (iii) the allocation is integral and optimal for each AAM vehicle given current prices, without requiring access to individual vehicle utilities. However, a competitive equilibrium with integral allocations may not always exist. We provide sufficient conditions for the existence and computation of a fractional-competitive equilibrium, where allocations can be fractional. Building on these theoretical insights, we propose a distributed, iterative, two-step algorithm that: 1) computes a fractional competitive equilibrium, and 2) derives an integral allocation from this equilibrium. We validate the effectiveness of our approach in allocating trajectories for two emerging urban air mobility services: drone delivery and air taxis.</description>

      <title>Robust Safety Critical Control Under Multiple State and Input Constraints: Volume Control Barrier Function Method</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.13996</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.13996v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, the safety-critical control problem for uncertain systems under multiple control barrier function (CBF) constraints and input constraints is investigated. A novel framework is proposed to generate a safety filter that minimizes changes to reference inputs when safety risks arise, ensuring a balance between safety and performance. A nonlinear disturbance observer (DOB) based on the robust integral of the sign of the error (RISE) is used to estimate system uncertainties, ensuring that the estimation error converges to zero exponentially. This error bound is integrated into the safety-critical controller to reduce conservativeness while ensuring safety. To further address the challenges arising from multiple CBF and input constraints, a novel Volume CBF (VCBF) is proposed by analyzing the feasible space of the quadratic programming (QP) problem. % ensuring solution feasibility by keeping the volume as a positive value. To ensure that the feasible space does not vanish under disturbances, a DOB-VCBF-based method is introduced, ensuring system safety while maintaining the feasibility of the resulting QP. Subsequently, several groups of simulation and experimental results are provided to validate the effectiveness of the proposed controller.</description>

      <title>Stochastic LQR Design With Disturbance Preview</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.06662</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.06662v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper considers the discrete-time, stochastic LQR problem with $p$ steps of disturbance preview information where $p$ is finite. We first derive the solution for this problem on a finite horizon with linear, time-varying dynamics and time-varying costs. Next, we derive the solution on the infinite horizon with linear, time-invariant dynamics and time-invariant costs. Our proofs rely on the well-known principle of optimality. We provide an independent proof for the principle of optimality that relies only on nested information structure. Finally, we show that the finite preview controller converges to the optimal noncausal controller as the preview horizon $p$ tends to infinity. We also provide a simple example to illustrate both the finite and infinite horizon results.</description>
