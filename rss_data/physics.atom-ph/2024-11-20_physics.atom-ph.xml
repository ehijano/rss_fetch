      <title>Studies of parity violation in atoms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.11861</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.11861v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Studies of the effects of the weak interaction in atomic systems provide tests of the Standard Model of particle physics, and explore physics scenarios beyond the Standard Model. In addition, these studies can offer valuable insights into low-energy nuclear physics. We provide an overview of the field of atomic parity violation, and discuss implications to nuclear and particle physics, and ongoing experimental efforts. Furthermore, we present our plans for precision measurements of the signatures of the weak interaction in atomic ytterbium.</description>

      <title>Pulsed Dual-axis Alkali-metal-noble-gas Comagnetometer</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.12125</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.12125v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Alkali-metal-noble-gas comagnetometers are precision probes well-suited for tests of fundamental physics and inertial rotation sensing, combining high sensitivity of the spin-exchange-relaxation free (SERF) magnetometers with inherent suppression of magnetic field noise. Past versions of the device utilizing continuous-wave optical pumping are sensitive to a single axis perpendicular to the plane spanned by the orthogonal pump and probe laser beams. These devices are susceptible to light shifts in the alkali atoms, and to power and beam pointing fluctuations of both the probe and pump lasers, the latter of which is a dominant source of $1/f$ noise. In this work, we model and implement a new approach to alkali-metal-noble-gas comagnetometers using pulsed optical pumping. After each pump laser pulse, an off-resonance probe beam measures the precession of noble-gas-spins-coupled alkali spins via optical rotation in the dark, thus eliminating effects from pump laser light shift and power fluctuations. Performing non-linear fitting on the sinusoidal transient signal with a proper phase enables separate and simultaneous measurement of signals along two orthogonal axes in the plane perpendicular to the pump beam. Effects from beam pointing fluctuations of the probe beam in the pump-probe plane is fundamentally eliminated, and signal response to pump beam pointing fluctuations is suppressed by compensation from noble-gas nuclear spins.</description>

      <title>Highly stable modular-assembled laser system for a dual-atom-interferometer gyroscope</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.12218</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.12218v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Operating atom-interferometer gyroscopes outside a laboratory environment is challenging primarily owing to the instability of laser systems. To enhance the thermal stability of free-space laser systems, a compact laser system using fiber lasers and all-quartz-jointed optical modules was developed for a dual-atom-interferometer gyroscope. Millimeter-scale optical elements jointed on quartz plates with identical quartz supports, ensure laser power stability and facilitate component upgrades. The primary diode laser was locked to the modulation transfer spectrum of Rb atoms, and Raman lasers were phase-locked to the primary laser. Frequencies for repumping, blow-away, and detection lasers were adjusted with acousto-optic modulators. At room temperature, laser power fluctuation was under 1:1000, polarization extinction ratio exceeded 30 dB, frequency fluctuation was below 91 kHz, and phase noise reached to -100 dBc/Hz @ 1 kHz. The optical modules were tested at 5--50 $^{\circ}$C and applied to a dual-atom-interferometer gyroscope. The fringe contrast was tested over the temperature range. The proposed system paves the way for promoting field applications of atom-interferometer sensors.</description>

      <title>Two-loop electron self-energy for low nuclear charges</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.12459</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.12459v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Calculations of the two-loop electron self-energy for the $1S$ Lamb shift are reported, performed to all orders in the nuclear binding strength parameter $Z\alpha$ (where $Z$ is the nuclear charge number and $\alpha$ is the fine structure constant). Our approach allows calculations to be extended to nuclear charges lower than previously possible and improves the numerical accuracy by more than an order of magnitude. Extrapolation of our all-order results to hydrogen yields a result twice as precise as the previously accepted value [E. Tiesinga et al. Rev. Mod. Phys. 93, 025010 (2021)], differing from it by 2.8 standard deviations. The resulting shift in the theoretical prediction for the $1S$-$2S$ transition frequency in hydrogen decreases the value of the Rydberg constant by one standard deviation.</description>

      <title>High-fidelity entanglement of metastable trapped-ion qubits with integrated erasure conversion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.12727</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.12727v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present metastable qubits in trapped ions as potential erasure qubits for which most fundamental algorithm errors can be converted into erasures. We first implement an erasure conversion scheme which enables us to detect $\sim$94% of spontaneous Raman scattering errors and nearly all errors from qubit decay. Second, we perform a two-ion geometric phase gate with a SPAM-corrected fidelity of 98.56% using far-detuned (-43 THz) Raman beams. Subtracting runs where erasures were detected, this fidelity becomes 99.14%. We present a pathway for improved gate efficiency and reduced overhead from erasure conversion.</description>

      <title>Cavity-enabled real-time observation of individual atomic collisions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.12622v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Using the strong dispersive coupling to a high-cooperativity cavity, we demonstrate fast and non-destructive number-resolved detection of atoms in optical tweezers. We observe individual atom-atom collisions, quantum state jumps, and atom loss events with a time resolution of $100\ \mu$s through continuous measurement of cavity transmission. Using adaptive feedback control in combination with the non-destructive measurements, we further prepare a single atom with $92(2)\%$ probability.</description>

      <title>Benchmarking and fidelity response theory of high-fidelity Rydberg entangling gates</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.20184</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.20184v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The fidelity of entangling operations is a key figure of merit in quantum information processing, especially in the context of quantum error correction. High-fidelity entangling gates in neutral atoms have seen remarkable advancement recently. A full understanding of error sources and their respective contributions to gate infidelity will enable the prediction of fundamental limits on quantum gates in neutral atom platforms with realistic experimental constraints. In this work, we implement the time-optimal Rydberg CZ gate, design a circuit to benchmark its fidelity, and achieve a fidelity, averaged over symmetric input states, of 0.9971(5), downward-corrected for leakage error, which together with our recent work forms a new state-of-the-art for neutral atoms. The remaining infidelity is explained by an ab initio error model, consistent with our experimental results over a range of gate speeds, with varying contributions from different error sources. Further, we develop a fidelity response theory to efficiently predict infidelity from laser noise with non-trivial power spectral densities and derive scaling laws of infidelity with gate speed. Besides its capability of predicting gate fidelity, we also utilize the fidelity response theory to compare and optimize gate protocols, to learn laser frequency noise, and to study the noise response for quantum simulation tasks. Finally, we predict that a CZ gate fidelity of ${\gtrsim} 0.999$ is feasible with realistic experimental upgrades.</description>

      <title>Capturing Nonlinear Electron Dynamics with Fully Characterised Attosecond X-ray Pulses</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.03858</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.03858v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Attosecond X-ray pulses are the key to studying electron dynamics at their natural timescale in specifically targeted electronic states. They promise to build the conceptual bridge between physical and chemical photo-reaction processes. Free-electron lasers (FELs) have demonstrated their capability of generating intense attosecond X-ray pulses. The use of SASE-based FELs for time-resolving experiments and investigations of nonlinear X-ray absorption mechanisms, however, necessitates their full pulse-to-pulse characterisation which remains a cutting-edge challenge. We have characterised X-ray pulses with durations of down to 600 attoseconds and peak powers up to 200 GW at ~1 keV photon energy via angular streaking at the Small Quantum Systems instrument of the European XFEL in Germany. As a direct application, we present results of nonlinear X-ray--matter interaction via time-resolved electron spectroscopy on a transient system, observing single- and double-core-hole generation in neon atoms. Using the derived temporal information about each single X-ray pulse, we reveal an otherwise hidden peak-intensity dependence of the probability for formation of double-core vacancies in neon after primary K-shell ionisation. Our results advance the field of attosecond science with highly intense and fully characterised X-ray pulses to the state-specific investigation of electronic motion in non-stationary media.</description>

      <title>Logical computation demonstrated with a neutral atom quantum processor</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.11822</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.11822v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Transitioning from quantum computation on physical qubits to quantum computation on encoded, logical qubits can improve the error rate of operations, and will be essential for realizing valuable quantum computational advantages. Using a neutral atom quantum processor with 256 qubits, each an individual Ytterbium atom, we demonstrate the entanglement of 24 logical qubits using the distance-two [[4,2,2]] code, simultaneously detecting errors and correcting for lost qubits. We also implement the Bernstein-Vazirani algorithm with up to 28 logical qubits encoded in the [[4,1,2]] code, showing better-than-physical error rates. We demonstrate fault-tolerant quantum computation in our approach, guided by the proposal of Gottesman (2016), by performing repeated loss correction for both structured and random circuits encoded in the [[4,2,2]] code. Finally, since distance-two codes can correct qubit loss, but not other errors, we show repeated loss and error correction using the distance-three [[9,1,3]] Bacon-Shor code. These results begin to clear a path for achieving scientific quantum advantage with a programmable neutral atom quantum processor.</description>
