      <title>AgenticAD: A Specialized Multiagent System Framework for Holistic Alzheimer Disease Management</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.08578</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.08578v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Alzheimer's disease (AD) presents a complex, multifaceted challenge to patients, caregivers, and the healthcare system, necessitating integrated and dynamic support solutions. While artificial intelligence (AI) offers promising avenues for intervention, current applications are often siloed, addressing singular aspects of the disease such as diagnostics or caregiver support without systemic integration. This paper proposes a novel methodological framework for a comprehensive, multi-agent system (MAS) designed for holistic Alzheimer's disease management. The objective is to detail the architecture of a collaborative ecosystem of specialized AI agents, each engineered to address a distinct challenge in the AD care continuum, from caregiver support and multimodal data analysis to automated research and clinical data interpretation. The proposed framework is composed of eight specialized, interoperable agents. These agents are categorized by function: (1) Caregiver and Patient Support, (2) Data Analysis and Research, and (3) Advanced Multimodal Workflows. The methodology details the technical architecture of each agent, leveraging a suite of advanced technologies including large language models (LLMs) such as GPT-4o and Gemini, multi-agent orchestration frameworks, Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) for evidence-grounded responses, and specialized tools for web scraping, multimodal data processing, and in-memory database querying. This paper presents a detailed architectural blueprint for an integrated AI ecosystem for AD care. By moving beyond single-purpose tools to a collaborative, multi-agent paradigm, this framework establishes a foundation for developing more adaptive, personalized, and proactive solutions. This methodological approach aims to pave the way for future systems capable of synthesizing diverse data streams to improve patient outcomes and reduce caregiver burden.</description>

      <title>GRPO-GCC: Enhancing Cooperation in Spatial Public Goods Games via Group Relative Policy Optimization with Global Cooperation Constraint</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.08607</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.08607v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Inspired by the principle of self-regulating cooperation in collective institutions, we propose the Group Relative Policy Optimization with Global Cooperation Constraint (GRPO-GCC) framework. This work is the first to introduce GRPO into spatial public goods games, establishing a new deep reinforcement learning baseline for structured populations. GRPO-GCC integrates group relative policy optimization with a global cooperation constraint that strengthens incentives at intermediate cooperation levels while weakening them at extremes. This mechanism aligns local decision making with sustainable collective outcomes and prevents collapse into either universal defection or unconditional cooperation. The framework advances beyond existing approaches by combining group-normalized advantage estimation, a reference-anchored KL penalty, and a global incentive term that dynamically adjusts cooperative payoffs. As a result, it achieves accelerated cooperation onset, stabilized policy adaptation, and long-term sustainability. GRPO-GCC demonstrates how a simple yet global signal can reshape incentives toward resilient cooperation, and provides a new paradigm for multi-agent reinforcement learning in socio-technical systems.</description>

      <title>Scalable Multi-Agent Path Finding using Collision-Aware Dynamic Alert Mask and a Hybrid Execution Strategy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.09469</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.09469v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Multi-agent pathfinding (MAPF) remains a critical problem in robotics and autonomous systems, where agents must navigate shared spaces efficiently while avoiding conflicts. Traditional centralized algorithms that have global information, such as Conflict-Based Search (CBS), provide high-quality solutions but become computationally expensive in large-scale scenarios due to the combinatorial explosion of conflicts that need resolution. Conversely, distributed approaches that have local information, particularly learning-based methods, offer better scalability by operating with relaxed information availability, yet often at the cost of solution quality. To address these limitations, we propose a hybrid framework that combines decentralized path planning with a lightweight centralized coordinator. Our framework leverages reinforcement learning (RL) for decentralized planning, enabling agents to adapt their planning based on minimal, targeted alerts--such as static conflict-cell flags or brief conflict tracks--that are dynamically shared information from the central coordinator for effective conflict resolution. We empirically study the effect of the information available to an agent on its planning performance. Our approach reduces the inter-agent information sharing compared to fully centralized and distributed methods, while still consistently finding feasible, collision-free solutions--even in large-scale scenarios having higher agent counts.</description>

      <title>Mnemosyne: An Unsupervised, Human-Inspired Long-Term Memory Architecture for Edge-Based LLMs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.08601</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.08601v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Long-term memory is essential for natural, realistic dialogue. However, current large language model (LLM) memory systems rely on either brute-force context expansion or static retrieval pipelines that fail on edge-constrained devices. We introduce Mnemosyne, an unsupervised, human-inspired long-term memory architecture designed for edge-based LLMs. Our approach uses graph-structured storage, modular substance and redundancy filters, memory committing and pruning mechanisms, and probabilistic recall with temporal decay and refresh processes modeled after human memory. Mnemosyne also introduces a concentrated "core summary" efficiently derived from a fixed-length subset of the memory graph to capture the user's personality and other domain-specific long-term details such as, using healthcare application as an example, post-recovery ambitions and attitude towards care. Unlike existing retrieval-augmented methods, Mnemosyne is designed for use in longitudinal healthcare assistants, where repetitive and semantically similar but temporally distinct conversations are limited by naive retrieval. In experiments with longitudinal healthcare dialogues, Mnemosyne demonstrates the highest win rate of 65.8% in blind human evaluations of realism and long-term memory capability compared to a baseline RAG win rate of 31.1%. Mnemosyne also achieves current highest LoCoMo benchmark scores in temporal reasoning and single-hop retrieval compared to other same-backboned techniques. Further, the average overall score of 54.6% was second highest across all methods, beating commonly used Mem0 and OpenAI baselines among others. This demonstrates that improved factual recall, enhanced temporal reasoning, and much more natural user-facing responses can be feasible with an edge-compatible and easily transferable unsupervised memory architecture.</description>

      <title>What Is Your Agent's GPA? A Framework for Evaluating Agent Goal-Plan-Action Alignment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.08847</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.08847v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce the Agent GPA (Goal-Plan-Action) framework: an evaluation paradigm based on an agent's operational loop of setting goals, devising plans, and executing actions. The framework includes five evaluation metrics: Goal Fulfillment, Logical Consistency, Execution Efficiency, Plan Quality, and Plan Adherence. Logical Consistency checks that an agent's actions are consistent with its prior actions. Execution Efficiency checks whether the agent executes in the most efficient way to achieve its goal. Plan Quality checks whether an agent's plans are aligned with its goals; Plan Adherence checks if an agent's actions are aligned with its plan; and Goal Fulfillment checks that agent's final outcomes match the stated goals. Our experimental results on two benchmark datasets - the public TRAIL/GAIA dataset and an internal dataset for a production-grade data agent - show that this framework (a) provides a systematic way to cover a broad range of agent failures, including all agent errors on the TRAIL/GAIA benchmark dataset; (b) supports LLM-judges that exhibit strong agreement with human annotation, covering 80% to over 95% errors; and (c) localizes errors with 86% agreement to enable targeted improvement of agent performance.</description>

      <title>GTAlign: Game-Theoretic Alignment of LLM Assistants for Mutual Welfare</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.08872</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.08872v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have achieved remarkable progress in reasoning, yet sometimes produce responses that are suboptimal for users in tasks such as writing, information seeking, or providing practical guidance. Conventional alignment practices typically assume that maximizing model reward also maximizes user welfare, but this assumption frequently fails in practice: models may over-clarify or generate overly verbose reasoning when users prefer concise answers. Such behaviors resemble the prisoner's dilemma, where individually rational choices lead to socially suboptimal outcomes. The fundamental challenge is the lack of a principled decision making mechanism that mutually benefits both the LLM and the user. We propose Game-Theoretic Alignment (GTAlign), an alignment framework that integrates game-theoretic decision making into both reasoning and training. During reasoning, the model explicitly treats user-LLM interaction as a strategic game: it constructs payoff matrices within its reasoning chain to estimate welfare for both itself and the user, and then selects actions that are mutually beneficial. During training, we introduce a mutual welfare reward that reinforces cooperative responses, aligning model behavior with socially efficient outcomes. In addition, we introduce an inference technique that leverages game-theoretic reasoning to dynamically adapt LLM's response when pricing policies of LLM service change. Extensive experiments demonstrate that GTAlign substantially improves reasoning efficiency, answer quality, and mutual welfare compared to baselines across diverse tasks.

      <title>Decentralized Multi-Robot Relative Navigation in Unknown, Structurally Constrained Environments under Limited Communication</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.09188</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.09188v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Multi-robot navigation in unknown, structurally constrained, and GPS-denied environments presents a fundamental trade-off between global strategic foresight and local tactical agility, particularly under limited communication. Centralized methods achieve global optimality but suffer from high communication overhead, while distributed methods are efficient but lack the broader awareness to avoid deadlocks and topological traps. To address this, we propose a fully decentralized, hierarchical relative navigation framework that achieves both strategic foresight and tactical agility without a unified coordinate system. At the strategic layer, robots build and exchange lightweight topological maps upon opportunistic encounters. This process fosters an emergent global awareness, enabling the planning of efficient, trap-avoiding routes at an abstract level. This high-level plan then inspires the tactical layer, which operates on local metric information. Here, a sampling-based escape point strategy resolves dense spatio-temporal conflicts by generating dynamically feasible trajectories in real time, concurrently satisfying tight environmental and kinodynamic constraints. Extensive simulations and real-world experiments demonstrate that our system significantly outperforms in success rate and efficiency, especially in communication-limited environments with complex topological structures.</description>

      <title>Identifying &amp; Interactively Refining Ambiguous User Goals for Data Visualization Code Generation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.09390</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.09390v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Establishing shared goals is a fundamental step in human-AI communication. However, ambiguities can lead to outputs that seem correct but fail to reflect the speaker's intent. In this paper, we explore this issue with a focus on the data visualization domain, where ambiguities in natural language impact the generation of code that visualizes data. The availability of multiple views on the contextual (e.g., the intended plot and the code rendering the plot) allows for a unique and comprehensive analysis of diverse ambiguity types. We develop a taxonomy of types of ambiguity that arise in this task and propose metrics to quantify them. Using Matplotlib problems from the DS-1000 dataset, we demonstrate that our ambiguity metrics better correlate with human annotations than uncertainty baselines. Our work also explores how multi-turn dialogue can reduce ambiguity, therefore, improve code accuracy by better matching user goals. We evaluate three pragmatic models to inform our dialogue strategies: Gricean Cooperativity, Discourse Representation Theory, and Questions under Discussion. A simulated user study reveals how pragmatic dialogues reduce ambiguity and enhance code accuracy, highlighting the value of multi-turn exchanges in code generation.</description>

      <title>Anemoi: A Semi-Centralized Multi-agent System Based on Agent-to-Agent Communication MCP server from Coral Protocol</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.17068</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.17068v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Recent advances in generalist multi-agent systems (MAS) have largely followed a context-engineering plus centralized paradigm, where a planner agent coordinates multiple worker agents through unidirectional prompt passing. While effective under strong planner models, this design suffers from two critical limitations: (1) strong dependency on the planner's capability, which leads to degraded performance when a smaller LLM powers the planner; and (2) limited inter-agent communication, where collaboration relies on prompt concatenation rather than genuine refinement through structured discussions. To address these challenges, we propose Anemoi, a semi-centralized MAS built on the Agent-to-Agent (A2A) communication MCP server from Coral Protocol. Unlike traditional designs, Anemoi enables structured and direct inter-agent collaboration, allowing all agents to monitor progress, assess results, identify bottlenecks, and propose refinements in real time. This paradigm reduces reliance on a single planner, supports adaptive plan updates, and minimizes redundant context passing, resulting in more scalable execution. Evaluated on the GAIA benchmark, Anemoi achieved 52.73% accuracy with a small LLM (GPT-4.1-mini) as the planner, surpassing the strongest open-source baseline OWL (43.63%) by +9.09% under identical LLM settings. Our implementation is publicly available at https://github.com/Coral-Protocol/Anemoi.</description>

      <title>DDO: Dual-Decision Optimization for LLM-Based Medical Consultation via Multi-Agent Collaboration</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.18630</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.18630v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) demonstrate strong generalization and reasoning abilities, making them well-suited for complex decision-making tasks such as medical consultation (MC). However, existing LLM-based methods often fail to capture the dual nature of MC, which entails two distinct sub-tasks: symptom inquiry, a sequential decision-making process, and disease diagnosis, a classification problem. This mismatch often results in ineffective symptom inquiry and unreliable disease diagnosis. To address this, we propose \textbf{DDO}, a novel LLM-based framework that performs \textbf{D}ual-\textbf{D}ecision \textbf{O}ptimization by decoupling the two sub-tasks and optimizing them with distinct objectives through a collaborative multi-agent workflow. Experiments on three real-world MC datasets show that DDO consistently outperforms existing LLM-based approaches and achieves competitive performance with state-of-the-art generation-based methods, demonstrating its effectiveness in the MC task. The code is available at https://github.com/zh-jia/DDO.</description>

      <title>Aegis: Automated Error Generation and Attribution for Multi-Agent Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.14295</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.14295v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Large language model based multi-agent systems (MAS) have unlocked significant advancements in tackling complex problems, but their increasing capability introduces a structural fragility that makes them difficult to debug. A key obstacle to improving their reliability is the severe scarcity of large-scale, diverse datasets for error attribution, as existing resources rely on costly and unscalable manual annotation. To address this bottleneck, we introduce Aegis, a novel framework for Automated error generation and attribution for multi-agent systems. Aegis constructs a large dataset of 9,533 trajectories with annotated faulty agents and error modes, covering diverse MAS architectures and task domains. This is achieved using a LLM-based manipulator that can adaptively inject context-aware errors into successful execution trajectories. Leveraging fine-grained labels and the structured arrangement of positive-negative sample pairs, Aegis supports three different learning paradigms: Supervised Fine-Tuning, Reinforcement Learning, and Contrastive Learning. We develop learning methods for each paradigm. Comprehensive experiments show that trained models consistently achieve substantial improvements in error attribution. Notably, several of our fine-tuned LLMs demonstrate performance competitive with or superior to proprietary models an order of magnitude larger, validating our automated data generation framework as a crucial resource for developing more robust and interpretable multi-agent systems.

      <title>Reimagining Agent-based Modeling with Large Language Model Agents via Shachi</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.21862</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.21862v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The study of emergent behaviors in large language model (LLM)-driven multi-agent systems is a critical research challenge, yet progress is limited by a lack of principled methodologies for controlled experimentation. To address this, we introduce Shachi, a formal methodology and modular framework that decomposes an agent's policy into core cognitive components: Configuration for intrinsic traits, Memory for contextual persistence, and Tools for expanded capabilities, all orchestrated by an LLM reasoning engine. This principled architecture moves beyond brittle, ad-hoc agent designs and enables the systematic analysis of how specific architectural choices influence collective behavior. We validate our methodology on a comprehensive 10-task benchmark and demonstrate its power through novel scientific inquiries. Critically, we establish the external validity of our approach by modeling a real-world U.S. tariff shock, showing that agent behaviors align with observed market reactions only when their cognitive architecture is appropriately configured with memory and tools. Our work provides a rigorous, open-source foundation for building and evaluating LLM agents, aimed at fostering more cumulative and scientifically grounded research.</description>

      <title>CLARITY: Clinical Assistant for Routing, Inference, and Triage</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.02463</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.02463v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present CLARITY (Clinical Assistant for Routing, Inference and Triage), an AI-driven platform designed to facilitate patient-to-specialist routing, clinical consultations, and severity assessment of patient conditions. Its hybrid architecture combines a Finite State Machine (FSM) for structured dialogue flows with collaborative agents that employ Large Language Model (LLM) to analyze symptoms and prioritize referrals to appropriate specialists. Built on a modular microservices framework, CLARITY ensures safe, efficient, and robust performance, flexible and readily scalable to meet the demands of existing workflows and IT solutions in healthcare. We report integration of our clinical assistant into a large-scale national interhospital platform, with more than 55,000 content-rich user dialogues completed within the two months of deployment, 2,500 of which were expert-annotated for subsequent validation. The validation results show that CLARITY surpasses human-level performance in terms of the first-attempt routing precision, naturally requiring up to 3 times shorter duration of the consultation than with a human.</description>
