      <title>A Constructor-Theoretic and Quantum Information Approach to the Three-Step Photoemission Model: A Theoretical Investigation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.17458</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.17458v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A novel theoretical reformulation of the conventional three-step photoemission model is presented by integrating the conceptual frameworks of constructor theory and quantum information theory. Each step of the photoemission process photon absorption, electron transport, and electron emission is formalized as a physical task (in the constructor-theoretic sense) and modeled by a quantum channel with an explicit operator-level description. This dual framework not only recovers the standard efficiency factorization n = A T D but also reveals new insights into the preservation of coherence and the interdependence of successive tasks. Furthermore, potential experimental setups and conditions under which the predicted phenomena could be observed are discussed. The motivation of this work is to pave the path for improved implementations of the current photoemission model and to contribute toward the realization of a universal constructor for quantum computation.</description>

      <title>Physics-guided hierarchical neural networks for Maxwell's equations in plasmonic metamaterials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.17644</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.17644v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: While machine learning (ML) has found multiple applications in photonics, traditional "black box" ML models typically require prohibitively large training datasets. Generation of such data, as well as the training processes themselves, consume significant resources, often limiting practical applications of ML. Here we demonstrate that embedding Maxwell's equations into ML design and training significantly reduces the required amount of data and improves the physics-consistency and generalizability of ML models, opening the road to practical ML tools that do not need extremely large training sets. The proposed physics-guided machine learning (PGML) is illustrated on the example of predicting complex field distributions within hyperbolic metamaterial-based photonic funnels. The hierarchical network design used in the study points to the emergence of effective medium theories within neural networks.</description>

      <title>Hybridization of Non-Hermitian Topological Interface Modes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.17649</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.17649v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose and experimentally demonstrate the hybridization of radiating topological interface states, analogous to Jackiw-Rebbi states but in gain media with radiation fields. This hybridization not only modifies energy levels under a strong coupling scheme but also significantly reshapes far-field radiation characteristics. The bonding mode exhibits sub-radiant, omnidirectional emission, while the antibonding mode becomes super-radiant and highly unidirectional. Crucially, this non-Hermitian hybridization is tunable, allowing simultaneous control of energy splitting, quality factor, and far-field radiation by varying the distance between the two topological interfaces. Our findings establish hybridized radiating topological interface states as a robust platform for engineering two-level systems with tailored far-field responses, offering new possibilities for applications in beam shaping, nonlinear optics, quantum technologies, and beyond.</description>

      <title>Three-dimensional Meta-atoms for High Confinement of Mid-IR Radiation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.17654</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.17654v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The ability to confine photons into structures with highly sub-wavelength volumes is extremely interesting for many applications such as sensing, nonlinear optics, and strong light-matter interactions. However, their realization is increasingly difficult as the wavelength becomes shorter, due to fabrication challenges and increased metal losses. In this work, we present the first experimental characterization of three-dimensional circuit-like resonators operating in the mid-infrared. Through a combination of simulations, reflectivity measurements, and scanning near-field optical microscopy, we developed an analytical model capable of predicting the electromagnetic response of these structures based on their geometrical parameters. The design we studied offers a high degree of flexibility, enabling precise control over the resonant frequency of the various modes supported by the resonator, as well as independent control over radiative and non-radiative losses. Combined with the extreme field confinement demonstrated, these meta-atoms are highly promising for applications in detectors,</description>

      <title>High-Q, size-independent, and reconfigurable optical antennas via zero-index material dispersion engineering</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.17656v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Enhancing light-matter interactions at the nanoscale is foundational to nanophotonics, with epsilon near zero (ENZ) materials demonstrating significant potential.High-quality (Q) factor resonances maximizing these interactions are typically realized in photonic crystals requiring sub-50 nm precision nanofabrication over large areas, limiting scalability and increasing complexity. Mie resonances offer an alternative but are constrained by low Q factors due to the scarcity of high refractive index materials, necessitating large refractive index changes for effective resonance switching and limiting dynamic reconfigurability. We overcome these limitations by embedding Mie resonators within ENZ media, thereby enhancing Q- factors, mitigating geometric dispersion and fabrication challenges, and maximizing optical reconfigurability. We introduce three resonator-ENZ configurations - voids in AlN, Ge in $SiO_2$, and intrinsic InSb in doped InSb - spanning from low-loss phononic to lossy plasmonic ENZ modes.Using novel epitaxial regrowth techniques, we achieve significant Q-factor improvements over non-embedded resonators. Notably, an air-based Mie resonator embedded in AlN supports resonant Q-factors exceeding 100, with negligible geometric dispersion across sizes from 800 nm to 2,800 nm. Additionally, we demonstrate dynamic reconfigurability of intrinsic InSb resonators by thermally tuning the ENZ wavelength over a 2$\mu$m range in the mid-infrared (11-16 $\mu$m) wavelength regime. These results showcase the potential of Mie resonators embedded in ENZ media for high-fidelity sensors, thermal emitters, and reconfigurable metasurfaces, bridging theoretical predictions with practical applications, advancing the development of dynamic, high-Q optical devices.</description>

      <title>Leveraging resonant frequencies of an optical cavity for spectroscopic measurement of gas temperature and concentration</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.17660</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.17660v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce a spectroscopic approach to primary gas thermometry, harnessing precise optical cavity resonance frequencies and ab initio molecular line intensity calculations. By utilizing CO (3-0) vibrational band lines and cavity mode dispersion spectroscopy, we achieve an uncertainty of 82 ppm (24 mK at 296 K) in line-intensity-ratio thermometry (LRT) - over an order of magnitude lower than any previously reported spectroscopic thermometry at gas pressures above 1.2 kPa. This method extends high-precision spectroscopic thermometry across a pressure range an order of magnitude larger than prior techniques, enabling a fully optical, non-contact, and molecule-selective primary amount-of-substance measurement. We further demonstrate sub-permille uncertainty in gas concentration measurements across pressures from 50 Pa to 20 kPa, significantly enhancing the precision and versatility of spectroscopic gas metrology.</description>

      <title>High-Efficiency Multilevel Phase Lenses with Nanostructures on Polyimide Membranes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.17889</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.17889v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The emergence of planar meta-lenses on flexible materials has profoundly impacted the long-standing perception of diffractive optics. Despite their advantages, these lenses still face challenges in design and fabrication to obtain high focusing efficiency and resolving power. A nanofabrication technique is demonstrated based on photolithography and polyimide casting for realizing membrane-based multilevel phase-type Fresnel zone plates (FZPs) with high focusing efficiency. By employing advantageous techniques, these lenses with nanostructures are directly patterned into thin polyimide membranes. The computational and experimental results have indicated that the focusing efficiency of these nanostructures at the primary focus increases significantly with increasing the number of phase levels. Specifically, 16-level phase lenses on a polyimide membrane can achieve a focusing efficiency of more than 91.6% of the input signal (9.5 times better than that of a conventional amplitude-type FZP) and focus light into a diffraction-limited spot together with very weak side-lobes. Furthermore, these lenses exhibit considerably reduced unwanted diffraction orders and produce extremely low background signals. The potential impact of these lenses extends across various applications and techniques including microscopy, imaging, micro-diffraction, remote sensing, and space flight instruments which require lightweight and flexible configurations.</description>

      <title>Confocal structured illumination microscopy for super-resolution imaging: theory and numerical simulations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.17904</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.17904v2 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Super-resolution structured illumination microscopy (SR-SIM) is a widely used technique for enhancing the resolution of fluorescence imaging beyond the diffraction limit. Most existing SR-SIM methods rely on Moir\'e effect-based physical imaging models, which require the estimation of structured illumination parameters during image reconstruction. However, parameter estimation is prone to errors, often leading to artifacts in the reconstructed images. To address these limitations, we propose super-resolution confocal structured illumination microscopy (SR-CSIM). The physical model of SR-CSIM is based on confocal imaging principles, eliminating the need for structured illumination parameter estimation. We construct the SR-CSIM imaging theory. Numerical simulation results demonstrate that SR-CSIM achieves a resolution comparable to that of SR-SIM while reducing artifacts. This advancement has the potential to broaden the applicability of SIM, providing researchers with a more robust and versatile imaging tool.</description>

      <title>Ultimate Sensitivity in X-ray Diffraction: Angular Moments vs. Shot Noise</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.17977</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.17977v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The sensitivity of x-ray diffraction experiments towards Bragg peak parameters constitutes a crucial performance attribute of experimental setups. Frequently, diffraction peaks are characterized by model-free angular moment analysis, which offers a greater versatility compared to traditional model-based peak fitting. Here, we have determined the ultimate sensitivity of angular moments for diffraction data that is limited by photon shot noise. We report experimentally achieved sensitivities of the first moment below $1/1000$th of a detector pixel and below $1\mu$rad. We have demonstrated the validity of our theoretical predictions by an excellent agreement with experimental results from three different setups. The provided formulas for the uncertainties of angular moments allow for the rapid determination of experimentally achieved sensitivities from single diffraction frames.</description>

      <title>Investigation of Tunable Structured Light Using Bilayer Parity-Time Symmetry Dammann Grating Metasurfaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.18039</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.18039v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the current technological landscape, structured light technology holds a critically important position. However, traditional structured light optical components often require complex systems and extensive resources for application, and they function in a fixed manner. This study takes this challenge as an opportunity to design a novel dynamically tunable double-layer Dammann grating (DG) metasurface. During the research, we developed a double-layer DG metasurface structure using silica as the substrate and lithium niobate (LiNbO3, LN) as the nanocolumn material. By specifically introducing parity-time (PT) symmetry, we designed three distinct states, combined with rotational transformations leveraging the Moir\'e effect. Further investigations revealed that for metasurfaces with different radius combinations, changes in rotation and PT symmetry states resulted in significant variations in the shape, position, and intensity of the diffraction spots, alongside changes in conversion efficiency and contrast ratio. This study thoroughly and comprehensively unveils the significant impacts of rotational transformations, PT symmetry, and radius combination on the optical characteristics of double-layer DG metasurfaces, providing a new method for the design of dynamic tunable optical components with structured light.</description>

      <title>Quasi-normal modes empowered coherent control of electromagnetic interactions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.18134</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.18134v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quasi-normal modes (QNMs) and coherent control of light-matter interactions (through synchronized multiple coherent incident waves) are profound and pervasive concepts in and beyond photonics, making accessible photonic manipulations with extreme precision and efficiency. Though each has been playing essential roles in its own, these two sweeping concepts remain largely segregated with little interactions, blocking vast opportunities of cross-fertilization to explore. Here we unify both concepts into a novel framework of coherent control for light interacting with open photonic systems. From the QNM perspective, scattered waves are superimposed radiations from all QNMs excited, and thus coherent controls can be mapped into another problem of QNM excitation manipulations. Within our framework, all incident properties (amplitudes, phases and polarizations) of waves from different directions can be exploited simultaneously in a synchronous manner, facilitating independent manipulations of each QNM and thus unlocking enormous flexibilities for coherent controls of both scattering intensity and polarization: (i) A visible structure under a single incident wave can be made invisible through shining extra waves; (ii) Along a direction where QNMs' radiation polarizations are identical, scattering along this direction can be fully eliminated, thus generalizing Kerker effects from a distinct QNM perspective; (iii) Along a direction of distinct QNM radiation polarizations, arbitrary scattering polarizations can be obtained. Given the ubiquity and profundity of QNMs and coherent control in almost all branches of wave physics, our framework and its underlying principles will inspire further fundamental explorations and practical applications beyond photonics, opening new opportunities for various forms of wave-matter interactions.</description>

      <title>Quantum Imaging of Photonic Spin Texture in an OAM Beam with NV Centers in Diamond</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.18400</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.18400v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Photonic spin texture (PST), the spatial distribution of the spin angular momentum (SAM) of light, is connected to unique properties of light, such as optical skyrmions and topological optical N-invariants. There has been recent progress on the generation and manipulation of PST using various methodologies. However, a challenge remains for the sub-wavelength characterization of PST. Here, we demonstrate nitrogen-vacancy (NV) centers in diamond as nanoscale quantum sensors for imaging the PST of a beam with orbital angular momentum (OAM). Leveraging the coherent interaction between photon spin and NV center electron spin at cryogenic temperature (77 K), and using the Hahn-Echo magnetometry technique, we experimentally demonstrate the imprinting of the PST on the quantum phase of NV centers. Our work can lead to the development of a quantum imaging platform capable of characterization of the spin texture of light at sub-wavelength scales.</description>

      <title>Quadratic solitons in higher-order topological insulators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.18432</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.18432v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: I consider higher-order topological insulator (HOTI) created in chi(2) nonlinear medium and based on two-dimensional generalization of the Su-Schrieffer-Heeger waveguide array, where transition between trivial and topological phases is achieved by shift of the four waveguides in the unit cell towards its center or towards its periphery. Such HOTI can support linear topological corner states that give rise to rich families of quadratic topological solitons bifurcating from linear corner states. The presence of phase mismatch between parametrically interacting fundamental-frequency (FF) and second-harmonic (SH) waves drastically affects the bifurcation scenarios and domains of soliton existence, making the families of corner solitons much richer in comparison with those in HOTIs with cubic nonlinearity. For instance, the internal soliton structure strongly depends on the location of propagation constant in forbidden gaps in spectra of both FF and SH waves. Two different types of corner solitons are obtained, where either FF or SH wave dominates in the bifurcation point from linear corner state. Because the waveguides are two-mode for SH wave, its spectrum features two groups of forbidden gaps with corner states of different symmetry appearing in each of them. Such corner states give rise to different families of corner solitons. Stability analysis shows that corner solitons in quadratic HOTI may feature wide stability domains and therefore are observable experimentally. These results illustrate how parametric nonlinear interactions enrich the behavior of topological excitations and allow to control their shapes.</description>

      <title>Resonant Energy Transfer and Collectively Driven Emitters in Waveguide QED</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.17662</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.17662v2 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Waveguide quantum electrodynamics (QED) has opened a new frontier in quantum optics, which enables the radiative coupling of distantly located emitters via the spatially extended waveguide mode. This coupling leads to modified emission dynamics and previous work has reported the observation of increased intensity correlations (an antidip) when probing the resonance response of multiple emitters. However, the interference between independent emitters has been shown to lead to a similar response. Here, we directly observe resonant energy transfer between two distant quantum emitters by recording an antidip in the intensity correlations, $g^{(2)}(\tau)$, while driving only one of the emitters. Under the condition that only a single emitter is driven, the antidip in photon coincidences is a distinctive signature of emitter-emitter coupling, which enables the transfer of energy from the driven to the undriven emitter. Interestingly, the observed mechanism is a long-range and waveguide-engineered version of resonant F\"orster transfer, which is responsible for the transport of energy between chlorophylls in the photosynthesis. Building on the established coupling, we demonstrate collective driving of the coupled emitter pair. Specifically, we control the relative driving phase and amplitude of the emitters and apply this collective excitation scheme to selectively populate the long-lived subradiant state. This results in suppressed emission, i.e. the peculiar situation where driving two emitters as opposed to one effectively reduces the probability of photon emission. Our work presents novel emission regimes and excitation schemes for a multi-emitter waveguide QED system. These can be exploited to deterministically generate emitter-emitter entanglement and advanced photonic states providing robustness against losses for photonic quantum computation and quantum communication.</description>

      <title>Quantum neural compressive sensing for ghost imaging</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.17790</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.17790v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Demonstrating the utility of quantum algorithms is a long-standing challenge, where quantum machine learning becomes one of the most promising candidate that can be resorted to. In this study, we investigate a quantum neural compressive sensing algorithm for ghost imaging to showcase its utility. The algorithm utilizes the variational quantum circuits to reparameterize the inverse problem of ghost imaging and uses the inductive bias of the physical forward model to perform optimization. To validate the algorithm's effectiveness, we conduct optical ghost imaging experiments, capturing signals from objects at different physical sampling rates and detection signal-to-noise ratios. The experimental results show that our proposed algorithm surpasses conventional methods in both visual appearance and quantitative metrics, achieving state-of-the-art performance. Importantly, we observe that the quantum neural network, guided by prior knowledge of physics, effectively overcomes the challenge of barren plateau in the optimization process. The proposed algorithm demonstrates robustness against various quantum noise levels, making it suitable for near-term quantum devices. Our study leverages physical inductive bias guided variational quantum algorithm, underscoring the potential of quantum computation in tackling a broad range of optimization and inverse problems.</description>

      <title>Interactions of fractional solitons with local defects: Stabilization and scattering</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.17819</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.17819v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Stability is an essential problem in theoretical and experimental studies of solitons in nonlinear media with fractional diffraction, which is represented by the Riesz derivative with Levy index (LI) taking values LI &lt; 2. Fractional solitons are unstable at LI smaller or equal to 1, or LI smaller or equal to 2 in uniform one-dimensional media with the cubic or quintic self-focusing, respectively. We demonstrate that, in these cases, the solitons may be effectively stabilized by pinning to a delta-functional trapping potential (attractive defect), which is a relevant setting in optical waveguides with the effective fractional diffraction. Using the respective fractional nonlinear Schroedinger equation with the delta-functional potential term, we find that, in the case of the cubic self-focusing, the fractional solitons are fully stabilized by the pinning to the defect for LI = 1, and partly stabilized for LI &lt; 1. In the case of the quintic self-focusing, the full and partial stabilization are found for LI = 2 and LI &lt; 2, respectively. In both cases, the instability boundary is exactly predicted by the Vakhitov-Kolokolov criterion. Unstable solitons spontaneously transform into oscillating breathers. A variational approximation (VA) is elaborated parallel to the numerical analysis, with a conclusion that the VA produces accurate results for lower LI values, i.e., stronger fractionality. In the cubic medium, collisions of traveling stable solitons with repulsive and attractive defects are addressed too, demonstrating outcomes in the form of rebound, splitting, and passage.</description>

      <title>Photonic Lightsails: Fast and Stable Propulsion for Interstellar Travel</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.17828</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.17828v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Lightsails are a highly promising spacecraft concept that has attracted interest in recent years due to its potential to travel at near-relativistic speeds. Such speeds, which current conventional crafts cannot reach, offer tantalizing opportunities to probe nearby stellar systems within a human lifetime. Recent advancements in photonics and metamaterials have created novel solutions to challenges in propulsion and stability facing lightsail missions. This review introduces the physical principles underpinning lightsail spacecrafts and discusses how photonics coupled with inverse design substantially enhance lightsail performance compared to plain reflectors. These developments pave the way through a previously inaccessible frontier of space exploration.</description>

      <title>Experimentally separating vacuum fluctuations from source radiation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.18208</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.18208v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The unique distinction between vacuum-field and source-radiation induced effects in processes such as the Lamb shift, Casimir forces or spontaneous emission, remains unresolved even at the theoretical level, and an experimental approach was never considered feasible [1-4]. In 1932, Fermi introduced the two-atom problem, which is a Gedanken-experiment that explores how two atoms interact with the surrounding electromagnetic field via vacuum and source-radiation induced processes, providing fundamental insights into the behavior of quantum fields [5-9]. Recent advancements in ultrafast optics have enabled experimental analogues of this system using two laser pulses inside a nonlinear crystal [10-12]. Here, we demonstrate the detection of vacuum and source radiation induced correlations, separated by their causal properties, between two laser pulses. In particular, we show that vacuum fluctuations and source radiation correlate different quadratures of near-infrared laser pulses, allowing them to be individually probed through phase-sensitive detection. This result provides an experimental verification of the time-domain fluctuation-dissipation theorem at the quantum level and offers a novel path to studying quantum radiation effects in time-dependent media. Beyond resolving a longstanding theoretical ambiguity, our findings open new possibilities for investigating quantum field phenomena in the context of relativistic quantum information such as entanglement harvesting from the quantum vacuum or quantum field detection in analogues of curved space-times.</description>

      <title>A novel spectroscopic probe of ultrafast magnetization dynamics in the extreme ultraviolet spectral range</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.18312</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.18312v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The development of spectroscopic techniques in the extreme ultraviolet (XUV) spectral range has significantly advanced the understanding of ultrafast interactions in magnetic systems triggered by optical excitation. In this work, we introduce a previously missing geometry that facilitates the observation of the ultrafast magnetization dynamics of magnetic systems with an out-of-plane magnetization grown on XUV opaque substrates. This novel approach to probe ultrafast magnetization dynamics combines the magneto-optical Kerr effect with the strong dependence of a sample's reflectance near its Brewster angle. It therefore works with linearly polarized light and does not require any additional polarizing optics. We provide a comprehensive analysis of the technique by presenting both simulations and experimental data as a function of the energy and the polarization of the XUV probe radiation as well as of the delay time after optical excitation.</description>

      <title>Distributed acoustic sensing for ocean applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.18344</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.18344v2 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Extensive monitoring of acoustic activities is important for many fields, including biology, security, oceanography, and Earth science. Distributed acoustic sensing (DAS) is an evolving technique for continuous, wide-coverage measurements of mechanical vibrations, which is suited to ocean applications. DAS illuminates an optical fiber with laser pulses and measures the backscattered wave due to small random variations in the refractive index of the material. Specifically, DAS uses coherent optical interferometry to measure the phase difference of the backscattered wave from adjacent locations along the fiber. External stimuli, such as mechanical strain due to acoustic wavefields impinging on the fiber-optic cable, modulate the backscattered wave. Hence, the differential phase measurements of the optical backscatter are proportional to the underlying physical quantities of the surrounding wavefield. Continuous measurement of the backscattered electromagnetic signal provides a distributed sensing modality that extends spatially along the fiber. We provide an overview of DAS technology and detail the underlying physics, from electromagnetic to mechanical and eventually acoustic quantities. We explain the effect of DAS acquisition parameters in signal processing and show the potential of DAS for sound source detection on data collected from the Ocean Observatories Initiative Regional Cabled Array https://doi.org/10.58046/5J60-FJ89.</description>

      <title>Broadband surface phonon spectroscopy by time-domain extreme ultraviolet diffuse scattering</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.18445</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.18445v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present experimental evidence that the dynamics of surface acoustic waves, with wavelengths ranging from tens to hundreds of nanometers, are encoded in the time-dependent diffuse scattering of extreme ultraviolet light. By measuring the diffuse scattering from a surface after an ultrafast optical excitation, we determined the dispersion relation of surface acoustic wave-packets across a broad range of wavevectors in various samples. The comparison of the signal amplitudes from samples with different surface morphologies suggests that the underlying excitation mechanism is related to the natural roughness of the samples surface. This simple and contactless approach represents a complementary experimental tool to transient grating or Brillouin spectroscopy, providing valuable insights into nanoscale surface dynamics.</description>

      <title>Engineering high Pockels coefficients in thin-film strontium titanate for cryogenic quantum electro-optic applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.14349</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.14349v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Materials which exhibit the Pockels effect are notable for their strong electro-optic interaction and rapid response times and are therefore used extensively in classical electro-optic components for data and telecommunication applications. Yet many materials optimized for room-temperature operation see their Pockels coefficients at cryogenic temperatures significantly reduced - a major hurdle for emerging quantum technologies which have even more rigorous demands than their classical counterpart. A noted example is $\mathrm{BaTiO_3}$, which features the strongest effective Pockels coefficient at room temperature, only to see it reduced to a third (i.e. $\mathrm{r_{eff}} \approx$ 170 pm/V) at a few Kelvin. Here, we show that this behaviour is not inherent and can even be reversed: Strontium titanate ($\mathrm{SrTiO_3}$), a material normally not featuring a Pockels coefficient, can be engineered to exhibit an $\mathrm{r_{eff}}$ of 345 pm/V at cryogenic temperatures - a record value in any thin-film electro-optic material. By adjusting the stoichiometry, we can increase the Curie temperature and realise a ferroelectric phase that yields a high Pockels coefficient, yet with limited optical losses - on the order of decibels per centimetre. Our findings position $\mathrm{SrTiO_3}$ as one of the most promising materials for cryogenic quantum photonics applications.</description>

      <title>Four no-go theorems on the existence of spin and orbital angular momentum of massless bosons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.06276</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.06276v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The past decades have seen substantial interest in the so-called orbital angular momentum (OAM) of light, driven largely by its diverse range of applications. However, there are fundamental theoretical issues with decomposing the angular momentum of massless particles, such as photons, into spin (SAM) and orbital angular momentum parts. While the angular momentum of massive particles has a natural splitting into the Wigner SAM and OAM, there are numerous proposed splittings for photons and no consensus about which is correct. Moreover, it has been shown that most of the proposed SAM and OAM operators do not satisfy the defining commutation relations of angular momentum operators and are thus not legitimate splittings. Here, we prove that it is generally impossible to split the total angular momentum operator of massless bosons, such as photons and gravitons, into spin and orbital parts. We prove two further generalizations of this result, showing that there are no SAM-OAM splittings even if (1) the SAM operator generates non-internal symmetries or (2) if one allows the SAM and OAM operators to generate non-SO(3) symmetries.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.07926v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Common techniques for measuring refractive indices, such as ellipsometry and goniometry, are ineffective for van der Waals crystal flakes because of their high anisotropy and small, micron-scale, lateral size. To address this, we employ near-field optical microscopy to analyze the guided optical modes within these crystals. By probing these modes in MoS$_2$ flakes with subwavelength spatial resolution at a wavelength of $1570\,\mathrm{nm}$, we determine both the in-plane and out-of-plane permittivity components of MoS$_2$ as $16.11$ and $6.25$, respectively, with a relative uncertainty below $1\%$, while overcoming the limitations of traditional methods.</description>

      <title>Spatiotemporal optical vortex (STOV) polariton</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.17413</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.17413v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We confirm the existence of the spatiotemporal optical vortex (STOV) polariton and the value of its tOAM, verifying our theory of transverse orbital angular momentum in a simple dispersive medium [S. W. Hancock et al., Phys. Rev. Lett. 127, 193901 (2021)]. We also develop a physical picture of the polariton as a structure driven by torques induced by the ponderomotive force of the light in the presence of material dispersion. This is a new type of spatiotemporal torque unanticipated in our recent work [S. W. Hancock et al., Phys. Rev. X 14, 011031 (2024)]. These results are accomplished by high resolution particle-in-cell (PIC) simulations of STOV pulse reflection from and transmission through a fully ionized hydrogen plasma slab. The linear theory matches the PIC simulations up to near-critical plasma densities and near-relativistic field strengths. For higher intensities, optical tOAM becomes invested in collective modes of the plasma.</description>
