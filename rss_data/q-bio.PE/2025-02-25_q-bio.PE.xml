      <title>When to Boost: How Dose Timing Determines the Epidemic Threshold</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.16715</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.16715v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Most vaccines require multiple doses, the first to induce recognition and antibody production and subsequent doses to boost the primary response and achieve optimal protection. We show that properly prioritizing the administration of first and second doses can shift the epidemic threshold, separating the disease-free from the endemic state and potentially preventing widespread outbreaks. Assuming homogeneous mixing, we prove that at a low vaccination rate, the best strategy is to give absolute priority to first doses. In contrast, for high vaccination rates, we propose a scheduling that outperforms a first-come first-served approach. We identify the threshold that separates these two scenarios and derive the optimal prioritization scheme and inter-dose interval. Agent-based simulations on real and synthetic contact networks validate our findings. We provide specific guidelines for effective resource allocation, showing that adjusting the timing between primer and booster significantly impacts epidemic outcomes and can determine whether the disease persists or disappears.</description>

      <title>The evolution of complexity and the transition to biochemical life</title>

Abstract: While modern physics and biology satisfactorily explain the passage from the Big Bang to the formation of Earth and the first cells to present-day life, respectively, the origins of biochemical life still remain an open question. Since life, as we know it, requires extremely long genetic polymers, any answer to the question must explain how an evolving system of polymers of ever-increasing length could come about on a planet that otherwise consisted only of small molecular building blocks. In this work, we show that, under realistic constraints, an abstract polymer model can exhibit dynamics such that attractors in the polymer population space with a higher average polymer length are also more probable. We generalize from the model and formalize the notions of complexity and evolution for chemical reaction networks with multiple attractors. The complexity of a species is defined as the minimum number of reactions needed to produce it from a set of building blocks, which in turn is used to define a measure of complexity for an attractor. A transition between attractors is considered to be a progressive evolution if the attractor with the higher probability also has a higher complexity. In an environment where only monomers are readily available, the attractor with a higher average polymer length is more complex. Thus, our abstract polymer model can exhibit progressive evolution for a range of thermodynamically plausible rate constants. We also formalize criteria for open-ended and historically-contingent evolution and explain the role of autocatalysis in obtaining them. Our work provides a basis for searching for prebiotically plausible scenarios in which long polymers can emerge and yield populations with even longer polymers.</description>

      <title>Relating dynamics and structure of discrete and continuous time systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.11602</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.11602v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In numerous subjects there are instances of dynamical variables that change in discrete time. One such example is a population's size, which changes in discrete generations which we label by $n$ ($= 0, 1, 2, . ..$). There are some exactly soluble cases where the population's size at discrete time $n$, written $x_{n}$, can be related to a different problem, where change occurs in continuous time, $t$, and the population's size is then written as $x(t)$. The relation is that $x(t = n)$ precisely coincides with $x_{n}$. In such a case, we say the two models are 'equivalent', even though $x_{n}$ obeys a difference equation and $x(t)$ obeys a differential equation. A comparison of the difference equation and the differential equation allows us to make a correspondence between coefficients in these equations. This exposes structural similarities and sometimes appreciable structural differences of discrete and continuous time dynamics. We present cases of such equivalences for both time homogeneous and time inhomogeneous problems. Beyond this, when the equation that $x_{n}$ obeys is modified so there is no exact solution, we show how to construct an approximate continuous time solution that can capture rapid change, such as growth, of $x_{n}$. Additionally, in some discrete time problems, the solution has an oscillatory component that changes sign as $n \rightarrow n + 1$. We show that the way an equivalent continuous time solution replicates this oscillatory behaviour is to become complex. We give concrete examples of this 'complexification' of the continuous time solution, which is real at $t = 0,1,2,...$ but is complex away from the integers.</description>

      <title>The impact of recovery rate heterogeneity in achieving herd immunity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.13130</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.13130v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Herd immunity is a critical concept in epidemiology, describing a threshold at which a sufficient proportion of a population is immune, either through infection or vaccination, thereby preventing sustained transmission of a pathogen. In the classic Susceptible-Infectious-Recovered (SIR) model, which has been widely used to study infectious disease dynamics, the achievement of herd immunity depends on key parameters, including the transmission rate ($\beta$) and the recovery rate ($\gamma$), where $\gamma$ represents the inverse of the mean infectious period. While the transmission rate has received substantial attention, recent studies have underscored the significant role of $\gamma$ in determining the timing and sustainability of herd immunity. Additionally, it is becoming increasingly evident that assuming $\gamma$ as a constant parameter might oversimplify the dynamics, as variations in recovery times can reflect diverse biological, social, and healthcare-related factors.
  In this paper, we investigate how heterogeneity in the recovery rate affects herd immunity. We show empirically that the mean of the recovery rate is not a reliable metric for determining the achievement of herd immunity. Furthermore, we provide a theoretical result demonstrating that it is instead the mean recovery time, which is the mean of the inverse $1/\gamma$ of the recovery rate that is critical in deciding whether herd immunity is achievable within the SIR framework. A similar result is proved for the SEIR model. These insights have significant implications for public health interventions and theoretical modeling of epidemic dynamics.</description>

      <title>Insecticide treated bed net use and elimination of malaria in Sub-Saharan African countries: Assessing the Global Technical Strategy (GTS) using an evolutionary game approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.13336</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.13336v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The WHO 2021 malaria report revealed that its Global Technical Strategy (GTS) 2020 milestones for morbidity and mortality, based on the 2015 baseline, have not been achieved globally -- the world is off-track by 42% and, can be extended up to 91% in 2030. Most of the Sub-Saharan African (SSA) countries failed to achieve GTS 2020 -- only 4 out of 40 highest burden countries met the goals. By fitting evolutionary game modeling to the malaria case and Insecticide-Treated Nets (ITN) usages data, we identify factors contributing to the GTS 2020 failures of 38 SSA countries. We use optimized projection of our model to evaluate further the potential achievement of GTS 2025 and 2030 objectives and discuss strategies for attaining goals in situations where these milestones seem unattainable. Our findings categorize all 38 countries based on the possibility to achieve their future milestone, either through increased campaigns, or by economic assistance, or through enhancing the efficacy of ITNs at minimal expense.</description>

      <title>FREE: The Foundational Semantic Recognition for Modeling Environmental Ecosystems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.10255</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.10255v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Modeling environmental ecosystems is critical for the sustainability of our planet, but is extremely challenging due to the complex underlying processes driven by interactions amongst a large number of physical variables. As many variables are difficult to measure at large scales, existing works often utilize a combination of observable features and locally available measurements or modeled values as input to build models for a specific study region and time period. This raises a fundamental question in advancing the modeling of environmental ecosystems: how to build a general framework for modeling the complex relationships amongst various environmental data over space and time? In this paper, we introduce a framework, FREE, which maps available environmental data into a text space and then converts the traditional predictive modeling task in environmental science to a semantic recognition problem. The proposed framework leverages recent advances in Large Language Models (LLMs) to supplement the original input features with natural language descriptions. This framework facilitates capturing the data semantics and allows harnessing the irregularities of input features. When used for long-term prediction, FREE has the flexibility to incorporate newly collected observations to enhance future prediction. The efficacy of FREE is evaluated in the context of two societally important real-world applications, predicting stream water temperature in the Delaware River Basin and predicting annual corn yield in Illinois and Iowa. Beyond the superior predictive performance over multiple baselines, FREE is shown to be more data- and computation-efficient as it can be pre-trained on simulated data generated by physics-based models.</description>

      <title>Stochastic Mutation Theory of SARS-CoV-2 Variants</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.10471</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.10471v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Predicting the future evolutionary trajectory of SARS-CoV-2 remains a critical challenge, particularly due to the pivotal role of spike protein mutations. Developing an evolutionary model capable of continuously integrating new experimental data is an urgent priority. By employing well-founded assumptions for mutant representation (four-letter and two-letter formats) and the n-mer distance algorithm, we constructed an evolutionary tree of SARS-CoV-2 mutations that accurately reflects observed viral strain evolution. We introduce a stochastic method for generating new strains on this tree based on spike protein mutations. For a given set A of existing mutation sites, we define a set X of x randomly generated sites on the spike protein. Our analysis reveals that the position of a generated strain on the tree is determined by x. Through large-scale stochastic sampling, we predict the emergence of new macro-lineages. As x increases, the proportions of macro-lineages shift: lineage O surpasses lineage N, lineage P overtakes O, and ultimately, new lineage Q surpasses P. We identified threshold values of x that distinguish between macro-lineages. Furthermore, we demonstrate that the linear regression of the number of mutated sites (x) against sample collection dates (t) provides a robust approximation, enabling the prediction of new lineage emergence based on the x-t relationship. To conclude, we demonstrated that the SARS-CoV-2 evolution adheres to statistical principles: the emergence of new strains on the evolutionary tree can be driven by randomly generated spike protein sites; and the large-scale stochastic sampling uncovers evolutionary patterns governing the emergence of diverse macro-lineages.</description>
