      <title>Symmetric Entropy-Constrained Video Coding for Machines</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.15347</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.15347v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: As video transmission increasingly serves machine vision systems (MVS) instead of human vision systems (HVS), video coding for machines (VCM) has become a critical research topic. Existing VCM methods often bind codecs to specific downstream models, requiring retraining or supervised data and thus limiting generalization in multi-task scenarios. Recently, unified VCM frameworks have employed visual backbones (VB) and visual foundation models (VFM) to support multiple video understanding tasks with a single codec. They mainly utilize VB/VFM to maintain semantic consistency or suppress non-semantic information, but seldom explore how to directly link video coding with understanding under VB/VFM guidance. Hence, we propose a Symmetric Entropy-Constrained Video Coding framework for Machines (SEC-VCM). It establishes a symmetric alignment between the video codec and VB, allowing the codec to leverage VB's representation capabilities to preserve semantics and discard MVS-irrelevant information. Specifically, a bi-directional entropy-constraint (BiEC) mechanism ensures symmetry between the process of video decoding and VB encoding by suppressing conditional entropy. This helps the codec to explicitly handle semantic information beneficial for MVS while squeezing useless information. Furthermore, a semantic-pixel dual-path fusion (SPDF) module injects pixel-level priors into the final reconstruction. Through semantic-pixel fusion, it suppresses artifacts harmful to MVS and improves machine-oriented reconstruction quality. Experimental results show our framework achieves state-of-the-art (SOTA) in rate-task performance, with significant bitrate savings over VTM on video instance segmentation (37.41%), video object segmentation (29.83%), object detection (46.22%), and multiple object tracking (44.94%). We will release our code.</description>

      <title>Confidence-Weighted Semi-Supervised Learning for Skin Lesion Segmentation Using Hybrid CNN-Transformer Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.15354</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.15354v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Automated skin lesion segmentation through dermoscopic analysis is essential for early skin cancer detection, yet remains challenging due to limited annotated training data. We present MIRA-U, a semi-supervised framework that combines uncertainty-aware teacher-student pseudo-labeling with a hybrid CNN-Transformer architecture. Our approach employs a teacher network pre-trained via masked image modeling to generate confidence-weighted soft pseudo-labels, which guide a U-shaped CNN-Transformer student network featuring cross-attention skip connections. This design enhances pseudo-label quality and boundary delineation, surpassing reconstruction-based and CNN-only baselines, particularly in low-annotation regimes. Extensive evaluation on ISIC-2016 and PH2 datasets demonstrates superior performance, achieving a Dice Similarity Coefficient (DSC) of 0.9153 and Intersection over Union (IoU) of 0.8552 using only 50% labeled data. Code is publicly available on GitHub.</description>

      <title>A Cross-Framework Study of Temporal Information Buffering Strategies for Learned Video Compression</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.15426</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.15426v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent advances in learned video codecs have demonstrated remarkable compression efficiency. Two fundamental design aspects are critical: the choice of inter-frame coding framework and the temporal information propagation strategy. Inter-frame coding frameworks include residual coding, conditional coding, conditional residual coding, and masked conditional residual coding, each with distinct mechanisms for utilizing temporal predictions. Temporal propagation methods can be categorized as explicit, implicit, or hybrid buffering, differing in how past decoded information is stored and used. However, a comprehensive study covering all possible combinations is still lacking. This work systematically evaluates the impact of explicit, implicit, and hybrid buffering on coding performance across four inter-frame coding frameworks under a unified experimental setup, providing a thorough understanding of their effectiveness.</description>

      <title>SANR: Scene-Aware Neural Representation for Light Field Image Compression with Rate-Distortion Optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.15775</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.15775v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Light field images capture multi-view scene information and play a crucial role in 3D scene reconstruction. However, their high-dimensional nature results in enormous data volumes, posing a significant challenge for efficient compression in practical storage and transmission scenarios. Although neural representation-based methods have shown promise in light field image compression, most approaches rely on direct coordinate-to-pixel mapping through implicit neural representation (INR), often neglecting the explicit modeling of scene structure. Moreover, they typically lack end-to-end rate-distortion optimization, limiting their compression efficiency. To address these limitations, we propose SANR, a Scene-Aware Neural Representation framework for light field image compression with end-to-end rate-distortion optimization. For scene awareness, SANR introduces a hierarchical scene modeling block that leverages multi-scale latent codes to capture intrinsic scene structures, thereby reducing the information gap between INR input coordinates and the target light field image. From a compression perspective, SANR is the first to incorporate entropy-constrained quantization-aware training (QAT) into neural representation-based light field image compression, enabling end-to-end rate-distortion optimization. Extensive experiment results demonstrate that SANR significantly outperforms state-of-the-art techniques regarding rate-distortion performance with a 65.62\% BD-rate saving against HEVC.</description>

      <title>HyperAIRI: a plug-and-play algorithm for precise hyperspectral image reconstruction in radio interferometry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.15198</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.15198v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The next-generation radio-interferometric (RI) telescopes require imaging algorithms capable of forming high-resolution high-dynamic-range images from large data volumes spanning wide frequency bands. Recently, AIRI, a plug-and-play (PnP) approach taking the forward-backward algorithmic structure (FB), has demonstrated state-of-the-art performance in monochromatic RI imaging by alternating a data-fidelity step with a regularisation step via learned denoisers. In this work, we introduce HyperAIRI, its hyperspectral extension, underpinned by learned hyperspectral denoisers enforcing a power-law spectral model. For each spectral channel, the HyperAIRI denoiser takes as input its current image estimate, alongside estimates of its two immediate neighbouring channels and the spectral index map, and provides as output its associated denoised image. To ensure convergence of HyperAIRI, the denoisers are trained with a Jacobian regularisation enforcing non-expansiveness. To accommodate varying dynamic ranges, we assemble a shelf of pre-trained denoisers, each tailored to a specific dynamic range. At each HyperAIRI iteration, the spectral channels of the target image cube are updated in parallel using dynamic-range-matched denoisers from the pre-trained shelf. The denoisers are also endowed with a spatial image faceting functionality, enabling scalability to varied image sizes. Additionally, we formally introduce Hyper-uSARA, a variant of the optimisation-based algorithm HyperSARA, promoting joint sparsity across spectral channels via the l2,1-norm, also adopting FB. We evaluate HyperAIRI's performance on simulated and real observations. We showcase its superior performance compared to its optimisation-based counterpart Hyper-uSARA, CLEAN's hyperspectral variant in WSClean, and the monochromatic imaging algorithms AIRI and uSARA.</description>

      <title>An Empirical Study on MC Dropout--Based Uncertainty--Error Correlation in 2D Brain Tumor Segmentation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.15541</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.15541v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Accurate brain tumor segmentation from MRI is vital for diagnosis and treatment planning. Although Monte Carlo (MC) Dropout is widely used to estimate model uncertainty, its effectiveness in identifying segmentation errors -- especially near tumor boundaries -- remains unclear. This study empirically examines the relationship between MC Dropout--based uncertainty and segmentation error in 2D brain tumor MRI segmentation using a U-Net trained under four augmentation settings: none, horizontal flip, rotation, and scaling. Uncertainty was computed from 50 stochastic forward passes and correlated with pixel-wise errors using Pearson and Spearman coefficients. Results show weak global correlations ($r \approx 0.30$--$0.38$) and negligible boundary correlations ($|r| &lt; 0.05$). Although differences across augmentations were statistically significant ($p &lt; 0.001$), they lacked practical relevance. These findings suggest that MC Dropout uncertainty provides limited cues for boundary error localization, underscoring the need for alternative or hybrid uncertainty estimation methods in medical image segmentation.</description>

      <title>ClapperText: A Benchmark for Text Recognition in Low-Resource Archival Documents</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.15557</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.15557v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper presents ClapperText, a benchmark dataset for handwritten and printed text recognition in visually degraded and low-resource settings. The dataset is derived from 127 World War II-era archival video segments containing clapperboards that record structured production metadata such as date, location, and camera-operator identity. ClapperText includes 9,813 annotated frames and 94,573 word-level text instances, 67% of which are handwritten and 1,566 are partially occluded. Each instance includes transcription, semantic category, text type, and occlusion status, with annotations available as rotated bounding boxes represented as 4-point polygons to support spatially precise OCR applications. Recognizing clapperboard text poses significant challenges, including motion blur, handwriting variation, exposure fluctuations, and cluttered backgrounds, mirroring broader challenges in historical document analysis where structured content appears in degraded, non-standard forms. We provide both full-frame annotations and cropped word images to support downstream tasks. Using a consistent per-video evaluation protocol, we benchmark six representative recognition and seven detection models under zero-shot and fine-tuned conditions. Despite the small training set (18 videos), fine-tuning leads to substantial performance gains, highlighting ClapperText's suitability for few-shot learning scenarios. The dataset offers a realistic and culturally grounded resource for advancing robust OCR and document understanding in low-resource archival contexts. The dataset and evaluation code are available at https://github.com/linty5/ClapperText.</description>

      <title>DGME-T: Directional Grid Motion Encoding for Transformer-Based Historical Camera Movement Classification</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.15725</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.15725v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Camera movement classification (CMC) models trained on contemporary, high-quality footage often degrade when applied to archival film, where noise, missing frames, and low contrast obscure motion cues. We bridge this gap by assembling a unified benchmark that consolidates two modern corpora into four canonical classes and restructures the HISTORIAN collection into five balanced categories. Building on this benchmark, we introduce DGME-T, a lightweight extension to the Video Swin Transformer that injects directional grid motion encoding, derived from optical flow, via a learnable and normalised late-fusion layer. DGME-T raises the backbone's top-1 accuracy from 81.78% to 86.14% and its macro F1 from 82.08% to 87.81% on modern clips, while still improving the demanding World-War-II footage from 83.43% to 84.62% accuracy and from 81.72% to 82.63% macro F1. A cross-domain study further shows that an intermediate fine-tuning stage on modern data increases historical performance by more than five percentage points. These results demonstrate that structured motion priors and transformer representations are complementary and that even a small, carefully calibrated motion head can substantially enhance robustness in degraded film analysis.

      <title>Efficient reconstruction and denoising of cryo-ET data with end-to-end localized deep learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.15246</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.15246v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Cryo-electron tomography (cryo-ET) enables 3D visualization of cellular structures. Accurate reconstruction of high-resolution volumes is complicated by the very low signal-to-noise ratio and a restricted range of sample tilts. Recent self-supervised deep learning approaches, which post-process initial reconstructions by filtered backprojection (FBP), have significantly improved reconstruction quality with respect to signal processing iterative algorithms, but they are slow, taking dozens of hours for an expert to reconstruct tomogram and demand large memory. We present CryoLithe, an end-to-end network that directly estimates the volume from an aligned tilt-series. CryoLithe achieves denoising and missing wedge correction comparable or better than state-of-the-art self-supervised deep learning approaches such as Cryo-CARE, IsoNet or DeepDeWedge, while being two order of magnitude faster. To achieve this, we implement a local, memory-efficient reconstruction network. We demonstrate that leveraging transform-domain locality makes our network robust to distribution shifts, enabling effective supervised training and giving excellent results on real data--without retraining or fine-tuning. CryoLithe reconstructions facilitate downstream cryo-ET analysis, including segmentation and subtomogram averaging and is openly available: https://github.com/swing-research/CryoLithe.</description>

      <title>Skull-stripping induces shortcut learning in MRI-based Alzheimer's disease classification</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.15831</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.15831v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Objectives: High classification accuracy of Alzheimer's disease (AD) from structural MRI has been achieved using deep neural networks, yet the specific image features contributing to these decisions remain unclear. In this study, the contributions of T1-weighted (T1w) gray-white matter texture, volumetric information, and preprocessing -- particularly skull-stripping -- were systematically assessed.
  Methods: A dataset of 990 matched T1w MRIs from AD patients and cognitively normal controls from the ADNI database were used. Preprocessing was varied through skull-stripping and intensity binarization to isolate texture and shape contributions. A 3D convolutional neural network was trained on each configuration, and classification performance was compared using exact McNemar tests with discrete Bonferroni-Holm correction. Feature relevance was analyzed using Layer-wise Relevance Propagation, image similarity metrics, and spectral clustering of relevance maps.
  Results: Despite substantial differences in image content, classification accuracy, sensitivity, and specificity remained stable across preprocessing conditions. Models trained on binarized images preserved performance, indicating minimal reliance on gray-white matter texture. Instead, volumetric features -- particularly brain contours introduced through skull-stripping -- were consistently used by the models.
  Conclusions: This behavior reflects a shortcut learning phenomenon, where preprocessing artifacts act as potentially unintended cues. The resulting Clever Hans effect emphasizes the critical importance of interpretability tools to reveal hidden biases and to ensure robust and trustworthy deep learning in medical imaging.</description>

      <title>Universal Vessel Segmentation for Multi-Modality Retinal Images</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.06987v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We identify two major limitations in the existing studies on retinal vessel segmentation: (1) Most existing works are restricted to one modality, i.e., the Color Fundus (CF). However, multi-modality retinal images are used every day in the study of the retina and diagnosis of retinal diseases, and the study of vessel segmentation on other modalities is scarce; (2) Even though a few works extended their experiments to new modalities such as the Multi-Color Scanning Laser Ophthalmoscopy (MC), these works still require fine-tuning a separate model for the new modality. The fine-tuning will require extra training data, which is difficult to acquire. In this work, we present a novel universal vessel segmentation model (URVSM) for multi-modality retinal images. In addition to performing the study on a much wider range of image modalities, we also propose a universal model to segment the vessels in all these commonly used modalities. While being much more versatile compared with existing methods, our universal model also demonstrates comparable performance to the state-of-the-art fine-tuned methods. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work that achieves modality-agnostic retinal vessel segmentation and the first to study retinal vessel segmentation in several novel modalities.</description>

      <title>TransVFC: A Transformable Video Feature Compression Framework for Machines</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.23772v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Nowadays, more and more video transmissions primarily aim at downstream machine vision tasks rather than humans. While widely deployed Human Visual System (HVS) oriented video coding standards like H.265/HEVC and H.264/AVC are efficient, they are not the optimal approaches for Video Coding for Machines (VCM) scenarios, leading to unnecessary bitrate expenditure. The academic and technical exploration within the VCM domain has led to the development of several strategies, and yet, conspicuous limitations remain in their adaptability for multi-task scenarios. To address the challenge, we propose a Transformable Video Feature Compression (TransVFC) framework. It offers a compress-then-transfer solution and includes a video feature codec and Feature Space Transform (FST) modules. In particular, the temporal redundancy of video features is squeezed by the codec through the scheme-based inter-prediction module. Then, the codec implements perception-guided conditional coding to minimize spatial redundancy and help the reconstructed features align with downstream machine perception.After that, the reconstructed features are transferred to new feature spaces for diverse downstream tasks by FST modules. To accommodate a new downstream task, it only requires training one lightweight FST module, avoiding retraining and redeploying the upstream codec and downstream task networks. Experiments show that TransVFC achieves high rate-task performance for diverse tasks of different granularities. We expect our work can provide valuable insights for video feature compression in multi-task scenarios. The codes are at https://github.com/Ws-Syx/TransVFC.</description>

      <title>A Multimodal Deep Learning Approach for White Matter Shape Prediction in Diffusion MRI Tractography</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.18400</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.18400v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Shape measures have emerged as promising descriptors of white matter tractography, offering complementary insights into anatomical variability and associations with cognitive and clinical phenotypes. However, conventional methods for computing shape measures are computationally expensive and time-consuming for large-scale datasets due to reliance on voxel-based representations. We propose Tract2Shape, a novel multimodal deep learning framework that leverages geometric (point cloud) and scalar (tabular) features to predict ten white matter tractography shape measures. To enhance model efficiency, we utilize a dimensionality reduction algorithm for the model to predict five primary shape components. The model is trained and evaluated on two independently acquired datasets, the HCP-YA dataset, and the PPMI dataset. We evaluate the performance of Tract2Shape by training and testing it on the HCP-YA dataset and comparing the results with state-of-the-art models. To further assess its robustness and generalization ability, we also test Tract2Shape on the unseen PPMI dataset. Tract2Shape outperforms SOTA deep learning models across all ten shape measures, achieving the highest average Pearson's r and the lowest nMSE on the HCP-YA dataset. The ablation study shows that both multimodal input and PCA contribute to performance gains. On the unseen testing PPMI dataset, Tract2Shape maintains a high Pearson's r and low nMSE, demonstrating strong generalizability in cross-dataset evaluation. Tract2Shape enables fast, accurate, and generalizable prediction of white matter shape measures from tractography data, supporting scalable analysis across datasets. This framework lays a promising foundation for future large-scale white matter shape analysis.</description>

      <title>UNet with Self-Adaptive Mamba-Like Attention and Causal-Resonance Learning for Medical Image Segmentation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.15234</link>

Abstract: Medical image segmentation plays an important role in various clinical applications; however, existing deep learning models face trade-offs between efficiency and accuracy. Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) capture local details well but miss the global context, whereas transformers handle the global context but at a high computational cost. Recently, State Space Sequence Models (SSMs) have shown potential for capturing long-range dependencies with linear complexity; however, their direct use in medical image segmentation remains limited due to incompatibility with image structures and autoregressive assumptions. To overcome these challenges, we propose SAMA-UNet, a novel U-shaped architecture that introduces two key innovations. First, the Self-Adaptive Mamba-like Aggregated Attention (SAMA) block adaptively integrates local and global features through dynamic attention weighting, enabling an efficient representation of complex anatomical patterns. Second, the causal resonance multi-scale module (CR-MSM) improves encoder-decoder interactions by adjusting feature resolution and causal dependencies across scales, enhancing the semantic alignment between low- and high-level features. Extensive experiments on MRI, CT, and endoscopy datasets demonstrate that SAMA-UNet consistently outperforms CNN, Transformer, and Mamba-based methods. It achieves 85.38% DSC and 87.82% NSD on BTCV, 92.16% and 96.54% on ACDC, 67.14% and 68.70% on EndoVis17, and 84.06% and 88.47% on ATLAS23, establishing new benchmarks across modalities. These results confirm the effectiveness of SAMA-UNet in combining efficiency and accuracy, making it a promising solution for real-world clinical segmentation tasks.

      <title>Implicit neural representations for accurate estimation of the standard model of white matter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.15762</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.15762v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Diffusion magnetic resonance imaging (dMRI) enables non-invasive investigation of tissue microstructure. The Standard Model (SM) of white matter aims to disentangle dMRI signal contributions from intra- and extra-axonal water compartments. However, due to the model its high-dimensional nature, accurately estimating its parameters poses a complex problem and remains an active field of research, in which different (machine learning) strategies have been proposed. This work introduces an estimation framework based on implicit neural representations (INRs), which incorporate spatial regularization through the sinusoidal encoding of the input coordinates. The INR method is evaluated on both synthetic and in vivo datasets and compared to existing methods. Results demonstrate superior accuracy of the INR method in estimating SM parameters, particularly in low signal-to-noise conditions. Additionally, spatial upsampling of the INR can represent the underlying dataset anatomically plausibly in a continuous way. The INR is self-supervised, eliminating the need for labeled training data. It achieves fast inference, is robust to noise, supports joint estimation of SM kernel parameters and the fiber orientation distribution function with spherical harmonics orders up to at least 8, and accommodates gradient non-uniformity corrections. The combination of these properties positions INRs as a potentially important tool for analyzing and interpreting diffusion MRI data.</description>

      <title>Foundation Model-Driven Classification of Atypical Mitotic Figures with Domain-Aware Training Strategies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.02601</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.02601v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present a solution for the MIDOG 2025 Challenge Track~2, addressing binary classification of normal mitotic figures (NMFs) versus atypical mitotic figures (AMFs). The approach leverages pathology-specific foundation model H-optimus-0, selected based on recent cross-domain generalization benchmarks and our empirical testing, with Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) fine-tuning and MixUp augmentation. Implementation includes soft labels based on multi-expert consensus, hard negative mining, and adaptive focal loss, metric learning and domain adaptation. The method demonstrates both the promise and challenges of applying foundation models to this complex classification task, achieving reasonable performance in the preliminary evaluation phase.</description>

      <title>Towards smart and adaptive agents for active sensing on edge devices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.06262</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.06262v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: TinyML has made deploying deep learning models on low-power edge devices feasible, creating new opportunities for real-time perception in constrained environments. However, the adaptability of such deep learning methods remains limited to data drift adaptation, lacking broader capabilities that account for the environment's underlying dynamics and inherent uncertainty. Deep learning's scaling laws, which counterbalance this limitation by massively up-scaling data and model size, cannot be applied when deploying on the Edge, where deep learning limitations are further amplified as models are scaled down for deployment on resource-constrained devices.
  This paper presents an innovative agentic system capable of performing on-device perception and planning, enabling active sensing on the edge. By incorporating active inference into our solution, our approach extends beyond deep learning capabilities, allowing the system to plan in dynamic environments while operating in real-time with a compact memory footprint of as little as 300 MB. We showcase our proposed system by creating and deploying a saccade agent connected to an IoT camera with pan and tilt capabilities on an NVIDIA Jetson embedded device. The saccade agent controls the camera's field of view following optimal policies derived from the active inference principles, simulating human-like saccadic motion for surveillance and robotics applications.</description>

      <title>PAD: Phase-Amplitude Decoupling Fusion for Multi-Modal Land Cover Classification</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.19136</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.19136v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The fusion of Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) and RGB imagery for land cover classification remains challenging due to modality heterogeneity and underexploited spectral complementarity. Existing approaches often fail to decouple shared structural features from modality-complementary radiometric attributes, resulting in feature conflicts and information loss. To address this, we propose Phase-Amplitude Decoupling (PAD), a frequency-aware framework that separates phase (modality-shared) and amplitude (modality-complementary) components in the Fourier domain. This design reinforces shared structures while preserving complementary characteristics, thereby enhancing fusion quality. Unlike previous methods that overlook the distinct physical properties encoded in frequency spectra, PAD explicitly introduces amplitude-phase decoupling for multi-modal fusion. Specifically, PAD comprises two key components: 1) Phase Spectrum Correction (PSC), which aligns cross-modal phase features via convolution-guided scaling to improve geometric consistency; and 2) Amplitude Spectrum Fusion (ASF), which dynamically integrates high- and low-frequency patterns using frequency-adaptive multilayer perceptrons, effectively exploiting SAR's morphological sensitivity and RGB's spectral richness. Extensive experiments on WHU-OPT-SAR and DDHR-SK demonstrate state-of-the-art performance. This work establishes a new paradigm for physics-aware multi-modal fusion in remote sensing. The code will be available at https://github.com/RanFeng2/PAD.</description>
