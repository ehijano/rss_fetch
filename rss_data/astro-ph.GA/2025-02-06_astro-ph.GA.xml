      <title>Capturing the short-term characteristics of a barred galaxy from a single snapshot</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.02612</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.02612v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Using a dataset of stars from a barred galaxy that provides instantaneous positions and velocities in the sky, we propose a method to identify its key structures, such as the central bar and spiral arms, and to determine the bar pattern speed in the short term. This is accomplished by applying combinatorial and topological data analysis techniques to the available star-state information set.
  To validate the methodology, we apply it to two scenarios: a test particle simulation and a N-body simulation, both evaluated when the bar is fully formed. In both cases, the results are robust and consistent. We then use these outcomes to calibrate a classical dynamical model and compute related structures, such as equilibrium points and invariant manifolds, which we verify align with the galaxy's spiral arms.</description>

      <title>2D light distributions of dwarf galaxies -- key tests of the implementation of physical processes in simulations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.02632</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.02632v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Cosmological simulations provide much of the theoretical framework within which we interpret extragalactic observations. However, even if a given simulation reproduces the integrated properties of galaxies well, it may not reproduce the detailed structures of individual galaxies. Comparisons between the 2D light distributions of simulated and observed galaxies -- particularly in the dwarf regime, where key processes like tidal perturbations and baryonic feedback most strongly influence galaxy structure -- thus provide an additional valuable test of the simulation's efficacy. We compare scaling relations derived from mock observations of simulated galaxies, drawn from the two largest halos in the high-resolution NewHorizon cosmological simulation, with galaxies in the Fornax cluster. While Fornax is significantly more massive than either group, it is the lowest-mass cluster in the local Universe, and contains a well-studied population of spatially resolved dwarfs, hence serves as a useful benchmark. Per unit stellar mass, NewHorizon dwarfs are systematically larger in half-light radius, much fainter in surface brightness, and bluer in colour than their Fornax counterparts, albeit with similar light profile shapes. We discuss potential reasons for these discrepancies, including environmental effects, baryonic feedback, resolution, or couplings of these factors. As observations of dwarfs outside of the local Universe become more plentiful through on-going or up-coming surveys such as Euclid and LSST, 2D comparisons such as these, where properties are measured in the same way across both simulations and observations, can place strong constraints on processes that alter the spatial distribution of baryons in galaxies.</description>

      <title>The dynamical impact of cosmic rays in the Rhea magnetohydrodynamics simulations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.02635</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.02635v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study explores the dynamical impact of cosmic rays (CRs) in Milky Way-like galaxies using the Rhea simulation suite. Cosmic rays, with their substantial energy density, influence the interstellar medium (ISM) by supporting galactic winds, modulating star formation, and shaping ISM energetics. The simulations incorporate a multi-phase ISM, self-consistent CR transport in the advection-diffusion approximation, and interactions with magnetic fields to study their effect on galaxy evolution. Key findings reveal that CRs reduce star formation rates, and drive weak but sustained outflows with mass loading factors of $\sim0.2$, transporting a substantial fraction (20%-60%) of the injected CR energy. These CR-driven outflows are launched not just from the galactic center but across the entire disk, illustrating their pervasive dynamical influence. Galactic disks supported by CRs exhibit broader vertical structures compared to magnetic-field-dominated setups, though the scale heights are similar. CR feedback enhances magnetic flux transport to the circumgalactic medium (CGM), leading to a magnetically enriched CGM with field strengths of $\sim0.5\mu\mathrm{G}$ while reducing gas temperatures to $\lesssim10^5\,\mathrm{K}$. The CR energy is relatively smoothly distributed in the disk, with gradient lengths exceeding the typical size of molecular clouds, indicating that the CR behavior is not adiabatic.</description>

      <title>Ultra High-Redshift or Closer-by, Dust-Obscured Galaxies? Deciphering the Nature of Faint, Previously Missed F200W-Dropouts in CEERS</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.02637</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.02637v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) is revolutionizing our understanding of the Universe by unveiling faint, near-infrared dropouts previously beyond our reach, ranging from exceptionally dusty sources to galaxies up to redshift $z \sim 14$. In this paper, we identify F200W-dropout objects in the Cosmic Evolution Early Release Science (CEERS) survey which are absent from existing catalogs. Our selection method can effectively identify obscured low-mass ($\log \text{M}_* \leq 9$) objects at $z \leq 6$, massive dust-rich sources up to $z \sim 12$, and ultra-high-redshift ($z &gt; 15$) candidates. Primarily relying on NIRCam photometry from the latest CEERS data release and supplementing with Mid-Infrared/(sub-)mm data when available, our analysis pipeline combines multiple SED-fitting codes, star formation histories, and CosMix - a novel tool for astronomical stacking. Our work highlights three $2&lt;z&lt;3$ dusty dwarf galaxies which have larger masses compared to the typical dusty dwarfs previously identified in CEERS. Additionally, we reveal five faint sources with significant probability of lying above $z&gt;15$, with best-fit masses compatible with $\Lambda$CDM and a standard baryons-to-star conversion efficiency. Their bi-modal redshift probability distributions suggest they could also be $z&lt;1.5$ dwarf galaxies with extreme dust extinction. We also identify a strong line emitter galaxy at $z \sim 5$ mimicking the near-infrared emission of a $z \sim 13$ galaxy. Our sample holds promising candidates for future follow-ups. Confirming ultra high-redshift galaxies or lower-z dusty dwarfs will offer valuable insights into early galaxy formation, evolution with their central black holes and the nature of dark matter, and/or cosmic dust production mechanisms in low-mass galaxies, and will help us to understand degeneracies and contamination in high-z object searches.</description>

      <title>Radial migration in the Galactic disc driven by a slowing bar</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.02642</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.02642v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Radial migration is an important dynamical effect that has reshaped the Galactic disc, but its origin has yet to be elucidated. In this work, we present evidence that resonant dragging by the corotation of a decelerating bar could be the main driver of radial migration in the Milky Way disc. Using a test particle simulation, we demonstrate this scenario explains the two distinct age-metallicity sequences observed in the solar vicinity: the plateauing upper sequence is interpreted as stars dragged outwards by the expanding corotation of the decelerating bar and the steeper lower sequence as stars formed locally around the solar circle. The upper migrated sequence dominates at guiding radii around the current corotation radius of the bar, $R\sim7\,\mathrm{kpc}$, but rapidly dies away beyond this where the mechanism cannot operate. This behaviour naturally explains the radial dependence of the $\mathrm{[\alpha/Fe]}$-bimodality, in particular the truncation of the high-$\mathrm{[\alpha/Fe]}$ disc beyond the solar circle. Under our proposed radial migration scenario, we constrain the Milky Way bar's pattern speed evolution using the age-metallicity distribution of stars currently trapped at corotation. We find the bar likely formed with an initial pattern speed of $60-100$ km s$^{-1}$ kpc$^{-1}$ and began decelerating $6-8$ Gyr ago at a rate $-\dot{\Omega}/\Omega^2\sim0.0025-0.0040$ (where the quoted ranges include systematic uncertainties).</description>

      <title>Introducing the Rhea simulations of Milky-Way-like galaxies I: Effect of gravitational potential on morphology and star formation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.02646</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.02646v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Milky Way is a complex ecosystem, for which we can obtain detailed observations probing the physical mechanisms determining the interstellar medium. For a detailed comparison with observations, and to provide theories for missing observables, we need to model the Milky Way as closely as possible. However, details of the Galactic structure are not fully defined by observations, raising the need for more generalized models. With the Rhea simulations we present a set of Milky Way like simulations, containing detailed physics of the interstellar medium, as well as star formation and stellar feedback. We conduct two simulations that differ in the gravitational potential: one fitted to several structural details derived from observations, the other just reproducing the most basic quantities. We find little difference in the overall morphology except for the bar region, which funnels gas towards the Galactic inner region and therefore prevents quenching in the center. Despite differences with galacto-centric radius, the global star formation rate is almost identical in both setups. A spiral arm potential does not influence properties of groups of formed stars. A bar potential, however, lowers size and formation time of those groups. We therefore conclude for a spiral arm potential to have little influence on star formation in the Galaxy, except for producing long-lived spiral structures instead of transient ones. A Galactic bar potential has noticeable influence on star formation mainly within the innermost 2.5kpc.</description>

      <title>Synergising semi-analytical models and hydrodynamical simulations to interpret JWST data from the first billion years</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.02647</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.02647v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The field of high redshift galaxy formation has been revolutionised by JWST, which is yielding unprecedented insights on galaxy assembly at early times. Our key aim is to study the physical mechanisms that can explain the unexpected abundance of bright galaxies at $z \geq 11$, as well as their metal enrichment and spectral properties. We also use recent data to determine the key sources of reionisation. To do so, we implement cold gas fractions and star formation efficiencies derived from the SPHINX20 high-resolution radiation-hydrodynamics simulation into DELPHI, a semi-analytic model that tracks the assembly of dark matter halos and their baryonic components from $z \sim 4.5-40$. In addition, we explore two different methodologies to boost galaxy luminosities at $z \geq 11$: a stellar initial mass function (IMF) that becomes increasingly top-heavy with decreasing metallicity and increasing redshift (eIMF model), and star formation efficiencies that increase with increasing redshift (eSFE model). Our key findings are: (i) both the eIMF and eSFE models can explain the abundance of bright galaxies at $z \geq 11$; (ii) dust attenuation plays an important role for the bright-end of the UV LF at $z \leq 11$; (iii) the mass-metallicity relation is in place as early as $z \sim 17$ in all models although its slope is model-dependent; (iv) within the spread of both models and observations, all of our models are in good agreement with current estimates of $\beta$ slopes at $z \sim 5-17$ and Balmer break strengths at $z \sim 6-10$; (v) in the eIMF model, galaxies at $z\geq12$ or with $\rm{M_{UV}}\geq-18$ show values of $\xi_{\rm{ion}} \sim 10^{25.55}~{\rm [Hz~erg^{-1}]}$, twice larger than in other models; (vi) star formation in galaxies below $10^{9}\rm{M_{\odot}}$ is the key driver of reionisation, providing the bulk ($\sim 85\%$) of ionising photons down to its midpoint at $z \sim 7$.</description>

      <title>Bar-spiral interaction produces radial migration and star formation bursts</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.02651v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Central bars and spirals are known to strongly impact the evolution of their host galaxies, both in terms of dynamics and star formation. Their typically different pattern speeds cause them to regularly overlap, which induces fluctuations in bar parameters. In this paper, we analyze both numerical simulations of disk galaxies and observational data to study the effect of bar-spiral physical overlap on stellar radial migration and star formation in the bar vicinity, as a function of time and galactic azimuth. We study three different numerical models, two of which are in a cosmological context, as well as APOGEE DR17 data and the WISE catalog of Galactic HII regions. We find that periodic boosts in stellar radial migration occur when the bar and spiral structure overlap. This mechanism causes net inward migration along the bar leading side, while stars along the bar trailling side and minor axis are shifted outward. The signature of bar-spiral induced migration is seen between the bar's inner Lindbald resonance and well outside its corotation, beyond which other drivers take over. We also find that, in agreement with simulations, APOGEE DR17 stars born at the bar vicinity (mostly metal-rich) can migrate out to the solar radius while remaining on cold orbits. For the Milky Way, 13% of stars in the solar vicinity were born inside the bar, compared to 5-20% in the simulations. Bar-spiral reconnections also result in periodic starbursts at the bar ends with an enhancement of up to a factor of 4, depending on the strength of the spiral structure. Similarly to the migration bursts, these do not always happen simultaneously at the two sides of the bar, hinting at the importance of odd spiral modes. Data from the WISE catalog suggest this phhenomenon is also relevant in our own Galaxy.</description>

      <title>The quenching of star formation in dwarf galaxies: new perspectives from deep-wide surveys</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.02656</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.02656v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Dwarf galaxies dominate the galaxy number density, making them critical to our understanding of galaxy evolution. However, typical dwarfs are too faint to be visible outside the very local Universe in past surveys like the SDSS, which offer large footprints but are shallow. Dwarfs in such surveys have relatively high star formation rates, which boost their luminosity, making them detectable in shallow surveys, but also biased and potentially unrepresentative of dwarfs as a whole. Here, we use deep data to perform an unbiased statistical study of ~7,000 nearby (z&lt;0.25) dwarfs (10^8 MSun &lt; M &lt; 10^9.5 MSun) in the COSMOS field which, at these redshifts, is a relatively low-density field. At z~0.05, ~40 per cent of dwarfs in low-density environments are red/quenched, falling to ~30 per cent by z~0.25. Red dwarfs reside closer to nodes, filaments and massive galaxies. Proximity to a massive galaxy appears to be more important in determining whether a dwarf is red, rather than simply its distance from nodes and filaments or the mean density of its local environment. Interestingly, around half of the red dwarfs reside outside the virial radii of massive galaxies and around a third of those also inhabit regions in the lower 50 per cent in density percentile (i.e. regions of very low ambient density). Around half of the red dwarf population is, therefore, quenched by mechanisms unrelated to environment, which are likely to be internal processes such as stellar and AGN feedback.</description>

      <title>Dynamic Imprints of Colliding-wind Dust Formation from WR140</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.02738</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.02738v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Carbon-rich Wolf-Rayet binaries are a prominent source of carbonaceous dust that contribute to the dust budget of galaxies. The "textbook" example of an episodic dust producing WR binary, WR140 (HD193793), provides us with an ideal laboratory for investigating the dust physics and kinematics in an extreme environment. This study is among the first to utilize two separate JWST observations, from Cycle 1 ERS (July 2022) and Cycle 2 (Sept. 2023), to measure WR140's dust kinematics and confirm its morphology. To measure the proper motions and projected velocities of the dust shells, we performed a novel PSF subtraction to reduce the effects of the bright diffraction spikes and carefully aligned the Cycle 2 to the Cycle 1 images. At 7.7 $\mu$m, through the bright feature common to 16 dust shells (C1), we find an average dust shell proper motion of $390\pm29$ mas yr$^{-1}$, which equates to a projected velocity of $2714\pm188$ km s$^{-1}$ at a distance of 1.64 kpc. Our measured speeds are constant across all visible shells and consistent with previously reported dust expansion velocities. Our observations not only prove that these dusty shells are astrophysical (i.e., not associated with any PSF artifact) and originate from WR140, but also confirm the "clumpy" morphology of the dust shells, in which identifiable substructures within certain shells persist for at least 14 months from one cycle to the next. These results support the hypothesis that clumping in the wind collision region is required for dust production in WR binaries.</description>

      <title>The Morphology of Dwarf Galaxies Hosting Variable Active Galactic Nuclei</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.02751</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.02751v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We analyze Hubble Space Telescope (HST) optical imaging of eight low-mass galaxies hosting active galactic nuclei (AGN) identified via their photometric variability in \cite{baldassare_search_2020}.
  We use GALFIT to model the 2D galaxy light profiles, and find a diversity of morphologies.
  The galaxies with regular morphologies are best fit with pseudo-bulges and disks, rather than classical bulges. We estimate black hole masses using scaling relations and find black hole masses of 10$^{3.7-6.6}$ M$_\odot$. We compare this sample to dwarf galaxies with AGN selected via optical spectroscopy. On average, the variable host galaxies have lower mass black holes. We analyze the brightest point source in each galaxy and find their properties are not entirely consistent with star clusters, indicating that they are likely AGN. These point sources are found to have lower luminosities than spectroscopically selected dwarf AGN, but brighter than the point sources in dwarf galaxies not identified as AGN. Our detailed imaging analysis shows that variability selection has the potential to find lower mass black holes and lower luminosity AGN than optical spectroscopy. These active dwarfs may have been missed by spectroscopic searches due to star formation dilution or low gas content.</description>

Abstract: The Laser Interferometer Space Antenna (LISA) will soon detect gravitational waves (GWs) emitted by massive black hole (MBH) mergers. Some theoretical models have predicted transient electromagnetic (EM) emission from these mergers, enabling the association of LISA GW sources with their EM counterparts via telescope follow-up. However, the number of unrelated EM transients that might contaminate telescope searches for the true transient counterparts of LISA MBH mergers is unknown. We investigate the expected numbers of unrelated EM transients that will coincide with simulated LISA localization volumes of MBH mergers, as a function of the merger total mass and redshift. We find that the number of potential contaminants in LISA localization volumes drops to unity for mergers at $z \lesssim 0.8$ and at 1 hour before coalescence. After coalescence, the parameter space corresponding to a maximum of one potential contaminant expands to $z \lesssim 1.5$. In contrast, if the redshifts for all transients detected in LISA sky localization regions are not available, the number of potential contaminants increases by an average factor of $\sim100$, and never drops below unity. Overall, we expect the average number of contaminating transients in telescope follow-up of LISA MBH mergers to be non-negligible, especially without redshift information for the detected transients. We recommend that endeavors designing follow-up strategies of LISA events should focus on: (1) building large redshift catalogs for host galaxies, (2) developing robust real-time transient classification algorithms, (3) and coordinating telescope resources to obtain redshifts for candidate transient EM counterparts in a timely manner.</description>

      <title>Resolved Gas Temperatures and 12C/13C ratios in SVS13A from ALMA Observations of CH3CN and CH3-13-CN</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.02873</link>

Abstract: Context. Multiple systems are common in field stars, and the frequency is found to be higher in early evolutionary stages. Thus, the study of young multiple systems during the embedded stages is key to have a comprehensive understanding of star formation. In particular, how material accretes from the large-scale envelope into the inner region and how this flow interacts with the system physically and chemically has not yet been well characterized observationally. Aims. We aim to provide a snapshot of the forming protobinary system SVS13A, consisting of VLA4A and VLA4B. This includes clear pictures of its kinematic structures, physical conditions, and chemical properties. Methods. We conducted ALMA observations toward SVS13A targeting CH3CN and CH3-13CN J=12-11 K-ladder line emission with a high spatial resolution of ~30 au at a spectral resolution of ~0.08 km s-1 Results. We perform LTE radiative transfer models to fit the spectral features of the line emission. We find the two-layer LTE radiative model including dust absorption is essential to interpret the CH3CN and CH3-13-CN line emission. We identify two major and four small kinematic components, and derive their physical and chemical properties. Conclusions. We find a possible infalling signature toward the bursting secondary source VLA4A, which may be fed by an infalling streamer from the large-scale envelope. The mechanical heating in the binary system, as well as the infalling shocked gas, likely play a role in the thermal structure of the protobinary system. By accumulating mass from the streamer, the system might have experienced a gravitationally unstable phase before the accretion outburst. Finally, the derived CH3CN/CH3-13-CN ratio is lower than the canonical ratio in the ISM and is different between VLA4A and VLA4B.</description>

      <title>More is better: Strong constraints on the stellar properties of LEGA-C z ~ 1 galaxies with Prospector</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.03021</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.03021v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present the stellar properties of 2908 galaxies at 0.6 &lt; z &lt; 1.0 from the LEGA-C survey. We emphasize the importance of high signal-to-noise, high spectral resolution spectroscopy in the inference of stellar population properties of galaxies. We estimate the galaxy properties with the SED fitting code Prospector, by fitting spectroscopy and broadband photometry together, drawn from the LEGA-C DR3 and UltraVISTA catalogs respectively. We report a positive correlation between light-weighted ages and stellar velocity dispersion ($\sigma_\star$). The trend with $\sigma_\star$ is weaker for the mass-weighted ages and stellar metallicity ($Z_\star$). On average, quiescent galaxies are characterized by high $Z_\star$, they are \sim 1.1 Gyr older, less dusty, with steeper dust attenuation slopes compared to star-forming galaxies. Conversely, star-forming galaxies are characterized by significantly higher dust optical depths and shallower (grayer) attenuation slopes. Low mass (high mass) star-forming galaxies have lower (higher) $Z_\star$, while their stellar populations are on average younger (older). A key pragmatic result of our study is that a linear-space metallicity prior is preferable to a logarithmic-space one when using photometry alone, as the latter biases the posteriors downward. Spectroscopy greatly improves stellar population measurements and is required to provide meaningful constraints on age, metallicity, and other properties. Pairing spectroscopy with photometry helps resolving the dust-age-metallicity degeneracy, yielding more accurate mass- and light-weighted ages, with ages inferred from photometry alone suffering such large uncertainties. Stellar metallicities are constrained by our spectroscopy, but precise measurements remain challenging (and impossible with photometry alone), particularly in the absence of Mg and Fe lines redward of 5000 $\AA$ in the observed spectrum.</description>

      <title>Nuclear Stellar Disk-like Nature in the Kinematics of SiO Maser Stars around Sagittarius A*</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.03024</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.03024v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a detailed analysis of the kinematics of SiO maser stars around the center of the Milky Way, Sagittarius A* (Sgr A*). We used the archive data in the SiO v=1, J=2-1 emission line obtained by the Atacama Large Millimeter/Submillimeter Array (ALMA) in 2017 and 2021 (#2016.1.00940.S, PI Darling, J. and #2019.1.00292.S, PI Paine, J.). We detected 37 SiO maser stars in the channel maps and derived their angular offsets relative to Sgr A* and LSR radial velocities. We derived the proper motions of 35 stars by comparing their angular offsets in the two epochs. The proper motions of Wolf-Rayet and O star in the Nuclear Star Cluster (NSC) are reported to be rather random, except for the co-moving clusters IRS13E and IRS13N (Tsuboi et al. 2022). However, the derived proper motions of SiO maser stars do not look completely random. The proper motions of the SiO maser stars show a tendency to lie along the Galactic plane. The proper motion amplitudes of SiO maser stars are larger than the LSR velocity amplitudes. We estimated the 3D motions from the proper motions and LSR velocities. Many 3D velocities are near to or larger than the upper limit velocities for Kepler orbits around Sgr A*, whose mass is assumed to be 4x10^6 Msun. These indicate that the SiO maser stars around Sgr A* are members of the Nuclear Stellar Disk rather than the NSC.</description>

      <title>A comprehensive study of the gas-phase formation network of HC$_5$N: theory, experiments, observations and models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.03046</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.03046v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Cyanopolyynes are among the largest and most commonly observed interstellar Complex Organic Molecules in star-forming regions. They are believed to form primarily in the gas-phase, but their formation routes are not well understood. We present a comprehensive study of the gas-phase formation network of cyanobutadiyne, HC$_5$N, based on new theoretical calculations, kinetics experiments, astronomical observations, and astrochemical modeling. We performed new quantum mechanics calculations for six neutral-neutral reactions in order to derive reliable rate coefficients and product branching fractions. We also present new CRESU data on the rate coefficients of three of these reactions (C$_3$N + C$_2$H$_2$, C$_2$H + HC$_3$N, CN + C$_4$H$_2$) obtained at temperatures as low as 24 K. In practice, six out of nine reactions currently used in astrochemical models have been updated in our reviewed network. We also report the tentative detection of the $^{13}$C isotopologues of HC$_5$N in the L1544 prestellar core. We derived a lower limit of $^{12}$C/$^{13}$C &gt; 75 for the HC$_5$N isotopologues, which does not allow to bring new constraints to the HC$_5$N chemistry. Finally, we verified the impact of the revised reactions by running the GRETOBAPE astrochemical model. We found good agreement between the HC$_5$N predicted and observed abundances in cold ($\sim$10 K) objects, demonstrating that HC$_5$N is mainly formed by neutral-neutral reactions in these environments. In warm molecular shocks, instead, the predicted abundances are a factor of ten lower with respect to observed ones. In this environment possessing an higher gas ionization fraction, we speculate that the contribution of ion-neutral reactions could be significant.</description>

      <title>DES to HSC: Detecting low surface brightness galaxies in the Abell 194 cluster using transfer learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.03142</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.03142v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Low surface brightness galaxies (LSBGs) are important for understanding galaxy evolution and cosmological models. The upcoming large-scale surveys are expected to uncover a large number of LSBGs, requiring accurate automated or machine learning-based methods for their detection. We study the scope of transfer learning for the identification of LSBGs. We use transformer models divided into two categories: LSBG Detection Transformer (LSBG DETR) and LSBG Vision Transformer (LSBG ViT), trained on Dark Energy Survey (DES) data, to identify LSBGs from dedicated Hyper Suprime-Cam (HSC) observations of the Abell 194 cluster, which are two magnitudes deeper than DES. The data from DES and HSC were standardized based on pixel-level surface brightness. We used two transformer ensembles to detect LSBGs. This was followed by a single-component S\'ersic model fit and a final visual inspection to filter out potential false positives and improve sample purity. We present a sample of 171 low surface brightness galaxies (LSBGs) in the Abell 194 cluster using HSC data, including 87 new discoveries. Of these, 159 were identified using transformer models, and 12 additional LSBGs were found through visual inspection. The transformer model achieved a true positive rate (TPR) of 93% in HSC data without any fine-tuning. Among the LSBGs, 28 were classified as ultra-diffuse galaxies (UDGs). The number of UDGs and the radial UDG number density suggest a linear relationship between UDG numbers and cluster mass on a log scale. UDGs share similar S\'ersic parameters with dwarf galaxies and occupy the extended end of the $R_{\mathrm{eff}}-M_g$ plane, suggesting they might be an extended subpopulation of dwarf galaxies. We have demonstrated that transformer models trained on shallower surveys can be successfully applied to deeper surveys with appropriate data normalization.</description>

      <title>Ferrers bar response models: a grid calculation for Galactic models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.03344</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.03344v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study numerically investigates the dynamics of barred spiral galaxies using 3D Ferrers bar response models. A total of 708 models were analyzed, incorporating variations in the axisymmetric potential (nucleus, bulge, disk, halo), bar length, mass, angular velocity, and disk stellar velocity dispersion. Model evaluation employed the Spearman correlation (to assess input-output relationships) and permutation feature importance in a Random Forest Regressor (to measure input variable impacts). Orbital configurations of test particles reveal the critical role of bar dynamics in shaping galaxies' morphological and kinematic properties. Key findings emphasize how bar potential influences major orbital families, affecting barred galaxies' long-term structure. These results provide deeper insights into galactic component interactions and a robust framework for understanding bar properties.</description>

      <title>Resonant Locking Between Binary Systems Induced by Gravitational Waves</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.01733</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.01733v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The interaction of gravitational waves (GWs) with matter is thought to be typically negligible in the Universe. We identify a possible exception in the case of resonant interactions, where GWs emitted by a background binary system such as an inspiraling supermassive black hole (SMBH) binary causes a resonant response in a stellar-mass foreground binary and the frequencies of the two systems become, and remain, synchronized. We point out that such locking is not only possible, but can significantly reduce the binaries' merger time for $\mathcal{O}(1-10^4)$ binaries in the host galaxy of the merging SMBHs of $10^{9-11}M_{\odot}$ for standard general relativity and even more either in ``wet'' SMBH mergers or in certain modified theories of gravity where the inspiral rate is reduced. This could leave an imprint on the period distribution of stellar mass binaries in post-merger galaxies which could be detectable by future GW detectors, such as LISA.</description>

      <title>An Alcock-Paczynski Test on Reionization Bubbles for Cosmology</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.02638</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.02638v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we propose an Alcock-Paczy\'nski (AP) test to constrain cosmology using HII bubbles during the Epoch of Reionization. Similarly to cosmic voids, a stack of HII bubbles is spherically symmetric because ionizing fronts propagate isotropically on average (even if individual bubbles may not be spherical), making them standard spheres to be used in an AP test. Upcoming 21-cm observations, from the Square Kilometer Array (SKA) for instance, will contain tomographic information about HII regions during reionization. However, extracting the bubbles from this signal is made difficult because of instrumental noise and foreground systematics. Here, we use a neural network to reconstruct neutral-fraction boxes from the noisy 21-cm signal, from which we extract bubbles using a watershed algorithm. We then run the purely geometrical AP test on these stacks, showing that a SKA-like experiment will be able to constrain the product of the angular-diameter distance $D_{\text{A}}$ and Hubble parameter $H$ at reionization redshifts with $\sim 2\%$ precision, robustly to astrophysical and cosmological uncertainties within the models tested here. This AP test, whether performed on 21-cm observations or other large surveys of ionized bubbles, will allow us to fill the knowledge gap about the expansion rate of our Universe at reionization redshifts.</description>

      <title>New stellar bow shocks and bubbles found around runaway stars</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.02658</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.02658v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Runaway stars with peculiar high velocities can generate stellar bow shocks. Only a few bow shocks show clear radio emission. Our goal is to identify and characterize new stellar bow shocks around O and Be runaway stars in the infrared (IR), and to study their possible radio emission and nature. Our input data is a catalog of O and Be runaways compiled using Gaia DR3. We used WISE IR images to search for bow shocks around these runaways, Gaia DR3 data to determine the actual motion of the runaway stars corrected for interstellar medium (ISM) motion caused by Galactic rotation, and archival radio data to search for emission signatures. We finally explored the radio detectability of these sources under thermal and nonthermal scenarios. We found 9 new stellar bow shock candidates, 3 new bubble candidates, and 1 intermediate structure candidate. One of them is an in situ bow shock candidate. We also found 17 already known bow shocks in our sample, though we discarded one, and 62 miscellaneous sources showing some IR emission around the runaways. We geometrically characterized the sources in IR using the WISE-4 band and estimated the ISM density at the bow shock positions, obtaining median values of ~6 and ~4 cm$^{-3}$ using 2D and 3D peculiar velocities. Most of the new discovered bow shocks come from new runaway discoveries. Within our samples we found that ~24% of the O-type runaway stars show bow shocks, while this decreases to ~3% for Be-type runaway stars. Two bow shocks present radio emission but not as clear counterparts, and two others show hints of radio emission. The physical scenarios indicate that two sources could still be compatible with nonthermal radio emission. The new sample of O and Be runaway stars allowed us to discover both new stellar bow shocks and bubbles. Their geometrical characterization can be used to assess the physical scenario of the radio emission. (Abridged)</description>

      <title>Tomographic halo model of the unWISE-Blue galaxies using cross-correlations with BOSS CMASS galaxies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.02744</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.02744v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The halo model offers a framework for investigating galaxy clustering, and for understanding the growth of galaxies and the distribution of galaxies of different types. Here, we use the halo model to study the small-scale clustering and halo occupation distribution (HOD) of the unWISE-Blue galaxy sample, an infrared-selected sample of $\sim$100 million galaxies across the entire extragalactic sky at $z\sim 0.5$ $-$ similar redshifts to the Baryon Oscillation Spectroscopic Survey (BOSS) CMASS sample. Although the photometric unWISE galaxies cannot be easily split in redshift, we use their cross-correlation with the BOSS CMASS sample to tomographically probe the HOD of the unWISE galaxies at $0.45 &lt; z &lt; 0.75$. To do so, we develop a new method for applying the halo model to cross-correlations between a photometric sample and a spectroscopic sample in narrow redshift bins, incorporating halo exclusion, post-Limber corrections, and redshift-space distortions. We reveal strong evolution in the CMASS HOD, and modest evolution in the unWISE-Blue HOD. For unWISE-Blue, we find that the average bias and mean halo mass drop from $b = 1.6$ and $\log_{10}(M_{\mathrm{h}}/M_{\odot}) \sim 13.4$ at $z \sim 0.5$ to $b = 1.4$ and $\log_{10}(M_{\mathrm{h}}/M_{\odot}) \sim 13.1$ at $z \sim 0.7$, and that the satellite fraction drops modestly from $\sim$20% to $\sim$10% in the same range. These results are useful for creating mock samples of the unWISE-Blue galaxies. Furthermore, the techniques developed to obtain these results are applicable to other tomographic cross-correlations between photometric samples and narrowly-binned spectroscopic samples, such as clustering redshifts.</description>

      <title>Turbulent transport in a non-Markovian velocity field</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.02946</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.02946v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The commonly used quasilinear approximation allows one to calculate the turbulent transport coefficients for the mean of a passive scalar or a magnetic field in a given velocity field. Formally, the quasilinear approximation is exact when the correlation time of the velocity field is zero. We calculate the lowest-order corrections to the transport coefficients due to the correlation time being nonzero. For this, we use the Furutsu-Novikov theorem, which allows one to express the turbulent transport coefficients in a Gaussian random velocity field as a series in the correlation time. We find that the turbulent diffusivities of both the mean passive scalar and the mean magnetic field are suppressed. Nevertheless, contradicting a previous study, we show that the turbulent diffusivity of the mean magnetic field is smaller than that of the mean passive scalar. We also find corrections to the $\alpha$ effect.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2502.02983v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recent work has suggested that, during reionisation, spatial variations in the ionising radiation field should produce enhanced Ly ${\alpha}$ forest transmission at distances of tens of comoving Mpc from high-redshift galaxies. We demonstrate that the Sherwood-Relics suite of hybrid radiation-hydrodynamical simulations are qualitatively consistent with this interpretation. The shape of the galaxy--Ly ${\alpha}$ transmission cross-correlation is sensitive to both the mass of the haloes hosting the galaxies and the volume averaged fraction of neutral hydrogen in the IGM, $\bar{x}_{\rm HI}$. The reported excess Ly ${\alpha}$ forest transmission on scales r ~ 10 cMpc at $\langle z \rangle \approx 5.2$ -- as measured using C IV absorbers as proxies for high-redshift galaxies -- is quantitatively reproduced by Sherwood-Relics at z = 6 if we assume the galaxies that produce ionising photons are hosted in haloes with mass $M_{\rm h}\geq 10^{10}~h^{-1}\,{\rm M}_\odot$. However, this redshift mismatch is equivalent to requiring $\bar{x}_{\rm HI}\sim 0.1$ at $z\simeq 5.2$, which is inconsistent with the observed Ly ${\alpha}$ forest effective optical depth distribution. We speculate this tension may be partly resolved if the minimum C IV absorber host halo mass at z &gt; 5 is larger than $M_{\rm h}=10^{10}~h^{-1}\,{\rm M}_\odot$. After reionisation completes, relic IGM temperature fluctuations will continue to influence the shape of the cross-correlation on scales of a few comoving Mpc at $4 \leq z \leq 5$. Constraining the redshift evolution of the cross-correlation over this period may therefore provide further insight into the timing of reionisation.</description>

      <title>High-resolution radio observations of TeV candidate sources</title>

Abstract: Radio-loud active galactic nuclei (AGN) with their jets pointed close to our line of sight constitute the majority of extragalactic $\gamma$-ray sources and significantly contribute to the radiation observed in the even higher energy regime. The upcoming Cherenkov Telescope Array (CTA) is expected to detect fainter TeV objects, leading to an anticipated increase in the proportion of non-blazar extragalactic high-energy sources. Here we present the results of our dual-frequency (1.7 and 5~GHz) European VLBI Network (EVN) and enhanced Multi Element Remotely Linked Interferometer Network (e-MERLIN) observations of two faint radio sources from the list of TeV candidate sources. They do not show signs of nuclear activity in their optical spectra, but they were hypothesized to contain faint AGN that is outshone by the host galaxy. We used the mas-scale resolution radio data to try to pinpoint the location of the compact radio emitting feature, determine its spectral index, radio power, brightness temperature and radio-X-ray luminosity ratio and thus identify the origin of the radio emission. Our results suggest that both optically passive-looking galaxies host faint compact radio-emitting AGN with steep spectra.</description>

      <title>Detection of the Extended $\gamma$-ray Emission around TeV source 1LHAASO J0249+6022 with Fermi-LAT</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.03138</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.03138v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: 1LHAASO J0249+6022 is an extended very-high-energy gamma-ray source discovered by the Large High-Altitude Air Shower Observatory. Based on nearly 16.1 years of data from the Fermi Large Area Telescope, we report the probable gamma-ray emission from 1LHAASO J0249+6022 in the 0.03-1 TeV energy range. The results show that its gamma-ray spectrum can be well fitted by a single power law with an index of 1.54 $\pm$ 0.17, and integral photon flux is (4.28 $\pm$ 1.03) $\times$ 10$^{-11}$ photons cm$^{-2}$ s$^{-1}$. We also considered theoretically whether the non-thermal emission could originate from a pulsar wind nebula (PWN) scenario. Assuming that the particles injected into the nebula have a power-law distribution, the resulting spectrum from the inverse Compton scattering is consistent with the detected GeV and TeV gamma-ray fluxes. Our study shows that the PWN scenario is reasonable for 1LHAASO J0249+6022.</description>

      <title>A JWST Project on 47 Tucanae: Kinematics, energy equipartition and anisotropy of multiple populations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.03140</link>

Abstract: Recent work with JWST has demonstrated its capability to identify and chemically characterize multiple populations in globular clusters down to the H-burning limit. In this study, we explore the kinematics of multiple populations in the globular cluster 47 Tucanae by combining data from JWST, HST, and Gaia. We analyzed velocity dispersion and anisotropy profiles from the cluster center out to $\sim$10$R_h$. Our findings indicate that while 1G stars are isotropic, 2G stars are significantly radially anisotropic. These results align with the predictions of simulations of the dynamical evolution of clusters where 2G stars are initially more centrally concentrated than 1G stars. Furthermore, we subdivided the 2G population into two subpopulations: $2G_A$ and $2G_B$, with the latter being more chemically extreme. We compared their dynamical profiles and found no significant differences. For the first time, we measured the degree of energy equipartition among the multiple populations of 47 Tucanae. Overall, within the analyzed radial range ($\sim$2-4$R_h$), both populations exhibit a low degree of energy equipartition. The most significant differences between 1G and 2G stars are observed in the tangential velocity component, where 2G stars are characterized by a stronger degree of energy equipartition than 1G stars. In the radial component, the behavior of 1G and 2G stars is more variable, with differences largely dependent on radius. Finally, our analysis reveals that the ratio of rotational velocity to velocity dispersion is larger for the 2G population, while 1G stars exhibit higher skewness in their tangential proper motions, providing further evidence of differences in the kinematic properties of the 1G and 2G populations.</description>

      <title>PhotoD with LSST: Stellar Photometric Distances Out to the Edge of the Galaxy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.03179</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.03179v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: As demonstrated with the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS), Pan-STARRS, and most recently with Gaia data, broadband near-UV to near-IR stellar photometry can be used to estimate distance, metallicity, and interstellar dust extinction along the line of sight for stars in the Galaxy. Anticipating photometric catalogs with tens of billions of stars from Rubin's Legacy Survey of Space and Time (LSST), we present a Bayesian model and pipeline that build on previous work and can handle LSST-sized datasets. Likelihood computations utilize MIST/Dartmouth isochrones and priors are derived from TRILEGAL-based simulated LSST catalogs from P. Dal Tio et al. The computation speed is about 10 ms per star on a single core for both optimized grid search and Markov Chain Monte Carlo methods; we show in a companion paper by K. Mrakov\v{c}i\'c et al. how to utilize neural networks to accelerate this performance by up to an order of magnitude. We validate our pipeline, named PhotoD (in analogy with photo-z, photometric redshifts of galaxies) using both simulated catalogs and SDSS, DECam, and Gaia photometry. We intend to make LSST-based value-added PhotoD catalogs publicly available via the Rubin Science Platform with every LSST data release.</description>

      <title>A Case Study of Interstellar Material Delivery: {\alpha} Centauri</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.03224</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.03224v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Interstellar material has been discovered in our Solar System, yet its origins and details of its transport are unknown. Here we present $\alpha$ Centauri as a case study of the delivery of interstellar material to our Solar System. $\alpha$ Centauri is a mature triple star system that likely harbours planets and is moving towards us with the point of closest approach approximately 28,000 years in the future. Assuming a current ejection model for the system, we find that such material can reach our Solar System and may currently be present here. The material that does reach us is mostly a product of low ($&lt;2$ km/s) ejection velocities, and the rate at which it enters our Solar System is expected to peak around the time of $\alpha$ Centauri 's closest approach. If $\alpha$ Centauri ejects material at a rate comparable to our own Solar System, we estimate the current number of $\alpha$ Centauri particles larger than 100 m in diameter within our Oort Cloud to be $10^{6}$, and during $\alpha$ Centauri 's closest approach, this will increase by an order of magnitude. However, the observable fraction of such objects remains low as there is only a probability of $10^{-6}$ that one of them is within 10 au of the Sun. A small number ($\sim 10$) meteors greater than 100 micrometers from $\alpha$ Centauri may currently be entering Earth's atmosphere every year: this number is very sensitive to the assumed ejected mass distribution, but the flux is expected to increase as $\alpha$ Centauri approaches.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2502.03455v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present the Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument (DESI) Strong Lens Foundry. We discovered $\sim 3500$ new strong gravitational lens candidates in the DESI Legacy Imaging Surveys using residual neural networks (ResNet). We observed a subset (51) of our candidates using the Hubble Space Telescope (HST). All of them were confirmed to be strong lenses. We also briefly describe spectroscopic follow-up observations by DESI and Keck NIRES programs. From this very rich dataset, a number of studies will be carried out, including evaluating the quality of the ResNet search candidates and lens modeling. In this paper we present our initial effort in these directions. In particular, as a demonstration, we present the lens model for DESI-165.4754-06.0423, with imaging data from HST, and lens and source redshifts from DESI and Keck NIRES, respectively. We use a fast, fully forward-modeling Bayesian pipeline, GIGA-Lens. This is the first time a strong lens with HST data, or any high resolution imaging, has been modeled using GPUs.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2402.18538v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this study, we extend the dust-independent Hatzidimitriou (1991) relation between cluster age and $d_{B-R}$ color difference between the red giant branch (RGB) and red clump to younger cluster ages. We perform membership analysis on fourteen galactic open clusters using Gaia DR3 astrometry, then compute the difference in color of the RGB and red clump $d_{B-R}$ using Gaia photometry. We also compute $d_{B-R}$ for five fields surrounding Small Magellanic Cloud (SMC) clusters. We find that the trend derived from older clusters does not extrapolate to younger ages and becomes double-valued. We confirm that $d_{B-R}$ is independent of metallicity. Current stellar evolutionary isochrones do not quantitatively reproduce the trend and furthermore predict an increased color gap with a decrease in metallicity that is not echoed in the data. Integrated light models based on current isochrones exaggerate the color change over the $-0.5 &lt;$ [Fe/H] $&lt; 0$ interval at the few-percent level.</description>

      <title>Little Red Dots: Rapidly Growing Black Holes Reddened by Extended Dusty Flows</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.10760</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.10760v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) observations have revolutionized extragalactic research, particularly with the discovery of little red dots (LRD), which we propose are dust-reddened broad-line active galactic nuclei (AGNs). Their unique v-shape spectral feature observed through JWST/NIRCam challenges us to discern the relative contributions of the galaxy and AGN. We study a spectral energy distribution (SED) model for LRDs from rest-frame UV to infrared bands. We hypothesize that the incident radiation from an AGN, characterized by a typical SED, is embedded in an extended dusty medium with an extinction law similar to those seen in dense regions such as Orion Nebula or certain AGN environments. The UV-optical spectrum is described by dust-attenuated AGN emission, featuring a red optical continuum at $\lambda&gt;4000$ A and a flat UV spectral shape established through a gray extinction curve at $\lambda&lt;3000$ A, due to the absence of small-size grains. There is no need for additional stellar emission or AGN scattered light. In the infrared, the SED is shaped by an extended dust and gas distribution ($\gamma&lt;1$; $\rho\propto r^{-\gamma}$) with a characteristic gas density of $\simeq 10-10^3~{\rm cm}^{-3}$, which allows relatively cool dust temperatures to dominate the radiation, thereby shifting the energy peak from near- to mid-infrared bands. This model, unlike the typical AGN hot torus models, can produce an infrared SED flattening that is consistent with LRD observations through JWST MIRI. Such a density structure can arise from the coexistence of inflows and outflows during the early assembly of galactic nuclei. This might be the reason why LRDs emerge preferentially in the high-redshift universe younger than one billion years.</description>

      <title>Cold fronts in galaxy clusters I: A case for the large-scale global eigen modes in unmagnetized and weakly magnetized cluster core</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.03988v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Galaxy clusters show large-scale azimuthal X-ray surface brightness fluctuations known as cold fronts. Cold fronts are argued to originate due to sloshing driven by sub-halo passage at close proximity to the cluster center. While this causes large-scale perturbations, the physical mechanisms that can sustain spiral density structures are not clear. In this work, we explore whether long wavelength thermal instability is an explanation for cold front formation in a cluster core which is perturbed by sub-halos or AGN activity. Using global linear perturbation analysis, we show that unstable internal gravity waves form large-scale three-dimensional spirals, akin to observed cold fronts. We explore if the presence of magnetic field (along spherical $\hat{\phi}$) may support such structures (by suppressing small scale Kelvin-Helmholtz modes) or disrupt them (by promoting additional thermal instability). We find that latter happens at shorter wavelengths and above characteristic Brunt V\"ais\"al\"a frequency ($&gt;N_{\rm BV}$). Our work implies that large-scale spirals are sustained over a long timescale ($&gt;N^{-1}_{\rm BV}$) even in presence of aligned magnetic fields that is otherwise supportive against mixing at the interface. Secondly, short-wavelength (but relatively longer along the field) unstable compressive modes may form within or in the vicinity of such spirals. The instability is an overstable slow wave, and grows in 2D at timescales $\gtrsim 2-3$ times longer than the spiral growth timescale (via thermal instability). Thus this instability cannot destroy the large scale coherence.</description>

      <title>The Molecular Cloud Lifecycle I: Constraining H2 formation and dissociation rates with observations</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.06416v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Molecular clouds (MCs) are the birthplaces of new stars in galaxies. A key component of MCs are photodissociation regions (PDRs), where far-ultraviolet radiation plays a crucial role in determining the gas's physical and chemical state. Traditional PDR models assume chemical steady state (CSS), where the rates of H$_2$ formation and photodissociation are balanced. However, real MCs are dynamic and can be out of CSS. In this study, we demonstrate that combining H$_2$ emission lines observed in the far-ultraviolet or infrared with column density observations can be used to derive the rates of H$_2$ formation and photodissociation. We derive analytical formulae that relate these rates to observable quantities, which we validate using synthetic H$_2$ line emission maps derived from the SILCC-Zoom hydrodynamical simulation. Our method estimates integrated H$_2$ formation and dissociation rates with an accuracy $\approx 30$ % (on top of uncertainties in observed H$_2$ emission maps and column densities). Our simulations, valid for column densities $N \leq 2 \times 10^{22}$ cm$^{-2}$, cover a wide dynamic range in H$_2$ formation and photodissociation rates, showing significant deviations from CSS, with 74 % of the MC's mass deviating from CSS by a factor greater than 2. Our analytical formulae can effectively distinguish between regions in and out of CSS. When applied to actual H$_2$ line observations, our method can assess the chemical state of MCs, providing insights into their evolutionary stages and lifetimes. A NASA Small Explorer mission concept, Eos, will be proposed in 2025 and is specifically designed to conduct the types of observations outlined in this study.</description>

      <title>Accelerated Emergence of Evolved Galaxies in Early Overdensities at $z\sim5.7$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.10980</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.10980v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We report the identification of two galaxy overdensities at $z\sim5.7$ in the sightline of the galaxy cluster Abell 2744. These overdensities consist of 25 and 17 member galaxies, spectroscopically confirmed with JWST NIRSpec/MSA and NIRCam/WFSS. Each overdensity has a total stellar mass of $\sim2\times10^{10} M_\odot$ and a star formation rate of $\sim200 M_\odot$/yr within a central region of radius $R=2$ Mpc (physical). The sensitive PRISM spectra allow us to identify six galaxies that show weak Ha+[NII] emissions within the overdensities ($27\pm6\%$), whereas the fraction of such galaxies is found significantly lower ($6\pm2\%$) in field samples of the equivalent redshift range. These weak emission line galaxies, dubbed as wELGs, exhibit a strong continuum break at $4000$AA rest-frame, a characteristic feature of evolved stellar populations. The high observed fraction of wELGs in the two overdensities is consistent with the idea that high-density environments are an ideal site where galaxies can accelerate their evolutionary pace compared to field analogs. Our study pinpoints an early onset of environmental effects, already important within one billion years after the Big Bang, and provides a complementary perspective on the emergence of quenched, massive galaxies at lower redshifts. Potential contributions from black hole accretion feedback to the reduction of star formation activity are discussed, but the connection to the local environments remains unclear.</description>

      <title>Extremely Dense Gas around Little Red Dots and High-redshift Active Galactic Nuclei: A Non-stellar Origin of the Balmer Break and Absorption Features</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.07805</link>

Abstract: The James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) has uncovered low-luminosity active galactic nuclei (AGNs) at high redshifts of $z\gtrsim 4-7$, powered by accreting black holes (BHs) with masses of $\sim 10^{6-8}~M_\odot$. One remarkable distinction of these JWST-identified AGNs, compared to their low-redshift counterparts, is that at least $\sim 20\%$ of them present H$\alpha$ and/or H$\beta$ absorption, which must be associated with extremely dense ($\gtrsim 10^9~{\rm cm}^{-3}$) gas in the broad-line region or its immediate surroundings. These Balmer absorption features unavoidably imply the presence of a Balmer break caused by the same dense gas. In this Letter, we quantitatively demonstrate that a Balmer break can form in AGN spectra without stellar components, when the accretion disk is heavily embedded in dense neutral gas clumps with densities of $\sim 10^{9-11}~{\rm cm}^{-3}$, where hydrogen atoms are collisionally excited to the $n=2$ states and effectively absorb the AGN continuum at the bluer side of the Balmer limit. The non-stellar origin of a Balmer break offers a potential solution to the large stellar masses and densities inferred for little red dots (LRDs) when assuming that their continuum is primarily due to stellar light. Our calculations indicate that the observed Balmer absorption blueshifted by a few hundreds ${\rm km~s}^{-1}$ suggests the presence of dense outflows in the nucleus at rates exceeding the Eddington value. Other spectral features such as higher equivalent widths of broad H$\alpha$ emission and presence of OI lines observed in high-redshift AGNs including LRDs align with the predicted signatures of a dense super-Eddington accretion disk.</description>

      <title>Estimate Sonic Mach Number in the Interstellar Medium with Convolutional Neural Network</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.11157</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.11157v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Understanding the role of turbulence in shaping the interstellar medium (ISM) is crucial for studying star formation, molecular cloud evolution, and cosmic ray propagation. Central to this is the measurement of the sonic Mach number ($M_s$), which quantifies the ratio of turbulent velocity to the sound speed. In this work, we introduce a convolutional neural network (CNN)-based approach for estimating $M_s$ directly from spectroscopic observations. The approach leverages the physical correlation between increasing $M_s$ and the shock-induced small-scale fluctuations that alter the morphological features in intensity, velocity centroid, and velocity channel maps. These maps, derived from 3D magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) turbulence simulations, serve as inputs for the CNN training. By learning the relationship between these structural features and the underlying turbulence properties, CNN can predict $M_s$ under various conditions, including different magnetic fields and levels of observational noise. The median uncertainty of the CNN-predicted $M_s$ ranges from 0.5 to 1.5 depending on the noise level. While intensity maps offer lower uncertainty, channel maps have the advantage of predicting the 3D $M_s$ distribution, which is crucial in estimating 3D magnetic field strength. Our results demonstrate that machine-learning-based tools can effectively characterize complex turbulence properties in the ISM.</description>

      <title>Signatures of Rapidly Rotating Stars with Chemically Homogeneous Evolution in the First Galaxies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.02002</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.02002v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) has revealed an unexpectedly high abundance of UV luminous galaxies at redshifts $z\gtrsim 10$, challenging `standard' galaxy formation models. This study investigates the role of rapidly rotating (massive) stars undergoing chemically homogeneous evolution (CHE) in reconciling this potential tension. These stars are more compact, hotter, and exhibit enhanced UV emission. We find that the rest-frame UV luminosity of star-forming galaxies can be significantly enhanced by a factor of $\sim 3-6$ when CHE stars above a minimum initial mass of $m_{\star,\min}^{\rm CHE}\sim 2-10\ \rm M_\odot$ account for more than half of the total stellar mass following a Salpeter initial mass function. As a result, the UV luminosity functions observed at $z\sim 12-16$ can be reproduced with less extreme values of star formation efficiency and UV luminosity stochastic variability. Our results highlight the potential of CHE in explaining the UV-bright galaxy populations detected by JWST and call for future work to explore the broader astrophysical implications of CHE and its associated phenomena in the early universe, such as gamma-ray bursts, compact object binaries, and metal enrichment.</description>

      <title>First Search for Pulsed CH Maser Emission Stimulated by a Pulsar</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.01074v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present the first search for pulsed CH maser emission potentially stimulated by PSR J1644$-$4559, conducted using the ultra-wide-bandwidth low-frequency receiver on Murriyang, CSIRO's Parkes Radio Telescope. Observations targeted three CH $\Lambda$-doublet transitions at 3264, 3335, and 3349 MHz, with a variability timescale of 78 ms. We detected ten CH emission features at 3335 and 3349 MHz, and seven features at 3264 MHz, during both pulsar-ON and pulsar-OFF phases. The observed velocities align with the OH emission and absorption reported by a previous study, suggesting a close spatial association between CH and OH molecules. The derived column densities for CH clouds within the Parkes beam range from $0.05$ to $9.8 \times 10^{13}$ cm$^{-2}$, indicating that these clouds are likely in diffuse and translucent states. Upper limits for CH column densities within the pulsar beam ranged from $0.3$ to $9.8 \times 10^{13}$ cm$^{-2}$. Comparison of these column densities suggests that CH clouds may exhibit clumpiness and substructure. No significant stimulated emission feature was detected in the optical depth spectra. Additionally, as part of our search for pulsed stimulated emission, we investigated the potential CH absorption of the pulsar signal and found none, in agreement with astrophysical expectations. The upper limits for the potential maser amplification factors towards PSR J1644$-$4559 at 3264, 3335, and 3349 MHz are 1.014, 1.009, and 1.009, respectively. This study demonstrates the feasibility of detecting pulsed CH maser emission in the interstellar medium stimulated by pulsar photons.</description>

      <title>Nebular emission from composite star-forming galaxies -- I. A novel modelling approach</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.05424v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We introduce a novel approach to modelling the nebular emission from star-forming galaxies by combining the contributions from many HII regions incorporating loose trends in physical properties, random dust attenuation, a predefined Halpha luminosity function and a diffuse ionized-gas component. Using a machine-learning-based regression artificial neural network trained on a grid of models generated by the photoionization code Cloudy, we efficiently predict emission-line properties of individual HII regions over a wide range of physical conditions. We generate 250,000 synthetic star-forming galaxies composed of up to 3000 HII regions and explore how variations in parameters affect their integrated emission-line properties. Our results highlight systematic biases in oxygen-abundance estimates derived using traditional methods, emphasizing the importance of accounting for the composite nature of star-forming galaxies when interpreting integrated nebular emission. Future work will leverage this approach to explore in detail its impact on parameter estimates of star-forming galaxies.</description>

      <title>Feedback and dynamical masses in high-$z$ galaxies: the advent of high-resolution NIRSpec spectroscopy</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.17145v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Stellar feedback is an essential step in the baryon cycle of galaxies, but it remains unconstrained beyond Cosmic Noon. We study the ionized gas kinematics, dynamical mass and gas-flow properties of a sample of 16 sub-$L^{\star}$ star-forming galaxies at $4\leq z\leq7.6$, using high-resolution JWST/NIRSpec observations. The emission lines are resolved, with velocity dispersions ($\sigma_{\rm gas}{\rm~(km~s^{-1})}\simeq38-96$) comparable to more massive galaxies at Cosmic Noon. From $\sigma_{\rm gas}$ and the galaxy size ($r_e=400-960~$pc), we estimate the dynamical mass to be $\log M_{\rm dyn}/M_{\odot}=9.25-10.25$. Stellar-to-dynamical mass ratios are low ($\log M_{\star}/M_{\rm dyn}\in[-0.5,-2]$) and decrease with increasing SFR surface density ($\Sigma_{\rm SFR}$). We estimate the gas surface densities assuming a star-formation law, but the gas masses do not balance the baryon-to-dynamical mass ratios, which would require a decrease in the star-formation efficiency. We find evidence of ionized outflows in five out of the sixteen galaxies, based on the need of broad components to reproduce the emission-line wings. We only observe outflows from galaxies undergoing recent bursts of star formation ${\rm SFR_{10}/SFR_{100}\geq1}$, with elevated $\Sigma_{\rm SFR}$ and low $M_{\star}/M_{\rm dyn}$. This links high gas surface densities to increased outflow incidence and lower $M_{\star}/M_{\rm dyn}$. With moderate outflow velocities ($v_{\rm flow}{\rm~(km~s^{-1})}=150-250$) and mass outflow rates ($\dot{M}_{\rm flow}/{\rm M_{\odot} yr^{-1}}=0.2-5$), these high-redshift galaxies appear more efficient at removing baryons than low-redshift galaxies with similar $M_{\star}$, showing mass loading-factors of $\dot{M}_{\rm flow}/{\rm SFR}=0.04-0.4$. For their given dynamical mass, the outflow velocities exceed the escape velocities, meaning that they may eventually enrich the Circumgalactic Medium.</description>

      <title>New constraints on the evolution of the MHI-M* scaling relation combining CHILES and MIGHTEE-HI data</title>

Abstract: The improved sensitivity of interferometric facilities to the 21-cm line of atomic hydrogen (HI) enables studies of its properties in galaxies beyond the local Universe. In this work, we perform a 21 cm line spectral stacking analysis combining the MIGHTEE and CHILES surveys in the COSMOS field to derive a robust HI-stellar mass relation at z=0.36. In particular, by stacking thousands of star-forming galaxies subdivided into stellar mass bins, we optimize the signal-to-noise ratio of targets and derive mean HI masses in the different stellar mass intervals for the investigated galaxy population. We combine spectra from the two surveys, estimate HI masses, and derive the scaling relation log10(MHI) = (0.32 +- 0.04)log10(M*) + (6.65 +- 0.36). Our findings indicate that galaxies at z=0.36 are HI richer than those at z=0, but HI poorer than those at z=1, with a slope consistent across redshift, suggesting that stellar mass does not significantly affect HI exchange mechanisms. We also observe a slower growth rate HI relative to the molecular gas, supporting the idea that the accretion of cold gas is slower than the rate of consumption of molecular gas to form stars. This study contributes to understanding the role of atomic gas in galaxy evolution and sets the stage for future development of the field in the upcoming SKA era.</description>

      <title>Indirect Detection of eV Dark Matter via Infrared Spectroscopy</title>

      <description>arXiv:2208.05975v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Infrared spectroscopy has been developed significantly. In particular, infrared photons can be measured with high spectral and angular resolution in state-of-art spectrographs. They are sensitive to monochromatic photons due to the decay and annihilation of particles beyond the Standard Model, such as dark matter (DM), while insensitive to background photons that form a continuous spectrum. In this paper, we study the indirect detection of the DM decaying into infrared light using infrared spectrographs. In particular, we show that serious thermal and astrophysical noises can be overcome. As concrete examples, the Warm INfrared Echelle spectrograph to Realize Extreme Dispersion and sensitivity (WINERED) installed at the Magellan Clay 6.5m telescope and Near-Infrared Spectrograph (NIRSpec) at the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) are discussed. We show that a few hours of measurements of a faint dwarf spheroidal galaxy with WINERED (NIRSpec-like spectrograph) in the Magellan telescope (JWST) can probe an axion-like particle DM in the mass range $m_\phi=1.8 - 2.7\,$eV ($0.5-4\,$eV) with a photon coupling $g_{\phi\gamma\gamma}\gtrsim 10^{-11}{\rm GeV}^{-1}$. Complemental approaches, taking advantage of the high resolutions, such as the measurement of the Doppler shift of the signal photon lines and the possible search of the DM decay around the Milky Way galaxy center with Infrared Camera and Spectrograph (IRCS) at 8.2m Subaru telescope, are also presented.</description>

      <title>Hanging on the cliff: Extreme mass ratio inspiral formation with local two-body relaxation and post-Newtonian dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.09122</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.09122v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Extreme mass ratio inspirals (EMRIs) are anticipated to be primary gravitational wave sources for LISA (Laser Interferometer Space Antenna). They form in dense nuclear clusters when a compact object (CO) is captured by the central massive black holes (MBHs) due to frequent two-body interactions among orbiting objects. We present a novel Monte Carlo approach to evolve the post-Newtonian (PN) equations of motion of a CO orbiting an MBH accounting for two-body relaxation locally on the fly, without the assumption of orbit-averaging. We estimate the fraction $S(a_0)$ of EMRIs to total captures (including direct plunges, DPs) as a function of the initial semi-major axis $a_0$ for COs around MBHs of $M_\bullet\in[10^4\,{\rm M}_\odot,4\times10^6\,{\rm M}_\odot]$. Previous results indicate $S(a_0)\rightarrow 0$ at large $a_0$, with a sharp transition from EMRIs to DPs around a critical scale $a_{\rm c}$. This notion has been recently challenged for low-mass MBHs, with EMRIs forming at $a\gg a_{\rm c}$, the so-called "cliffhangers''. Our simulations confirm their existence, at larger numbers than previously expected. Cliffhangers start to appear for $M_\bullet\lesssim3\times 10^5\,{\rm M}_\odot$ and can account for up to 55% of the overall EMRIs formed. We find $S(a_0)\gg 0$ for $a\gg a_{\rm c}$, reaching values as high as 0.6 for $M_\bullet=10^4\,{\rm M}_\odot$, much larger than previously found. We find that the PN description of the system greatly enhances the number of EMRIs by shifting $a_{\rm c}$ to larger values at all MBH masses, and that the local treatment of relaxation significantly boosts the number of cliffhangers for small MBHs. Our work shows the limitations of standard assumptions for estimating EMRI formation rates, most importantly their dynamical models. Future estimates of rates and properties of EMRIs detectable by LISA should account for these improvements.</description>

      <title>Gravitational Wave Forecasts Constrained by JWST AGN Observations for Early Massive Black Hole Mergers</title>

Abstract: Massive black holes (BHs) grow by gas accretion and mergers, observable through electromagnetic (EM) and gravitational wave (GW) emission. The James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) has detected faint active galactic nuclei (AGNs), revealing an abundant population of accreting BHs with masses of $M_\bullet\sim 10^{6-8}~M_\odot$. This mass range overlaps with the detection scopes of space-based GW interferometers and approaches the upper bounds of the predicted mass of seed BHs. We model BH mass assembly in light of the new JWST findings to investigate their formation channels and predict merger events. Two types of seed BHs are considered: heavy seeds ($M_\bullet\sim 10^{2-5}~M_\odot$) formed in rare and overdense cosmic regions, and light seeds ($M_\bullet\sim 10^{1-3}~M_\odot$) formed as stellar remnants in less massive dark-matter halos. The BHs grow through episodic accretion and merger events, which we model by fitting the AGN luminosity function to observational data including JWST-identified AGNs at $z\sim 5$. We find that heavy seeds alone struggle to explain quasars and faint JWST-selected AGNs simultaneously, requiring the more abundant light seeds. The observed merger rate of BHs from heavy seeds alone is limited to $\lesssim 10^{-1}~{\rm yr}^{-1}$ for major mergers at $z\geq5$. However, the presence of light seeds increases the major merger rate by several orders of magnitude, which peaks at a total BH mass of $M_\bullet\simeq 2\times 10^3~M_\odot$ over $5&lt;z&lt;10$ at a rate of $\sim 30~{\rm yr}^{-1}$. These events are detectable by future GW observatories such as the Laser Interferometer Space Antenna (LISA). Precise sky localization and distance measurement of those GW events, with solid angle and luminosity distance uncertainties $\Delta\Omega\Delta\log D_L\lesssim 10^{-4}~\rm deg^2$, will enable EM identification of mergers at $z\geq5$ and multi-messenger follow-up observations.</description>

      <title>Two-temperature treatments in magnetically arrested disk GRMHD simulations more accurately predict light curves of Sagittarius A*</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.09556</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.09556v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The Event Horizon Telescope Collaboration (EHTC) observed the Galactic centre source Sagittarius A* (Sgr A*) and used emission models primarily based on single ion temperature (1T) general relativistic magnetohydrodynamic (GRMHD) simulations. This predicted emission is strongly dependent on a modelled prescription of the ion-to-electron temperature ratio. The most promising models are magnetically arrested disk (MAD) states. However, nearly all MAD models exhibit larger temporal fluctuations in radiative 230 GHz emission compared to observations. This limitation possibly stems from the fact that the actual temperature ratio depends on microphysical dissipation, radiative processes and other effects not captured in ideal fluid simulations. Therefore, we investigate the effects of two-temperature (2T) thermodynamics in MAD GRMHD simulations of Sgr A*, where the temperatures of both species are evolved. We find that the 230 GHz synchrotron flux variability more closely matches historical observations when we include the 2T treatment compared to 1T simulations. For the low accretion rates of Sgr A*, a common assumption is to neglect radiative cooling. However, we find that the radiative cooling of electrons-via synchrotron, inverse Compton, and bremsstrahlung processes-reduces the electron temperature in the inner disk, where the EHT observes, by about 10%, which, in turn, decreases both the (sub)millimetre synchrotron flux and its temporal fluctuations compared to uncooled simulations.</description>

Abstract: Relics are diffuse, highly-polarized radio sources that trace merger-driven shocks at the periphery of merging galaxy clusters. The LOFAR survey recently discovered a rare example of double relics in the low-mass cluster PSZ2 G181.06+48.47. Through a detailed exploration of new Chandra and XMM-Newton observations, we reveal that PSZ2 G181.06+48.47 has a lower mass ($M_{500,X}=2.32^{+0.29}_{-0.25}\times10^{14}$ M$_{\odot}$) than previously thought. Despite its cool global temperature of $kT_{500}=3.62^{+0.15}_{-0.07}$ keV, PSZ2 G181.06+48.47 is one of the most disturbed clusters in the Planck sample, with a complex morphological and thermodynamic structure. We discover a set of three discontinuities within &lt;500 kpc of the cluster center, and, from a surface brightness analysis, place $5\sigma$ upper limits of $M_{NE}&lt;1.43$ and $M_{SW}&lt;1.57$ for any shock associated with the relic locations. We also revise established scaling relations for double radio-relics by adding 12 new systems not included in previous work. The PSZ2 G181.06+48.47 relics have the widest separation (scaled for $r_{500}$) of all known double-relic systems. The exceptional distance from the cluster center ($&gt;r_{200}$), indicates the relics may be associated with shocks in the ``run-away" phase. We propose that this late-stage, post-apocenter merger is captured as the two subclusters with a mass ratio of 1.2-1.4 fall back into each other. The outer relic shocks were likely produced at the first core passage, while the inner discontinuities are associated with the second infall.</description>

Abstract: White dwarf-main sequence (WDMS) binary systems are essential probes for understanding binary stellar evolution and play a pivotal role in constraining theoretical models of various transient phenomena. In this study, we construct a catalog of WDMS binaries using Gaia DR3's low-resolution BP/RP (XP) spectra. Our approach integrates a model-independent neural network for spectral modelling with Gaussian Process Classification to accurately identify WDMS binaries among over 10 million stars within 1 kpc. This study identify approximately 30,000 WDMS binary candidates, including ~1,700 high-confidence systems confirmed through spectral fitting. Our technique is shown to be effective at detecting systems where the main-sequence star dominates the spectrum - cases that have historically challenged conventional methods. Validation using GALEX photometry reinforces the reliability of our classifications: 70\% of candidates with an absolute magnitude $M_{G} &gt; 7$ exhibit UV excess, a characteristic signature of white dwarf companions. Our all-sky catalog of WDMS binaries expands the available dataset for studying binary evolution and white dwarf physics and sheds light on the formation of WDMS.</description>
