      <title>Voice biomarkers of perinatal depression: cross-sectional nationwide pilot study report</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.06412</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.06412v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Perinatal depression (PND) affects 1 in 5 mothers, with 85% lacking support. Digital health tools offer early identification and prevention, potentially reducing PND risk by over 50% and improving engagement. Despite high interest, user retention needs improvement for maximum benefit. Voice biomarkers have emerged as a possible digital alternative to collecting mood questionnaires to inform individualized user adherence and retention. However, no voice biomarkers have been developed specifically for pregnant mothers. We aimed to test an unstructured speech sample for the feasibility of yielding a machine learning (ML) model to predict PND. We surveyed 446 women nationwide at 22 weeks of gestation. We measured PHQ-8 and modified EPDS and four voice samples. Participants were classified as depressed if their PHQ-8 or EPDS were equal or higher than 10. In the present report, we focus on a 2-minute unstructured speech prompt. A standardized cleaning pipeline was applied to the audio files, including a uniform format conversion, segment filtering for background noise, extraneous acoustic events, and file size. This resulted in 112 high-quality voice recordings, i.e., a rate of 25%. The ML modeling strategy utilized the Allie ML framework on 80% of the data for training on the binary classification task (depressed or not). The analysis included steps for feature selection using referenced speech audio embeddings, followed by a TPOT classifier for ML. We report the validation results for the 20% held-out data. For PHQ-8, we achieved a balanced accuracy of ~71%, precision of 73%, recall of 68%, and AUC of 0.71. For EPDS, we achieved a balanced accuracy of 80%, precision of 92%, recall of 80%, and AUC of 0.80. In conclusion, we demonstrate the feasibility at scale and a promising accuracy for detecting PND using 120 seconds of unstructured speech audio data in expectant mothers.</description>

      <title>Hillclimb-Causal Inference: A Data-Driven Approach to Identify Causal Pathways Among Parental Behaviors, Genetic Risk, and Externalizing Behaviors in Children</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.06784</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.06784v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Motivation: Externalizing behaviors in children, such as aggression, hyperactivity, and defiance, are influenced by complex interplays between genetic predispositions and environmental factors, particularly parental behaviors. Unraveling these intricate causal relationships can benefit from the use of robust data-driven methods.
  Methods: We developed a method called Hillclimb-Causal Inference, a causal discovery approach that integrates the Hill Climb Search algorithm with a customized Linear Gaussian Bayesian Information Criterion (BIC). This method was applied to data from the Adolescent Brain Cognitive Development (ABCD) Study, which included parental behavior assessments, children's genotypes, and externalizing behavior measures. We performed dimensionality reduction to address multicollinearity among parental behaviors and assessed children's genetic risk for externalizing disorders using polygenic risk scores (PRS), which were computed based on GWAS summary statistics from independent cohorts. Once the causal pathways were identified, we employed structural equation modeling (SEM) to quantify the relationships within the model.
  Results: We identified prominent causal pathways linking parental behaviors to children's externalizing outcomes. Parental alcohol misuse and broader behavioral issues exhibited notably stronger direct effects (0.33 and 0.20, respectively) compared to children's polygenic risk scores (0.07). Moreover, when considering both direct and indirect paths, parental substance misuse (alcohol, drug, and tobacco) collectively resulted in a total effect exceeding 1.1 on externalizing behaviors. Bootstrap and sensitivity analyses further validated the robustness of these findings.</description>

      <title>Impact of SMILES Notational Inconsistencies on Chemical Language Model Performance</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.07139</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.07139v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Chemical language models (CLMs), inspired by natural language processing (NLP), have recently emerged as powerful tools for various cheminformatics tasks such as molecular property prediction and molecule generation. The simplified molecular input line entry system (SMILES) is commonly employed in CLMs for representing molecular structures. However, despite attempts at standardization through Canonical SMILES, significant representational inconsistencies remain due to variations in canonicalization methods (grammatical inconsistencies) and incomplete stereochemical annotations (stereochemical inconsistencies). This study systematically investigates the prevalence and impact of these inconsistencies. Our literature review reveals that nearly half (45.4%) of the studies employing CLMs omit explicit mention of SMILES canonicalization, potentially impairing reproducibility. Through quantitative analysis of publicly available datasets, we observed substantial variability in SMILES representations, particularly highlighting significant gaps in stereochemical information approximately 50% of enantiomers and 30% of geometric isomers lacked complete annotations. Empirical evaluations using an encoder-decoder CLM demonstrated that representational variations significantly affect latent molecular representations, notably reducing translation accuracy. Interestingly, these variations minimally impacted downstream property prediction tasks, likely due to robust feature selection driven by label information. Furthermore, explicit manipulation of stereochemical annotations confirmed their crucial role in accurate cyclic structure reconstruction.</description>

      <title>Rigorous Evaluation of Predictive Toxicity Models by Multi-Objective Optimization of Reference Compound Lists Using Genetic Algorithms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.07140</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.07140v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In pharmaceutical safety assessments, validation studies are essential for evaluating the predictive performance and reliability of alternative methods prior to regulatory acceptance. Typically, these studies utilize reference compound lists selected to balance multiple critical factors, including chemical structure, physicochemical properties, and toxicity profiles. However, the inherent trade-offs among these criteria complicate the independent optimization of each factor, necessitating a comprehensive multi-objective optimization approach. To address this challenge, we propose a novel multi-objective optimization framework employing a Genetic Algorithm (GA) to simultaneously maximize structural, physicochemical, and toxicity diversity of reference compound lists. Applying this methodology to existing validation study datasets, we demonstrated that GA-optimized compound lists achieved significantly higher overall diversity compared to randomly generated lists. Additionally, toxicity prediction models tested on GA-optimized compound lists exhibited notably lower predictive performance compared to random selections, confirming that these lists provide a rigorous and unbiased assessment environment. These findings emphasize the potential of our GA-based method to enhance the robustness and generalizability of toxicity prediction models. Overall, our approach provides valuable support for developing balanced and rigorous reference compound lists, potentially accelerating the adoption of alternative safety assessment methods by facilitating smoother regulatory validation processes.</description>

      <title>Evaluating Cognitive Assessment Tools:A Comparative Analysis of MMSE, RUDAS, SAGE, ADAS and MoCA for Early Dementia Detection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.07246</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.07246v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Early detection of dementia is very crucial to ensure treatment begins on time, however it is difficult to choose appropriate cognitive assessment tools because each test is designed differently and may not be tailored to the needs of a patient. This review compares five commonly used tests the Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE), Rowland Universal Dementia Assessment Scale (RUDAS), Self-Administered Gerocognitive Examination (SAGE), Alzheimer's Disease Assessment Scale (ADAS), and Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA). Each test has different criteria's and vary in their coverage of cognitive domains. MMSE focuses on memory and language but lacks in the evaluation of executive and visuospatial abilities. RUDAS and SAGE focus on memory, language and visual thinking while ADAS mainly targets memory, executive function and language. The MoCA is most complete as it focuses on areas like attention, memory skills, problem solving and visual skills. This review evaluates how accurate and reliable these tools are to help doctors decide the most efficient tool for diagnosis.</description>

      <title>A Systems Biology view of Breast cancer via Fractal Geometry and Fractional Calculus</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.07338</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.07338v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Breast cancer (BC) is the most widespread cancer globally, yet current diagnostic and prognostic methods inadequately capture its biological complexity, despite the benefits of early detection. Cancer systems biology (SB) has advanced over the past two decades as a multiscale approach, but often neglects morphological complexity observable at cellular, tissue, and tumor levels. Structural organization significantly influences system behavior, necessitating the identification of scales where morphological features emerge. Fractal geometry (FG) provides quantitative tools to assess the irregular, scale-invariant structures typical of cancer. Alongside FG, fractional calculus (FC) offers a framework to model memory-dependent and non-local dynamics. However, existing research remains constrained to mono-fractal analyses or limited imaging scopes, lacking integration into broader SB models. This review aims to bridge that gap by presenting core FG concepts, both mono- and multi-fractal measures, and their application to BC across histological, cytological, and radiological data. It further explores how FC enhances dynamic morphological modeling. Finally, it considers how number-theoretic tools like p-adic analysis may represent hierarchical genomic and morphological patterns, unifying insights from tumor morphology to genome organization.</description>

Abstract: Fibrinogen is an abundant protein found in human blood plasma that plays crucial roles in various physiological processes. When nanoparticles (NPs) are introduced into a biological solution, layers of biomolecules form on their surface, creating a corona. Understanding how the structure of the protein evolves into the corona is essential for evaluating the safety and toxicity of nanotechnology. However, the influence of NP properties on protein conformation is not well understood. In this study, we propose a new method that addresses this issue by analyzing multi-component spectral data using Machine Learning (ML). We apply the method to fibrinogen at blood concentrations while interacting with hydrophobic carbon or hydrophilic silicon dioxide NPs, revealing striking differences in the temperature dependence of the protein structure between the two cases. Our unsupervised ML method a) does not suffer from the challenges associated with the curse of dimensionality, and b) simultaneously handles spectral data from various sources. The method provides a deeper understanding of the correlation between protein structure and NP interactions, which could support the development of nanomedical tools to treat various conditions.</description>

      <title>Martinize2 and Vermouth: Unified Framework for Topology Generation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2212.01191v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Ongoing advances in force field and computer hardware development enable the use of molecular dynamics (MD) to simulate increasingly complex systems with the ultimate goal of reaching cellular complexity. At the same time, rational design by high-throughput (HT) simulations is another forefront of MD. In these areas, the Martini coarse-grained force field, especially the latest version (i.e. v3), is being actively explored because it offers an enhanced spatial-temporal resolution. However, the automation tools for preparing simulations with the Martini force field, accompanying the previous version, were not designed for HT simulations or studies of complex cellular systems. Therefore, they become a major limiting factor. To address these shortcomings, we present the open-source Vermouth python library. Vermouth is designed to become the unified framework for developing programs, which prepare, run, and analyze Martini simulations of complex systems. To demonstrate the power of the Vermouth library, the Martinize2 program is showcased as a generalization of the martinize script, originally aimed to set up simulations of proteins. In contrast to the previous version, Martinize2 automatically handles protonation states in proteins and post-translation modifications, offers more options to fine-tune structural biases such as the elastic network (EN), and can convert non-protein molecules such as ligands. Finally, Martinize2 is used in two high-complexity benchmarks. The entire I-TASSER protein template database as well as a subset of 200,000 structures from the AlphaFold Protein Structure Database are converted to CG resolution and we illustrate how the checks on input structure quality can safeguard high-throughput applications.</description>

      <title>Differentiable Folding for Nearest Neighbor Model Optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.09085</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.09085v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The Nearest Neighbor model is the $\textit{de facto}$ thermodynamic model of RNA secondary structure formation and is a cornerstone of RNA structure prediction and sequence design. The current functional form (Turner 2004) contains $\approx13,000$ underlying thermodynamic parameters, and fitting these to both experimental and structural data is computationally challenging. Here, we leverage recent advances in $\textit{differentiable folding}$, a method for directly computing gradients of the RNA folding algorithms, to devise an efficient, scalable, and flexible means of parameter optimization that uses known RNA structures and thermodynamic experiments. Our method yields a significantly improved parameter set that outperforms existing baselines on all metrics, including an increase in the average predicted probability of ground-truth sequence-structure pairs for a single RNA family by over 23 orders of magnitude. Our framework provides a path towards drastically improved RNA models, enabling the flexible incorporation of new experimental data, definition of novel loss terms, large training sets, and even treatment as a module in larger deep learning pipelines. We make available a new database, RNAometer, with experimentally-determined stabilities for small RNA model systems.</description>

      <title>LLMs Outperform Experts on Challenging Biology Benchmarks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.06108</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.06108v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This study systematically evaluates 27 frontier Large Language Models on eight biology benchmarks spanning molecular biology, genetics, cloning, virology, and biosecurity. Models from major AI developers released between November 2022 and April 2025 were assessed through ten independent runs per benchmark. The findings reveal dramatic improvements in biological capabilities. Top model performance increased more than 4-fold on the challenging text-only subset of the Virology Capabilities Test over the study period, with OpenAI's o3 now performing twice as well as expert virologists. Several models now match or exceed expert-level performance on other challenging benchmarks, including the biology subsets of GPQA and WMDP and LAB-Bench CloningScenarios. Contrary to expectations, chain-of-thought did not substantially improve performance over zero-shot evaluation, while extended reasoning features in o3-mini and Claude 3.7 Sonnet typically improved performance as predicted by inference scaling. Benchmarks such as PubMedQA and the MMLU and WMDP biology subsets exhibited performance plateaus well below 100%, suggesting benchmark saturation and errors in the underlying benchmark data. The analysis highlights the need for more sophisticated evaluation methodologies as AI systems continue to advance.</description>
