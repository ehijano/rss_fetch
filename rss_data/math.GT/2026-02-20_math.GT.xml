      <title>3-decompositions of genus two handlebody-knots</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.17109</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.17109v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the class of $3$-decomposable genus two handlebody-knots and provide a complete classification of essential annuli in their exteriors. We introduce the notion of $\tau$- and $\rho$-tangles and good rectangles and annuli. By classifying $\tau$- and $\rho$-tangles whose exteriors admit a good rectangle or annulus, we categorize atoroidal $3$-decomposable genus two handlebody-knots into distinct classes, based on the number of essential annuli. As an application, the hyperbolicity of all genus two handlebody-knots with up to six crossings are determined, and numerous hyperbolic handlehody-knots with seven crossings identified. Furthermore, obstructions for a handlebody-knot to be $3$-decomposable are constructed with explicit examples provided.</description>

      <title>The realization problem of essential surfaces in knot exteriors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.17139</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.17139v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study compact orientable essential surfaces in knot exteriors in the 3-sphere. The genus $g$, the number of boundary components $b$, and the boundary slope $p/q$ are fundamental invariants of an essential surface. The \textit{realization problem} asks whether, for a given triple $(g, b, q)$ with $g \ge 0$, $b \ge 1$, and $q \ge 1$, there exists a knot $K \subset S^3$ whose exterior $E(K)$ contains a compact orientable essential surface $F$ of genus $g$ with $b$ boundary components and boundary slope $p/q$ for some $p$.
  In general, not all combinations of $(g, b, q)$ are realizable. First, we show that if $b$ is odd, then $q$ must be equal to $1$. Our main theorem states that for any given even $b \ge 2$ and $q \ge 1$, there exist a genus $g \ge 0$ and a knot $K$ such that $E(K)$ contains a compact orientable essential surface with these parameters.</description>

      <title>A $y$-ification of Khovanov homology</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.17435</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.17435v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Motivated by the $y$-ification of HOMFLY--PT homology by Gorsky and Hogancamp, and the $\mathfrak{sl}_2$-action of Gorsky, Hogancamp, and Mellit, we construct $y$-ifications of Khovanov homology and its equivariant versions within Bar-Natan's framework for tangles, and define an action of the element $e$ in $\mathfrak{sl}_2$ on these $y$-ifications. We then prove that our construction is compatible with the previous ones under Rasmussen's spectral sequence from HOMFLY--PT homology to Khovanov homology. Our construction is elementary and well suited to diagrammatic manipulations and algorithmic implementations. As a result, we verify directly that these additional structures distinguish pairs of knots with identical Khovanov homology and HOMFLY--PT homology, in particular the Conway knot and the Kinoshita--Terasaka knot.</description>

      <title>Dehn quandles of surfaces and their bounded cohomology</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.17661</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.17661v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce new families of quandles that serve as invariants for classifying closed orientable surfaces. These families generalize the classical Dehn quandle and are defined, respectively, on isotopy classes of unoriented closed curves and on integral weighted multicurves. We establish their fundamental algebraic properties and construct a natural quandle covering that relates them. We then analyze their metric properties, showing that these quandles are unbounded with respect to the quandle metric. Next, we compute their second bounded quandle cohomology, proving it to be infinite-dimensional. We also establish a version of the Gromov Mapping Theorem, showing that the natural map from an abelian quandle extension onto the original quandle induces an injection on bounded quandle cohomology in every dimension. Finally, inspired by recent developments in quandle rings, we analyze idempotents in the integral quandle rings arising from the classical Dehn quandle of a surface.</description>

      <title>Shortcut learning in geometric knot classification</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.17350</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.17350v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Classifying the topology of closed curves is a central problem in low dimensional topology with applications beyond mathematics spanning protein folding, polymer physics and even magnetohydrodynamics. The central problem is how to determine whether two embeddings of a closed arc are equivalent under ambient isotopy. Given the striking ability of neural networks to solve complex classification tasks, it is therefore natural to ask if the knot classification problem can be tackled using Machine Learning (ML). In this paper, we investigate generic shortcut methods employed by ML to solve the knot classification challenge and specifically discover hidden non-topological features in training data generated through Molecular Dynamics simulations of polygonal knots that are used by ML to arrive to positive classifications results. We then provide a rigorous foundation for future attempts to tackle the knot classification challenge using ML by developing a publicly-available (i) dataset, that aims to remove the potential of non-topological feature classification and (ii) code, that can generate knot embeddings that faithfully explore chosen geometric state space with fixed knot topology. We expect that our work will accelerate the development of ML models that can solve complex geometric knot classification challenges.</description>

      <title>Trace-free characters and abelian knot contact homology I</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/1708.00851</link>
      <description>arXiv:1708.00851v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the structure underlying Ng's conjecture, which relates the degree $0$ abelian knot contact homology of a knot $K$ to the coordinate ring of the $SL_2(\mathbf{C})$-character variety $X(\Sigma_2 K)$ of the $2$-fold branched cover of the $3$-sphere branched along $K$. Our approach is based on the study of (meridionally) trace-free characters of knot groups. For each knot $K$, they form a closed algebraic subset $S_0(K)$ of the $SL_2(\mathbf{C})$-character variety of $K$, defined by the trace-free condition on meridians. The subset $S_0(K)$, called the trace-free slice of $K$, has a natural connection to $X(\Sigma_2K)$. We show that the trace-free slice admits the structure of a $2$-fold branched cover of a closed algebraic set, called the fundamental variety, whose coordinate ring coincides with the nilradical quotient of the complexification of degree $0$ abelian knot contact homology. Using this framework, we introduce the notion of \emph{ghost characters} and prove that Ng's conjecture holds for a knot $K$ if and only if $K$ admits no ghost characters. This criterion establishes Ng's conjecture for all 2-bridge and 3-bridge knots.</description>

      <description>arXiv:1708.00874v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We show that the $(4,5)$- and $(5,6)$-torus knots admit ghost characters. Consequently, these knots provide counterexamples to Ng's conjecture, which proposes an isomorphism between the complexification of degree $0$ abelian knot contact homology and the coordinate ring of the character variety of the $2$-fold branched cover of the $3$-sphere branched along a knot. While Ng's conjecture has been verified for all $2$-bridge and $3$-bridge knots, we demonstrate, via ghost characters, how this isomorphism fails for these torus knots.</description>

      <title>On nonorientable $4$--manifolds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.20950</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.20950v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present several structural results on closed, nonorientable, smooth $4$--manifolds, extending analogous results and machinery for the orientable case. We prove the existence of simplified broken Lefschetz fibrations and simplified trisections on nonorientable $4$--manifolds, yielding descriptions of them via factorizations in mapping class groups of nonorientable surfaces. With these tools in hand, we classify low genera simplified broken Lefschetz fibrations on nonorientable $4$--manifolds. We also establish that every closed, smooth $4$--manifold is obtained by surgery along a link of tori in a connected sum of copies of $\mathbb{CP}^2$, $S^1 \times S^3$ and $S^1\widetilde{\times} S^3$. Our proofs make use of topological modifications of singularities, handlebody decompositions, and mapping classes of surfaces.</description>

      <title>On Einstein Structures for $\mathrm{SO}_0(p,p+1)$-Surface Group Representations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.12779</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.12779v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Let $S$ be a closed surface of genus $g \geq 2$. We study the cocompact domain of discontinuity $\Omega_{\rho}$ in the Einstein universe $\mathrm{Ein}^{p-1,p}$ defined by Guichard-Wienhard and Kapovich-Leeb-Porti for a class of $p$-Anosov representations $\rho:\pi_1S \rightarrow \mathrm{SO}_0(p,p+1)$ including Hitchin representations, for $p \geq 3$. The quotient $M_{\rho} = \rho(\pi_1S)\backslash \Omega_{\rho}$ is abstractly known to be realizable as a fiber bundle over $S$, with unknown fiber of unique homotopy type $F_{\rho}$. We explicitly exhibit $M_{\rho}$ as a smooth $\mathfrak{F}_{\rho}$-fiber bundle over $S$, determining the diffeomorphism type of $M_{\rho}$ and the unique homotopy type $F_{\rho}$. Surprisingly, in many situations the fiber bundle $\mathfrak{F}_{\rho} \rightarrow M_{\rho}\rightarrow S$ is trivial.</description>
