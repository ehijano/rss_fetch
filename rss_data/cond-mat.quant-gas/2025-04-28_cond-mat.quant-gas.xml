      <title>Anisotropic dynamic excitations in a two-dimensional Fulde-Ferrell superfluid</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.18117</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.18117v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: By calculating the dynamical structure factor of a two-dimensional (2D) Fulde-Ferrell superfluid system, the anisotropic dynamical excitations are studied systematically using random phase approximation (RPA). Our calculation results not only establish the interaction strength and the Zeeman field dependencies of the phase diagram, but also reveal the evolution of the collective modes and the single-particle excitations during the phase transition from the Bardeen-Cooper-Schrieffer (BCS) superfluid to the FF superfluid, particularly their competition with each other. The calculation results demonstrate that the optimal combination of two parameters (the interaction strength and Zeeman field) exists for finding an FF superfluid. With the increase of the angle between the transferred momentum and the center-of-mass (COM) momentum, the collective phonon mode exhibits a sharp resonance signature at small angles, which gradually diminishes as it merges into the single-particle excitations, then reappears at large angles. In an FF superfluid, the sound speed along the COM momentum direction increases with the Zeeman field strength while decreases with the interaction strength, displaying contrasting behavior compared to a BCS superfluid whereas the sound speed remains nearly constant. Notably, a remarkable roton-like dispersion emerges along the COM momentum direction while it is absent in the opposite direction. These theoretical predictions provide crucial guidance for the experimental search and study of an FF superfluid.</description>

      <title>Dark Superradiance in Cavity-Coupled Polar Molecular Bose-Einstein Condensates</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.18125</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.18125v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose an experimental scheme to realize phase transition from {\it dark superradiance} to conventional superradiance in a microwave cavity coupled to polar molecules. The competition between cavity-mediated infinite-range repulsions and finite-range attractive dipolar interactions stabilizes a variety of exotic quantum phases, including vortex, vortex anti-vortex pairs, and superradiant phase, all emerging without external driving fields. In vortex phase associated with {\it dark superradiance}, cavity remains in vacuum state while profoundly reshaping the condensate's ground-state wave functions. In particular, the spin configuration locally parallel but globally anti-parallel is a direct consequence of competing for two nonlocal interactions. Beyond Dicke paradigm, dipolar dressing of condensate enables access to an unexplored regime of repulsion-dominated superradiance. A Bogoliubov analysis of low-energy excitation spectrum confirms that the condensate remains stable, avoiding roton-maxon induced collapse even in strongly dipolar regime.</description>

      <title>Quantum droplets in a beyond-mean-field density-dependent gauge theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.18220</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.18220v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The beyond-mean-field corrections appropriate to a bosonic many-body system experiencing a density-dependent gauge potential are derived, and from this the dimensional hierarchy of quantum droplet solutions are explored. Non-stationary quantum droplet solutions are supported by a single interaction parameter characterising the strength of the gauge potential, while in one dimension the beyond-mean-field theory can be solved exactly to yield chiral quantum droplets and dark soliton-like excitations. Numerical simulations of single and pairs of chiral droplets indicate a rich dynamics in the beyond-mean-field regime.</description>

      <title>PT-symmetry breaking phase transitions in an LMG dimer</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.18426</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.18426v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The open Lipkin-Meshkov-Glick (LMG) model provides a prototype of a dissipative phase transition which can be analyzed using mean-field theory. By combining the physics of this model with those of a quantum analogue of a parity-time reversal symmetry breaking transition we analyze the steady states phase diagram of a pair of coupled LMG models. The interplay of these two distinct physical effects leads to a complex phase diagram with multiple different types of steady state. We show that the effects predicted from mean-field theory survive in the full quantum model.</description>

      <title>Vortices in the Many-Body Excited States of Interacting Bosons in Two Dimension</title>

Abstract: Quantum vortices play an important role in the physics of two-dimensional quantum many-body systems, though they usually are understood in the single-particle framework like the mean-field approach. Inspired by the study on the relations between solitons and yrast states, we investigate here the emergence of vortices from the eigenstates of a N -body Hamiltonian of interacting particles trapped in a disk. We analyse states that appear by consecutively measuring the positions of particles. These states have densities, phases, and energies closely resembling mean-field vortices. We discuss similarities, but also point out purely many-body features, such as vortex smearing due to the quantum fluctuation of their center. The ab initio analysis of the many-body system, and mean-field approaches are supported by the analysis within the Bogoliubov approach.</description>

      <title>Probing Hilbert Space Fragmentation with Strongly Interacting Rydberg Atoms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.13790</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.13790v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Hilbert space fragmentation provides a mechanism to break ergodicity in closed many-body systems. Here, we propose a feasible scheme to explore this exotic paradigm on a Rydberg quantum simulator. We show that the Rydberg Ising model in the large detuning regime can be mapped to a generalized folded XXZ model featuring a strongly fragmented Hilbert space. The emergent Hamiltonian, however, displays distinct time scales for the transport of a magnon and a hole excitation. This interesting property facilitates a continuous tuning of the Krylov-subspace ergodicity, from the integrable regime, to the Krylov-restricted thermal phase, and eventually to the statistical bubble localization region. By further introducing nonlocal interactions, we find that both the fragmentation behavior and the ergodicity of the Krylov subspace can be significantly enriched. We also examine the role of atomic position disorders and identify a symmetry-selective many-body localization transition. We demonstrate that these phenomena manifest themselves in quench dynamics, which can be readily probed in state-of-the-art Rydberg array setups.</description>

      <title>Entanglement swapping in critical quantum spin chains</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.12377</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.12377v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The transfer of quantum information between many-qubit states is a subject of fundamental importance in quantum science and technology. We consider entanglement swapping in critical quantum spin chains, where the entanglement between the two chains is induced solely by the Bell-state measurements. We employ a boundary conformal field theory (CFT) approach and describe the measurements as conformal boundary conditions in the replicated field theory. We show that the swapped entanglement exhibits a logarithmic scaling, whose coefficient takes a universal value determined by the scaling dimension of the boundary condition changing operator. We apply our framework to the critical spin-1/2 XXZ chain and determine the universal coefficient by the boundary CFT analysis. We also numerically verify these results by the tensor-network calculations. Possible experimental relevance to Rydberg atom arrays is briefly discussed.</description>

      <title>Phonon thermal Hall as a lattice Aharonov-Bohm effect</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.18236</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.18236v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In a growing list of insulators, experiments find a misalignment between the heat flux and the thermal gradient vectors induced by magnetic field. This phenomenon, known as the phonon thermal Hall effect, implies energy flow without entropy production along the orientation perpendicular to the temperature gradient. Experiments find that the thermal Hall angle is maximal at the temperature at which the longitudinal thermal conductivity peaks. At this temperature, $T_{max}$, Normal phonon-phonon collisions (which do not produce entropy) dominate Umklapp and boundary scattering events (which do). In the presence of a magnetic field, Born-Oppenheimer approximated molecular wave functions are known to acquire a geometric [Berry] phase. Its origin is the difference in the spatial distributions of the positive charge of the nuclei and the negative charge of the electron cloud. The magnetic flux is negligible for the point-like nuclei, but not for the electron cloud. Therefore, the molecular wave-function becomes a complex number in the presence of the magnetic field. In a crystal, this implies a complex amplitude for transverse acoustic phonons, modifying three-phonon interference patterns, and twisting the quasi-momentum of the outgoing phonon. The rough amplitude of the thermal Hall angle expected in this picture is set by the wavelength, $\lambda_{ph}$, and the crest displacement amplitude, $u_m$, of transverse acoustic phonons at $T_{max}$. The derived expression is surprisingly close to what has been experimentally found in black phosphorus, germanium and silicon.</description>
