      <title>Towards improved understanding of spontaneous imbibition into dry porous media using pore-scale direct numerical simulations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.02831</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.02831v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Traditional approaches to mathematically describe spontaneous imbibition are usually based on either macro-scale models, such as Richards equation, or simplified pore-scale models, such as the bundle of capillary tubes (BCTM) or pore-network modeling (PNM). It is well known that such models cannot provide full microscopic details of the multiphase flow processes and that many pore-scale mechanisms still lack proper mathematical descriptions. To improve the predictive capabilities of traditional models, a fundamental understanding of pore-scale dynamics is needed. The focus of this paper is obtaining detailed insight and consistent explanation of particular processes during capillary-controlled water imbibition into dry porous media. We use two-dimensional model geometries and perform fully dynamic volume-of-fluid based direct numerical simulations of air-water multiphase flow at the pore-scale, to study processes that generally are not considered in traditional models. More specifically, we investigate differences between converging and diverging geometries, dynamic pressure and meniscus reconfiguration during pore-filling events, and the influence of inertia and pore size on imbibition dynamics and the occurrence of capillary barriers. Furthermore, we perform a detailed comparison between non-interacting and interacting BCTM and study the impact of the narrow contractions on imbibition dynamics and the trapping of the non-wetting phase. Obtained knowledge can be used to improve predictive models, which are broadly relevant considering the importance of spontaneous imbibition in many different natural and industrial processes.</description>

      <title>Phase Transitions in Anisotropic Turbulence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.02844</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.02844v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Turbulence is a widely observed state of fluid flows, characterized by complex, nonlinear interactions between motions across a broad spectrum of length and time scales. While turbulence is ubiquitous, from teacups to planetary atmospheres, oceans and stars, its manifestations can vary considerably between different physical systems. For instance, three-dimensional (3D) turbulent flows display a forward energy cascade from large to small scales, while in two-dimensional (2D) turbulence, energy cascades from small to large scales. In a given physical system, a transition between such disparate regimes of turbulence can occur when a control parameter reaches a critical value. The behavior of flows close to such transition points, which separate qualitatively distinct \textit{phases} of turbulence, has been found to be unexpectedly rich. Here, we survey recent findings on such transitions in highly anisotropic turbulent fluid flows, including turbulence in thin layers and under the influence of rapid rotation. We also review recent work on transitions induced by turbulent fluctuations, such as random reversals and transitions between large-scale vortices and jets, among others. The relevance of these results and their ramifications for future investigations are discussed.</description>

      <title>Unsteady separation and oscillations in a compressible wake of a cylinder</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.02933</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.02933v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The paper presents a new analysis and a new interpretation of oscillations observed in the experiments of near wakes of cylinders at Mach 4 and Mach 6 and Reynolds number range 2 $\times$ 10$^4$ to 5 $\times$ 10$^5$ by \cite{schmidt2015oscillations} and \cite{thasu2022strouhal}. It is shown that the presence of such oscillations is strongly Reynolds number dependent. It is further shown that there is a threshold Reynolds number below which wake unsteadiness and oscillations do not appear. Attention is drawn to the earlier experimental investigation of supersonic wakes behind cylinders and spheres by \cite{kendall1962exp} which discusses cylinder oscillations and confirms the concept of threshold Reynolds number. Following the earlier work of \cite{goldburg1965strouhal} on hypersonic wakes of spheres and cones, a Strouhal number($St_\theta$) based on total wake momentum thickness ($\theta$) is shown to be the relevant similarity parameter for correlating the hypersonic and high supersonic wakes of spheres, cones, as well as cylinders. In this limited sense, $St_\theta$ can be said to be `universal'. A universal Strouhal number based on only one geometry (\textit{i.e.,} a circular cylinder) and over a limited Reynolds number range as proposed by \cite{schmidt2015oscillations} is much too restrictive.</description>

      <title>A unified transition mechanism from shock to detonation waves</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.03042</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.03042v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The transition of shock-to-detonation is of great significance for the investigation of supernova formation, disaster prevention and supersonic propulsion technology. In this paper, the influence Equation of shock-to-detonation transition is summarized for the oblique detonation problem from aerodynamic analysis. The Equation integrates the effects of parameters such as chemical reaction, shock intensity and wall conditions, which quantitatively explains the physical mechanism of shock-to-detonation transition in the form of mathematical expression. Comparison with numerical simulation results as well as their gradients verified the reliability of the influence Equation. Further, the influence Equation can also be used to predict the critical conditions for the transition from shock to detonation transition form. In addition to oblique detonation, the influence Equation is compatible with the deflagration-to-detonation problem for normal detonation, which shows a wide applicability.</description>

      <title>Considerations on free-surface detachment and bed entrainment of fluvial plastics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.03081</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.03081v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Over the last decade, fluvial plastics have been identified as major threat to aquatic environments and human health. In order to develop adequate mitigation strategies for plastic pollution, a fundamental process understanding of riverine plastic transport is of significant importance. In this context, the implementation of research findings into numerical simulation environments is anticipated to enhance modelling capabilities and to support a rigorous decision making. Recent experimental research has focused on the incipient motion of plastic particles, as well as on the effects of surface tension on plastic concentration profiles. While these investigations have advanced the state-of-the-art knowledge, current literature still displays a lack of basic insights into layer-specific plastic transport physics. In this study, first principles are applied to advance knowledge on free-surface detachment and bed entrainment of fluvial plastics. A novel relationship for the critical surface detachment velocity is derived, followed by the development of a framework that allows to relate plastic Shields parameters to those of natural sediments. Overall, it is anticipated that these developments will trigger new research within the plastics community, and it is hoped that present findings will be implemented into Lagrangian particle tracking software.</description>

      <title>Dynamics of a Data-Driven Low-Dimensional Model of Turbulent Minimal Pipe Flow</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.03135</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.03135v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The simulation of turbulent flow requires many degrees of freedom to resolve all the relevant times and length scales. However, due to the dissipative nature of the Navier-Stokes equations, the long-term dynamics are expected to lie on a finite-dimensional invariant manifold with fewer degrees of freedom. In this study, we build low-dimensional data-driven models of pressure-driven flow through a circular pipe. We impose the `shift-and-reflect' symmetry to study the system in a minimal computational cell (e.g., smallest domain size that sustains turbulence) at a Reynolds number of 2500. We build these models by using autoencoders to parametrize the manifold coordinates and neural ODEs to describe their time evolution. Direct numerical simulations (DNS) typically require on the order of O(105) degrees of freedom, while our data-driven framework enables the construction of models with fewer than 20 degrees of freedom. Remarkably, these reduced order models effectively capture crucial features of the flow, including the streak breakdown. In short-time tracking, these models accurately track the true trajectory for one Lyapunov time, while at long-times, they successfully capture key aspects of the dynamics such as Reynolds stresses and energy balance. Additionally, we report a library of exact coherent states (ECS) found in the DNS with the aid of these low-dimensional models. This approach leads to the discovery of seventeen previously unknown solutions within the turbulent pipe flow system, notably featuring relative periodic orbits characterized by the longest reported periods for such flow conditions.</description>

      <title>The impact of transience in the interaction between orographic gravity waves and mean flow</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.03139</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.03139v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A Lagrangian gravity-wave parameterization (MS-GWaM, Multi-Scale Gravity-Wave Model) that allows for fully transient wave-mean-flow interaction and horizontal propagation is applied to orographic gravity waves for the first time. Both linear and nonlinear mountain waves are modeled in idealized simulations within the pseudo-incompressible flow solver PincFlow. Two-dimensional flows over monochromatic orographies are considered, using MS-GWaM either in its fully transient implementation or in a steady-state implementation that represents classic mountain-wave parameterizations. Comparisons of wave-resolving simulations (not using MS-GWaM) and coarse-resolution simulations (using MS-GWaM) show that allowing for transience leads to a significantly more accurate forcing of the resolved mean flow. The model is able to reproduce the transient forcing of linearly generated mountain waves that slowly propagate upwards, in contrast to the instantaneous distribution of wave energy in classic parameterizations. At high altitudes, wave breaking induces a wind reversal that is captured by the transient model but inhibited in steady-state simulations, due to the assumption of critical level formation. This shows that transience can have a substantial impact in the interaction between mountain waves and mean flow.</description>

      <title>On the unsteady aerodynamics of flapping wings under dynamic hovering kinematics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.03222</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.03222v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Hummingbirds and insects achieve outstanding flight performance by adapting their flapping motion to the flight requirements. Their wing kinematics can change from smooth flapping to highly dynamic waveforms, generating unsteady aerodynamic phenomena such as leading-edge vortices (LEV), rotational circulation, wing wake capture, and added mass. This article uncovers the interactions of these mechanisms in the case of a rigid semi-elliptical wing undergoing aggressive kinematics in the hovering regime at $Re\sim \mathcal{O}(10^3)$. The flapping kinematics were parametrized using smoothed steps and triangular functions and the flow dynamics were simulated by combining the overset method with Large Eddy Simulations (LES). The analysis of the results identifies an initial acceleration phase and a cruising phase. During the former, the flow is mostly irrotational and governed by the added mass effect. The added mass was shown to be responsible for a lift first peak due to the strong flapping acceleration. The dynamic pitching and the wing wake interaction generate a second lift peak due to a downwash flow and a vortex system on the proximal and distal parts of the wing's pressure side. Conversely, aerodynamic forces in the cruising phase are mainly governed by the growth and the establishment of the LEV. Finally, the leading flow structures in each phase and their impact on the aerodynamic forces were isolated using the extended Proper Orthogonal Decomposition (POD).</description>

      <title>A probabilistic framework for learning non-intrusive corrections to long-time climate simulations from short-time training data</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.02688v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Chaotic systems, such as turbulent flows, are ubiquitous in science and engineering. However, their study remains a challenge due to the large range scales, and the strong interaction with other, often not fully understood, physics. As a consequence, the spatiotemporal resolution required for accurate simulation of these systems is typically computationally infeasible, particularly for applications of long-term risk assessment, such as the quantification of extreme weather risk due to climate change. While data-driven modeling offers some promise of alleviating these obstacles, the scarcity of high-quality simulations results in limited available data to train such models, which is often compounded by the lack of stability for long-horizon simulations. As such, the computational, algorithmic, and data restrictions generally imply that the probability of rare extreme events is not accurately captured. In this work we present a general strategy for training neural network models to non-intrusively correct under-resolved long-time simulations of chaotic systems. The approach is based on training a post-processing correction operator on under-resolved simulations nudged towards a high-fidelity reference. This enables us to learn the dynamics of the underlying system directly, which allows us to use very little training data, even when the statistics thereof are far from converged. Additionally, through the use of probabilistic network architectures we are able to leverage the uncertainty due to the limited training data to further improve extrapolation capabilities. We apply our framework to severely under-resolved simulations of quasi-geostrophic flow and demonstrate its ability to accurately predict the anisotropic statistics over time horizons more than 30 times longer than the data seen in training.</description>

      <title>Inner core heterogeneity induced by a large variation in lower mantle heat flux</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.03158</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.03158v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Seismic mapping of the top of the inner core indicates two distinct areas of high P-wave velocity, the stronger one located beneath Asia, and the other located beneath the Atlantic. This two-fold pattern supports the idea that a lower-mantle heterogeneity can be transmitted to the inner core through outer core convection. In this study, a two-component convective dynamo model, where thermal convection is near critical and compositional convection is strongly supercritical, produces a substantial inner core heterogeneity in the rapidly rotating strongly driven regime of Earth's core. While the temperature profile that models secular cooling ensures that the mantle heterogeneity propagates as far as the inner core boundary (ICB), the distribution of heat flux at the ICB is determined by the strength of compositional buoyancy. A large heat flux variation $q^*$ of $O(10)$ at the core-mantle boundary (CMB), where $q^*$ is the ratio of the maximum heat flux difference to the mean heat flux at the CMB, produces a core flow regime of long-lived convection in the east and time-varying convection in the west. Here, the P-wave velocity estimated from the ICB heat flux in the dynamo is higher in the east than in the west, with the hemispherical difference of the same order as the observed lower bound, 0.5%. Additional observational constraints are satisfied in this regime -- the variability of high-latitude magnetic flux in the east is lower than that in the west; and the stratified F-layer at the base of the outer core, which is fed by the mass flux from regional melting of the inner core and magnetically damped, attains a steady-state height of $\sim$ 200 km.</description>

      <title>Flow-induced vibration of a flexible cantilever in tandem configuration</title>

      <description>arXiv:2309.12580v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The present work investigates the fluid-structure interaction (FSI) of a flexible cylindrical cantilever in a tandem configuration. A fully coupled fluid-structure solver based on the three-dimensional incompressible Navier-Stokes equations and Euler-Bernoulli beam equation is employed to numerically examine the coupled dynamics of the cantilever. We assess the extent to which such a flexible structure could sustain oscillations in both subcritical and post-critical regimes of Reynolds number ($Re$). Spatio-temporal power transfer patterns, response amplitudes, and vorticity dynamics are quantified and compared between isolated and tandem configurations. Results of our analysis indicate that the cantilever in tandem configuration is prone to sustained oscillations dependent on $Re$ and the reduced velocity parameter ($U^*$). In the subcritical $Re$ regime, the cantilever exhibits sustained oscillations with peak transverse oscillation amplitudes occurring within a specific range of $U^*$. Within this range, the transverse oscillations demonstrate lock-in behavior and synchronization with the vortex shedding frequency. The vorticity dynamics in the subcritical $Re$ regime reveal that in the tandem configuration, the presence of the upstream cylinder significantly modifies the wake structure, delaying vortex formation and extending the near wake. In the post-critical $Re$ regime, the cantilever shows a broader range of sustained oscillations in terms of $U^*$, with single- and multi-frequency dynamics driven by vortex-body interactions. The power transfer analysis shows cyclic energy exchange patterns between the fluid and flexible structure, with significant variations in the hydrodynamic loading along the cantilever. The findings of this work help broaden the understanding of sustained oscillations in flexible cantilevers and are relevant to the design of cantilever flow sensors.</description>

      <title>Time-Dependent Low-Rank Input-Output Operator for Forced Linearized Dynamics with Unsteady Base Flows</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.00790</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.00790v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Understanding the linear growth of disturbances due to external forcing is crucial for flow stability analysis, flow control, and uncertainty quantification. These applications typically require a large number of forward simulations of the forced linearized dynamics, often in a brute-force fashion. When dealing with simple steady-state or periodic base flows, there exist powerful and cost-effective solution operator techniques. Once these solution operators are constructed, they can be used to determine the response to various forcings with negligible computational cost. However, these methods do not apply to problems with arbitrarily time-dependent base flows. This paper develops and investigates reduced-order modeling with time-dependent bases (TDBs) to build low-rank solution operators for forced linearized dynamics with arbitrarily time-dependent base flows. In particular, we use forced optimally time-dependent decomposition (f-OTD), which extracts the time-dependent correlated structures of the flow response to various excitations. Several demonstrations are included to illustrate the utility of the f-OTD low-rank approximation for performing global transient stability analysis. Additionally, we demonstrate the application of f-OTD in computing the post-transient response of linearized Navier-Stokes equations to a large number of impulses, which has applications in flow control.</description>

      <title>Periodically activated physics-informed neural networks for assimilation tasks for three-dimensional Rayleigh-B\'enard convection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.02970</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.02970v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We apply physics-informed neural networks to three-dimensional Rayleigh-B\'enard convection in a cubic cell with a Rayleigh number of Ra = 10^6 and a Prandtl number of Pr = 0.7 to assimilate the velocity vector field from given temperature fields and vice versa. With the respective ground truth data provided by a direct numerical simulation, we are able to evaluate the performance of the different activation functions applied (sine, hyperbolic tangent and exponential linear unit) and different numbers of neurons (32, 64, 128, 256) for each of the five hidden layers of the multi-layer perceptron. The main result is that the use of a periodic activation function (sine) typically benefits the assimilation performance in terms of the analyzed metrics, correlation with the ground truth and mean average error. The higher quality of results from sine-activated physics-informed neural networks is also manifested in the probability density function and power spectra of the inferred velocity or temperature fields. Regarding the two assimilation directions, the assimilation of temperature fields based on velocities appears to be more challenging in the sense that it exhibits a sharper limit on the number of neurons below which viable assimilation results can not be achieved.</description>

      <title>A unified framework for prediction of vortex-induced vibration based on the nonlinear data-driven identification of general wake oscillator modeling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.04538</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.04538v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we present novel identification strategies to develop a unified framework for vortex-induced vibration (VIV) prediction based on the general semi-empirical wake oscillator. Greybox nonlinear system identification method accompanying high-fidelity computational fluid dynamics (CFD) and/or experimental data could be applied for the identification process. The proposed template of general wake oscillators contains low- to high-order damping terms to be identified for characterizing the possible flow dynamics. Two different strategies, including individual identification of single wake oscillator and overall identification of coupled VIV control equations, are proposed. VIV system consisting of an elastically-mounted circular cylinder submerged in laminar flow at Reynold number of 100 is considered. Both strategies have been tested and have exhibited high accuracy. The second strategy, i.e., overall identification of coupled VIV control equations, would be more suitable for the future framework owing that its training process considers the effect of fluid damping. A detailed mathematical introduction to future works on framework development covering the wide Reynold number range is addressed. The proposed unified framework is a landmark update of past wake oscillators both in terms of prediction accuracy and physical principles and has considerable research significance and practical engineering value.</description>

Abstract: Self-similar dynamics, often described by partial differential equations (PDEs) without noise terms, have been widely observed in nature and have attracted considerable attention from researchers in various fields, including physics, fluid mechanics, applied mathematics, and chemical engineering. The concept of universality class and the renormalization group (RG) theory, emerged from critical phenomena, which also have been widely observed in nature, are pillars of modern physics, with guiding the recent development of physics. While self-similarity appearing in fluid dynamics reminds physicists of critical phenomena, deep connections between them have not been explored. Here, we focus on a variation of a daily phenomenon, a drop falling from a faucet, and demonstrate self-similar dynamics for the shape of liquid-air interface in confined space with a scaling law for a characteristic length scale, which leads to a clear correspondence between the present self-similar dynamics and critical phenomena by identifying critical exponents, which define a universality class. We not only show that the observed master curve describing the self-similar shape is a solution to the Navier-Stokes equations, but also develop a renormalization group (RG) theory for the governing PDE to show the fixed point of RG corresponds to the solution, which becomes stable with time due to a scaling crossover. Our results will impact on our understanding of critical, scaling, and singular behaviors widely observed in nature.</description>
