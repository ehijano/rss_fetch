      <title>The model fitting of Gaia DR3 Classical Cepheid light and radial velocity curves</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.22635</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.22635v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Classical Cepheids are key astrophysical laboratories for studying stellar structure and evolution, and for calibrating the cosmic distance scale. Despite major progress, uncertainties remain regarding their masses, luminosities, distances, and the role of processes like core overshooting, rotation, and mass loss. The high-precision data from ESA Gaia's third data release offer an opportunity to address these issues. This study aims to estimate the structural parameters and distances of a sample of Classical Cepheids using non-linear convective pulsation models. It also tests the consistency of Gaia parallaxes, constrains the Mass Luminosity relation, and investigates the dependence of the projection factor (p-factor) on pulsation period. We analysed 46 Cepheids with precise Gaia DR3 photometry and radial velocities. Model fitting was performed by comparing predicted and observed light curves in Gaia G, GBP, and GRP bands, and radial velocity curves. Distances from the models were compared with Gaia parallaxes, including published corrections. Predicted masses and luminosities were used to constrain the ML relation; radial velocities allowed independent pfactor estimates. Distances show statistical agreement with Gaia parallaxes, requiring no additional global offset. Inferred masses and luminosities are consistent with evolution models including mild core overshooting, mass loss, or rotation. No significant period dependence of the pfactor is found, with a constant value of p = 1.22+/-0.05, consistent with recent studies. Results also agree with the Period-Wesenheit-Metallicity relation from Gaia DR3.</description>

      <title>Double Compact Binary Merger Rate Density in Open Star Clusters: Black Holes, Neutron Stars, and White Dwarfs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.22673</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.22673v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Studying compact-object binary mergers in star clusters is crucial for understanding stellar evolution and dynamical interactions in galaxies. Open clusters in particular are more abundant over cosmic time than globular clusters, however, previous research on low-mass clusters with $\lesssim 10^3~\textrm{M}_{\odot}$ has focused on binary black holes (BBHs) or black hole-neutron star (BH-NS) binaries. Binary mergers of other compact objects, such as white dwarfs (WDs), are also crucial as progenitors of transient phenomena such as Type Ia supernovae and Fast Radio Bursts. We present simulations of three types of open clusters with masses of $10^2$, $10^3$, and $10^4~\mathrm{M}_{\odot}$. In massive clusters with $\gtrsim 10^4~\textrm{M}_{\odot}$, BBHs are dynamically formed, however, less massive compact binaries such as WD-WD and WD-NS are perturbed inside the star clusters, causing them to evolve into other objects. We further find BH-NS mergers only in $10^3~\textrm{M}_{\odot}$ clusters. Considering star clusters with a typical open cluster mass, we observe that WD-WD merger rates slightly increase for $10^3~\textrm{M}_{\odot}$ clusters but decrease for $10^2~\textrm{M}_{\odot}$ clusters. Since the host clusters are tidally disrupted, most of them merge outside of the clusters. Our WD-WD merger results have further implications for two classes of transients. Super-Chandrasekhar WD-WD mergers are present in our simulations, demonstrating potential sources of Fast Radio Bursts at a rate of 70-780 Gpc$^{-3}$yr$^{-1}$, higher than the rate estimated for globular clusters. Additionally, we find that Carbon-Oxygen WD-WD mergers in our open clusters (34-640 $\textrm{Gpc}^{-3}$yr$^{-1}$) only account for 0.14-2.6% of the observed Type Ia supernova rate in our local Universe.</description>

      <title>Meridional Movements of Individual Sunspots and Pores</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.22751</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.22751v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The analysis of the meridional displacement velocity of individual solar pores and sunspots has been performed. In the period May 2010\,-\,March 2025 of observations in the continuum of the \textit{Solar Dynamics Observatory/Helioseismic and Magnetic Imager} (SDO/HMI), we identified more than $3.6\cdot 10^{5}$ sunspots and pores for analysis and tracked their displacement. The velocity of the meridional displacement of spots $v_{\rm m}$ depends on their magnetic polarity, latitude, and stage of development. For sunspots and pores of trailing polarity, the velocity of movement is on average directed toward the poles. For such spots, the dependence of the velocity on latitude can be represented by linear regressions for pores: $v^{\rm pr}_{\rm tr} \approx 2.0+0.62\cdot \theta^{\rm o}$ m s$^{-1}$; for sunspots: $v^{\rm sp}_{\rm tr}\approx 0.02+0.94\cdot \theta ^{\rm o}$ m s$^{-1}$. For sunspots and pores of leading polarity, the dependence is non-monotonic in nature on latitude. For pores: $v^{\rm pr}_{\rm ld}\approx 0.35-11.7\cdot {\rm sin}(\theta)+16.5\cdot {\rm sin}^{\rm 2} (\theta) +76.5\cdot {\rm sin}^3 (\theta)-32.7\cdot {\rm sin}^{4}(\theta )$ m s$^{-1}$; for sunspots: $v^{\rm sp}_{\rm ld}\approx -0.35-18.3\cdot {\rm sin}(\theta)+32.2\cdot {\rm sin}^{\rm 2}(\theta) +71.4\cdot {\rm sin}^{\rm 3} (\theta)-6.7\cdot {\rm sin}^{\rm 4}(\theta)$ m s$^{-1}$. The highest speed of meridional movement to the poles is observed for sunspots of trailing polarity during the phase of growth of the sunspot area. The velocity of the meridional movement depends on their area, reaching a maximum for an area of $S\approx 80 - 100$ $\mu$sh.</description>

      <title>Deep survey of millimeter RRLs towards the planetary nebulae IC 418 and NGC 7027</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.23256</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.23256v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The circumstellar environments of PNe are wonderful chemically rich astrophysical laboratories in which the ionization of atoms and the formation of simple and complex molecules can be studied. The new high-sensitivity receivers open the possibility to carry out deep observations, essential to unveil weak atomic and molecular spectra in the mm range. The main goal of this work is to study the emission lines detected in the spectra of the bright C-rich PNe IC 418 and NGC 7027 and to identify all those emission features associated with radio recombination lines (RRLs) of light elements. We aim to analyze the RRLs detected on each source, and to model the sources and derive their physical parameters. This work allows us to provide the most complete and updated catalog of RRLs in space, carried out at 2, 3 and 7 mm with the IRAM 30m and the Yebes 40m radio telescopes. We compare these observational data sets with synthetic models produced with the radiation transfer code Co3RaL. Our observations reveal the presence of several H and He I RRLs at mm wavelengths in the spectra of IC 418 and NGC 7027 and also of HeIIi RRLs in the spectrum of NGC 7027. Many of these lines had remained undetected until now due to their weakness and the lack of high-sensitivity observations at these frequencies. The data also confirm the absence of molecular emission towards IC 418, above a detection level of ~3 mK [Tmb]. These mm observations represent the most extended RRL line survey of two C-rich PNe carried out so far, with most of the lines never reported before. These extremely complete catalogs evidence the importance of high-sensitivity observations and are expected to be very helpful in the line identification process in mm observations, in particular for still unknown or poorly characterized molecular species existing in the vicinity of ionized environments.</description>

      <title>Evolutionary Map of the Universe: Detection and Analysis of the Shell Surrounding the Runaway Wolf-Rayet Star WR16</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.23588</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.23588v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present the first radio--continuum detection of the circumstellar shell around the well-known WN8 type Wolf-Rayet star WR16 at 943.5\,MHz using the \ac{ASKAP} \ac{EMU} survey. At this frequency, the shell has a measured flux density of 72.2$\pm$7.2\,mJy. Using previous \ac{ATCA} measurements at 2.4, 4.8, and 8.64~GHz, as well as the \ac{EMU} observations of the star itself, we determine a spectral index of $\alpha\,=\,+0.74\pm0.02$, indicating thermal emission. We propose that the shell and star both exhibit thermal emission, supported by the its appearance in near-infrared and H$\alpha$ observations. The latest \textit{Gaia} parallax is used to determine a distance of 2.28$\pm$0.09\,kpc. This star is well-known for its surrounding circular nebulosity, and using the distance and an angular diameter of 8\farcm42, we determine the shell size to be 5.57$\pm$0.22~pc. We use the \textit{Gaia} \acp{PM} of WR16 to determine peculiar velocities of the star as $V_{\alpha}(pec) =$ --45.3$\pm$5.4\,\kms\ and $V_{\delta}(pec) =$ 22.8$\pm$4.7\,\kms, which indicates that the star is moving in a north-west direction, and translates to a peculiar tangential velocity to be 50.7$\pm$6.9\,\kms. We also use these \acp{PM} to determine the shell's origin, estimate an age of $\sim 9500\pm 1300$\,yr, and determine its average expansion velocity to be $280\pm40$\,\kms. This average expansion velocity suggests that the previous transitional phase is a \ac{LBV} phase, rather than a \ac{RSG} phase. We also use the measured flux at 943.5~MHz to determine a mass-loss rate of $1.753\times 10^{-5}~M_\odot~$yr$^{-1}$, and use this to determine a lower-limit on ionising photons of $N_{UV} &gt; 1.406\times 10^{47}~$s$^{-1}$.</description>

      <title>The hydrodynamic thermal continuum, with applications to stratified atmospheres and 1D coronal loop models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.23591</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.23591v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Using both analytical and numerical means, we demonstrate that linear stability analysis of a hydrodynamic stratified atmosphere or a 1D coronal loop model in non-adiabatic settings features a thermal continuum corresponding to highly localized eigenfunctions. This thermal continuum can be precomputed, involving the net heat-loss function and its partial derivatives, and is the generalization of the thermal instability introduced by~\citet{Parker1953}. We account for a thermal imbalance, directly affecting thermal instability growthrates.
  We present completely general equations that govern all eigenmodes, including non-adiabatically affected p- and g-modes of the stratified settings. We intend to clarify how linear thermal instability is relevant for solar loops that show spontaneous in-situ condensations, and eliminate recent confusion on specific isochoric routes to linear instability alongside other thermal instability channels. The thermal continuum, previously identified as a crucial ingredient in magnetohydrodynamic eigenmode spectra for coronal loops and atmospheres, drives multithermal aspects across our universe, such as forming solar coronal rain and prominences, or cold cloud creation in intracluster to interstellar medium environments.</description>

      <title>Is convective turbulence the only exciting mechanism of global p modes in the Sun?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.23686</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.23686v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In solar-like oscillators, acoustic waves are excited by turbulent motion in the convective envelope and propagate inward, generating a variety of standing pressure modes. When combining together the power of several solar acoustic modes, an excess not compatible with pure stochastic excitation was found in some studies. This could be the signature of a second mode excitation source. With over 27 years of helioseismic data from the Sun as a star observations by the Solar and Heliospheric Observatory (SoHO), we aim to study the variation in mode energy over this period, covering solar Cycles 23, 24, and the beginning of Cycle 25. We focus on the possible sources of high peaks in the mode-energy time series, i.e. instrumental problems or other exciting mechanisms, such as flares or Coronal Mass Ejections. We reconstruct the energy time series for each mode with a sampling time of 1.45 days. By combining the small-time-scale variations in energy for several low-degree modes in the 2090-3710uHz range, we study the correlation between the modes and their compatibility with the hypothesis that modes are only stochastically excited by convection. The observed excitation rate significantly deviates from what would be expected in the case of a purely stochastic excitation. Our results indicate that this energy excess cannot be only attributed to instrumental effects and does not exhibit a cyclic variation. Although high-energy excesses are occasionally associated with observations of flares or CMEs, no consistent pattern could be identified. The excitation is slightly more frequent for modes probing the upper layer of the convective zone. Furthermore, the energy supply rate seems to vary over time with the mean value following a modulation that can match the Quasi-Biennial Oscillation (QBO) observed in other solar indicators, and the variance being anti-correlated with the cycle.</description>

      <title>Measuring the Suns radial velocity variability due to supergranulation over a magnetic cycle</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.23693</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.23693v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In recent years supergranulation has emerged as one of the biggest challenges for the detection of Earth-twins in radial velocity planet searches. We used eight years of Sun-as-a-star radial velocity observations from HARPS-N to measure the quiet-Sun's granulation and supergranulation properties of most of its 11-year activity cycle, after correcting for the effects of magnetically active regions using two independent methods. In both cases, we observe a clear, order of magnitude variation in the time-scale of the supergranulation component, which is largest at activity minimum and is strongly anti-correlated with the relative Sunspot number. We also explored a range of observational strategies which could be employed to characterise supergranulation in stars other than the Sun, showing that a comparatively long observing campaign of at least 23 nights is required, but that up to 10 stars can be monitored simultaneously in the process. We conclude by discussing plausible explanations for the "supergranulation" cycle.</description>

      <title>Spectropolarimetric synthesis of forbidden lines in MHD models of coronal bright points</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.23884</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.23884v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The inference of the magnetic field vector from spectropolarimetric observations is crucial for understanding the physical processes governing the solar corona. We investigate which information on the magnetic fields of coronal bright points (CBP) can be gained from the intensity and polarization of the Fe XIII 10747 A, Fe XIV 5303 A, Si X 14301 A, and Si IX 39343 A forbidden lines. We apply the P-CORONA synthesis code to a CBP model in the very low corona, obtained with the Bifrost code, and to a larger global model to study the impact of the outer coronal material along the line of sight (LoS). The enhanced density within the CBP produces an intensity brightening, but suppresses the linear polarization. The circular polarization from such regions often approaches 0.1% of the intensity. The contribution from the coronal material along the LoS depends strongly on its temperature, and is weaker for lines with a peak response at higher temperatures (Fe10747 at 1.7 MK; Fe5303 at 2 MK). The weak field approximation (WFA) provides information on the longitudinal magnetic fields in the strongest-emitting spatial intervals along the LoS, and is more reliable in the regions of the CBP where the field does not change sign. This tends to coincide with the regions where there is a strong correlation between the circular polarization and the wavelength derivative of the intensity. Considering roughly 30 minutes of time evolution, the CBP signals are somewhat attenuated but are still identifiable, while the area where the WFA can be suitably applied remains substantial. The circular polarization of the Fe5303 and especially Fe10747 lines are valuable diagnostics for the magnetic fields in the higher-temperature regions of the CBP, which could be exploited with future coronagraphs with similar capabilities to Cryo-NIRSP/DKIST, but designed to observe below 1.05 solar radii.</description>

      <title>Avalanching together: A model for sympathetic flaring</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.23889</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.23889v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Avalanche models running in a self-organized critical regime have proven powerful in reproducing the power-law distributions and scale invariance that characterize the statistical properties of solar flares. They are often interpreted as representing an individual active region of the Sun. As a result, this class of models has rarely been applied to describe sympathetic flares $\unicode{x2014}$ solar eruptions that occur in close spatial and temporal proximity, seemingly driven by their mutual interaction. In this study, we investigate the phenomenon of sympathetic flaring using avalanche models and compare their statistical properties with observations of sympathetic flares on the Sun. We developed a novel avalanche model featuring two connected lattices, each representing a distinct active region. This connectivity allows the transfer of nodal variable between the lattices, simulating the non-local effects expected to occur during sympathetic flares. Our results show that under strong connectivity, the lattices exhibit temporal synchronization, with correlations between their avalanche energies. Furthermore, increasing the connectivity between the lattices results in an excess of avalanches at short waiting times. A quantitative comparison with observational data suggests that only a weak connectivity allows our model to replicate the observed solar waiting time distributions. Consequently, we propose that if magnetic connectivity between distinct active regions drives sympathetic flaring on the Sun, it must remain relatively weak.</description>

      <title>Anchoring Stellar Age Indicators: A Cross-Calibration of [C/N] and Gyrochronology Ages via the Age-Velocity-Dispersion Relation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.24010</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.24010v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Determining stellar ages is challenging, as it depends on other stellar parameters in a non-linear way and often relies on stellar evolution models to infer the underlying relation between these parameters and age. This complexity increases when comparing different age-dating methods, as they rely on distinct indicators and are often applicable to non-overlapping regions of the color-magnitude diagram. Moreover, many empirical calibration methods rely on pre-determined ages, often from open clusters or asteroseismology, which only cover a limited parameter space. Fortunately, the age-velocity-dispersion relation (AVR), in which the velocity dispersion increases with age, is a universal feature among stars of all evolutionary stages. In this paper, we 1) explore the parameter space in which [C/N] and gyrochronology are applicable, extending beyond the domains probed by asteroseismology and open clusters, and 2) assess whether the traditionally assumed [C/N] and gyrochronology relations yield ages on a consistent physical scale, after calibrating both using the same AVR. We find gyrochronology can be applied to all partially convective stars after they have converged onto the slow rotating sequence and before they experience weakened magnetic braking; [C/N] can be used to infer ages for all giants with metallicity &gt; -0.8 dex and [C/N] &lt; -0.05 dex, and can be used as an age-indicator down to [Fe/H] of -1 dex if only selecting the low-$\alpha$ disk. Lastly, ages obtained from [C/N] and gyrochronology agree within uncertainty after accounting for systematic offsets.</description>

      <title>Exploring the parameter space of hierarchical triple black hole systems</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.22519v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a comprehensive exploration of hierarchical triple black hole (BH) systems to address the "initial separation" problem in gravitational wave astrophysics. This problem arises because isolated BH binaries must have extremely small initial separations to merge within a Hubble time via gravitational wave (GW) emission alone, separations at which their stellar progenitors would have merged prematurely. Using a modified JADE secular code incorporating GW energy loss, we systematically investigate a seven-dimensional parameter space: masses of three BHs (5-100 $M_\odot$ inner binary, 1-200 $M_\odot$ tertiary), inner/outer semimajor axes (1-200 AU and 100-10,000 AU), outer orbit eccentricity (0-0.9), and mutual inclination (40{\deg}-80{\deg}). We employed an adaptive MCMC approach sampling the merger/nonmerger transition boundary across nearly 15 million simulations. Results reveal merger-conducive regions correspond to asymmetric inner binary masses, large inner separations where von Zeipel-Lidov-Kozai (ZLK) mechanism operates effectively without relativistic precession suppression, small outer separations providing stronger perturbations, and large outer eccentricities bringing the tertiary closer at pericenter. Merger probability correlates positively with mutual inclination. We developed a classification scheme for nonmerging systems based on GW emission and ZLK oscillations. A trained neural network predicts merger outcomes with 99% ROC score and 95% accuracy (99.7% for high-confidence predictions), enabling rapid population synthesis. Validation against N-body integrations showed 87% qualitative agreement, confirming our methodology captures essential triple BH dynamics while enabling unprecedented-scale exploration of configurations resolving the initial separation problem.</description>

      <title>Polar alignment of a circumbinary disc around a brown dwarf binary</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.22747</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.22747v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Inspired by recent observations suggesting that the retrograde precession of the brown dwarf binary 2M1510 AB is consistent with induction by a polar circumbinary planet, we investigate the formation of such planets by studying the evolution of a primordial misaligned circumbinary disc around a brown dwarf binary. Analytical calculations show that a critical tilt angle of $i_{\rm crit} \gtrsim 50^\circ$ for moderately eccentric binaries is needed for polar alignment of circumbinary discs in systems with low disc-to-binary angular momentum ratios. For higher ratios, this angle converges to the Kozai-Lidov instability threshold of $\sim 39^\circ$. We identify disc parameters, such as viscosity ($\alpha = 10^{-4}$) and aspect ratio ($H/r = 0.05$), that enable polar alignment within typical disc lifetimes. Notably, a circumbinary disc around a low-mass binary, such as a brown dwarf binary, will require more time to achieve polar alignment compared to higher-mass systems. A hydrodynamical simulation confirms that an initially inclined disc around a brown dwarf evolves towards a polar state, creating favorable conditions for polar planet formation. Using these results, we finish by placing 2M1510 AB into a wider context and speculate why such a polar circumbinary configuration has not been identified before.</description>

      <title>Timing results of 22 years for PSR J0922+0638</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.22765</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.22765v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We conducted a timing analysis of PSR J0922+0638 (B0919+06) using data from the Nanshan 26 m radio telescope and the MeerKAT telescope, spanning from January 2001 to March 2023. During this 22-year period, we discovered a previously unreported small glitch (glitch 1) before the well-known large glitch (glitch 2), occurring at ${\rm MJD} \sim 53325(3)$, with a frequency jump amplitude of $\Delta \nu/\nu \sim 0.79(6) \times 10^{-9}$. We also identified ten slow glitch events, half of which were newly detected. These slow glitches occurred quasi-periodically, with an average interval of approximately 553(21) days, fractional frequency changes ranging from $\Delta \nu/\nu \sim 1.13(1) \times 10^{-9}$ to $4.08(5) \times 10^{-9}$, and a maximum fractional change in the first derivative of the frequency of $\Delta \dot{\nu}/\dot{\nu} \sim -4.6 \times 10^{-3}$. Additionally, our timing noise analysis reveals a change in the spectral index for noise power before and after glitch 2, with values of $-6.0$ and $-5.3$, respectively, likely due to this large glitch. Throughout the entire observation period, the first derivative of the spin frequency ($\dot{\nu}$) showed a periodic structure. The possible modulation period was estimated to be 537(24) days before the 700-day data gap at MJD 56716 and 600(58) days afterward. We discuss the periodic oscillations in pulsar rotation as a possible manifestation of spin-down noise and quasi-periodic slow glitches.</description>

Abstract: The Ukrainian satellite telescope of electrons and protons STEP-F conducted a scientific experiment in space on board the low Earth orbit spacecraft "CORONAS-Photon" in 2009. In the article it is described the background, stages of development, manufacturing and tests of weight-dimensional, breadboard, technological, flight and auxiliary models of the instrument, and of the control and test suites for the STEP-F. The principles of operation, design, and technical and scientific characteristics of the instrument have been described. Stages of adjustment, graduating and autonomous, docking, complex, ground pre-flight and flight tests have been shown. Scientific results obtained by the STEP-F instrument during the time of deep minimum of solar activity demonstrate the detection of new features in high-energy charged particle distributions inside radiation belts of the Earth, in the region of the Brazilian magnetic anomaly, and outside of the referred volumes.

      <title>A systematic bias in template-based RV extraction algorithms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.23261</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.23261v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper we identify and explore a previously unidentified, multi meter-per-second, systematic correlation between time and RVs inferred through TM and LBL methods. We evaluate the influence of the data-driven stellar template in the RV bias and hypothesize on the possible sources of this effect. We first use the s-BART pipeline to extract RVs from three different datasets gathered over four nights of ESPRESSO and HARPS observations. Then, we demonstrate that the effect can be recovered on a larger sample of 19 targets, totaling 4124 ESPRESSO observations spread throughout 38 nights. We also showcase the presence of the bias in RVs extracted with the SERVAL and ARVE pipelines. Lastly, we explore the construction of the stellar template through the 5 years of ESPRESSO observations of HD10700, totalling more than 2000 observations. We find that a systematic quasi-linear bias affects the RV extraction with slopes that vary from -0.3 m/s-1/h-1 to -52 m/s-1/h-1 in our sample. This trend is not observed in CCF RVs and appears when all observations of a given star are collected within a short time-period (timescales of hours). We show that this systematic contamination exists in the RV time-series of two different template-matching pipelines, one line-by-line pipeline, and that it is agnostic to the spectrograph. We also find that this effect is connected with the construction of the stellar template, as we are able to mitigate it through a careful selection of the observations used to construct it. Our results suggest that a contamination of micro-telluric features, coupled other sources of correlated noise, could be the driving factor of this effect. We also show that this effect does not impact the usual usage of template-matching for the detection and characterization of exoplanets. Other short-timescale science cases can however be severely affected.</description>

      <title>On inertial forces (indirect terms) in problems with a central body</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.23331</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.23331v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Gravitational systems in astrophysics often comprise a body -- the primary -- that far outweights the others, and which is taken as the centre of the reference frame. A fictitious acceleration, also known as the indirect term, must therefore be added to all other bodies in the system to compensate for the absence of motion of the primary. In this paper, we first stress that there is not one indirect term but as many indirect terms as there are bodies in the system that exert a gravitational pull on the primary. For instance, in the case of a protoplanetary disc with two planets, there are three indirect terms: one arising from the whole disc, and one per planet. We also highlight that the direct and indirect gravitational accelerations should be treated in a balanced way: the indirect term from one body should be applied to the other bodies in the system that feel its direct gravitational acceleration, and only to them. We point to situations where one of those terms is usually neglected however, which may lead to spurious results. These ideas are developed here for star-disc-planets interactions, for which we propose a recipe for the force to be applied onto a migrating planet, but they can easily be generalized to other astrophysical systems.</description>

Abstract: The NEID Earth Twin Survey (NETS) has been delivering a rich set of precise radial velocity (RV) measurements for 41 bright, nearby main sequence stars. Here, we describe the status of the survey after three years on sky and we present the full set of RV measurements and accompanying stellar activity indicators. We discuss intermediate survey diagnostics, including calibration of the known RV zero point offset introduced following the Contreras fire in 2022 and the identification of an undiagnosed and previously unknown zero point offset in 2021. An analysis of our data set using exttt{RVSearch} demonstrates that for these target stars, NEID is independently sensitive to nearly all known planets with periods shorter than the NETS observing baseline. We also highlight a number of newly detected RV signals, which present exciting opportunities for future investigations.</description>

      <title>Simulation of images of protoplanetary disks after collision with free-floating planets</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.23795v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Observational manifestations of disturbances in a protoplanetary disk caused by a collision with a massive planet are studied. It is assumed that the planet moves along a parabolic trajectory that intersects the disk plane near the star. Gas-dynamic simulation is performed using the finite volume method on a long time scale. On its basis, images of the disk observed from the pole and edge-on are constructed in the infrared and submillimeter ranges. A wide range of planet orbit parameters is considered. The approach of the planet was considered both prograde and retrograde with the respect to the disk rotation. Calculations have shown that in the images of the disk seen pole-on, two spiral arms can be observed in case of the prograde fall, and one with retrograde case. In the case of observations of a disk whose plane is inclined at a small angle to the line of sight, distortions of the disk plane can be noticeable. In addition, a gas tail is extended from the disk in the direction of the planet's motion, which can also be identified in observations.</description>

      <title>Exploring the Wolf Approach to Constraining NIR Extinction Laws in the Corona Australis Molecular Cloud</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.23915</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.23915v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The viability of the star count (Wolf) method is assessed as a means of constraining the near-infrared (NIR) extinction law toward the Corona Australis molecular cloud. Using deep $JHK_S$ photometry from the VISIONS survey, extinction maps with 1 arcmin spatial resolution are constructed. The derived extinction ratios are $A_J/A_H=1.73\pm0.07$, $A_H/A_{K_S}=1.70\pm0.11$, and $A_J/A_{K_S}=3.02\pm0.22$, which are consistent with Galactic literature means. Assuming a power-law form ($A_\lambda \propto \lambda^{-\alpha}$) for the NIR extinction law, we derive indices of $\alpha\approx 2.0$ across all wavelength combinations, with no statistically significant wavelength dependence throughout the NIR wavelength range. While spatial variations in extinction properties are tentatively observed across the cloud, concerns persist regarding the impact of photometric completeness, and the role of reference field selection. Continued research is required to refine the approach, and scrutinize the veracity of potential extinction law variations over a more expansive region of sky.</description>

Abstract: The Vera C. Rubin Observatory recently released Data Preview 1 (DP1) in advance of the upcoming Legacy Survey of Space and Time (LSST), which will enable boundless discoveries in time-domain astronomy over the next ten years. DP1 provides an ideal sandbox for validating innovative data analysis approaches for the LSST mission, whose scale challenges established software infrastructure paradigms. This note presents a pair of such pipelines for variability-finding using powerful software infrastructure suited to LSST data, namely the HATS (Hierarchical Adaptive Tiling Scheme) format and the LSDB framework, developed by the LSST Interdisciplinary Network for Collaboration and Computing (LINCC) Frameworks team. This note presents a pair of variability-finding pipelines built on LSDB, the HATS catalog of DP1 data, and preliminary results of detected variable objects, two of which are novel discoveries.</description>

      <title>A planet-host ratio relation to synthesize microlensing and transiting exoplanet demography from Roman</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.24004</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.24004v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The NASA Nancy Grace Roman Space Telescope (Roman) will be the first survey able to detect large numbers of both cold and hot exoplanets across Galactic distances: ~1,400 cold exoplanets via microlensing and ~200,000 hot, transiting planets. Differing sensitivities to planet bulk properties between the microlensing and transit methods require relations like a planet mass-radius relation (MRR) to mediate. We propose using instead a planet-host ratio relation (PHRR) to couple directly microlensing and transit observables. Unlike the MRR, a PHRR uses parameters that are always measured and so can leverage the full Roman exoplanet sample. Using 908 confirmed exoplanets from the NASA Exoplanet Archive, we show that transit depth, $\delta$, and planet-host mass ratio, $q$, obey a PHRR that is continuous over all planet scales. The PHRR is improved by including orbital period, $P$, and host effective temperature, $T_{\star}$. We compare several candidate PHRRs of the form $\delta (q,T_\star, P)$, with the Bayesian Information Criterion favouring power-law dependence on $T_\star$ and $P$, and broken power-law dependence on $q$. The break in $q$ itself depends on $T_\star$, as do the power-law slopes in $q$ either side of the break. The favoured PHRR achieves a fairly uniform $50\%$ relative precision in $\delta$ for all $q$. Approximately $5\%$ of the sample has a transit depth that is strongly under-predicted by the PHRR; around half of these are associated with large stars ($R_\star &gt; 2.5 \, R_{\odot}$) potentially subject to Malmquist bias.</description>

Abstract: The early evolution of protostellar, star-forming discs, including their density structure, turbulence, magnetic dynamics, and accretion variability, remains poorly understood. We present high-resolution magnetohydrodynamic simulations, using adaptive mesh refinement to capture detailed disc dynamics down to sub-AU scales. Starting from initial conditions derived from a molecular cloud simulation, we model the collapse of a dense core into a protostellar disc over 10,000 yr following sink particle (star) formation, achieving a maximum effective resolution of 0.63 AU. This simulation traces the evolution of the disc density, accretion rates, turbulence, and magnetic field structures. We find that the protostellar disc grows to a diameter of approximately 100 AU, with mass accretion occurring in episodic bursts influenced by the turbulence of the core from which the disc builds up. The disc is highly turbulent with a sonic Mach number of $\sim2$. Episodic accretion events within the disc cause intermittent increases in mass and magnetic energy density, resulting in an equipartition of the thermal and magnetic pressure, i.e., leading to an Alfv\'en Mach number of $\sim2$. Some regions above and below the disc mid-plane show sub-Alfv\'enic conditions with intermittent outflow activity. The disc density profiles steepen over time, following a power law consistent with observed young stellar discs and the minimum mass solar nebula. These results underscore the role of turbulence in early accretion variability and offer new insights into the physical and magnetic structure of young protostellar discs, especially with respect to their turbulent components.</description>

      <title>An interferometric study of B star multiplicity</title>

Abstract: Massive stars are extremely influential objects and multiplicity has the potential to dictate how they evolve over time by causing dynamical interactions, common-envelope evolution, mergers and more. While O-star multiplicity has been studied over a broad separation range, studies of B star multiplicity are lacking despite the fact that they dominate the production of core-collapse supernovae and neutron stars. We analyse interferometric data at high-angular resolution taken with PIONIER/VLTI for a sample of 32 B stars. Using parametric modelling of the closure phases and visibilities, we determine best-fit models to each of the systems and investigate whether each source is best represented by a single star or a higher-order system. Detection limits were calculated for companions to determine if they were significant. We then combined our findings from the interferometric data with results from a literature search to see if other companions were reported at different separation ranges. We find that, within the interferometric range, 72$\pm$8\% of the B stars are resolved as multiple systems. The most common type of system is a triple system, followed by binary systems, presumably single stars and then higher-order systems. The interferometric companion fraction derived for the sample is 1.88$\pm$0.24. When accounting for the spectroscopic companions confirmed in the literature and wide companions inferred from Gaia data in addition to companions we find with interferometry, multiplicity and companion fractions of 0.88$\pm$0.06 and 2.31$\pm$0.27 respectively are obtained for our sample. The number of triple systems in particular increases significantly when accounting for spectroscopic companions, suggesting that binarity and higher-order multiplicity are integral to the evolution of B stars, as they are for O stars.</description>

      <title>Influence of Dark Matter on the Formation of Biogenic Elements in Early Universe Stars</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.17522v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We demonstrate that dark matter interactions can profoundly influence stellar nucleosynthesis in the early universe by altering thermodynamic gradients and modifying nuclear reaction rates within primordial stars. Incorporating a dark matter-modified Fermi-Dirac distribution and accounting for localized energy injection from annihilation heating, our model predicts enhanced production of carbon and nitrogen alongside reduced oxygen synthesis. These compositional shifts significantly reshape stellar structure and produce synthetic spectra that closely reproduce the observed characteristics of carbon-enhanced metal-poor (CEMP) stars. Our findings reveal a direct and previously overlooked role of dark matter in driving the chemical evolution of the early cosmos, offering a plausible link between fundamental particle physics and observable astrophysical signatures.</description>

      <title>Impact of convective overshooting on the single-degenerate model of Type Ia supernovae</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.02551</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.02551v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The single-degenerate (SD) model is one of the principal models for the progenitors of Type Ia supernovae (SNe Ia). However, it faces some challenges, the primary being its inability to account for the observed SN Ia birth rate. Many studies have attempted to address this issue by expanding the parameter space, defined by the initial donor star mass and orbital period, that can lead to SNe Ia, as well as by improving binary population synthesis. While these efforts have led to significant progress, many uncertainties in stellar physics persist, which influences the outcomes of such studies. Convective overshooting, which can significantly affect the internal structure of a star and subsequently its evolution within a binary system, is one of the most significant sources of uncertainty in stellar physics. We investigate the effect of convective overshooting on the parameter space and birth rate of SNe Ia within the SD model. We employed the common-envelope wind (CEW) model, a new version of the SD model, as our progenitor model. Using MESA, we obtained the parameter space that leads to SNe Ia for three different convective overshooting parameters and calculated the corresponding SN Ia birth rate. Convective overshooting expands the upper boundaries (corresponding to a larger initial donor mass) and right boundaries (corresponding to a longer initial orbital period) of the parameter space for systems with massive white dwarfs (WDs; &gt;= 0.75Msun). However, the minimum WD mass and the parameter space for low-mass WDs - and, consequently, the calculated SN Ia birth rate - vary non-monotonically with convective overshooting parameters. The CEW model may explain the SNe Ia that interact with the circumstellar medium (CSM), i.e., SNe Ia-CSM. We find that the parameter space for SNe Ia-CSM increases with convective overshooting parameters, as does their birth rate.</description>

      <title>Detailed Chemical Abundance Analysis of Metal-Poor Turn-Off Stars: One with [Fe/H] &lt; -4 and Three with [Fe/H] &lt; -3</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.18286</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.18286v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present the analysis of four new extremely metal poor turn-off stars thanks to high-resolution spectra obtained with the Subaru/HDS spectrograph. We determined the abundances and upper limits of Li, C, Mg, Ca, Sr, and Ba. Metallicities range from [Fe/H] = -3.3 to -4.4 dex. For one of the stars, we measure the lithium abundance Log(Li/H) = 2.1 {\pm} 0.2. Two stars of the sample have low [{\alpha}/Fe] abundances. The most metal-poor star of the sample with [Fe/H] = -4.42 dex has a high [Sr/Fe] abundance ratio [Sr/Fe] = 0.9 dex, a high value also found in HE 1327-2326. This star is the second-most iron-poor star observed with Subaru telescope, suggesting that more ultra metal-poor stars could be discovered using high-resolution spectrographs in the Northern Hemisphere.</description>

      <title>Probing Solar Polar Regions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.20502v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The magnetic fields and dynamical processes in the solar polar regions play a crucial role in the solar magnetic cycle and in supplying mass and energy to the fast solar wind, ultimately being vital in controlling solar activities and driving space weather. Despite numerous efforts to explore these regions, to date no imaging observations of the Sun's poles have been achieved from vantage points out of the ecliptic plane, leaving their behavior and evolution poorly understood. This observation gap has left three top-level scientific questions unanswered, 1) How does the solar dynamo work and drive the solar magnetic cycle? 2) What drives the fast solar wind? 3) How do space weather processes globally originate from the Sun and propagate throughout the solar system? The Solar Polar-orbit Observatory (SPO) mission, a solar polar exploration spacecraft, is proposed to address these three unanswered scientific questions by imaging the Sun's poles from high heliolatitudes. In order to achieve its scientific goals, SPO will carry six remote-sensing and four in-situ instruments to measure the vector magnetic fields and Doppler velocity fields in the photosphere, to observed the Sun in the extreme ultraviolet, X-ray, and radio wavelengths, to image the corona and the heliosphere up to 45 $R_\odot$, and to perform in-situ detection of magnetic fields, and low- and high-energy particles in the solar wind.</description>

      <title>Computing Anharmonic Infrared Spectra of Polycyclic Aromatic Hydrocarbons Using Machine-Learning Molecular Dynamics</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.05120v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We introduce a machine learning molecular dynamics (MLMD) approach to calculate the anharmonic infrared (IR) absorption spectra of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs), key carriers of interstellar aromatic IR bands. This method accounts for temperature effects in a molecule-specific way and achieves accuracy comparable to conventional quantum chemical calculations at a fraction of the cost, scaling linearly with system size. We applied MLMD to calculate the anharmonic spectra of 1,704 PAHs in the NASA Ames PAH IR Spectroscopic Database with up to 216 carbon atoms at different temperatures, demonstrating its capability for high-throughput spectral calculations of large molecular systems.</description>

      <title>Quasinormal modes and absorption cross-section of a Bardeen black hole surrounded by perfect fluid dark matter in four dimensions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.05215</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.05215v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper we study quasinormal modes and absorption cross sections for the $(1+3)$-dimensional Bardeen black hole surrounded by perfect fluid dark matter. Studies of the massless scalar field is already done in \cite{Sun:2023slzl}. Hence, in this paper we will focus on the massive scalar field perturbations and massless Dirac field perturbations. To compute the quasinormal modes we use the semi-analytical 3rd-order WKB method, which has been shown to be one of the best approaches when the effective potential is adequate and when $n &lt; \ell$ and $n &lt; \lambda$. We have also utilized the P\"oschl-Teller method to compare the valus obtained using the WKB approach. We have computed quasinormal frequencies by varying various parameters of the theory such as the mass of the scalar field $\mu$, dark matter parameter $\alpha$ and the magnetic charge $g$. We have summarized our solutions in tables and figures for clarity. As for the absorption cross section, we used third order WKB approach to compute reflection, transmission coefficients and partial absorption cross sections. Graphs are presented to demonstrate the behavior of the above quantities when the dark matter parameter and mass of the massive scalar field are varied.</description>

      <title>CAMPOS II. The onset of protostellar disk substructures and planet formation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.11577</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.11577v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The 1.3 mm CAMPOS survey has resolved 90 protostellar disks with ~15 au resolution across the Ophiuchus, Corona Australis, and Chamaeleon star-forming regions. To address the fundamental question, `When does planet formation begin?', we combined the CAMPOS sample with literature observations of Class 0-II disks (bolometric temperature, $T_{bol} \le 1900 K$). To investigate substructure detection rates as a function of $T_{bol}$, we restricted the sample to disks observed at the 1.3 mm wavelength, with inclinations below 75$^\circ$, linear resolution $\le 20$ au and resolved with at least 4 resolution elements ($\theta_{disk}/\theta_{res} \ge 4$). We also considered the effects of extinction correction and the inclusion of Herschel Space Telescope data on the $T_{bol}$ measurements to constrain the lower and upper limits of $T_{bol}$ for each source. We find that by $T_{bol}$ ~200-400 K, substructure detection rates increased sharply to ~60%, corresponding to an age of ~0.2-0.4 Myr. No substructures are detected in Class 0 disks. The ratio of disk-averaged brightness temperature to predicted dust temperature shows a trend of increasing values toward the youngest Class 0 disks, suggesting higher optical depths in these early stages. Our statistical analysis confirms that substructures similar to those in Class II disks are already common by the Class I stage, and the emergence of structures at early Class I could represent only an upper limit. Classifying disks with substructures into those with and without large central cavities, we find both populations coexisting across evolutionary stages, suggesting they are not necessarily evolutionarily linked. If protostellar disk substructures do follow an evolutionary sequence, then our results imply that disk substructures evolve very rapidly and thus can be present in all Class I/II stages and/or that they can be triggered at different times.</description>

      <title>Birthplaces of X-ray emission lines in Cygnus X-3</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.19380</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.19380v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate the formation of X-ray emission lines in the wind of the Wolf-Rayet (WR) companion in Cyg X-3 by analyzing their orbital dynamics using Chandra High Energy Transmission Grating (HEG) observations during a hypersoft state. Our goal is to constrain the X-ray transparency of the recently discovered funnel-like structure surrounding the compact star, as revealed by X-ray polarimetry. All lines exhibit sinusoidal orbital modulation, with the velocity amplitude generally increasing and the orbital phase with the highest blueshift generally decreasing for ions with a higher ionisation potential. The {Fe}{xxvi}-line displays velocity extremes at phase 0.25 (blueshift) and 0.75 (redshift), indicating that the line-emitting region is close to the compact component (disc or corona) and thus reflects the orbital motion. The {Fe}{xxv}-line shows a complex behaviour that cannot be fully resolved with the Chandra/HEG resolution. Other lines display velocity extremes scattered around phase 0.5 (blueshift) and 0.0 (redshift), with velocity amplitudes of 100--300 km/s, suggesting their origin in the WR stellar wind between the two components along 3D \xi-surfaces. Parts of the emission lines of {Ar}{xviii} and {Ca}{xx} originated around the compact star (disc or corona). The recent polarisation funnel-modelling is consistent with the present results during the hypersoft state.</description>
