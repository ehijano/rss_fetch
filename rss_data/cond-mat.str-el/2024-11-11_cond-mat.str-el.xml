      <title>Quantum geometric fluctuations in fractional quantum Hall fluids</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.05076</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.05076v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present here a complete microscopic theory of a family of neutral excitations in the fractional quantum Hall fluids, related to the geometric fluctuations of the quantum Hall ground states. Many of the physical properties of such geometric modes can be inferred analytically. These include the chirality, multiplicity and energy of these geometric modes, as well as the relationship to the density modulation of the ground states of both incompressible and compressible fluids, with or without translational symmetry (e.g. the bubble and stripe phases). With a particular focus on the recently experimentally measured graviton modes as the special case, we elucidate both the universal aspects of the geometric modes and the non-universal aspects dependent on the details of the microscopic Hamiltonians. The microscopic theory explains some of the phenomenological components in the effective field theory and composite fermion theory. It predicts how geometric or graviton modes of both chiralities can be measured in experiments for any topological or compressible phases at different energy scales. In particular we show gapped geometric modes can exist even for compressible FQH phases, though translational symmetry of the ground state is important for such modes to couple to external probes (e.g. Raman scattering) in the long wavelength limit.</description>

      <title>Intrinsic Topological Entanglement Entropy and the Strong Subadditivity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.05077</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.05077v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In $(2+1)d$ topological quantum field theory, topological entanglement entropy (TEE) can be computed using the replica and surgery methods. We classify all bipartitions on a torus and propose a general method for calculating their corresponding TEEs. For each bipartition, the TEEs for different ground states are bounded by a topological quantity, termed the intrinsic TEE, which depends solely on the number of entanglement interfaces $ \pi_{\partial A}$, $S_{\text{iTEE}}(A) = - \pi_{\partial A} \ln \mathcal{D}$ with $\mathcal{D}$ being the total quantum dimension. We derive a modified form of strong subadditivity (SSA) for the intrinsic TEE, with the modification depending on the genus $g_X$ of the subregions $X$, $S_{\text{iTEE}}(A) + S_{\text{iTEE}}(B) - S_{\text{iTEE}}(A\cup B) - S_{\text{iTEE}}(A\cap B) \geq -2\ln \mathcal{D} (g_A + g_B - g_{A\cup B} - g_{A\cap B})$. Additionally, we show that SSA for the full TEE holds when the intersection number between torus knots of the subregions is not equal to one. When the intersection number is one, the SSA condition is satisfied if and only if $\sum_a |\psi_a|^2 (\ln S_{0a} - \ln |\psi_a|) + |S\psi_a|^2 (\ln S_{0a} - \ln |S\psi_a|) \geq 2 \ln \mathcal{D}$, with $S$ being the modular $S$-matrix and $\psi_a$ being the probability amplitudes. This condition has been verified for unitary modular categories up to rank $11$, while counterexamples have been found in non-pseudo-unitary modular categories, such as the Yang-Lee anyon.</description>

      <title>Field-Induced Criticality in YbCu4Au</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.05280</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.05280v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: YbCu4Au is a unique material exhibiting multiple quantum fluctuations simultaneously. In this study, we investigated the field-induced criticality in YbCu4Au, based on comprehensive micro and macro measurements, including powder X-ray diffraction (XRD), neutron powder diffraction (NPD), nuclear magnetic resonance, magnetization, resistivity, specific heat, muon spin rotation relaxation (muSR), and X-ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS). Single crystals of YbCu4Au were grown, and their crystal structure was determined using XRD, and NPD measurements. Magnetic successive transitions were observed below 1 T by specific heat, resistivity, NPD, and muSR measurements. XAS measurements further indicate that the valence of Yb ions (+2.93) remained unchanged above 2 T. Moreover, the change in quadrupole frequency observed in the previous study is attributable to the electric quadrupole, as the expected value of the electric quadrupole was finite under magnetic fields [S. Wada et al., Journal of Physics: Condensed Matter, 20, 175201 (2008).]. These experimental results suggest that YbCu4Au exhibited bicritical behavior near 1 T, arising from the competition between RKKY interaction, accounting for the magnetic phases, and the Zeeman effect.</description>

      <title>Catalogue of cubic, non-Fermi liquid, Kondo-type exchange models for doublet impurities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.05401</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.05401v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: To identify what types of non-Fermi liquid (NFL) behavior are most likely to occur in cubic metals due to doublet impurities, we derive every cubic symmetry-allowed, NFL, Kondo-type exchange coupling. We find three distinct types of NFL behavior: two-channel Kondo (2CK) behavior for a non-Kramers doublet impurity coupled to local $\Gamma_8$ conduction electrons; topological Kondo physics for a Kramers doublet impurity and $\Gamma_4$ or $\Gamma_5$ conduction electrons; and lastly, spin-half impurity spin-$\frac{3}{2}$ conduction electron Kondo behavior for a Kramers doublet impurity and $\Gamma_8$ conduction electrons. The first two critical behaviors are not straightforward to realize. In the first case, 2CK physics is not guaranteed, since cubic symmetry does not prevent an effective spatial anisotropy from exceeding the 2CK coupling, which restores a Fermi liquid behavior. In the second case, the topological Kondo interaction is guaranteed to dominate, however, the spin degeneracy of the conduction electrons needs to be lifted e.g. by a magnetic field$-$so that they can be represented by $\Gamma_4$ or $\Gamma_5$ triplets$-$which then also lifts the degeneracy of the Kramers doublet. We find that the spin-half impurity spin-$\frac{3}{2}$ conduction electron, NFL, Kondo behavior has the greatest chance of existing in diluted, cubic compounds. We compute the thermodynamics of the topological Kondo model using the numerical renormalization group, and discuss the thermodynamics of the spin-half impurity spin-$\frac{3}{2}$ conduction electron Kondo model. We also identify candidate materials where the corresponding NFL behaviors could be observed.</description>

      <title>Magnetic structure and crystal field states of antiferromagnetic CeNiGe$_3$: Neutron scattering and $\mu$SR investigations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.05656</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.05656v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present the results of microscopic investigations of antiferromagnetic CeNiGe$_3$, using neutron powder diffraction (NPD), inelastic neutron scattering (INS), and muon spin relaxation ($\mu$SR) measurements. CeNiGe$_3$ crystallizes in a centrosymmetric orthorhombic crystal structure (space group: $Cmmm$) and undergoes antiferromagnetic (AFM) ordering. The occurrence of long-range AFM ordering at $T_{\rm N} \approx 5.2$~K is confirmed by magnetic susceptibility, heat capacity, neutron diffraction, and $\mu$SR measurements. The NPD data characterize the AFM state with an incommensurate helical magnetic structure having a propagation vector $k$ = (0, 0.41, 1/2). In addition, INS measurements at 10~K identified two crystal electric field (CEF) excitations at 9.17~meV and 18.42~meV. We analyzed the INS data using a CEF model for an orthorhombic environment of Ce$^{3+}$ ($J=5/2$) and determined the CEF parameters and ground state wavefunctions of CeNiGe$_3$. Moreover, zero-field $\mu$SR data for CeNiGe$_3$ at $T&lt; T_{\rm N}$ show long-range AFM ordering with three distinct oscillation frequencies corresponding to three different internal fields at the muon sites. The internal fields at the muon-stopping sites have been further investigated using density functional theory calculations.</description>

      <title>Conformal Boundary as Holographic Dual to the Hyperbolic Fracton Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.05662</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.05662v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In addition to describing our universe, gravitational theories profoundly inspire the study of emergent properties of exotic phases of matter. While the Anti-de Sitter/conformal field theory (AdS/CFT) correspondence is one of the most celebrated examples, the field of fractonic matter -- driven in part by gapless phases resembling linearized gravity -- has also seen rapid developments. Despite the deep implications of both areas, connections between them remain sparse, primarily due to the difficulty in constructing explicit models that encapsulate both fields' essential features. Here we demonstrate the efficacy of the recently proposed Hyperbolic Fracton Model as a concrete model for AdS/CFT duality. Using explicit numerical and analytical calculations on the discrete hyperbolic lattice, we show that the boundary state exhibits conformal field theory properties. Our main result is that bulk defects induce an emergent temperature for the boundary state, proportional to the defect perimeter, in quantitative agreement with the expected behaviour of a black hole in AdS spacetime. The Hyperbolic Fracton Model thus emerges as a unique lattice model of holographic principle equipped with a well-defined bulk Hamiltonian, and offers a promising gateway for studying a wide range of holographic phenomena.</description>

      <title>Probing moir\'e electronic structures through quasiparticle interference</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.05677</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.05677v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Moir\'e lattices are a general feature of bilayer structures, where an additional periodic superstructure is generated by either lattice mismatch or from a twist angle. They have been shown to stabilise new ground states, including unconventional superconductivity and Mott insulating phases, attributed to strong electron correlations. However, controlling these interactions requires a detailed understanding of the low energy electronic structure which is lacking so far. Probing the electronic structure is challenging due to sample inhomogeneity, the low characteristic energy scales involved and small sample sizes. Through quasiparticle interference (QPI) imaging, scanning tunnelling microscopy (STM) can overcome many of these challenges but requires detailed modelling to extract the $k$-space electronic structure. Here, we present realistic calculations of QPI in twisted bilayer structures, which accounts for the effect of the long range moir\'e lattice on the electronic structure as well as it's interaction at a defect. These calculations reveal that while the moir\'e supercell significantly reduces the size of the Brillouin zone, the QPI scattering vectors retain characteristics of the individual monolayers with distinct perturbations from the twisted geometry that can be directly linked back to the electronic structure. The procedure introduced here provides a general framework to use QPI to determine the low energy electronic structure in moir\'e lattice systems.</description>

      <title>Ising domain wall networks from intertwined charge density waves in single-layer TiSe2</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.05725</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.05725v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: When the period of an incommensurate charge density wave (ICDW) approaches an integer multiple of a lattice vector, the energy gain obtained from locking the period to the lattice can lead to a fascinating transition into a commensurate state. This transition actually occurs through an intermediate near-commensurate (NC) phase, with locally commensurate regions separated by an ordered array of phase slips of a complex CDW order parameter. TiSe2 is a paradigmatic CDW system where incommensuration is believed to be induced by carrier doping, yet its putative NC state has never been imaged or its nature established. Here we report the observation of a striking NC state in ultraclean, slightly doped monolayers of TiSe2, displaying an intricate network of coherent, unidirectional CDW domain walls over hundreds of nanometers. Detailed analysis reveals these are not phase slips of a complex CDW, but rather sign-changing Ising-type domain walls of two coupled real CDWs of previously known symmetry, consistent with the period doubling nature of the parent commensurate state. In addition, we observe an unexpected nematic modulation at the original lattice Bragg peaks which couples to the CDW order parameters. A Ginzburg-Landau analysis naturally explains the couplings and relative modulations of all order parameters, unveiling TiSe2 as a rare example of an NC-CDW of two intertwined real modulations and emergent nematicity.</description>

      <title>(3+1)d boundary topological order of (4+1)d fermionic SPT state</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.05786</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.05786v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate (3+1)d topological orders in fermionic systems with an anomalous $\mathbb{Z}_{2N}^{\mathrm{F}}$ symmetry, where its $\mathbb{Z}_2^{\mathrm{F}}$ subgroup is the fermion parity. Such an anomalous symmetry arises as the discrete subgroup of the chiral U(1) symmetry of $\nu$ copies of Weyl fermions of the same chirality. Guided by the crystalline correspondence principle, we construct (3+1)d symmetry-preserving gapped states on the boundary of a closely related (4+1)d $C_N\times \mathbb{Z}_2^{\mathrm{F}}$ symmetry-protected topological (SPT) state (with $C_N$ being the $N$-fold rotation), whenever it is possible. In particular, for $\nu=N$, we show that the (3+1)d symmetric gapped state admits a topological $\mathbb{Z}_4$ gauge theory description at low energy, and propose that a similar theory saturates the corresponding $\mathbb{Z}_{2N}^\mathrm{F}$ anomaly. For $N\nmid \nu$, our construction cannot produce any topological quantum field theory (TQFT) symmetric gapped state; but for $\nu=N/2$, we find a non-TQFT symmetric gapped state via stacking lower-dimensional (2+1)d non-discrete-gauge-theory topological orders inhomogeneously. For other values of $\nu$, no symmetric gapped state is possible within our construction, which is consistent with the theorem by Cordova-Ohmori.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.05071v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Coulomb repulsion can, counterintuitively, mediate Cooper pairing via the Kohn-Luttinger mechanism. However, it is commonly believed that observability of the effect requires special circumstances -- e.g., vicinity of the Fermi level to van Hove singularities, significant lattice-induced band distortions, or non-trivial Fermi surface topologies. Here we establish that quantum geometric properties of the constituent electrons can dramatically promote pairing from repulsion via dependence of screening on the quantum metric. We demonstrate quantum-geometry-enhanced superconductivity in two microscopic models with tunable quantum geometry, highlighting the crucial roles of quantum metric anisotropy and inhomogeneity. Our analysis provides an experimentally accessible figure of merit for the importance of quantum geometry to inducing unconventional superconductivity, indicating its relevance to graphene multilayers.</description>

      <title>Universal finite-size scaling in the extraordinary-log boundary phase of 3d $O(N)$ model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.05089</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.05089v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recent advances in boundary critical phenomena have led to the discovery of a new surface universality class in the three-dimensional $O(N)$ model. The newly found "extraordinary-log" phase can be realized on a two-dimensional surface for $N&lt; N_c$, with $N_c&gt;3$, and on a plane defect embedded into a three-dimensional system, for any $N$. One of the key features of the extraordinary-log phase is the presence of logarithmic violations of standard finite-size scaling. In this work we study finite-size scaling in the extraordinary-log universality class by means of Monte Carlo simulations of an improved lattice model. We simulate the model with open boundary conditions, realizing the extraordinary-log phase on the surface for $N=2,3$, as well as with fully periodic boundary conditions and in the presence of a plane defect for $N=2,3,4$. In line with theory predictions, renormalization-group invariant observables studied here exhibit a logarithmic dependence on the size of the system. We numerically access not only the leading term in the $\beta$-function governing these logarithmic violations, but also the subleading term, which controls the evolution of the boundary phase diagram as a function of $N$.</description>

      <title>Unusual magnetic and transport properties in the Zintl phase Eu$_{11}$Zn$_6$As$_{12}$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.05291</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.05291v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Narrow-gap rare-earth Zintl phases frequently exhibit fascinating physical phenomena due to their various crystal structures, complex magnetic properties, and tunable transport behaviors. Here we report the synthesis, magnetic, thermodynamic, and transport properties of a Eu-containing Zintl arsenide, Eu$_{11}$Zn$_6$As$_{12}$, which consists of infinite chains of Eu cations and anionic frameworks constructed from corner-sharing ZnAs$_4$ tetrahedra. Eu$_{11}$Zn$_6$As$_{12}$ exhibits complicated magnetic behavior owing to intricate exchange interactions mediated by the discrete anionic fragments. Two long-range magnetic transitions at 22 K ($T_\mathrm{N}$) and 9 K ($T^*$), as well as exceptionally strong ferromagnetic fluctuations around 29 K ($T_\mathrm{F}$), are indicated by the susceptibility, heat capacity and resistivity measurements. Besides, Eu$_{11}$Zn$_6$As$_{12}$ displays metallic behavior, attributable to the hole carriers doped by slight Eu vacancies or the mixed valence of Eu$^{2+}$ and Eu$^{3+}$. A prominent resistivity peak occurs around $T_\mathrm{N}$, which is rapidly suppressed by the applied field, leading to a prominent negative magnetoresistance effect. A resistivity hysteresis is observed below 5 K, caused by a small net ferromagnetic component. Our study presents the distinct magnetic and transport properties of Eu$_{11}$Zn$_6$As$_{12}$, and further experiments are required to elucidate the origin of these novel behaviors. Moreover, our findings demonstrate that Eu-based Zintl phases are a fertile ground to study the interplay between magnetism and charge transport.</description>

      <title>Strong-to-weak Symmetry Breaking and Entanglement Transitions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.05364v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: When interacting with an environment, the entanglement within quantum many-body systems is rapidly transferred to the entanglement between the system and the bath. For systems with a large local Hilbert space dimension, this leads to a first-order entanglement transition for the reduced density matrix of the system. On the other hand, recent studies have introduced a new paradigm for classifying density matrices, with particular focus on scenarios where a strongly symmetric density matrix undergoes spontaneous symmetry breaking to a weak symmetry phase. This is typically characterized by a finite R\'enyi-2 correlator or a finite Wightman correlator. In this work, we study the entanglement transition from the perspective of strong-to-weak symmetry breaking, using solvable complex Brownian SYK models. We perform analytical calculations for both the early-time and late-time saddles. The results show that while the R\'enyi-2 correlator indicates a transition from symmetric to symmetry-broken phase, the Wightman correlator becomes finite even in the early-time saddle due to the single-replica limit, demonstrating that the first-order transition occurs between a near-symmetric phase and a deeply symmetry-broken phase in the sense of Wightman correlator. Our results provide a novel viewpoint on the entanglement transition under symmetry constraints and can be readily generalized to systems with repeated measurements.</description>

      <title>Numerical investigation of quantum phases and phase transitions in a two-leg ladder of Rydberg atoms</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.05494v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Experiments on chains of Rydberg atoms appear as a new playground to study quantum phase transitions in 1D. As a natural extension, we report a quantitative ground-state phase diagram of Rydberg atoms arranged in a two-leg ladder that interact via van der Waals potential. We address this problem numerically, using the Density Matrix Renormalization Group (DMRG) algorithm. Our results suggest that, surprisingly enough, $\mathbb{Z}_k$ crystalline phases, with the exception of the checkerboard phase, appear in pairs characterized by the same pattern of occupied rungs but distinguishable by a spontaneously broken $\tilde{\mathbb{Z}}_2$ symmetry between the two legs of the ladder. Within each pair, the two phases are separated by a continuous transition in the Ising universality class, which eventually fuses with the $\mathbb{Z}_k$ transition, whose nature depends on $k$. According to our results, the transition into the $\mathbb{Z}_2\otimes \tilde{\mathbb{Z}}_2$ phase changes its nature multiple of times and, over extended intervals, falls first into the Ashkin-Teller, latter into the $\mathbb{Z}_4$-chiral universality class and finally in a two step-process mediated by a floating phase. The transition into the $\mathbb{Z}_3$ phase with resonant states on the rungs belongs to the three-state Potts universality class at the commensurate point, to the $\mathbb{Z}_3$-chiral Huse-Fisher universality class away from it, and eventually it is through an intermediate floating phase. The Ising transition between $\mathbb{Z}_3$ and $\mathbb{Z}_3\otimes \tilde{\mathbb{Z}}_2$ phases, coming across the floating phase, opens the possibility to realize lattice supersymmetry in Rydberg quantum simulators.</description>

      <title>Stability of the first-order character of phase transition in HoCo$_2$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.05509</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.05509v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: HoCo$_2$ exhibits a giant magnetocaloric (MC) effect at its first-order magnetostructural phase transition around 77~K, and understanding the thermodynamic nature of this transition in response to external magnetic fields is crucial for its MC applications. In this study, we present a comprehensive investigation of specific heat and magnetization measurements of HoCo$_2$ under varying magnetic fields. The specific heat measurements qualitatively indicate a transformation from first- to second-order behavior of this phase transition at higher magnetic fields. However, analysis of the power-law dependence of the magnetic entropy change ($\Delta S_{\rm M} \propto$ H$^n$) and the breakdown of universal behavior in the temperature dependence of $\Delta S_{\rm M}$ suggest that the first-order nature remains intact, even up to 7 T. This stability of the first-order nature is further manifested through the distinctive non-linear behavior of modified Arrott plots, with a negative slope in the 6--7 T range.</description>

      <title>Exploring Topological Boundary Effects through Quantum Trajectories in Dissipative SSH Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.05671</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.05671v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the topological properties of the Su-Schrieffer-Heeger (SSH) model under dissipative dynamics using the quantum trajectory approach. Our study explores the preservation or breakdown of topological edge states, particularly focusing on the effects of symmetry-preserving and symmetry-breaking dissipations. We employ the Disconnected Entanglement Entropy (DEE) as a marker for detecting topological phases in the system, which is subjected to Lindblad dynamics. The analysis reveals that, while dissipation in the bulk minimally affects the system's topological features, dissipation at the boundary leads to the destabilization of the edge modes, independently of the symmetry properties of the dissipation.</description>

      <title>Pressure tuning of intrinsic and extrinsic sources to the anomalous Hall effect in CrGeTe$_3$</title>

      <description>arXiv:2401.09539v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The integrated Berry curvature is a geometric property that has dramatic implications for material properties. This study investigates the integrated Berry curvature and other contributions to the anomalous Hall effect in CrGeTe$_3$ as a function of pressure. The anomalous Hall effect is absent in the insulating phase of CrGeTe$_3$ and evolves with pressure in a dome-like fashion as pressure is applied. The dome's edges are characterized by Fermi surface deformations, manifested as mixed electron and hole transport. We corroborate the presence of bipolar transport by ab-initio calculations which also predict a nonmonotonic behavior of the Berry curvature as a function of pressure. Quantitative discrepancies between our calculations and experimental results indicate that additional scattering mechanisms, which are also strongly tuned by pressure, contribute to the anomalous Hall effect in CrGeTe$_3$.</description>

      <title>Origin of the hidden energy scale and the $f$-ratio in geometrically frustrated magnets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.12966</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.12966v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Sufficiently clean geometrically frustrated (GF) magnets are the largest class of candidate materials that may host quantum spin liquids (QSLs). Some of them have been shown to exhibit spin-glass freezing, potentially precluding QSLs, at the "hidden energy scale", which is significantly lower than the microscopic energy scale of spin interactions. Here, we investigate the origin of the hidden energy scale and its relationship to the $f$-ratio, the figure of merit for the degree of frustration in GF magnetic materials. The available experimental and numerical data provide evidence that GF magnets display, universally, two distinct temperature scales in the specific heat, the lowest of which is of the order of the hidden energy scale $T^*$. We argue that this scale is determined by non-magnetic excitations, similar to spin exchanges in chains of spins. The collective entropy of such excitations matches the entropy of the ground states of the Ising model on the same lattice, which provides a way to verify the proposed scenario in experiment. We demonstrate that in the presence of quenched disorder, a broad class of materials exhibits spin-glass freezing at temperatures of order $T^*$, in accordance with experimental observations. As $T^*$ is a property of the clean GF medium, it leads to a constraint on the $f$-ratio.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.05706v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Fractional Chern insulators (FCIs) have attracted intensive attention for the realization of fractional quantum Hall states in the absence of an external magnetic field. Most of FCIs have been proposed on two-dimensional (2D) Euclidean lattice models with various boundary conditions. In this work, we investigate hyperbolic FCIs which are constructed in hyperbolic geometry with constant negative curvature. Through the studies on hyperbolic analogs of kagome lattices with hard-core bosons loaded into topological flat bands, we find convincing numerical evidences of two types of $\nu=1/2$ FCI states, {\emph {i.e.}}, the conventional and unconventional FCIs. Multiple branches of edge excitations and geometry-dependent wave functions for both conventional and unconventional $\nu=1/2$ FCI states are revealed, however, the geometric degree of freedom in these FCIs plays various roles. Additionally, a center-localized orbital plays a crucial role in the unconventional FCI state.</description>

      <title>Superlattice induced electron percolation within a single Landau level</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.17137</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.17137v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate the quantum Hall effect in a single Landau level in the presence of a square superlattice of $\delta$-function potentials. The interplay between the superlattice spacing $a_s$ and the magnetic length $\ell_B$ in clean system leads to three interesting characteristic regimes corresponding to $a_s \lt \ell_B$, $a_s \gg \ell_B$ and the intermediate one where $a_s \sim \ell_B$ . In the intermediate regime, the continuous magnetic translation symmetry breaks down to discrete lattice symmetry. In contrast, we show that in the other two regimes, the same is hardly broken in the topological band despite the presence of the superlattice. In the presence of weak disorder (white-noise) one typically expects a tiny fraction of extended states due to topological protection of the Landau level. Interestingly, we obtain a large fraction of extended states throughout the intermediate regime which maximizes at the special point $a_s = \sqrt{2\pi} \ell_B$. We argue the superlattice induced percolation phenomenon requires both the breaking of the time reversal symmetry and the continuous magnetic translational symmetry. It could have a direct implication on the integer plateau transitions in both continuous quantum Hall systems and the lattice based anomalous quantum Hall effect.</description>

      <title>Pressure-dependent Electronic Superlattice in the Kagome-Superconductor CsV$_3$Sb$_5$</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.14790v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present a high-resolution single crystal x-ray diffraction study of kagome-superconductor \cvs, exploring its response to variations in pressure and temperature. We discover that at low temperatures, the structural modulations of the electronic superlattice, commonly associated with charge-density-wave order, undergo a transformation around $p \sim$ 0.7 GPa from the familiar $2\times2$ pattern to a long-range-ordered modulation at wavevector $q=(0, 3/8, 1/2)$. Our observations align with inferred changes in the CDW pattern from prior transport and nuclear-magnetic-resonance studies, providing new insights into these transitions. Interestingly, the pressure-induced variations in the electronic superlattice correlate with two peaks in the superconducting transition temperature as pressure changes, hinting that fluctuations within the electronic superlattice could be key to stabilizing superconductivity. However, our findings contrast with the minimal pressure dependency anticipated by ab initio calculations of the electronic structure. They also challenge prevailing scenarios based on a Peierls-like nesting mechanism involving van Hove singularities.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.19348v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: For the first time, robust superconductivity has been independently observed in twisted WSe$_2$ bilayers by two separate groups [Y. Xia et al., arXiv:2405.14784; Y. Guo et al., arXiv:2406.03418.]. In light of this, we explore the possibility of a universal superconducting pairing mechanism in twisted WSe$_2$ bilayers. Using a continuum band structure model and a phenomenological boson-mediated effective electron-electron attraction, we find that intervalley intralayer pairing predominates over interlayer pairing. Notably, despite different experimental conditions, both twisted WSe$_2$ samples exhibit a comparable effective attraction strength. This consistency suggests that the dominant pairing glue is likely independent of the twist angle and layer polarization, pointing to a universal underlying boson-induced pairing mechanism.</description>

      <title>Studying the 3d Ising surface CFTs on the fuzzy sphere</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.15914v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Boundaries not only are fundamental elements in nearly all realistic physical systems, but also greatly enrich the structure of quantum field theories. In this paper, we demonstrate that conformal field theory (CFT) with a boundary, known as surface CFT in three dimensions, can be studied with the setup of fuzzy sphere. We consider the example of surface criticality of the 3D Ising CFT. We propose two schemes by cutting a boundary in the orbital space or the real space to realise the ordinary and the normal surface CFTs on the fuzzy sphere. We obtain the operator spectra through state-operator correspondence. We observe integer spacing of the conformal multiplets, and thus provide direct evidence of conformal symmetry. We identify the ordinary surface primary $o$, the displacement operator $\mathrm{D}$ and their conformal descendants and extract their scaling dimensions. We also study the one-point and two-point correlation functions and extract the bulk-to-surface OPE coefficients, some of which are reported for the first time. In addition, using the overlap of the bulk CFT state and the polarised state, we calculate the boundary central charges of the 3D Ising surface CFTs non-perturbatively. Other conformal data obtained in this way also agrees with prior methods.</description>

Abstract: We present a comprehensive theoretical study of interacting and disordered topological phases of coupled Kitaev wires, which may support further realistic applications of Majorana fermions. We develop a variety of analytical, mathematical and numerical methods for one and two-coupled wires, associated with a topological marker accessible from real-space correlation functions on the wire(s). We verify the stability of the topological superconducting phase and quantify disorder effects close to the quantum phase transitions, e.g. through two-point correlation functions or using a renormalization group (RG) analysis of disorder. We show for the first time that the double critical Ising (DCI) phase -- a fractional Majorana liquid characterized by a pair of half central charges and topological numbers -- is stabilized by strong interactions against disorder which respects the inversion symmetry between the wires (ie. parity conservation on each wire). In the presence of an inter-wire hopping term, the DCI phase turns into a protected topological phase with a bulk gap. We study the localization physics developing along the critical line for weaker interactions.</description>

      <title>Many-body Physics of Ultracold Alkaline-Earth atoms with SU($N$)-symmetric interactions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.05359v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Symmetries play a crucial role in understanding phases of matter and the transitions between them. Theoretical investigations of quantum models with SU($N$) symmetry have provided important insights into many-body phenomena. However, these models have generally remained a theoretical idealization, since it is very difficult to exactly realize the SU($N$) symmetry in conventional quantum materials for large $N$. Intriguingly however, in recent years, ultracold alkaline-earth-atom (AEA) quantum simulators have paved the path to realize SU($N$)-symmetric many-body models, where $N$ is tunable and can be as large as 10. This symmetry emerges due to the closed shell structure of AEAs, thereby leading to a perfect decoupling of the electronic degrees of freedom from the nuclear spin. In this work, we provide a systematic review of recent theoretical and experimental work on the many-body physics of these systems. We first discuss the thermodynamic properties and collective modes of trapped Fermi gases, highlighting the enhanced interaction effects that appear as $N$ increases. We then discuss the properties of the SU($N$) Fermi-Hubbard model, focusing on some of the major experimental achievements in this area. We conclude with a compendium highlighting some of the significant theoretical progress on SU($N$) lattice models and a discussion of some exciting directions for future research.</description>

Abstract: We study properties of boundary conditions (BCs) in theories with categorical (or non-invertible) symmetries. We describe how the transformation properties, or (generalized) charges, of BCs are captured by topological BCs of Symmetry Topological Field Theory (SymTFT), which is a topological field theory in one higher spacetime dimension. As an application of the SymTFT chracterization, we discuss the symmetry properties of boundary conditions for (1+1)d gapped and gapless phases. We provide a number of concrete examples in spacetime dimensions $d=2,3$. We furthermore expand the lattice description for (1+1)d anyon chains with categorical symmetries to include boundary conditions carrying arbitrary 1-charges under the symmetry.</description>
