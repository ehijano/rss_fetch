      <title>Treats or Affection? Understanding Reward Preferences in Indian Free-ranging Dogs for Bonding with Humans</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.02756</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.02756v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Free-ranging dogs constitute approximately 80% of the global dog population. These dogs are freely breeding and live without direct human supervision, making them an ideal model system for studying dog-human relationships. Living in close proximity with humans, free-ranging dogs in India frequently interact with people, and previous studies suggest that humans are a crucial part of their social environment. Positive reinforcement in the form of food and petting is commonly received from humans. In this study, we investigated which type of reward, food or petting, is more influential in shaping positive social associations with unfamiliar humans. Field trials were conducted on 61 adult free-ranging dogs in Nadia district, West Bengal, India. During a familiarization phase, two unfamiliar individuals each provided either food or petting to the dogs. This was followed by a choice test in which dogs could choose between the two individuals. A choice test following the familiarization phase was conducted on the first 5 days, while only choice tests were conducted on the subsequent 5 days. Results showed that on the first day, dogs significantly preferred the individual providing food. However, from the second day onward, preference for either individual was no different from chance. These findings suggest that while food is a stronger short-term motivator, repeated interactions involving either food or petting contribute equally to the formation of positive social associations over time. This study sheds light on the dynamics of dog-human relationship development in Indian free-ranging dog populations and highlights the nuanced role of different types of rewards in fostering affiliative bonds.</description>
