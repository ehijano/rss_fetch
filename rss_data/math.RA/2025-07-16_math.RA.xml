      <title>Transposed $\delta$-Poisson algebra structures on null-filiform associative algebras</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.10554</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.10554v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we consider transposed $\delta$-Poisson algebras, which are a generalization of transposed $\delta$-Poisson algebras. In particular, we describe all transposed $\delta$-Poisson algebras of associative null-filiform algebras. It can be seen that these algebras are characterized by the roots of the polynomial $\delta^3 - 3\delta^2 + 2\delta$. A complete classification of transposed $\delta$-Poisson algebras corresponding to each value of the parameter $\delta$ is provided. Furthermore, we construct all $\delta$-Poisson algebra structures on null-filiform associative algebras, and show that they are trivial $\delta$-Poisson algebras.</description>

      <title>Dilogarithm identities of higher degree and cluster $a$-variable periodicity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.10555</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.10555v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We use the periodicities of cluster groupoid mutations established by Li and the second author to prove that the dilogarithm identities of higher degree obtained by Nakanishi follow from the classical dilogarithm identities associated to a periodicity of cluster mutations when the exchange matrix is full rank.</description>

      <title>The $m$-generalized right group inverses in Banach algebras</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.10600</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.10600v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we introduce the concept of the m-generalized right group inverse. This serves as a natural extension of both the m-weak group inverse and the generalized group inverse. We characterize this new generalized inverse using the m-generalized right group decomposition and a polar-like property. Additionally, we present the representation of the m-generalized right group inverse using the generalized right core inverse, leading to new insights and properties for both the m-weak group inverse and the generalized group inverse.</description>

      <title>Structure of Galois rings and the Gelfand-Kirillov Conjecture</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.10782</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.10782v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The theory of Galois rings and orders, introduced by Futorny and Ovsienko, has many interesting applications to the structure and representation theory of algebras. This paper focuses on ring theoretical properties of Galois rings. The main technique is based on the fact that our algebras are embedded in a nice way into fixed rings of skew group (or monoid) rings, and via a simple localization procedure many facts about our rings can be deduced from properties of the associated skew group rings. With this tool we obtain natural conditions for our rings to be Ore domains and (semi)prime Goldie rings. We also discuss various ring theoretical dimensions and analyze what can be said when we combine powerful theories of Galois rings and PI-rings. We use our methods to compute dimensions and establish structural properties of affine and double affine Hecke algebras, as well as spherical Coulomb branch algebras. We also verify the Gelfand-Kirillov conjecture for the later and for the spherical subalgebras of the DAHA.</description>

      <title>On differentially smoothness of certain Artin-Schelter regular algebras of dimension 5</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.10853</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.10853v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This article investigates the differential smoothness of various five-dimensional Artin-Schelter regular algebras. By analyzing the relationship between the number of generators and the Gelfand-Kirillov dimension, we provide structural obstructions to differential smoothness in specific algebraic families. In particular, we prove that certain two- and four-generator AS-regular algebras of global dimension five fail to admit a differential calculus, while a five-generator graded Clifford algebra provides a contrasting positive example.</description>

      <title>On certain subsemigroups of finite oriented and order-decreasing full transformations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.11122</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.11122v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $\mathcal{ORD}_{n}$ be the semigroup consisting of all oriented and order-decreasing full transformations on the finite chain $X_{n}=\{ 1&lt;\cdots&lt;n \}$, and for $1\leq r\leq n-1$, let $$\mathcal{ORD}(n,r) =\{\alpha \in \mathcal{ORD}_{n}\, :\, \lvert \textrm{im}(\alpha )\rvert \leq r\}.$$ In this paper, we determine the cardinality of $\mathcal{ORD}(n,r)$ and the number of nilpotent elements of $\mathcal{ORD}(n,r)$, we find a minimal generating set and the rank of $\mathcal{ORD}(n,r)$, and moreover, we characterize all maximal subsemigroups of $\mathcal{ORD}(n,r)$ for each $3\leq r\leq n-1$.</description>

      <title>Subinjective and Subprojective Extension-Reflecting Modules</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.11221</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.11221v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Given a right R-module M and any short exact sequence of right R-modules \[ 0 \to A \to B \to C \to 0, \] it is well known that if both A and C belong to the subinjectivity domain $\mathfrak{\underline{In}^{-1}}(M)$ (resp., the subprojectivity domain $\mathfrak{\underline{Pr}^{-1}}(M)$) of M, then B also belongs to the corresponding domain. Module classes satisfying this closure property are said to be closed under extensions.
  Let $ \mathfrak{In}(M) = \{ N \in Mod-R \mid M \in \mathfrak{\underline{In}^{-1}}(N) \}$ and $ \mathfrak{Pr}(M) = \{ N \in Mod-R \mid M \in \mathfrak{\underline{Pr}^{-1}}(N)\}.$
  Unlike $\mathfrak{\underline{In}^{-1}}(M)$ and $\mathfrak{\underline{Pr}^{-1}}(M)$, the classes $ \mathfrak{In}(M)$ and $\mathfrak{Pr}(M) $ are not, in general, closed under extensions.
  In this paper, we investigate certain classes of modules and rings that ensure the extension-closure of $ \mathfrak{In}(M)$ and $\mathfrak{Pr}(M) $. We prove that if the injective hull of $M$ is projective, then $ \mathfrak{In}(M)$ is closed under extension; and if $M$ is a homomorphic image of a module which is both projective and injective, then $\mathfrak{Pr}(M) $. is closed under extensions. As a consequence, over a QF-ring, the classes
  $ \mathfrak{In}(M)$ and $\mathfrak{Pr}(M) $ are closed under extensions for every module $M$. We further explore several implications of these results and present examples of modules with the above properties over arbitrary rings.
  Additionally, we introduce the rings whose right modules of finite length are homomorphic images of injective modules. Among other results, we prove that, if $ \mathfrak{In}(R)$ is closed under extensions, then modules of finite length are homomorphic image of injectives if and and only if simple modules are homomorphic image of injectives.</description>

      <title>Bassian-Finite Abelian Groups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.11388</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.11388v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce a new class of Abelian groups which lies strictly between the classes of co-Hopfian groups and Dedekind-finite groups, calling these groups {\it Bassian-finite}. We prove the surprising fact that in the torsion case the Bassian-finite property coincides with the co-Hopficity, thus extending a recent result by Chekhlov-Danchev-Keef in Siber. Math. J. (2026), and we construct a torsion-free Bassian-finite group which is {\it not} co-Hopfian as well as a Dedekind-finite group which is {\it not} Bassian-finite. Some other closely relevant things are also established. E.g., we extend a construction of a countable Butler group that is {\it not} completely decomposable, due to Arnold-Rangaswamy in Boll. Un. Mat. Ital. (2007), to find a Butler group of countably infinite rank which is Bassian-finite, but {\it not} completely decomposable.</description>

      <title>Basic quantum algebra</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.11459</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.11459v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This is an introduction to quantum algebra, from a geometric perspective. The classical spaces $X$, such as the Lie groups, homogeneous spaces, or more general manifolds, are described by various algebras $A$, defined over various fields $F$. These algebras $A$ satisfy a commutativity type condition, and the general idea is that of lifting this condition, and calling quantum spaces the underlying space-like objects $X$. One problem comes from the fact that different fields $F$ lead, via different algebras $A$, to different classes of quantum spaces $X$. Our aim here is to identify and put at the center of the presentation those quantum spaces $X$ which do not depend on the choice of $F$.</description>

      <title>Graduated orders over completed group rings and conductor formul\ae</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.15560</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.15560v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study graduated orders over completed group rings of $1$-dimensional admissible $p$-adic Lie groups, and verify the equivariant $p$-adic Artin conjecture for such orders. Following Jacobinski and Plesken, we obtain a formula for the conductor of a graduated order into a self-dual order. We also refine Nickel's central conductor formula by determining a hitherto implicit exponent $r_\chi$.</description>
