      <title>Knowledge and Common Knowledge of Strategies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.19298</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.19298v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Most existing work on strategic reasoning simply adopts either an informed or an uninformed semantics. We propose a model where knowledge of strategies can be specified on a fine-grained level. In particular, it is possible to distinguish first-order, higher-order, and common knowledge of strategies. We illustrate the effect of higher-order knowledge of strategies by studying the game Hanabi. Further, we show that common knowledge of strategies is necessary to solve the consensus problem. Finally, we study the decidability of the model checking problem.</description>

      <title>Universal Quantitative Abstraction: Categorical Duality and Logical Completeness for Probabilistic Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.19444</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.19444v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A unified theory of quantitative abstraction is presented for probabilistic systems that links category theory, optimal transport, and quantitative modal logic. At its core is a canonical $ \varepsilon $-quotient endowed with a universal property: among all $ \varepsilon $-abstractions, it is the most informative one that respects a prescribed bound on value loss. This construction induces an adjunction between abstraction and realization functors $ (Q_{\varepsilon} \dashv R_{\varepsilon}) $, established via the Special Adjoint Functor Theorem, revealing a categorical duality between metric structure and logical semantics. A behavioral pseudometric is characterized as the unique fixed point of a Bellman-style operator, with contraction and Lipschitz properties proved in a coalgebraic setting. A quantitative modal $ \mu $-calculus is introduced and shown to be expressively complete for logically representable systems, so that behavioral distance coincides with maximal logical deviation. Compositionality under interface refinement is analyzed, clarifying how abstractions interact across system boundaries. An exact validation suite on finite Markov decision processes corroborates the contraction property, value-loss bounds, stability under perturbation, adversarial distinguishability, and scalability, demonstrating both robustness and computational feasibility. The resulting framework provides principled targets for state aggregation and representation learning, with mathematically precise guarantees for value-function approximation in stochastic domains.</description>

      <title>Transformers are Inherently Succinct</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.19315</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.19315v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose succinctness as a measure of the expressive power of a transformer in describing a concept. To this end, we prove that transformers are highly expressive in that they can represent formal languages substantially more succinctly than standard representations of formal languages like finite automata and Linear Temporal Logic (LTL) formulas. As a by-product of this expressivity, we show that verifying properties of transformers is provably intractable (i.e. EXPSPACE-complete).</description>

      <title>A Logic-based Algorithmic Meta-Theorem for Treedepth: Single Exponential FPT Time and Polynomial Space</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.19793</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.19793v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: For a graph $G$, the parameter treedepth measures the minimum depth among all forests $F$, called elimination forests, such that $G$ is a subgraph of the ancestor-descendant closure of $F$. We introduce a logic, called neighborhood operator logic with acyclicity, connectivity and clique constraints ($\mathsf{NEO}_2[\mathsf{FRec}]+\mathsf{ACK}$ for short), that captures all NP-hard problems$\unicode{x2013}$like Independent Set or Hamiltonian Cycle$\unicode{x2013}$that are known to be tractable in time $2^{\mathcal{O}(k)}n^{\mathcal{O}(1)}$ and space $n^{\mathcal{O}(1)}$ on $n$-vertex graphs provided with elimination forests of depth $k$. We provide a model checking algorithm for $\mathsf{NEO}_2[\mathsf{FRec}]+\mathsf{ACK}$ with such complexity that unifies and extends these results. For $\mathsf{NEO}_2[\mathsf{FRec}]+\mathsf{k}$, the fragment of the above logic that does not use acyclicity and connectivity constraints, we get a strengthening of this result, where the space complexity is reduced to $\mathcal{O}(k\log(n))$.
  With a similar mechanism as the distance neighborhood logic introduced in [Bergougnoux, Dreier and Jaffke, SODA 2023], the logic $\mathsf{NEO}_2[\mathsf{FRec}]+\mathsf{ACK}$ is an extension of the fully-existential $\mathsf{MSO}_2$ with predicates for (1) querying generalizations of the neighborhoods of vertex sets, (2) verifying the connectivity and acyclicity of vertex and edge sets, and (3) verifying that a vertex set induces a clique. Our results provide $2^{\mathcal{O}(k)}n^{\mathcal{O}(1)}$ time and $n^{\mathcal{O}(1)}$ space algorithms for problems for which the existence of such algorithms was previously unknown. In particular, $\mathsf{NEO}_2[\mathsf{FRec}]$ captures CNF-SAT via the incidence graphs associated to CNF formulas, and it also captures several modulo counting problems like Odd Dominating Set.</description>

      <title>A new introduction rule for disjunction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.19172</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.19172v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We extend Natural Deduction for intuitionistic logic with a third introduction rule for the disjunction, $\vee$-i3, with a conclusion $\Gamma\vdash A\vee B$, but both premises $\Gamma\vdash A$ and $\Gamma\vdash B$. This rule is admissible in Natural Deduction. This extension is interesting in several respects. First, it permits to solve a well-known problem in logics with interstitial rules that have a weak introduction property: closed cut-free proofs end with an introduction rule, except in the case of disjunctions. With this new introduction rule, we recover the strong introduction property: closed cut-free proofs always end with an introduction. Second, the termination proof of this proof system is simpler than that of the usual propositional Natural Deduction with interstitial rules, as it does not require the use of the so-called ultra-reduction rules. Third, this proof system, in its linear version, has applications to quantum computing: the $\vee$-i3 rule enables the expression of quantum measurement, without the cost of introducing a new connective. Finally, even in logics without interstitial rules, the rule $\vee$-i3 is useful to reduce commuting cuts, although, in this paper, we leave the termination of such reduction as an open problem.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2510.05032v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We introduce a theory for computational control, consisting of eight naturally interpretable equations. Adding these to a prop of base circuits constructs controlled circuits, borne out in examples of reversible Boolean circuits and quantum circuits. We prove that this syntactic construction semantically corresponds to taking the free rig category on the base prop.</description>

      <title>Follow the STARs: Dynamic $\omega$-Regular Shielding of Learned Policies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.14689</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.14689v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper presents a novel dynamic post-shielding framework that enforces the full class of $\omega$-regular correctness properties over pre-computed probabilistic policies. This constitutes a paradigm shift from the predominant setting of safety-shielding -- i.e., ensuring that nothing bad ever happens -- to a shielding process that additionally enforces liveness -- i.e., ensures that something good eventually happens. At the core, our method uses Strategy-Template-based Adaptive Runtime Shields (STARs), which leverage permissive strategy templates to enable post-shielding with minimal interference. As its main feature, STARs introduce a mechanism to dynamically control interference, allowing a tunable enforcement parameter to balance formal obligations and task-specific behavior at runtime. This allows to trigger more aggressive enforcement when needed, while allowing for optimized policy choices otherwise. In addition, STARs support runtime adaptation to changing specifications or actuator failures, making them especially suited for cyber-physical applications. We evaluate STARs on a mobile robot benchmark to demonstrate their controllable interference when enforcing (incrementally updated) $\omega$-regular correctness properties over learned probabilistic policies.</description>

      <title>Mathematics with large language models as provers and verifiers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.12829</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.12829v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: During 2024 and 2025 the discussion about the theorem-proving capabilities of large language models started reporting interesting success stories, mostly to do with difficult exercises (such as problems from the International Mathematical Olympiad), but also with conjectures [Feldman &amp; Karbasi, arXiv:2509.18383v1] formulated for the purpose of verifying whether the artificial intelligence could prove it. In this paper we report a theorem proving feat achieved by ChatGPT by using a protocol involving different prover and verifier instances of the gpt-5 model working collaboratively. To make sure that the produced proofs do not suffer from hallucinations, the final proof is formally verified by the lean proof assistant, and the conformance of premises and conclusion of the lean code is verified by a human. Our methodology is by no means complete or exact. It was nonetheless able to solve five out of six 2025 IMO problems, and close about a third of the sixty-six number theory conjectures in [Cohen, Journal of Integer Sequences, 2025].</description>
