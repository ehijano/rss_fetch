      <title>Whither the Zeroth Law of Turbulence?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.13298</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.13298v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Experimental and numerical studies of incompressible turbulence suggest that the mean dissipation rate of kinetic energy remains constant as the Reynolds number tends to infinity (or the non-dimensional viscosity tends to zero). This anomalous behavior is central to many theories of high-Reynolds-number turbulence and for this reason has been termed the "zeroth law". Here we report a sequence of direct numerical simulations of incompressible Navier-Stokes in a box with periodic boundary conditions, which indicate that the anomaly vanishes at a rate that agrees with the scaling of third-moment of absolute velocity increments. Our results suggest that turbulence without boundaries may not develop strong enough singularities to sustain the zeroth law.</description>

      <title>The influence of wetting effects on the stability of spanwise-confined liquid films</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.13300</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.13300v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the influence of side-walls wetting effects on the linear stability of falling liquid films confined in the spanwise direction. Building upon our previous stability framework, which was developed to analyze the effect of spanwise confinement on the stability, we now incorporate wetting phenomena to develop a more comprehensive theoretical model. This extended model captures the interplay of gravity, inertia, surface tension, viscous dissipation, static meniscus, and moving contact lines. The base state exhibits two key features: a curved meniscus and a velocity overshoot near the side walls. A biglobal linear stability analysis is conducted based on the linearized Navier-Stokes equations. Unlike classical stability theory, our results reveal that surface tension, when strong, suppresses the long-wave instability ($k \rightarrow 0$), significantly increasing the critical Reynolds number as it increases. Notably, this effect is more pronounced for smaller contact angles. Moreover, stabilization is present across all wavenumbers at small Reynolds numbers, however, at large Reynolds numbers, the stabilization effect weakens, even for small contact angles. Furthermore, this stabilization is governed by the ratio of the capillary length to channel width, where complete stabilization occurs when this ratio exceeds a critical value dependent on the contact angle. We attribute this behavior to a capillary attenuation mechanism that dominates at smaller contact angles. No destabilization due to velocity overshoot was observed in the linear regime. Additionally, the introduction of wetting effects results in vortical structures in the vicinity of the side walls. These vortices dissipate the perturbation energy, thereby stabilizing the flow.</description>

      <title>Harnessing Leading-Edge Vortices for Improved Thrust Performance of Wave-Induced Flapping Foil Propulsors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.13309</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.13309v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study employs high-fidelity fluid-structure interaction simulations to investigate design optimizations for wave-assisted propulsion (WAP) systems using flapping foils. Building on prior work that identified the leading-edge vortex (LEV) as critical to thrust generation for these flapping foil propulsors, this work explores pitch control mechanisms and foil geometries to improve performance across varying sea states. Two pitch-limiting strategies $\unicode{x2014}$ a spring-limiter and an angle-limiter $\unicode{x2014}$ are evaluated. Results show that while both perform similarly at higher sea states, the angle-limiter yields superior thrust at sea-state 1, making it the preferred mechanism due to its simplicity and effectiveness. Additionally, foil geometry effects are analyzed, with thin elliptical and flat plate foils outperforming the baseline NACA0015 shape. The elliptical foil offers marginally better performance and is recommended for WAP applications. A fixed pitch amplitude of 5{\deg} provides thrust across all sea states, offering a practical alternative to more complex adaptive systems. These findings demonstrate how insights into the flow physics of flapping foils can inform the design of more efficient WAP systems.</description>

      <title>Slow uniform flow of a rarefied gas past an infinitely thin circular disk</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.13493</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.13493v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The steady behavior of a rarefied gas flowing past an infinitely thin circular disk is investigated based on kinetic theory, with the uniform flow assumed to be perpendicular to the disk surface. Although this problem is classical in fluid mechanics, it is revisited here due to the abrupt changes in the fluid variables near the disk edge, where a kinetic description becomes essential. This study focuses on elucidating the gas behavior near the sharp edge by resolving the discontinuity in the velocity distribution function originating from the edge. To this end, the linearized Bhatnagar--Gross--Krook (BGK) model of the Boltzmann equation, subject to diffuse reflection boundary conditions, is solved numerically using an integral equation approach. The results clearly reveal the emergence of a kinetic boundary-layer structure near the disk edge, which extends over a distance of several mean free paths, as the Knudsen number $\mathrm{Kn}$ (defined with respect to the disk radius) becomes small. The magnitude of this boundary layer is found to scale as $\mathrm{Kn}^{1/2}$. In addition, the drag force acting on the disk is computed over a wide range of Knudsen numbers.</description>

      <title>Energy Minimization in Fluid Flow through Tubes and Networks of Various Geometries</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.13546</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.13546v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper we continue our previous investigation about energy minimization in the flow of fluids through tubes and networks of interconnected tubes of various geometries. We will show that the principle of energy minimization holds independent of the geometry of the tubes and networks of such interconnected tubes and independent of the type of fluid in such geometries where in this regard we consider generalized Newtonian fluids. We consider in this investigation the flow of Newtonian fluids through tubes and networks of interconnected tubes of elliptical, rectangular, equilateral triangular and concentric circular annular cross sectional geometries. We also consider a combination of geometric factor with a fluid type factor by showing that the principle of energy minimization holds in the flow of some non-Newtonian fluids (namely power law, Ellis and Ree-Eyring fluids) through tubes and networks of interconnected tubes of elliptical cross sections. The relevance of this study extends beyond tubes and networks of fluid flow to include for instance porous media and electrical networks.</description>

      <title>Flow past a fixed spherical droplet: breaking of axisymmetry by an internal flow bifurcation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.13652</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.13652v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Direct numerical simulations of a uniform flow past a fixed spherical droplet are performed to determine the parameter range within which the axisymmetric flow becomes unstable. The problem is governed by three dimensionless parameters: the drop-to-fluid dynamic viscosity ratio, $\mu^\ast$, and the external and internal Reynolds numbers, $\Rey^e$ and $\Rey^i$, which are defined using the kinematic viscosities of the external and internal fluids, respectively. The present study confirms the existence of a regime at low-to-moderate viscosity ratio where the axisymmetric flow breaks down due to an internal flow instability. In the initial stages of this bifurcation, the external flow remains axisymmetric, while the asymmetry is generated and grows only inside the droplet. As the disturbance propagates outward, the entire flow first transits to a biplanar symmetric flow, characterised by two pairs of counter-rotating streamwise vortices in the wake. A detailed examination of the flow field reveals that the vorticity on the internal side of the droplet interface is driving the flow instability. Specifically, the bifurcation sets in once the maximum internal vorticity exceeds a critical value that decreases with increasing $\Rey^i$. For sufficiently large $\Rey^i$, internal flow bifurcation may occur at viscosity ratios of $\mu^\ast = O(10)$, an order of magnitude higher than previously reported values. Finally, we demonstrate that the internal flow bifurcation in the configuration of a fixed droplet in a uniform fluid stream is closely related to the first path instability experienced by a buoyant, deformable droplet of low-to-moderate $\mu^\ast$ freely rising in a stagnant liquid.</description>

      <title>Effect of micromagnetorotation on a micropolar magnetohydrodynamic blood flow in a 3D stenosed artery</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.13678</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.13678v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study presents a numerical investigation of a 3D micropolar magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) blood flow through stenosis, with and without the effects of micromagnetorotation (MMR). MMR refers to the magnetic torque caused by the misalignment of the magnetization of magnetic particles in the fluid with the magnetic field, which affects the internal rotation (microrotation) of these particles. Blood can be modeled as a micropolar fluid with magnetic particles due to the magnetization of erythrocytes. In this manner, this study analyzes important flow features, i.e., streamlines, vorticity, velocity, and microrotation, under varying stenosis (50%, 80%), hematocrit levels (25%, 45%), and magnetic fields (1T, 3T, 8T), using two newly developed transient OpenFOAM solvers epotMicropolarFoam and epotMMRFoam. Results indicate that micropolar effects become more pronounced at severe stenosis due to the significant reduction in artery size. Furthermore, when MMR is disregarded (i.e., when blood is modeled as a classical MHD micropolar fluid without magnetic particles), the magnetic field does not significantly alter blood flow, regardless of its intensity, due to the minimal impact of the Lorentz force on blood. Conversely, MMR substantially affects blood flow, particularly at higher hematocrit levels and severe stenoses, leading to reductions of up to 30% in velocity and vorticity and up to 99.9% in microrotation. Simultaneously, any vortices or disturbances are dampened. These findings underscore the critical role of MMR (which was ignored so far) in altering flow behavior in stenosed arteries, suggesting that it should be considered in future MHD micropolar blood flow studies.</description>

      <title>JANC: A cost-effective, differentiable compressible reacting flow solver featured with JAX-based adaptive mesh refinement</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.13750</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.13750v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The compressible reacting flow numerical solver is an essential tool in the study of combustion, energy disciplines, as well as in the design of industrial power and propulsion devices. We have established the first JAX-based block-structured adaptive mesh refinement (AMR) framework, called JAX-AMR, and then developed a fully-differentiable solver for compressible reacting flows, named JANC. JANC is implemented in Python and features automatic differentiation capabilities, enabling an efficient integration of the solver with machine learning. Furthermore, benefited by multiple acceleration features such as XLA-powered JIT compilation, GPU/TPU computing, parallel computing, and AMR, the computational efficiency of JANC has been significantly improved. In a comparative test of a two-dimensional detonation tube case, the computational cost of the JANC core solver, running on a single A100 GPU, was reduced to 1% of that of OpenFOAM, which was parallelized across 384 CPU cores. When the AMR method is enabled for both solvers, JANC's computational cost can be reduced to 1-2% of that of OpenFOAM. The core solver of JANC has also been tested for parallel computation on a 4-card A100 setup, demonstrating its convenient and efficient parallel computing capability. JANC also shows strong compatibility with machine learning by combining adjoint optimization to make the whole dynamic trajectory efficiently differentiable. JANC provides a new generation of high-performance, cost-effective, and high-precision solver framework for large-scale numerical simulations of compressible reacting flows and related machine learning research. Now, the source codes have been available under the MIT license at https://github.com/JA4S/JAX-AMR and https://github.com/JA4S/JANC.</description>

      <title>The Footprint of Laminar Separation on a Wall-Bounded Wing Section at Transitional Reynolds Numbers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.05926</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.05926v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: When a chordwise Reynolds number (Re) falls below about $10^5$ the performance of wings and aerodynamic sections become sensitive to viscous phenomena, including boundary layer separation and possible reattachment. Here, detailed measurements of the flow inside the boundary layer on the suction surface are shown for an aspect ratio 3 wing with wall boundaries. The separation lines and recirculation zones are shown on the wing and on the wall junction as Re and angle of incidence, ($\alpha$) are varied. There is good agreement on the lowest Re case which has also been computed in direct numerical simulation. Though the flow at midspan may sometimes be described as two-dimensional, at $\alpha \leq 6^\circ$ it is unrepresentative of the remainder of the wing, and the influence of the wall is seen in strong spanwise flows aft of the separation line. The geometry of the NACA 65(1)-412 section, used here, promotes a substantial chord length for the development of the recirculating regions behind separation making it apt for their study. However, the phenomena themselves are likely to be found over a wide range of wings with moderate thickness at moderate $\alpha$.</description>

      <title>Diffusivity-Free Turbulence in Liquid Metal Rotating Rayleigh-B\'enard Convection Experiments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.11226</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.11226v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Convection in planets and stars is predicted to occur in the "ultimate regime'' of diffusivity-free, rapidly rotating turbulence, in which flows are characteristically unaffected by viscous and thermal diffusion. Boundary layer diffusion, however, has historically hindered experimental study of this regime. Here, we utilize the boundary-independent oscillatory thermal-inertial mode of rotating convection to realize the diffusivity-free scaling in liquid metal laboratory experiments. This oscillatory style of convection arises in rotating liquid metals (low Prandtl number fluids) and is driven by the temperature gradient in the fluid bulk, thus remaining independent of diffusive boundary dynamics. We triply verify the existence of the diffusivity-free regime via measurements of heat transfer efficiency $Nu$, dimensionless flow velocities $Re$, and internal temperature anomalies $\theta$, all of which are in quantitative agreement with planar asymptotically-reduced models. Achieving the theoretical diffusivity-free scalings in desktop-sized laboratory experiments provides the validation necessary to extrapolate and predict the convective flows in remote geophysical and astrophysical systems.</description>

      <title>A Multi-Component, Multi-Physics Computational Model for Solving Coupled Cardiac Electromechanics and Vascular Haemodynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.11797</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.11797v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The circulatory system, comprising the heart and blood vessels, is vital for nutrient transport, waste removal, and homeostasis. Traditional computational models often treat cardiac electromechanics and blood flow dynamics separately, overlooking the integrated nature of the system. This paper presents an innovative approach that couples a 3D electromechanical model of the heart with a 3D fluid mechanics model of vascular blood flow. Using a file-based partitioned coupling scheme, these models run independently while sharing essential data through intermediate files. We validate this approach using solvers developed by separate research groups, each targeting disparate dynamical scales employing distinct discretisation schemes, and implemented in different programming languages. Numerical simulations using idealised and realistic anatomies show that the coupling scheme is reliable and requires minimal additional computation time relative to advancing individual time steps in the heart and blood flow models. Notably, the coupled model predicts muscle displacement and aortic wall shear stress differently than the standalone models, highlighting the importance of coupling between cardiac and vascular dynamics in cardiovascular simulations. Moreover, we demonstrate the model's potential for medical applications by simulating the effects of myocardial scarring on downstream vascular flow. This study presents a paradigm case of how to build virtual human models and digital twins by productive collaboration between teams with complementary expertise.</description>

      <title>Computational fluid dynamics-based structure optimization of ultra-high-pressure water-jet nozzle using approximation method</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.01137</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.01137v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Since the geometry structure of ultra-high-pressure (UHP) water-jet nozzle is a critical factor to enhance its hydrodynamic performance, it is critical to obtain a suitable geometry for a UHP water jet nozzle. In this study, a CFD-based optimization loop for UHP nozzle structure has been developed by integrating an approximate model to optimize nozzle structure for increasing the radial peak wall shear stress. In order to improve the optimization accuracy of the sparrow search algorithm (SSA), an enhanced version called the Logistic-Tent chaotic sparrow search algorithm (LTC-SSA) is proposed. The LTC-SSA algorithm utilizes the Logistic-Tent Chaotic (LTC) map, which is designed by combining the Logistic and Tent maps. This new approach aims to overcome the shortcoming of "premature convergence" for the SSA algorithm by increasing the diversity of the sparrow population. In addition, to improve the prediction accuracy of peak wall shear stress, a data prediction method based on LTC-SSA-support vector machine (SVM) is proposed. Herein, LTC-SSA algorithm is used to train the penalty coefficient C and parameter gamma g of SVM model. In order to build LTC-SSA-SVM model, optimal Latin hypercube design (Opt LHD) is used to design the sampling nozzle structures, and the peak wall shear stress (objective function) of these nozzle structures are calculated by CFD method. For the purpose of this article, this optimization framework has been employed to optimize original nozzle structure. The results show that the optimization framework developed in this study can be used to optimize nozzle structure with significantly improved its hydrodynamic performance.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2501.09907v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Stylized turbulent swirls depicted in artworks are often analyzed with the modern tools for real turbulent flows such as the power spectrum and the structure function. Motivated by the recent study on \textit{The Starry Night} of van Gogh (Ma \textit{et al}., Phys. Fluids, \textbf{36} 095140, 2024), we here analyze Ogata K\=orin's \textit{Red and White Plum Blossoms}, in particular its swirling pattern and the bark of the plum-tree trunk. The results show that they follow closely the Obukhov--Corrsin spectrum $k^{-5/3}$ in the inertial-convective range of the passive scalar advected by the homogeneous and isotropic turbulence. Furthermore their 4th- and 6th-order structure functions exhibit approximately the same intermittent scaling law of the passive scalar. We discuss several possible explanations of this consistency.</description>
