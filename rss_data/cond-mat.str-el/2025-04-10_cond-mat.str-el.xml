      <title>Inverse Single-sided Magnet</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.06284</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.06284v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A single-sided magnet generates a magnetic field on only one side while canceling it on the opposite side, a feature that has enabled diverse applications in both fundamental science and engineering. Here, we propose the {\it inverse} single-sided magnet: a non-ferromagnetic system that selectively attracts either the north or south pole of a ferromagnet while remaining unresponsive to the opposite pole. We demonstrate that such behavior can arise in microscopic octupolar magnets. To illustrate this, we analyze two minimal models: a coplanar magnetic structure with 120-degree ordering and a collinear magnetic structure with site-dependent anisotropy. In both cases, we find that the magnetization response is nonreciprocal with respect to the sign of the applied magnetic field. Notably, in the latter model, the system exhibits strong magnetization in one field direction and negligible response in the opposite direction. This diode-like behavior for magnetic fields suggests that inverse single-sided magnets could play a pivotal role in controlling magnetic interference, with potential impact comparable to conventional single-sided magnets.</description>

      <title>Identifying Universal Spin Excitations in Spin-1/2 Kagome Quantum Spin Liquid Materials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.06491</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.06491v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A quantum spin liquid (QSL) is an exotic quantum state of matter characterized by fluctuating spins which may exhibit long-range entanglement. Among the possible host candidates for a QSL ground state, the $S$=1/2 kagome lattice antiferromagnet is particularly promising. Using high resolution inelastic neutron scattering measurements on Zn-barlowite (Zn$_\mathrm{x}$Cu$_\mathrm{4-x}$(OD)$_\mathrm{6}$FBr, $x\simeq 0.80$), we measure a spin excitation spectrum consistent with a QSL ground state. Continuum scattering above $\sim$1 meV matches that of herbertsmithite (Zn$_\mathrm{x}$Cu$_\mathrm{4-x}$(OD)$_6$Cl$_2$, $x\simeq 0.85$), another prominent kagome QSL material, indicating universal spinon excitations. A detailed analysis of the spin-spin correlations, compared with density matrix renormalization group calculations, further indicate a QSL ground state for the physically relevant Hamiltonian parameters. The measured spectra in Zn-barlowite are consistent with gapped behavior with a gap size $\Delta = 1.1(2)$ meV. Comparison with a simple pair correlation model allows us to clearly distinguish intrinsic kagome correlations from impurity-induced correlations. Our results clarify the behavior that is universal within this important family of QSL candidate materials.</description>

      <title>A critical theory for solidification of a liquid Fermi liquid</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.06508</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.06508v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We give a simple description of a zero-temperature phase transition between a liquid metal and a solid. The critical point has a Fermi surface as well as a Bose surface, a sphere in momentum space of gapless bosonic excitations. We find a fixed point of the renormalization group governing such a non-Fermi liquid, using an expansion in the codimension of both the Fermi and Bose surfaces. We comment on the nature of the solid phase and possible physical realizations.</description>

      <title>Two-Axis planar Hall magnetic field sensors with sub nanoTesla resolution</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.06630</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.06630v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Planar Hall effect (PHE) magnetic sensors are attractive for various applications where the field resolution is required in the range of sub-nano Tesla or in Pico Tesla. Here we present a detailed noise study of the PHE sensors consisting of two or three intersecting ellipses. It can be used to measure two axes of the magnetic field in the sensor plane in particular along the two perpendicular easy axes in the overlapping region for two intersecting ellipses and three easy axes at an angle of 60 degrees for three crossing ellipses. Thus, for each remanent magnetic state in the overlap area, the sensor can measure the vector component of the magnetic field perpendicular to the direction of the remanent magnetization. The two field components are measured with a field resolution less than 200 pT/sqrt(Hz) at 10 Hz and 350 pT/sqrt(Hz) at 1 Hz in the same region, while maintaining a similar size and noise level of a single-axis sensor. Furthermore, we discuss here the possible route for future improvement of the field resolution</description>

      <title>Selective Kondo screening and strange metallicity by sliding Dirac semimetals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.06739</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.06739v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Kondo screening of local moments in normal metals typically leads to hybridized conduction and valence bands separated by a Kondo gap, resulting in an insulating state at half-band filling. We show a dramatic change of this scenario in a Dirac-semimetal-based correlated system -- a bilayer honeycomb lattice heterostructure where the local moment lattice is stacked on a Dirac semimetal breaking the inversion symmetry. This system is modeled by an extended Anderson honeycomb lattice involving the real-space dependence of major interlayer hybridization parameters on the relative sliding distance along the armchair direction. First, we unveil the multiple Kondo scales and the successive Kondo breakdown transitions in this correlated heterostructure under sliding. Second, we demonstrate the existence of a genuine selective Kondo screening phase which is stabilized near the A-B stack pattern and is accessible by applying the interlayer voltage. Third, we find a nearly flat hybridized band located concomitantly within the Kondo gap, resulting in an unprecedented metallic state at the half-band filling. This unconventional heavy fermion state is characterized by the violation of Luttinger theorem and the appearance of a Van Hove singularity at the Fermi energy. The general sliding-driven band structure landscape and the implications of our results for the broad context of multiorbital Kondo physics are briefly discussed.</description>

      <title>Generic deformation channels for critical Fermi surfaces including the impact of collisions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.06945</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.06945v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper constitutes a sequel to our theoretical efforts to determine the nature of the generic low-energy deformations of the Fermi surface of a quantum-critical metal, which arises at the stable non-Fermi liquid (NFL) fixed point of a quantum phase transition. The emergent critical Fermi surface, arising right at the Ising-nematic quantum critical point (QCP), is a paradigmatic example where an NFL behaviour is induced by the strong interactions of the fermionic degrees of freedom with those of the bosonic order parameter. It is an artifact of the bosonic modes becoming massless at the QCP, thus undergoing Landau damping at the level of one-loop self-energy. We resort to the well-tested formalism of the quantum Boltzmann equations (QBEs)for identifying the excitations. While in our earlier works, we have focussed on the collisionless regime by neglecting the collision integral and assuming the bosons to be in equilibrium, here we embark on a full analysis. In particular, we take into account the bosonic part of the QBEs. The final results show that that the emergent modes are long-lived and robust against the damping effects brought about the collision integral(s), exhibiting the same qualitative features as obtained from the no-collision approximations.</description>

      <title>Fermi surface as a quantum critical manifold: gaplessness, order parameter, and scaling in $d$-dimensions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.07014</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.07014v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study several models of $d$-dimensional fermions ($d=1,2,3$) with an emphasis on the properties of their gapless (metallic) phase. It occurs at $T = 0$ as a continuous transition when zeros of the partition function reach the real range of parameters. Those zeros define the $(d-1)$-manifold of quantum criticality (Fermi surface). Its appearance or restructuring correspond to the Lifshitz transition. Such $(d-1)$-membrane breaks the symmetry of the momentum space, leading to gapless excitations, a hallmark of metallic phase. To probe quantitatively the gapless phase we introduce the geometric order parameter as $d$-volume of the Fermi sea. From analysis of the chain, ladder, and free fermions with different spectra, this proposal is shown to be consistent with scaling near the Lifshitz points of other quantities: correlation length, oscillation wavelength, susceptibilities, and entanglement. All the (hyper)scaling relations are satisfied. Two interacting cases of the Tomonaga-Luttinger ($d=1$) and the Fermi ($d=2,3$) liquids are analysed, yielding the same universality classes as free fermions.</description>

      <title>Non-Hermitian Numerical Renormalization Group: Solution of the non-Hermitian Kondo model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.07019</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.07019v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Non-Hermitian (NH) Hamiltonians describe open quantum systems, nonequilibrium dynamics, and dissipative processes. Although a rich range of single-particle NH physics has been uncovered, many-body phenomena in strongly correlated NH systems have been far less well studied. The Kondo effect, an important paradigm for strong correlation physics, has recently been considered in the NH setting. Here we develop a NH generalization of the numerical renormalization group (NRG) and use it to solve the NH Kondo model. Our non-perturbative solution applies beyond weak coupling, and we uncover a nontrivial phase diagram. The method is showcased by application to the NH pseudogap Kondo model, which we show supports a completely novel phase with a genuine NH stable fixed point and complex eigenspectrum. Our NH-NRG code, which can be used in regimes and for models inaccessible to, e.g., perturbative scaling and Bethe ansatz, is provided open source.</description>

      <title>Universal neural wave functions for high-pressure hydrogen</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.07062</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.07062v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We leverage the power of neural quantum states to describe the ground state wave function of solid and liquid dense hydrogen, including both electronic and protonic degrees of freedom. For static protons, the resulting Born-Oppenheimer energies are consistently lower than all previous projector Monte Carlo calculations for systems containing up to $128$ hydrogen atoms. In contrast to conventional methods, we introduce a universal trial wave function whose variational parameters are optimized simultaneously over a large set of proton configurations spanning a wide pressure-temperature spectrum and covering both molecular and atomic phases. This global optimization not only yields lower energies compared to benchmarks but also brings an enormous reduction in computational cost. By including nuclear quantum effects in the zero-temperature ground state, thus going beyond the Born-Oppenheimer approximation, our description overcomes major limitations of current wave functions, notably by avoiding any explicit symmetry assumption on the expected quantum crystal and sidestepping efficiency issues of imaginary time evolution with disparate mass scales. As a first application, we examine crystal formation in an extremely high-density region where pressure-induced melting is expected.</description>

      <title>Successive randomized compression: A randomized algorithm for the compressed MPO-MPS product</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.06475</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.06475v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Tensor networks like matrix product states (MPSs) and matrix product operators (MPOs) are powerful tools for representing exponentially large states and operators, with applications in quantum many-body physics, machine learning, numerical analysis, and other areas. In these applications, computing a compressed representation of the MPO--MPS product is a fundamental computational primitive. For this operation, this paper introduces a new single-pass, randomized algorithm, called successive randomized compression (SRC), that improves on existing approaches in speed or in accuracy. The performance of the new algorithm is evaluated on synthetic problems and unitary time evolution problems for quantum spin systems.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2504.06853v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Molecular magnets are a promising class of materials with exciting properties and applications. However, a profound understanding and application of such materials depends on the accurate detection of their electronic and magnetic properties. Despite the availability of experimental techniques that can sense the magnetic signal, the exact determination of the spin ground states and spatial distribution of exchange interaction of strongly correlated single-molecule magnets remains challenging. Here, we demonstrate that scanning probe microscopy with a nickelocene-functionalized probe can distinguish between nearly degenerate multireference ground states of single-molecule {\pi}-magnets and map their spatial distribution of the exchange interaction. This method expands the already outstanding imaging capabilities of scanning probe microscopy for characterizing the chemical and electronic structures of individual molecules, paving the way for the study of strongly correlated molecular magnets with unprecedented spatial resolution.</description>

      <title>A modified-residue prescription to calculate dynamical correlation functions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.06912</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.06912v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: One of the challenges in using numerical methods to address many-body problems is the multi-dimensional integration over poles. More often that not, one needs such integrations to be evaluated as a function of an external variable. An example would be calculating dynamical correlations functions that are used to model response functions, where the external variable is the frequency. The standard numerical techniques rely on building an adaptive mesh, using special points in the Brillouin zone or using advanced smearing techniques. Most of these techniques, however, suffer when the grid is coarse. Here we propose that, if one knows the nature of the singularity in the integrand, one can define a residue and use it to faithfully estimate the integral and reproduce all the resulting singular features even with a coarse grid. We demonstrate the effectiveness of the method for different scenarios of calculating correlation functions with different resulting singular features, for calculating collective modes and densities of states. We also present a quantitative analysis of the error and show that this method can be widely applicable.</description>

      <title>Intertwining Josephson and Vortex Topologies in Conventional Superconductors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.07066</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.07066v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recent experimental advances have unveiled promising evidence of vortex-bound Majorana quasiparticles in multiple superconducting compounds. However, theoretical progress in understanding these phenomena, especially from ab initio approaches, has been limited by the computational complexity of simulating vortex structures. To bridge this gap, we introduce the Josephson-vortex correspondence (JVC), a theoretical framework that systematically maps the bound-state topological properties of vortices to those of $\pi$-phase Josephson junctions in the same superconductor. This correspondence allows vortex phase diagrams to be constructed directly from junction calculations, thereby eliminating the need for large-scale vortex calculations. We demonstrate the validity and predictive power of JVC across a variety of effective models, and further extend the framework to the first-principles level. Applying our approach to 2M-WS$_2$ and Sr$_3$SnO, we identify them as realistic, doping-tunable platforms for realizing vortex Majorana zero modes. Our theory will pave the way for ab initio Majorana material discovery and design.</description>

      <title>Chiral superconductivity from spin polarized Chern band in twisted MoTe$_2$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.07082</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.07082v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Superconductivity has been observed in twisted MoTe2 within the anomalous Hall metal parent state. Key signatures-including a fully spin/valley polarized normal state, anomalous Hall resistivity hysteresis, superconducting phase adjacent to the fractional Chern insulating state and a narrow superconducting dome at zero gating field-collectively indicate chiral superconductivity driven by intravalley pairing of electrons. Within the Kohn-Luttinger mechanism, we compute the superconducting phase diagram via random phase approximation, incorporating Coulomb repulsion in a realistic continuum model. Our results identify a dominant intravalley pairing with a narrow superconducting dome of p+ip type at zero gate field. This chiral phase contrasts sharply with the much weaker time-reversal-symmetric intervalley pairing at finite gating field. Our work highlights the role of band topology in achieving robust topological superconductivity, and supports the chiral and topological nature of the superconductivity observed in twisted MoTe2.</description>

Abstract: Inspired by the observation of extreme field-boosted superconductivity in uranium ditelluride, we present a scenario in which superconductivity can be induced by a strong Zeeman field, rather than destroyed by it, as is the case in Pauli-limited superconductivity. The resulting superconducting state has an upper critical field far greater than the superconducting transition temperature, and with spin-orbit coupling, it is sensitive to the field orientation. We demonstrate the interplay between superconductivity and metamagnetism in a simple effective theory.</description>

      <title>Glassy disordered ground states in the frustrated pyrochlore and fluorite antiferromagnets NaCd$M_2$F$_7$ ($M$ = Ni$^{2+}$, Mn$^{2+}$)</title>

Abstract: We report the crystal structures, magnetic and thermodynamic properties of two magnetically frustrated $A$'$A$"$M_2$F$_7$-type antiferromagnets, NaCdNi$_2$F$_7$ and NaCdMn$_2$F$_7$. While NaCdNi$_2$F$_7$ forms a stable pyrochlore structure (SG: $Fd \overline{3} m$, #227) with magnetic $S$ = 1 Ni$^{2+}$ ions on the frustrated pyrochlore 16$c$ site and fully disordered non-magnetic Na$^+$/Cd$^{2+}$ ions on the pyrochlore 16$d$ site, NaCdMn$_2$F$_7$ favors the defect-fluorite structure (SG: $Fm \overline{3} m$, #225) with magnetic $S$ = 5/2 Mn$^{2+}$ and non-magnetic Na$^+$ and Cd$^{2+}$ ions fully disordered on the fluorite 4$a$ site. This is a result of the Mn$^{2+}$ ionic radius being too close to the average Na$^+$/Cd$^{2+}$ ionic radius, hindering the cationic site ordering towards the stable pyrochlore structure. In both cases, dominant antiferromagnetic interactions $\theta_{CW,Ni}$ = -91.2(5) K and $\theta_{CW,Mn}$ = -42.4(4) K are noted, with no magnetic transition until $T_{f,Ni}$ = 3.2 K and $T_{f,Mn}$ = 2.0 K, implying substantial frustration, with frustration indices $f_{Ni}$ = 28.5 and $f_{Mn}$ = 21. AC susceptibility measurements and bifurcation of ZFC/FC low-field magnetization indicate a glassy ground-state, precipitated by the magnetic-bond-disorder stemming from the inherent structural disorder.</description>

      <title>Accurate Gauge-Invariant Tensor Network Simulations for Abelian Lattice Gauge Theory in (2+1)D</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.20566</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.20566v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We propose a novel tensor network method to achieve accurate and efficient simulations of Abelian lattice gauge theories (LGTs) in (2+1)D. The first key is to identify a gauge canonical form (GCF) of gauge-invariant tensor network states, which simplifies existing algorithms already for (1+1)D LGTs. The second key is to employ the GCF of projected entangled-pair state (PEPS) combining variational Monte Carlo, enabling efficient variational optimization for (2+1)D LGT ground states with gauge and matter fields. We demonstrate the versatile capability of this approach for accurate simulation of pure $\mathbb{Z}_2$, $\mathbb{Z}_3$ and $\mathbb{Z}_4$ gauge theory, odd-$\mathbb{Z}_2$ gauge theories, and $\mathbb{Z}_2$ gauge theory coupled to hard-core bosons, on square lattices up to $32\times 32$. Our work establishes gauge-invariant PEPS as a powerful approach to simulate (2+1)D Abelian LGTs.</description>

      <title>Symmetrizing the Constraints -- Density Matrix Renormalization Group for Constrained Lattice Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.04035</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.04035v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We develop a density matrix renormalization group (DMRG) algorithm for constrained quantum lattice models that successfully implements the local constraints as symmetries in the contraction of the matrix product states and matrix product operators. Such an implementation allows us to investigate a quantum dimer model in DMRG with substantial circumference on cylindrical geometry for the first time in the literature. We have thence computed the ground state phase diagram of the quantum dimer model on triangular lattice, with the symmetry-breaking characteristics of the columnar solid phase and $\sqrt{12}\times\sqrt{12}$ valence bond solid phase fully captured, as well as the topological entanglement entropy of the $\mathbb{Z}_2$ quantum spin liquid phase that extends to the RK point on non-bipartite lattice accurately revealed. Our DMRG algorithm on constrained quantum lattice models opens new opportunities for matrix and tensor-based algorithms for these systems that have immediate relevance towards the frustrated quantum magnets and synthetic quantum simulators.</description>

      <title>Computable and Faithful Lower Bound on Entanglement Cost</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.10649</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.10649v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Quantifying the minimum entanglement needed to prepare quantum states and implement quantum processes is a key challenge in quantum information theory. In this work, we develop computable and faithful lower bounds on the entanglement cost under quantum operations that completely preserve the positivity of partial transpose (PPT operations), by introducing logarithmic $k$-negativity, a generalization of logarithmic negativity. Our bounds are efficiently computable via semidefinite programming and provide non-trivial values for all states that are not PPT, establishing their faithfulness. Notably, we find and affirm the irreversibility of asymptotic entanglement manipulation under PPT operations for full-rank entangled states. Furthermore, we extend our methodology to derive lower bounds on the entanglement cost of both point-to-point and bipartite quantum channels. Our bound demonstrates improvements over previously known computable bounds for a wide range of states and channels. These findings push the boundaries of understanding the structure of entanglement and the fundamental limits of entanglement manipulation.</description>

      <title>Exact closed-form unitary transformations of fermionic operators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.09636</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.09636v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Unitary transformations play a fundamental role in many-body physics, and except for special cases, they are not expressible in closed form. We present closed-form expressions for unitary transformations generated by a single fermionic operator for Hermitian and anti-Hermitian generators. We demonstrate the usefulness of these expressions in formal analyses of unitary transformations and numerical applications involving block-diagonalization and Heisenberg dynamics. This work paves the way for new analytical treatments of unitary transformations and numerical many-body methods for fermions.</description>

      <title>Compressing Hamiltonians with \emph{ab initio} downfolding for simulating strongly-correlated materials on quantum computers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.12237</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.12237v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The accurate first-principles description of strongly-correlated materials is an important and challenging problem in condensed matter physics. \emph{Ab initio} downfolding has emerged as a way of deriving compressed many-body Hamiltonians that maintain the essential physics of strongly-correlated materials. The solution of these material-specific models is still exponentially difficult to generate on classical computers, but quantum algorithms allow for a significant speed-up in obtaining the ground states of these compressed Hamiltonians. Here we demonstrate that utilizing quantum algorithms for obtaining the properties of downfolded Hamiltonians can indeed yield high-fidelity solutions. By combining \emph{ab initio} downfolding and variational quantum eigensolvers, we correctly predict the antiferromagnetic state of one-dimensional cuprate $\text{Ca}_2\text{CuO}_3$, the excitonic ground state of monolayer $\text{WTe}_2$, and the charge-ordered state of correlated metal $\text{SrVO}_3$. Numerical simulations utilizing a classical tensor network implementation of variational quantum eigensolvers allow us to simulate large models with up to $54$ qubits and encompassing up to four bands in the correlated subspace, which is indicative of the complexity that our framework can address. Through these methods we demonstrate the potential of classical pre-optimization and downfolding techniques for enabling efficient materials simulation using quantum algorithms.</description>

      <title>Measuring pair correlations in Bose and Fermi gases via atom-resolved microscopy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.08780</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.08780v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We demonstrate atom-resolved detection of itinerant bosonic $^{23}$Na and fermionic $^6$Li quantum gases, enabling the direct in situ measurement of interparticle correlations. In contrast to prior work on lattice-trapped gases, here we realize microscopy of quantum gases in the continuum. We reveal Bose-Einstein condensation with single-atom resolution, measure the enhancement of two-particle $g^{(2)}$ correlations of thermal bosons, and observe the suppression of $g^{(2)}$ for fermions; the Fermi or exchange hole. For strongly interacting Fermi gases confined to two dimensions, we directly observe non-local fermion pairs in the BEC-BCS crossover. We obtain the pairing gap, the pair size, and the short-range contact directly from the pair correlations. In situ thermometry is enabled via the fluctuation-dissipation theorem. Our technique opens the door to the atom-resolved study of strongly correlated quantum gases of bosons, fermions, and their mixtures.</description>
