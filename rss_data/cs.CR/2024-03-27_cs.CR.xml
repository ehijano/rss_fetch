      <title>Holographic Global Convolutional Networks for Long-Range Prediction Tasks in Malware Detection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.17978</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.17978v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Malware detection is an interesting and valuable domain to work in because it has significant real-world impact and unique machine-learning challenges. We investigate existing long-range techniques and benchmarks and find that they're not very suitable in this problem area. In this paper, we introduce Holographic Global Convolutional Networks (HGConv) that utilize the properties of Holographic Reduced Representations (HRR) to encode and decode features from sequence elements. Unlike other global convolutional methods, our method does not require any intricate kernel computation or crafted kernel design. HGConv kernels are defined as simple parameters learned through backpropagation. The proposed method has achieved new SOTA results on Microsoft Malware Classification Challenge, Drebin, and EMBER malware benchmarks. With log-linear complexity in sequence length, the empirical results demonstrate substantially faster run-time by HGConv compared to other methods achieving far more efficient scaling even with sequence length $\geq 100,000$.</description>

      <title>EG-ConMix: An Intrusion Detection Method based on Graph Contrastive Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.17980</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.17980v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: As the number of IoT devices increases, security concerns become more prominent. The impact of threats can be minimized by deploying Network Intrusion Detection System (NIDS) by monitoring network traffic, detecting and discovering intrusions, and issuing security alerts promptly. Most intrusion detection research in recent years has been directed towards the pair of traffic itself without considering the interrelationships among them, thus limiting the monitoring of complex IoT network attack events. Besides, anomalous traffic in real networks accounts for only a small fraction, which leads to a severe imbalance problem in the dataset that makes algorithmic learning and prediction extremely difficult. In this paper, we propose an EG-ConMix method based on E-GraphSAGE, incorporating a data augmentation module to fix the problem of data imbalance. In addition, we incorporate contrastive learning to discern the difference between normal and malicious traffic samples, facilitating the extraction of key features. Extensive experiments on two publicly available datasets demonstrate the superior intrusion detection performance of EG-ConMix compared to state-of-the-art methods. Remarkably, it exhibits significant advantages in terms of training speed and accuracy for large-scale graphs.</description>

      <title>Leak and Learn: An Attacker's Cookbook to Train Using Leaked Data from Federated Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.18144</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.18144v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Federated learning is a decentralized learning paradigm introduced to preserve privacy of client data. Despite this, prior work has shown that an attacker at the server can still reconstruct the private training data using only the client updates. These attacks are known as data reconstruction attacks and fall into two major categories: gradient inversion (GI) and linear layer leakage attacks (LLL). However, despite demonstrating the effectiveness of these attacks in breaching privacy, prior work has not investigated the usefulness of the reconstructed data for downstream tasks. In this work, we explore data reconstruction attacks through the lens of training and improving models with leaked data. We demonstrate the effectiveness of both GI and LLL attacks in maliciously training models using the leaked data more accurately than a benign federated learning strategy. Counter-intuitively, this bump in training quality can occur despite limited reconstruction quality or a small total number of leaked images. Finally, we show the limitations of these attacks for downstream training, individually for GI attacks and for LLL attacks.</description>

      <title>Optimizing Cyber Response Time on Temporal Active Directory Networks Using Decoys</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.18162</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.18162v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Microsoft Active Directory (AD) is the default security management system for Window domain network. We study the problem of placing decoys in AD network to detect potential attacks. We model the problem as a Stackelberg game between an attacker and a defender on AD attack graphs where the defender employs a set of decoys to detect the attacker on their way to Domain Admin (DA). Contrary to previous works, we consider time-varying (temporal) attack graphs. We proposed a novel metric called response time, to measure the effectiveness of our decoy placement in temporal attack graphs. Response time is defined as the duration from the moment attackers trigger the first decoy to when they compromise the DA. Our goal is to maximize the defender's response time to the worst-case attack paths. We establish the NP-hard nature of the defender's optimization problem, leading us to develop Evolutionary Diversity Optimization (EDO) algorithms. EDO algorithms identify diverse sets of high-quality solutions for the optimization problem. Despite the polynomial nature of the fitness function, it proves experimentally slow for larger graphs. To enhance scalability, we proposed an algorithm that exploits the static nature of AD infrastructure in the temporal setting. Then, we introduce tailored repair operations, ensuring the convergence to better results while maintaining scalability for larger graphs.</description>

      <title>A Transformer-Based Framework for Payload Malware Detection and Classification</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.18223</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.18223v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: As malicious cyber threats become more sophisticated in breaching computer networks, the need for effective intrusion detection systems (IDSs) becomes crucial. Techniques such as Deep Packet Inspection (DPI) have been introduced to allow IDSs analyze the content of network packets, providing more context for identifying potential threats. IDSs traditionally rely on using anomaly-based and signature-based detection techniques to detect unrecognized and suspicious activity. Deep learning techniques have shown great potential in DPI for IDSs due to their efficiency in learning intricate patterns from the packet content being transmitted through the network. In this paper, we propose a revolutionary DPI algorithm based on transformers adapted for the purpose of detecting malicious traffic with a classifier head. Transformers learn the complex content of sequence data and generalize them well to similar scenarios thanks to their self-attention mechanism. Our proposed method uses the raw payload bytes that represent the packet contents and is deployed as man-in-the-middle. The payload bytes are used to detect malicious packets and classify their types. Experimental results on the UNSW-NB15 and CIC-IOT23 datasets demonstrate that our transformer-based model is effective in distinguishing malicious from benign traffic in the test dataset, attaining an average accuracy of 79\% using binary classification and 72\% on the multi-classification experiment, both using solely payload bytes.</description>

      <title>An Experimentally Validated Feasible Quantum Protocol for Identity-Based Signature with Application to Secure Email Communication</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.18247</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.18247v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Digital signatures are one of the simplest cryptographic building blocks that provide appealing security characteristics such as authenticity, unforgeability, and undeniability. In 1984, Shamir developed the first Identity-based signature (IBS) to simplify public key infrastructure and circumvent the need for certificates. It makes the process uncomplicated by enabling users to verify digital signatures using only the identifiers of signers, such as email, phone number, etc. Nearly all existing IBS protocols rely on several theoretical assumption-based hard problems. Unfortunately, these hard problems are unsafe and pose a hazard in the quantum realm. Thus, designing IBS algorithms that can withstand quantum attacks and ensure long-term security is an important direction for future research. Quantum cryptography (QC) is one such approach. In this paper, we propose an IBS based on QC. Our scheme's security is based on the laws of quantum mechanics. It thereby achieves long-term security and provides resistance against quantum attacks. We verify the proposed design's correctness and feasibility by simulating it in a prototype quantum device and the IBM Qiskit quantum simulator. The implementation code in qiskit with Jupyternotebook is provided in the Annexure. Moreover, we discuss the application of our design in secure email communication.</description>

      <title>Bayesian Learned Models Can Detect Adversarial Malware For Free</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.18309</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.18309v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The vulnerability of machine learning-based malware detectors to adversarial attacks has prompted the need for robust solutions. Adversarial training is an effective method but is computationally expensive to scale up to large datasets and comes at the cost of sacrificing model performance for robustness. We hypothesize that adversarial malware exploits the low-confidence regions of models and can be identified using epistemic uncertainty of ML approaches -- epistemic uncertainty in a machine learning-based malware detector is a result of a lack of similar training samples in regions of the problem space. In particular, a Bayesian formulation can capture the model parameters' distribution and quantify epistemic uncertainty without sacrificing model performance. To verify our hypothesis, we consider Bayesian learning approaches with a mutual information-based formulation to quantify uncertainty and detect adversarial malware in Android, Windows domains and PDF malware. We found, quantifying uncertainty through Bayesian learning methods can defend against adversarial malware. In particular, Bayesian models: (1) are generally capable of identifying adversarial malware in both feature and problem space, (2) can detect concept drift by measuring uncertainty, and (3) with a diversity-promoting approach (or better posterior approximations) lead to parameter instances from the posterior to significantly enhance a detectors' ability.</description>

      <title>Privacy-Preserving Distributed Nonnegative Matrix Factorization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.18326</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.18326v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Nonnegative matrix factorization (NMF) is an effective data representation tool with numerous applications in signal processing and machine learning. However, deploying NMF in a decentralized manner over ad-hoc networks introduces privacy concerns due to the conventional approach of sharing raw data among network agents. To address this, we propose a privacy-preserving algorithm for fully-distributed NMF that decomposes a distributed large data matrix into left and right matrix factors while safeguarding each agent's local data privacy. It facilitates collaborative estimation of the left matrix factor among agents and enables them to estimate their respective right factors without exposing raw data. To ensure data privacy, we secure information exchanges between neighboring agents utilizing the Paillier cryptosystem, a probabilistic asymmetric algorithm for public-key cryptography that allows computations on encrypted data without decryption. Simulation results conducted on synthetic and real-world datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm in achieving privacy-preserving distributed NMF over ad-hoc networks.</description>

      <title>FoC: Figure out the Cryptographic Functions in Stripped Binaries with LLMs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.18403</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.18403v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Analyzing the behavior of cryptographic functions in stripped binaries is a challenging but essential task. Cryptographic algorithms exhibit greater logical complexity compared to typical code, yet their analysis is unavoidable in areas such as virus analysis and legacy code inspection. Existing methods often rely on data or structural pattern matching, leading to suboptimal generalizability and suffering from manual work. In this paper, we propose a novel framework called FoC to Figure out the Cryptographic functions in stripped binaries. In FoC, we first build a binary large language model (FoCBinLLM) to summarize the semantics of cryptographic functions in natural language. The prediction of FoC-BinLLM is insensitive to minor changes, such as vulnerability patches. To mitigate it, we further build a binary code similarity model (FoC-Sim) upon the FoC-BinLLM to create change-sensitive representations and use it to retrieve similar implementations of unknown cryptographic functions in a database. In addition, we construct a cryptographic binary dataset for evaluation and to facilitate further research in this domain. And an automated method is devised to create semantic labels for extensive binary functions. Evaluation results demonstrate that FoC-BinLLM outperforms ChatGPT by 14.61% on the ROUGE-L score. FoC-Sim outperforms the previous best methods with a 52% higher Recall@1. Furthermore, our method also shows practical ability in virus analysis and 1-day vulnerability detection.</description>

      <title>MisGUIDE : Defense Against Data-Free Deep Learning Model Extraction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.18580</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.18580v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The rise of Machine Learning as a Service (MLaaS) has led to the widespread deployment of machine learning models trained on diverse datasets. These models are employed for predictive services through APIs, raising concerns about the security and confidentiality of the models due to emerging vulnerabilities in prediction APIs. Of particular concern are model cloning attacks, where individuals with limited data and no knowledge of the training dataset manage to replicate a victim model's functionality through black-box query access. This commonly entails generating adversarial queries to query the victim model, thereby creating a labeled dataset.
  This paper proposes "MisGUIDE", a two-step defense framework for Deep Learning models that disrupts the adversarial sample generation process by providing a probabilistic response when the query is deemed OOD. The first step employs a Vision Transformer-based framework to identify OOD queries, while the second step perturbs the response for such queries, introducing a probabilistic loss function to MisGUIDE the attackers. The aim of the proposed defense method is to reduce the accuracy of the cloned model while maintaining accuracy on authentic queries. Extensive experiments conducted on two benchmark datasets demonstrate that the proposed framework significantly enhances the resistance against state-of-the-art data-free model extraction in black-box settings.</description>

      <title>The Impact of Uniform Inputs on Activation Sparsity and Energy-Latency Attacks in Computer Vision</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.18587</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.18587v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Resource efficiency plays an important role for machine learning nowadays. The energy and decision latency are two critical aspects to ensure a sustainable and practical application. Unfortunately, the energy consumption and decision latency are not robust against adversaries. Researchers have recently demonstrated that attackers can compute and submit so-called sponge examples at inference time to increase the energy consumption and decision latency of neural networks. In computer vision, the proposed strategy crafts inputs with less activation sparsity which could otherwise be used to accelerate the computation. In this paper, we analyze the mechanism how these energy-latency attacks reduce activation sparsity. In particular, we find that input uniformity is a key enabler. A uniform image, that is, an image with mostly flat, uniformly colored surfaces, triggers more activations due to a specific interplay of convolution, batch normalization, and ReLU activation. Based on these insights, we propose two new simple, yet effective strategies for crafting sponge examples: sampling images from a probability distribution and identifying dense, yet inconspicuous inputs in natural datasets. We empirically examine our findings in a comprehensive evaluation with multiple image classification models and show that our attack achieves the same sparsity effect as prior sponge-example methods, but at a fraction of computation effort. We also show that our sponge examples transfer between different neural networks. Finally, we discuss applications of our findings for the good by improving efficiency by increasing sparsity.</description>

      <title>Spikewhisper: Temporal Spike Backdoor Attacks on Federated Neuromorphic Learning over Low-power Devices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.18607</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.18607v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Federated neuromorphic learning (FedNL) leverages event-driven spiking neural networks and federated learning frameworks to effectively execute intelligent analysis tasks over amounts of distributed low-power devices but also perform vulnerability to poisoning attacks. The threat of backdoor attacks on traditional deep neural networks typically comes from time-invariant data. However, in FedNL, unknown threats may be hidden in time-varying spike signals. In this paper, we start to explore a novel vulnerability of FedNL-based systems with the concept of time division multiplexing, termed Spikewhisper, which allows attackers to evade detection as much as possible, as multiple malicious clients can imperceptibly poison with different triggers at different timeslices. In particular, the stealthiness of Spikewhisper is derived from the time-domain divisibility of global triggers, in which each malicious client pastes only one local trigger to a certain timeslice in the neuromorphic sample, and also the polarity and motion of each local trigger can be configured by attackers. Extensive experiments based on two different neuromorphic datasets demonstrate that the attack success rate of Spikewispher is higher than the temporally centralized attacks. Besides, it is validated that the effect of Spikewispher is sensitive to the trigger duration.</description>

      <title>Statistical testing of random number generators and their improvement using randomness extraction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.18716</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.18716v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Random number generators (RNGs) are notoriously hard to build and test, especially in a cryptographic setting. Although one cannot conclusively determine the quality of an RNG by testing the statistical properties of its output alone, running numerical tests is both a powerful verification tool and the only universally applicable method. In this work, we present and make available a comprehensive statistical testing environment (STE) that is based on existing statistical test suites. The STE can be parameterised to run lightweight (i.e. fast) all the way to intensive testing, which goes far beyond what is required by certification bodies. With it, we benchmark the statistical properties of several RNGs, comparing them against each other. We then present and implement a variety of post-processing methods, in the form of randomness extractors, which improve the RNG's output quality under different sets of assumptions and analyse their impact through numerical testing with the STE.</description>

      <title>Bootstrapping Guarantees: Stability and Performance Analysis for Dynamic Encrypted Control</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.18571</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.18571v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Encrypted dynamic controllers that operate for an unlimited time have been a challenging subject of research. The fundamental difficulty is the accumulation of errors and scaling factors in the internal state during operation. Bootstrapping, a technique commonly employed in fully homomorphic cryptosystems, can be used to avoid overflows in the controller state but can potentially introduce significant numerical errors. In this paper, we analyze dynamic encrypted control with explicit consideration of bootstrapping. By recognizing the bootstrapping errors occurring in the controller's state as an uncertainty in the robust control framework, we can provide stability and performance guarantees for the whole encrypted control system. Further, the conservatism of the stability and performance test is reduced by using a lifted version of the control system.</description>

      <title>Testing Resource Isolation for System-on-Chip Architectures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.18720</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.18720v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Ensuring resource isolation at the hardware level is a crucial step towards more security inside the Internet of Things.  Even though there is still no generally accepted technique to generate appropriate tests, it became clear that tests should be generated at the system level.  In this paper, we illustrate the modeling aspects in test generation for resource isolation, namely modeling the behavior and expressing the intended test scenario.  We present both aspects using the industrial standard PSS and an academic approach based on conformance testing.</description>

      <title>RAW: A Robust and Agile Plug-and-Play Watermark Framework for AI-Generated Images with Provable Guarantees</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.18774</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.18774v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Safeguarding intellectual property and preventing potential misuse of AI-generated images are of paramount importance. This paper introduces a robust and agile plug-and-play watermark detection framework, dubbed as RAW. As a departure from traditional encoder-decoder methods, which incorporate fixed binary codes as watermarks within latent representations, our approach introduces learnable watermarks directly into the original image data. Subsequently, we employ a classifier that is jointly trained with the watermark to detect the presence of the watermark. The proposed framework is compatible with various generative architectures and supports on-the-fly watermark injection after training. By incorporating state-of-the-art smoothing techniques, we show that the framework provides provable guarantees regarding the false positive rate for misclassifying a watermarked image, even in the presence of certain adversarial attacks targeting watermark removal. Experiments on a diverse range of images generated by state-of-the-art diffusion models reveal substantial performance enhancements compared to existing approaches. For instance, our method demonstrates a notable increase in AUROC, from 0.48 to 0.82, when compared to state-of-the-art approaches in detecting watermarked images under adversarial attacks, while maintaining image quality, as indicated by closely aligned FID and CLIP scores.</description>

      <title>Nested Dirichlet models for unsupervised attack pattern detection in honeypot data</title>

      <description>arXiv:2301.02505v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Cyber-systems are under near-constant threat from intrusion attempts. Attacks types vary, but each attempt typically has a specific underlying intent, and the perpetrators are typically groups of individuals with similar objectives. Clustering attacks appearing to share a common intent is very valuable to threat-hunting experts. This article explores Dirichlet distribution topic models for clustering terminal session commands collected from honeypots, which are special network hosts designed to entice malicious attackers. The main practical implications of clustering the sessions are two-fold: finding similar groups of attacks, and identifying outliers. A range of statistical models are considered, adapted to the structures of command-line syntax. In particular, concepts of primary and secondary topics, and then session-level and command-level topics, are introduced into the models to improve interpretability. The proposed methods are further extended in a Bayesian nonparametric fashion to allow unboundedness in the vocabulary size and the number of latent intents. The methods are shown to discover an unusual MIRAI variant which attempts to take over existing cryptocurrency coin-mining infrastructure, not detected by traditional topic-modelling approaches.</description>

      <title>Snail: Secure Single Iteration Localization</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.14916v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Localization is a computer vision task by which the position and orientation of a camera is determined from an image and environmental map. We propose a method for performing localization in a privacy preserving manner supporting two scenarios: first, when the image and map are held by a client who wishes to offload localization to untrusted third parties, and second, when the image and map are held separately by untrusting parties. Privacy preserving localization is necessary when the image and map are confidential, and offloading conserves on-device power and frees resources for other tasks. To accomplish this we integrate existing localization methods and secure multi-party computation (MPC), specifically garbled circuits, yielding proof-based security guarantees in contrast to existing obfuscation-based approaches which recent related work has shown vulnerable. We present two approaches to localization, a baseline data-oblivious adaptation of localization suitable for garbled circuits and our novel Single Iteration Localization. Our technique improves overall performance while maintaining confidentiality of the input image, map, and output pose at the expense of increased communication rounds but reduced computation and communication required per round. Single Iteration Localization is over two orders of magnitude faster than a straightforward application of garbled circuits to localization enabling real-world usage in the first robot to offload localization without revealing input images, environmental map, position, or orientation to offload servers.</description>

      <title>Expectations Versus Reality: Evaluating Intrusion Detection Systems in Practice</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.17458v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Our paper provides empirical comparisons between recent IDSs to provide an objective comparison between them to help users choose the most appropriate solution based on their requirements. Our results show that no one solution is the best, but is dependent on external variables such as the types of attacks, complexity, and network environment in the dataset. For example, BoT_IoT and Stratosphere IoT datasets both capture IoT-related attacks, but the deep neural network performed the best when tested using the BoT_IoT dataset while HELAD performed the best when tested using the Stratosphere IoT dataset. So although we found that a deep neural network solution had the highest average F1 scores on tested datasets, it is not always the best-performing one. We further discuss difficulties in using IDS from literature and project repositories, which complicated drawing definitive conclusions regarding IDS selection.</description>

      <title>High Dimensional Distributed Gradient Descent with Arbitrary Number of Byzantine Attackers</title>

Abstract: Robust distributed learning with Byzantine failures has attracted extensive research interests in recent years. However, most of existing methods suffer from curse of dimensionality, which is increasingly serious with the growing complexity of modern machine learning models. In this paper, we design a new method that is suitable for high dimensional problems, under arbitrary number of Byzantine attackers. The core of our design is a direct high dimensional semi-verified mean estimation method. Our idea is to identify a subspace first. The components of mean value perpendicular to this subspace can be estimated via gradient vectors uploaded from worker machines, while the components within this subspace are estimated using auxiliary dataset. We then use our new method as the aggregator of distributed learning problems. Our theoretical analysis shows that the new method has minimax optimal statistical rates. In particular, the dependence on dimensionality is significantly improved compared with previous works.</description>

      <title>Approximate and Weighted Data Reconstruction Attack in Federated Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.06822</link>
      <description>arXiv:2308.06822v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Federated Learning (FL) is a distributed learning paradigm that enables multiple clients to collaborate on building a machine learning model without sharing their private data. Although FL is considered privacy-preserved by design, recent data reconstruction attacks demonstrate that an attacker can recover clients' training data based on the parameters shared in FL. However, most existing methods fail to attack the most widely used horizontal Federated Averaging (FedAvg) scenario, where clients share model parameters after multiple local training steps. To tackle this issue, we propose an interpolation-based approximation method, which makes attacking FedAvg scenarios feasible by generating the intermediate model updates of the clients' local training processes. Then, we design a layer-wise weighted loss function to improve the data quality of reconstruction. We assign different weights to model updates in different layers concerning the neural network structure, with the weights tuned by Bayesian optimization. Finally, experimental results validate the superiority of our proposed approximate and weighted attack (AWA) method over the other state-of-the-art methods, as demonstrated by the substantial improvement in different evaluation metrics for image data reconstructions.</description>

      <title>LCANets++: Robust Audio Classification using Multi-layer Neural Networks with Lateral Competition</title>

      <description>arXiv:2308.12882v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Audio classification aims at recognizing audio signals, including speech commands or sound events. However, current audio classifiers are susceptible to perturbations and adversarial attacks. In addition, real-world audio classification tasks often suffer from limited labeled data. To help bridge these gaps, previous work developed neuro-inspired convolutional neural networks (CNNs) with sparse coding via the Locally Competitive Algorithm (LCA) in the first layer (i.e., LCANets) for computer vision. LCANets learn in a combination of supervised and unsupervised learning, reducing dependency on labeled samples. Motivated by the fact that auditory cortex is also sparse, we extend LCANets to audio recognition tasks and introduce LCANets++, which are CNNs that perform sparse coding in multiple layers via LCA. We demonstrate that LCANets++ are more robust than standard CNNs and LCANets against perturbations, e.g., background noise, as well as black-box and white-box attacks, e.g., evasion and fast gradient sign (FGSM) attacks.</description>

      <title>Byzantine-resilient Federated Learning With Adaptivity to Data Heterogeneity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.13374</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.13374v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper deals with federated learning (FL) in the presence of malicious Byzantine attacks and data heterogeneity. A novel Robust Average Gradient Algorithm (RAGA) is proposed, which leverages the geometric median for aggregation and can freely select the round number for local updating. Different from most existing resilient approaches, which perform convergence analysis based on strongly-convex loss function or homogeneously distributed dataset, we conduct convergence analysis for not only strongly-convex but also non-convex loss function over heterogeneous dataset. According to our theoretical analysis, as long as the fraction of dataset from malicious users is less than half, RAGA can achieve convergence at rate $\mathcal{O}({1}/{T^{2/3- \delta}})$ where $T$ is the iteration number and $\delta \in (0, 2/3)$ for non-convex loss function, and at linear rate for strongly-convex loss function. Moreover, stationary point or global optimal solution is proved to obtainable as data heterogeneity vanishes. Experimental results corroborate the robustness of RAGA to Byzantine attacks and verifies the advantage of RAGA over baselines on convergence performance under various intensity of Byzantine attacks, for heterogeneous dataset.</description>

      <title>Physical 3D Adversarial Attacks against Monocular Depth Estimation in Autonomous Driving</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.17301</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.17301v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Deep learning-based monocular depth estimation (MDE), extensively applied in autonomous driving, is known to be vulnerable to adversarial attacks. Previous physical attacks against MDE models rely on 2D adversarial patches, so they only affect a small, localized region in the MDE map but fail under various viewpoints. To address these limitations, we propose 3D Depth Fool (3D$^2$Fool), the first 3D texture-based adversarial attack against MDE models. 3D$^2$Fool is specifically optimized to generate 3D adversarial textures agnostic to model types of vehicles and to have improved robustness in bad weather conditions, such as rain and fog. Experimental results validate the superior performance of our 3D$^2$Fool across various scenarios, including vehicles, MDE models, weather conditions, and viewpoints. Real-world experiments with printed 3D textures on physical vehicle models further demonstrate that our 3D$^2$Fool can cause an MDE error of over 10 meters.</description>
