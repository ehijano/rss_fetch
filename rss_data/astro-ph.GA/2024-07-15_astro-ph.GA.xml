      <title>A Spectral Atlas of Lyman Alpha Emitters at z = 5.7 and z = 6.6</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.08772</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.08772v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present two uniformly observed spectroscopic samples of Ly-alpha emitters (LAEs) (127 at z = 5.7 and 82 at z = 6.6), which we use to investigate the evolution of the LAE population at these redshifts. The observations cover a large field (44 sq. deg) in the North Ecliptic Pole (HEROES), as well as several smaller fields. We have a small number of exotic LAEs in the samples: double-peaked Ly-alpha profiles; very extended red wings; and one impressive lensed LAE cross. We also find three broad-line AGNs. We compare the Ly-alpha line width measurements at the two redshifts, finding that the lower-luminosity LAEs show a strong evolution of decreasing line width with increasing redshift, while the high-luminosity LAEs do not, with a transition luminosity of log L(Ly-alpha) = 43.25 erg s-1 . Thus, at z = 6.6, the high-luminosity LAEs may be producing large ionized bubbles themselves, or they may be residing in overdense galaxy sites that are producing such bubbles. In order to avoid losses in the red wing, the radius of the ionized bubble must be larger than 1 pMpc. The double-peaked LAEs also require transmission on the blue side. For the four at z = 6.6, we use models to estimate the proximity radii, Ra , where the ionizing flux of the galaxy is sufficient to make the surroundings have a low enough neutral fraction to pass the blue light. Since the required Ra are large, multiple ionizing sources in the vicinity may be needed.</description>

      <title>JADES: Spectroscopic Confirmation and Proper Motion for a T-Dwarf at 2 Kiloparsecs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.08781</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.08781v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large area observations of extragalactic deep fields with the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) have provided a wealth of candidate low-mass L- and T-class brown dwarfs. The existence of these sources, which are at derived distances of hundreds of parsecs to several kiloparsecs from the Sun, has strong implications for the low-mass end of the stellar initial mass function, and the link between stars and planets at low metallicities. In this letter, we present a JWST/NIRSpec PRISM spectrum of brown dwarf JADES-GS-BD-9, confirming its photometric selection from observations taken as part of the JWST Advanced Deep Extragalactic Survey (JADES) program. Fits to this spectrum indicate that the brown dwarf has an effective temperature of 800-900K (T5 - T6) at a distance of $1.8 - 2.3$kpc from the Sun, with evidence of the source being at low metallicity ([M/H] $\leq -0.5$). Finally, because of the cadence of JADES NIRCam observations of this source, we additionally uncover a proper motion between the 2022 and 2023 centroids, and we measure a proper motion of $20 \pm 4$ mas yr$^{-1}$ (a transverse velocity of 214 km s$^{-1}$ at 2.25 kpc). At this predicted metallicity, distance, and transverse velocity, it is likely that this source belongs either to the edge of the Milky Way thick disk or the galactic halo. This spectral confirmation demonstrates the efficacy of photometric selection of these important sources across deep extragalactic JWST imaging.</description>

      <title>The MeerKAT Fornax Survey. III. Ram-pressure stripping of the tidally interacting galaxy NGC 1427A in the Fornax cluster</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.09082</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.09082v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present MeerKAT Fornax Survey HI observations of NGC 1427A, a blue irregular galaxy with a stellar mass of 2e+9 Msun located near the centre of the Fornax galaxy cluster. Thanks to the excellent resolution (1 to 6 kpc spatially, 1.4 km/s in velocity) and HI column density sensitivity (4e+19/cm^2 to 1e+18/cm^2 depending on resolution), our data deliver new insights on the long-debated interaction of this galaxy with the cluster environment. We confirm the presence of a broad, one-sided, starless HI tail stretching from the outer regions of the stellar body and pointing away from the cluster centre. We find the tail to have 50% more HI (4e+8 Msun) and to be 3 times longer (70 kpc) than in previous observations. In fact, we detect scattered HI clouds out to 300 kpc from the galaxy in the direction of the tail -- possibly the most ancient remnant of the passage of NGC 1427A through the intracluster medium of Fornax. Both the velocity gradient along the HI tail and the peculiar kinematics of HI in the outer region of the stellar body are consistent with the effect of ram pressure given the line-of-sight motion of the galaxy within the cluster. However, several properties cannot be explained solely by ram pressure and suggest an ongoing tidal interaction. This includes: the close match between dense HI and stars within the disturbed stellar body; the abundant kinematically-anomalous HI; and the inversion of the HI velocity gradient near the base of the HI tail. We rule out an interaction with the cluster tidal field, and conclude that NGC 1427A is the result of a high-speed galaxy encounter or of a merger started at least 300 Myr ago, where ram pressure shapes the distribution and kinematics of the HI in the perturbed outer stellar body and in the tidal tails.</description>

      <title>Detailed Mapping of the Galactic Disk Structure in the Solar Neighborhood through LAMOST K Dwarfs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.09312</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.09312v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Galactic disk is one of the main components of the Milky Way, which contributes most of the luminosity. Its structure is essential for understanding the formation and evolution of the Milky Way. Using 174,443 K-type dwarf stars observed by both LAMOST and Gaia DR3, we study the disk density profile in the local volume within 1,200 pc. In the azimuthal dimension, we find strong asymmetric signal of the thin disk. The surface density and the scale height of the southern disk significantly change versus the azimuthal angle at the same galactocentric distance $R$. Meanwhile, in the vertical dimension, the scale height of the northern disk has quite different trend than that of the southern one. The scale height of the southern disk shows a decreasing trend with $\phi\sim-2.5^\circ$, and change to an increasing one with $\phi\sim5.0^\deg$. Meanwhile, the scale height of the northern disk has a consistently smaller increase. Finally, we divide the entire sample into three subsamples based on metallicity and all three subsamples show significant non-axisymmetric and north-south asymmetric signals in the Galactic disk. Furthermore, we find that the scale height of the metal-poor ([Fe/H] $&lt;$ -0.4 dex) subsample in the northern disk is greater than that of the metal-rich ([Fe/H] $&gt;$ -0.1 dex) subsample. However, in the southern disk, the scale height exhibits varying relationships across different metallicity slices.</description>

      <title>Thermodynamics of Giant Molecular Clouds: The Effects of Dust Grain Size</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.09343</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.09343v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The dust grain size distribution (GSD) likely varies significantly across different star-forming environments in the Universe, but the overall impact of this variation on star formation remains unclear. This ambiguity arises because the GSD interacts non-linearly with processes like heating/cooling, radiation, and chemistry, which have competing effects and different environmental dependencies. In this study, we investigate the effects of GSD variation on the thermochemistry and evolution of giant molecular clouds (GMCs). To achieve this, we conducted radiation-dust-magnetohydrodynamic simulations spanning a range of cloud masses and grain sizes, which explicitly incorporate the dynamics of dust grains within the full-physics framework of the STARFORGE project. We find that differences in grain size significantly alter the thermochemistry of GMCs. Specifically, we show that the leading-order effect is that larger grains, under fixed dust mass and dust-to-gas ratio conditions, result in lower dust opacities. This reduced opacity permits ISRF photons to penetrate more deeply and allows internal radiation field photons to permeate more extensively into the cloud, resulting in rapid gas heating and the inhibition of star formation. We find that star formation efficiency is highly sensitive to grain size, with an order of magnitude reduction in efficiency when grain size increases from 0.1 $\rm\mu m$ to 10 $\rm\mu m$. Additionally, we note that warmer gas suppresses the formation of low-mass stars. Moreover, as a consequence of the decreased opacities, we observe a greater proportion of gas residing in diffuse ionized structures.</description>

      <title>Rich and diverse molecular gas environments of closely-separated dual quasars viewed by ALMA</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.09399</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.09399v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a study of the molecular gas in five closely-spaced ($R_{\perp}&lt;20$ kpc) dual quasars ($L_{\rm bol}\gtrsim10^{44}~\mathrm{erg~s}^{-1}$) at redshifts $0.4&lt;z&lt;0.8$ with the Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array. The dual quasar phase represents a distinctive stage during the interaction between two galaxies for investigating quasar fueling and feedback effects on the gas reservoir. The dual quasars were selected from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey and Subaru/Hyper Suprime-Cam Subaru Strategic Program, with confirmatory spectroscopic validation. Based on the detection of the CO J=2--1 emission line with Band 4, we derived key properties including CO luminosities, line widths, and molecular gas masses for these systems. Among the ten quasars of the five pairs, eight have line detections exceeding $5\sigma$. The detected sources prominently harbor substantial molecular gas reservoirs, with molecular gas masses ($M_{\text{molgas}}$) between $10^{9.6-10.5}~\mathrm{M_{\odot}}$, and molecular gas-to-stellar mass ratios ($\mu_{\text{molgas}}$) spanning $18-97\%$. The overall $\mu_{\text{molgas}}$ of these dual quasars agrees with that of inactive star-forming main-sequence galaxies at comparable redshifts, indicating no clear evidence of quenching. However, intriguing features in each individual system show possible evidence of AGN feedback, matter transfer, and compaction processes.</description>

      <title>Exploring Galactic open clusters with Gaia I. An examination in the first kiloparsec</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.09407</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.09407v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Context. Since the first publication of the Gaia catalogue a new view of our Galaxy has arrived. Its astrometric and photometric information has improved the precision of the physical parameters of open star clusters obtained from them. Aims. Using the Gaia DR3 catalogue, we aim to find physical stellar members including faint stars for 370 Galactic open clusters located within 1 kpc. We also estimate the age, metallicity, distance modulus and extinction of these clusters. Methods. We employ the HDBSCAN algorithm on both astrometric and photometric data to identify members in the open clusters. Subsequently, we refine the samples by eliminating outliers through the application of the Mahalanobis metric utilizing the chi-square distribution at a confidence level of 95%. Furthermore, we characterize the stellar parameters with the PARSEC isochrones. Results. We obtain reliable star members for 370 open clusters with an average parallax error of 0.16 mas. We identify about 40% more stars in these clusters compared to previous work using the Gaia DR2 catalogue, including faint stars as new members with G &gt; 17. Before the clustering application we correct the parallax zero-point bias to avoid spatial distribution stretching that may affect clustering results. Our membership lists include merging stars identified by HDBSCAN with astrometry and photometry. We note that the use of photometry in clustering can recover up to 10% more stars in the fainter limit than clustering based on astrometry only, this combined with the selection of stars filtering them out by quality cuts significantly reduces the number of stars with huge parallax error. After clustering, we estimate age, Z, and AV from the photometry of the membership lists.</description>

      <title>Galaxy Mergers in the Epoch of Reionization I: A JWST Study of Pair Fractions, Merger Rates, and Stellar Mass Accretion Rates at $z = 4.5-11.5$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.09472</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.09472v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a full analysis of galaxy major merger pair fractions, merger rates, and mass accretion rates, thus uncovering the role of mergers in galaxy formation at the earliest previously unexplored epoch of $4.5&lt;z&lt;11.5$. We target galaxies with masses $\log_{10}(\mathrm{M}_*/\mathrm{M}_\odot) = 8.0 - 10.0$, utilizing data from eight JWST Cycle-1 fields (CEERS, JADES GOODS-S, NEP-TDF, NGDEEP, GLASS, El-Gordo, SMACS-0723, MACS-0416), covering an unmasked area of 189.36 $\mathrm{arcmin}^2$. We develop a new probabilistic pair-counting methodology that integrates full photometric redshift posteriors and corrects for detection incompleteness to quantify close pairs with physical projected separations between 20 and 50 kpc. Our analysis reveals an increase in pair fractions up to $z = 8$, reaching $0.211 \pm 0.065$, followed by a statistically flat evolution to $z = 11.5$. We find that the galaxy merger rate increases from the local Universe up to $z = 6$ and then stabilizes at a value of $\sim 6$ Gyr$^{-1}$ up to $z = 11.5$. We fit both a power-law and a power-law + exponential model to our pair fraction and merger rate redshift evolution, finding that the latter model describes the trends more accurately, particularly at $z = 8.0 - 11.5$. In addition, we measure that the average galaxy increases its stellar mass due to mergers by a factor of $2.77 \pm 0.99$ from redshift $z = 10.5$ to $z = 5.0$. Lastly, we investigate the impact of mergers on galaxy stellar mass growth, revealing that mergers contribute $71 \pm 25\%$ as much to galaxy stellar mass increases as star formation from gas. This indicates that mergers drive about half of galaxy assembly at high redshift.</description>

      <title>Dark matter limits from the tip of the red giant branch of globular clusters</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.08773</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.08773v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Capture and annihilation of WIMP-like dark matter in red giant stars can lead to faster-than-expected ignition of the helium core, and thus a lower tip of the red giant branch (TRGB) luminosity. We use Gaia data to place constraints on the dark matter-nucleon cross section using 22 globular clusters with measured TRGB luminosities, and place projections on the sensitivity resulting from 161 clusters with full phase space distributions observed by Gaia. Although limits remain weaker than those from Earth-based direct detection experiments, they represent a constraint that is fully independent of dark matter properties in the Solar neighbourhood, probing its properties across the entire Milky Way galaxy. Based on our findings, it is likely that the use of the TRGB as a standard candle in $H_0$ measurements is very robust against the effects of dark matter.</description>

      <title>Testing screened modified gravity with SDSS-IV-MaNGA</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.08825</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.08825v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Fifth forces are ubiquitous in modified gravity theories, and must be screened to evade stringent local tests. This can introduce unusual behaviour in galaxy phenomenology by affecting galaxies' components differently. Here we use the SDSS-IV-MaNGA dataset to search for a systematic excess of gas circular velocity over stellar circular velocity, expected in thin-shell-screened theories in the partially screened regime. Accounting for asymmetric drift and calibrating our model on screened subsamples, we find no significant evidence for a screened fifth force. We bound the fifth-force strength to $\Delta G/G_\text{N} &lt; 0.1$ for all astrophysical ranges, strengthening to $\sim$0.01 at Compton wavelength of 3 Mpc for the Hu-Sawicki model, for instance. This implies a stringent constraint on scalar-tensor theories, for example $f_{\mathcal{R}0} \lesssim 10^{-8}$ in Hu-Sawicki $f(\mathcal{R})$ gravity.</description>

      <title>Observational bounds on a possible electron-to-proton mass ratio variation and constraints in the lepton-specific 2HDM</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.08921</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.08921v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this work, we test a possible redshift variation of the electron-to-proton mass ratio, $\mu = m_e/m_p$, directly from galaxy cluster gas mass fraction measurements and type Ia Supernovae observations. Our analysis is completely independent of any cosmological model. Our result reveals no variation of $\mu$ within 1 $\sigma$ confidence level. From the point of view of Particle Physics, we can use the precision on these results to constrain the parameter space of models beyond the Standard Model of electroweak interactions. We exemplify this by focusing in a specific Two Higgs Doublet model (2HDM), where the second scalar doublet couples exclusively to leptons. An important parameter in the model concerns the ratio between its vacuum expectation values, defined by $\tan\beta$. In our approach we can constrain the inverse parameter (cot$\beta$) to an optimal value, (tan$\beta)^{-1}=$ 0.02127 $\pm$ 0.0029, with the largest vacuum expectation value for 2HDM, $v_2$, estimated at around 240.033 $\pm$ 0.21~GeV. Also, by taking into account the $(g-2)_\mu$ discrepancy found between theory and experiment, we can reduce the validity region for this model and establish bounds on the scalar masses, in the light of our findings from galaxy clusters data for $\mu$. This study contributes valuable insights to the understanding of Particle Physics and Astrophysics interface, establishing a new interplay between data from large scale structure of the Universe and subatomic Physics.</description>

      <title>Clues on the nature of the quasi-periodic optical outbursts of the blazar OJ 287</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.09273</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.09273v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The fascination with the blazar OJ 287 stems not only from its status as a prominent candidate for a close supermassive black hole (SMBH) binary, but also because of the thermal bremsstrahlung origin proposed for its giant optical outbursts. These outbursts arrive as pairs, quasi-periodically every $\sim 12$ years, based on the unique 130-year-long, well-sampled optical light curve available for this blazar. For its three well-known, large quasi-periodic optical outbursts (QPOOs), observed in 1983, 2007 and 2015, optical photo-polarimetric monitoring has been reported in the literature. For these initially radio-undetected QPOOs, widely acclaimed as `bremsstrahlung flares', we have scrutinised the available measurements of optical polarisation and spectral index during the rising phase. Several inconsistencies of these data with the optical bremsstrahlung interpretation are noted, which point towards a synchrotron-dominated alternative interpretation for all these prominent QPOOs, just as for the optical emission observed between the outbursts. Possible reasons for the radio non-detection of the QPOOs during the initial stage are outlined.</description>

      <title>Investigating Optical Variability of the Blazar S5 0716+714 On Diverse Time-scales</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.09419</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.09419v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present the results of the observational study of the blazar S5 0716+716 in the optical bands B, V, R, and I between March 2019 and August 2023 to investigate its variability on diverse time-scales. The blazar was followed up by the T60 robotic telescope in Turkey for 416 nights to obtain long-term variability during this period. In order to search for intraday variability of the object, we have carried out 21 nights of observations with the T100 telescope for at least 1 hour. The blazar showed a ~2.47 mag variation in the optical R-band during our monitoring period, the brightest state on 18.01.2020 (MJD 58866) as R=12.109$\pm$0.011 and the faintest state on 23.03.2019 (MJD 58565) as R=14.580$\pm$0.013. We employed the nested ANOVA test and the power enhanced F-test to quantify intraday variability which showed that the blazar was significantly variable in the R-band on 12 out of 21 nights. Correlation analysis of the light curves shows that the emission in the BVRI optical bands was strongly correlated both in the short and long term without any time lag. The blazar has likely quasi-periods of 186$\pm$30, 532$\pm$76 days in the optical R-band light curve according to the WWZ, and the LS periodogram. The IDV and LTV features are discussed within the frame of prospective scenarios.</description>

      <title>Flow-Based Generative Emulation of Grids of Stellar Evolutionary Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.09427</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.09427v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a flow-based generative approach to emulate grids of stellar evolutionary models. By interpreting the input parameters and output properties of these models as multi-dimensional probability distributions, we train conditional normalizing flows to learn and predict the complex relationships between grid inputs and outputs in the form of conditional joint distributions. Leveraging the expressive power and versatility of these flows, we showcase their ability to emulate a variety of evolutionary tracks and isochrones across a continuous range of input parameters. In addition, we describe a simple Bayesian approach for estimating stellar parameters using these flows and demonstrate its application to asteroseismic datasets of red giants observed by the Kepler mission. By applying this approach to red giants in open clusters NGC 6791 and NGC 6819, we illustrate how large age uncertainties can arise when fitting only to global asteroseismic and spectroscopic parameters without prior information on initial helium abundances and mixing length parameter values. We also conduct inference using the flow at a large scale by determining revised estimates of masses and radii for 15,388 field red giants. These estimates show improved agreement with results from existing grid-based modelling, reveal distinct population-level features in the red clump, and suggest that the masses of Kepler red giants previously determined using the corrected asteroseismic scaling relations have been overestimated by 5-10%.</description>

      <title>Intensive broadband reverberation mapping of Fairall 9 with 1.8 years of daily Swift monitoring</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.09445</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.09445v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present 1.8 years of near-daily Swift monitoring of the bright, strongly variable Type 1 AGN Fairall 9. Totaling 575 successful visits, this is the largest such campaign reported to date. Variations within the UV/optical are well-correlated, with longer wavelengths lagging shorter wavelengths in the direction predicted by thin disk/lamp-post models. The correlations are improved by detrending; subtracting a second-order polynomial fit to the UV/optical light curves to remove long-term trends that are not of interest to this study. Extensive testing indicates detrending with higher-order polynomials removes too much intrinsic variability signal on reverberation timescales. These data provide the clearest detection to date of interband lags within the UV, indicating that neither emission from a large disk nor diffuse continuum emission from the broad-line region can independently explain the full observed lag spectrum. The observed X-ray flux variations are poorly correlated with those in the UV/optical. Further, subdivision of the data into four ~160 day light curves shows that the UV/optical lag spectrum is highly stable throughout the four periods, but the X-ray to UV lags are unstable, significantly changing magnitude and even direction from one period to the next. This indicates the X-ray to UV relationship is more complex than predicted by the simple reprocessing model often adopted for AGN. A bowl model (lamp-post irradiation and blackbody reprocessing on a disk with a steep rim) fit suggests the disk thickens at a distance (~10 lt-day) and temperature (~8000K) consistent with the inner edge of the BLR.</description>

      <title>How coronal mass ejections are influenced by the morphology and toroidal flux of their source magnetic flux ropes?</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.09457v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Coronal mass ejections (CMEs) stand as intense eruptions of magnetized plasma from the Sun, playing a pivotal role in driving significant changes of the heliospheric environment. Deducing the properties of CMEs from their progenitors in solar source regions is crucial for space weather forecasting. Deducing the properties of CMEs from their progenitors in solar source regions is crucial for space weather forecasting. The primary objective of this paper is to establish a connection between CMEs and their progenitors in solar source regions, enabling us to infer the magnetic structures of CMEs before their full development. To this end, we create a dataset comprising a magnetic flux rope series with varying projection shapes, sizes and toroidal fluxes, using the Regularized Biot-Savart Laws (RBSL). Thereafter, we simulate the propagation of these flux ropes from the solar surface to a distance of 25$R_{\odot}$ with our global coronal MHD model which is named COCONUT. Our parametric survey reveals significant impacts of source flux ropes on the consequent CMEs. We find that the projection shape can influence the magnetic structures of CMEs at 20$R_{\odot}$, albeit with minimal impacts on the propagation speed. However, these impacts diminish as source flux ropes become fat. In terms of toroidal flux, our simulation results demonstrate a pronounced correlation with the propagation speed of CMEs, as well as the successfulness in erupting. This work builds the bridge between the CMEs in the outer corona and their progenitors in solar source regions. Our parametric survey suggests that the projection shape, cross-section radius and toroidal flux of source flux ropes are crucial parameters in predicting magnetic structures and propagation speed of CMEs, providing valuable insights for space weather prediction.</description>

      <title>A lack of LAEs within 5Mpc of a luminous quasar in an overdensity at z=6.9: potential evidence of quasar negative feedback at protocluster scales</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.06870</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.06870v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: High-redshift quasars are thought to live in the densest regions of space which should be made evident by an overdensity of galaxies around them. However, campaigns to identify these overdensities through the search of Lyman Break Galaxies (LBGs) and Lyman $\alpha$ emitters (LAEs) have had mixed results. These may be explained by either the small field of view of some of the experiments, the broad redshift ranges targeted by LBG searches, and by the inherent large uncertainty of quasar redshifts estimated from UV emission lines, which makes it difficult to place the Ly-$\alpha$ emission line within a narrowband filter. Here we present a three square degree search ($\sim 1000$ pMpc) for LAEs around the $z=6.9$ quasar VIKJ2348-3054 using the Dark Energy CAMera (DECam), housed on the 4m Blanco telescope, finding 38 LAEs. The systemic redshift of VIK J2348--3054 is known from ALMA [CII] observations and place the Ly-$\alpha$ emission line of companions within the NB964 narrowband of DECam. This is the largest field of view LAE search around a $z&gt;6$ quasar conducted to date. We find that this field is $\sim$ 10 times more overdense when compared to the Chandra Deep-Field South, observed previously with the same instrumental setup as well as several combined blank fields. This is strong evidence that VIKJ2348-3054 resides in an overdensity of LAEs over several Mpc. Surprisingly, we find a lack of LAEs within 5 physical Mpc of the quasar and take this to most likely be evidence of the quasar suppressing star formation in its immediate vicinity. This result highlights the importance of performing overdensity searches over large areas to properly assess the density of those regions of the Universe.</description>

      <title>Violent starbursts and quiescence induced by FUV radiation feedback in metal-poor galaxies at high-redshift</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.04824</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.04824v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: JWST observations of galaxies at $z\gtrsim 8$ suggest that they are more luminous and clumpier than predicted by most models, prompting several proposals on the physics of star formation and feedback in the first galaxies. In this paper, we focus on the role of ultraviolet (UV) radiation in regulating star formation by performing a set of cosmological radiation hydrodynamics simulations of one galaxy at sub-pc resolution with different radiative feedback models. We find that the suppression of cooling by far UV (FUV) radiation (i.e., $\mathrm{H_2}$ dissociating radiation) from Pop II stars is the main physical process triggering the formation of compact and massive star clusters and is responsible for the bursty star formation observed in metal-poor galaxies at $z\gtrsim 10$. Indeed, artificially suppressing FUV radiation leads to a less intense continuous mode of star formation distributed into numerous, but low-mass open star clusters. Due to the intense FUV field, low-metallicity clouds remain warm ($\sim 10^4\,\mathrm{K}$) until they reach a relatively high density ($\gtrsim 10^3\,\mathrm{cm^{-3}}$), before becoming self-shielded and transitioning to a colder ($\sim 100\,\mathrm{K}$), partially molecular phase. As a result, star formation is delayed until the clouds accumulate enough mass to become gravitationally unstable. At this point, the clouds undergo rapid star formation converting gas into stars with high efficiency. We, therefore, observe exceptionally bright galaxies (ten times brighter than for continuous star formation) and subsequent quenched "dead" galaxies that did not form stars for tens of Myrs.</description>

      <title>Fast-moving stars around an intermediate-mass black hole in Omega Centauri</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.06015v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Black holes have been found over a wide range of masses, from stellar remnants with masses of 5-150 solar masses (Msun), to those found at the centers of galaxies with $M&gt;10^5$ Msun. However, only a few debated candidate black holes exist between 150 and $10^5$ Msun. Determining the population of these intermediate-mass black holes is an important step towards understanding supermassive black hole formation in the early universe. Several studies have claimed the detection of a central black hole in $\omega$ Centauri, the Milky Way's most massive globular cluster. However, these studies have been questioned due to the possible mass contribution of stellar mass black holes, their sensitivity to the cluster center, and the lack of fast-moving stars above the escape velocity. Here we report observations of seven fast-moving stars in the central 3 arcseconds (0.08 pc) of $\omega$ Centauri. The velocities of the fast-moving stars are significantly higher than the expected central escape velocity of the star cluster, so their presence can only be explained by being bound to a massive black hole. From the velocities alone, we can infer a firm lower limit of the black hole mass of $\sim$8,200 Msun, making this a compelling candidate for an intermediate-mass black hole in the local universe.</description>

      <title>Filling in the Blanks: A Method to Infer the Substructure Membership and Dynamics of 5D Stars</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.10168v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present and test a method to infer a probability density function (PDF) for the missing vlos of a star with 5D information within $2.5$ kpc. We use stars from the Gaia DR3 RVS catalogue to describe the local orbital structure in action space. This technique also allows us to infer the probability that a 5D star is associated with the Milky Way's stellar Disc or the stellar Halo, which can be further decomposed into known stellar substructures. The method is tested on a 6D Gaia DR3 RVS sample and a 6D Gaia sample crossmatched to groundbased spectroscopic surveys, stripped of their true vlos. The stars predicted vlos, membership probabilities, and inferred structure properties are then compared to the true 6D equivalents, allowing the method's accuracy and limitations to be studied in detail. Our predicted vlos PDFs are statistically consistent with the true vlos, with accurate uncertainties. We find that the vlos of Disc stars can be well constrained, with a median uncertainty of 26 kms. Halo stars are typically less well constrained with a median uncertainty of 72 kms, but those found likely to belong to Halo substructures can be better constrained. The dynamical properties of the total sample and subgroups, such as distributions of integrals of motion and velocities, are also accurately recovered. The group membership probabilities are statistically consistent with our initial labelling, allowing high quality sets to be selected from 5D samples by choosing a trade off between higher expected purity and decreasing expected completeness.</description>

      <title>The Pristine survey XXIV: The Galactic underdogs -- Dynamic tales of a Milky Way metal-poor population</title>

Abstract: Through the chemodynamical characterisation of metal-poor stars, one can efficiently probe the early history of the Milky Way. We aim at decontaminating a sample of $\sim$ 3M giant stars with Gaia DR3 XP-based \textit{Pristine-Gaia} metallicities, to investigate a subset of very metal-poor stars ([Fe/H] &lt; -1.7) with disc-like orbits. We construct a statistically robust sample of $\sim$ 36 000 very metal-poor giants, using APOGEE and LAMOST to estimate and remove contamination from high $V_\phi$ stars. We investigate the spatial and kinematic properties of the decontaminated sample, using $V_\phi$ and the action space, both powerful to disentangle stellar populations. As in previous works, we find a pronounced asymmetry in $L_z$ and $V_\phi$ in favour of prograde stars. This excess is mostly made of prograde-planar stars (10% of the very metal-poor population), and contains stars with $V_\phi$ &gt; 180 km s$^{-1}$ and $Z_{\text{max}}$ &lt; 1.5 kpc, down to [Fe/H] = -2.9 at a 2$\sigma$ confidence level. While the overall orbital distributions of our sample match that of a halo, the highly prograde and planar subset (2% of the very metal-poor population) also bears characteristics classically associated with a thick disc, i.e., a spatial distribution compatible with a short-scaled thick disc, and a thick disc-like $Z_{\text{max}}$ - $R_{\text{max}}$ distribution. Additionally, assuming a stationary or prograde halo with $\overline{V_\phi}$ $\sim$ 30-40 km.s$^{-1}$ is not sufficient to suppress the kinematic signature of the highly prograde and planar subset. These results rule out any link with a thin disc, and instead, support a contribution from a \textit{metal-weak thick disc}.</description>

      <title>Rayleigh and Raman scattering cross-sections and phase matrices of the ground-state hydrogen atom, and their astrophysical implications</title>

      <description>arXiv:2308.04959v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present explicit expressions for Rayleigh and Raman scattering cross-sections and phase matrices of the ground $1s$ state hydrogen atom based on the Kramers-Heisenberg dispersion formula. The Rayleigh scattering leaves the hydrogen atom in the ground-state while the Raman scattering leaves the hydrogen atom in either $ns$ ($n\geq2$; $s$-branch) or $nd$ ($n\geq3$; $d$-branch) excited state, and the Raman scattering converts incident ultraviolet (UV) photons around the Lyman resonance lines into optical-infrared (IR) photons. We show that this Raman wavelength conversion of incident flat UV continuum in dense hydrogen gas with a column density of $N_{\text{H}} &gt; 10^{21}~\text{cm}^{-2}$ can produce broad emission features centred at Balmer, Paschen, and higher-level lines, which would mimic Doppler-broadened hydrogen lines with the velocity width of $\gtrsim 1,000~\text{km}~\text{s}^{-1}$ that could be misinterpreted as signatures of Active Galactic Nuclei, supernovae, or fast stellar winds. We show that the phase matrix of the Rayleigh and Raman $s$-branch scatterings is identical to that of the Thomson scattering while the Raman $d$-branch scattering is more isotropic, thus the Paschen and higher-level Raman features are depolarized compared to the Balmer features due to the flux contribution from the Raman $d$-branch. We argue that observations of the line widths, line flux ratios, and linear polarization of multiple optical/IR hydrogen lines are crucial to discriminate between the Raman-scattered broad emission features and Doppler-broadened emission lines.</description>

      <title>Robustness of direct measurements of the mean free path of ionizing photons in the epoch of reionization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.06344</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.06344v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Measurements of the mean free path of Lyman-continuum photons in the intergalactic medium during the epoch of reionization can help constrain the nature of the sources as well as sinks of hydrogen-ionizing radiation. A recent approach to this measurement has been to utilize composite spectra of multiple quasars at $z\sim 6$, and infer the mean free path after correcting the spectra for the presence of quasar proximity zones. This has revealed not only a steep drop in the mean free path from $z=5$ to $z=6$, but also potentially a mild tension with reionization simulations. We critically examine such direct measurements of the mean free path for biases due to quasar environment, incomplete reionization, and quasar proximity zones. Using cosmological radiative transfer simulations of reionization combined with one-dimensional radiative transfer calculations of quasar proximity zones, we find that the bias in the mean free path due to overdensities around quasars is minimal at $z\sim 6$. Patchiness of reionization at this redshift also does not affect the measurements significantly. Fitting our model to the data results in a mean free path of $\lambda_{\mathrm{mfp}}=1.49^{+0.47}_{-0.52}$~pMpc at $z=6$, which is consistent with the recent measurements in the literature, indicating robustness with respect to the modelling of quasar proximity zones. We also compare various ways in which the mean free path has been defined in simulations before the end of reionization. Overall, our finding is that recent measurements of the mean free path appear to be robust relative to several sources of potential bias.</description>

      <title>A population of neutron star candidates in wide orbits from Gaia astrometry</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.00089v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We report discovery and spectroscopic follow-up of 21 astrometric binaries containing solar-type stars and dark companions with masses near 1.4 $M_{\odot}$. The simplest interpretation is that the companions are dormant neutron stars (NSs), though ultramassive white dwarfs (WDs) and tight WD+WD binaries cannot be fully excluded. We selected targets from Gaia DR3 astrometric binary solutions in which the luminous star is on the main sequence and the dynamically-implied mass of the unseen companion is (a) more than $1.25\,M_{\odot}$ and (b) too high to be any non-degenerate star or close binary. We obtained multi-epoch radial velocities (RVs) over a period of 700 days, spanning a majority of the orbits' dynamic range in RV. The RVs broadly validate the astrometric solutions and significantly tighten constraints on companion masses. Several systems have companion masses that are unambiguously above the Chandrasekhar limit, while the rest have masses between 1.25 and 1.4 $M_{\odot}$. The orbits are significantly more eccentric at fixed period than those of typical WD + MS binaries, perhaps due to natal kicks. Metal-poor stars are overrepresented in the sample: 3 out of 21 objects (14%) have [Fe/H]$\sim-1.5$ and are on halo orbits, compared to $\sim$0.5% of the parent Gaia binary sample. The metal-poor stars are all strongly enhanced in lithium. The formation history of these objects is puzzling: it is unclear both how the binaries escaped a merger or dramatic orbital shrinkage when the NS progenitors were red supergiants, and how they remained bound when the NSs formed. Gaia has now discovered 3 black holes (BHs) in astrometric binaries with masses above 9 $M_{\odot}$, and 21 NSs with masses near $1.4\,M_{\odot}$. The lack of intermediate-mass objects in this sample is striking, supporting the existence of a BH/NS mass bimodality over 4 orders of magnitude in orbital period.</description>

      <title>M3DIS -- A grid of 3D radiation-hydrodynamics stellar atmosphere models for stellar surveys</title>

Abstract: Large-scale stellar surveys, such as SDSS-V, 4MOST, WEAVE, and PLATO, require accurate atmospheric models and synthetic spectra of stars for accurate analyses of fundamental stellar parameters and chemical abundances. The primary goal of our work is to develop a new approach to solve radiation-hydrodynamics (RHD) and generate model stellar spectra in a self-consistent and highly efficient framework. We build upon the Copenhagen legacy RHD code, the MULTI3D non-local thermodynamic equilibrium (NLTE) code, and the DISPATCH high-performance framework. The new approach allows us to calculate 3D RHD models of stellar atmospheres on timescales of a few thousand CPU hours and to perform subsequent spectrum synthesis in local thermodynamic equilibrium (LTE) or NLTE for the desired physical conditions within the parameter space of FGK-type stars. We compare the 3D RHD solar model with other available models and validate its performance against solar observations, including the centre-to-limb variation of intensities and key solar diagnostic lines of H and Fe. We show that the performance of the new code allows to overcome the main bottleneck in 3D NLTE spectroscopy and enables calculations of multi-dimensional grids of synthetic stellar observables for comparison with modern astronomical observations.</description>

      <title>Masses of Sunyaev-Zel'dovich Galaxy Clusters Detected by The Atacama Cosmology Telescope: Stacked Lensing Measurements with Subaru HSC Year 3 data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.08201</link>

Abstract: We present a stacked lensing analysis of 96 galaxy clusters selected by the thermal Sunyaev-Zel'dovich (SZ) effect in maps of the cosmic microwave background (CMB). We select foreground galaxy clusters with a $5\sigma$-level SZ threshold in CMB observations from the Atacama Cosmology Telescope, while we define background source galaxies for the lensing analysis with secure photometric redshift cuts in Year 3 data of the Subaru Hyper Suprime Cam survey. We detect the stacked lensing signal in the range of $0.1 &lt; R\, [h^{-1}\mathrm{Mpc}] &lt; 100$ in each of three cluster redshift bins, $0.092&lt;z\le0.445$, $0.445&lt;z\le0.695$, and $0.695&lt;z\le1.180$, with 32 galaxy clusters in each bin. The cumulative signal-to-noise ratios of the lensing signal are $14.6$, $12.0$, and $6.6$, respectively. Using a halo-based forward model, we then constrain statistical relationships between the mass inferred from the SZ observation (i.e. SZ mass) and the total mass derived from our stacked lensing measurements. At the average SZ mass in the cluster sample ($2.1-2.4\times10^{14}\, h^{-1}M_\odot$), our likelihood analysis shows that the average total mass differs from the SZ counterpart by a factor of $1.3 \pm 0.2$, $1.6 \pm 0.2$, and $1.6 \pm 0.3$ ($68\%$) in the aforementioned redshift ranges, respectively. Our limits are consistent with previous lensing measurements, and we find that the cluster modeling choices can introduce a $1\sigma$-level difference in our parameter inferences.</description>
