      <title>OmniGenBench: A Modular Platform for Reproducible Genomic Foundation Models Benchmarking</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.14402</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.14402v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The code of nature, embedded in DNA and RNA genomes since the origin of life, holds immense potential to impact both humans and ecosystems through genome modeling. Genomic Foundation Models (GFMs) have emerged as a transformative approach to decoding the genome. As GFMs scale up and reshape the landscape of AI-driven genomics, the field faces an urgent need for rigorous and reproducible evaluation. We present OmniGenBench, a modular benchmarking platform designed to unify the data, model, benchmarking, and interpretability layers across GFMs. OmniGenBench enables standardized, one-command evaluation of any GFM across five benchmark suites, with seamless integration of over 31 open-source models. Through automated pipelines and community-extensible features, the platform addresses critical reproducibility challenges, including data transparency, model interoperability, benchmark fragmentation, and black-box interpretability. OmniGenBench aims to serve as foundational infrastructure for reproducible genomic AI research, accelerating trustworthy discovery and collaborative innovation in the era of genome-scale modeling.</description>

      <title>Ancestry-Adjusted Polygenic Risk Scores for Predicting Obesity Risk in the Indonesian Population</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.13503</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.13503v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Obesity prevalence in Indonesian adults increased from 10.5% in 2007 to 23.4% in 2023. Studies showed that genetic predisposition significantly influences obesity susceptibility. To aid this, polygenic risk scores (PRS) help aggregate the effects of numerous genetic variants to assess genetic risk. However, 91% of genome-wide association studies (GWAS) involve European populations, limiting their applicability to Indonesians due to genetic diversity. This study aims to develop and validate an ancestry adjusted PRS for obesity in the Indonesian population using principal component analysis (PCA) method constructed from the 1000 Genomes Project data and our own genomic data from approximately 2,800 Indonesians. We calculate PRS for obesity using all races, then determine the first four principal components using ancestry-informative SNPs and develop a linear regression model to predict PRS based on these principal components. The raw PRS is adjusted by subtracting the predicted score to obtain an ancestry adjusted PRS for the Indonesian population. Our results indicate that the ancestry-adjusted PRS improves obesity risk prediction. Compared to the unadjusted PRS, the adjusted score improved classification performance with a 5% increase in area under the ROC curve (AUC). This approach underscores the importance of population-specific adjustments in genetic risk assessments to enable more effective personalized healthcare and targeted intervention strategies for diverse populations.</description>

      <title>ChromFound: Towards A Universal Foundation Model for Single-Cell Chromatin Accessibility Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.12638</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.12638v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The advent of single-cell Assay for Transposase-Accessible Chromatin using sequencing (scATAC-seq) offers an innovative perspective for deciphering regulatory mechanisms by assembling a vast repository of single-cell chromatin accessibility data. While foundation models have achieved significant success in single-cell transcriptomics, there is currently no foundation model for scATAC-seq that supports zero-shot high-quality cell identification and comprehensive multi-omics analysis simultaneously. Key challenges lie in the high dimensionality and sparsity of scATAC-seq data, as well as the lack of a standardized schema for representing open chromatin regions (OCRs). Here, we present ChromFound, a foundation model tailored for scATAC-seq. ChromFound utilizes a hybrid architecture and genome-aware tokenization to effectively capture genome-wide long contexts and regulatory signals from dynamic chromatin landscapes. Pretrained on 1.97 million cells from 30 tissues and 6 disease conditions, ChromFound demonstrates broad applicability across 6 diverse tasks. Notably, it achieves robust zero-shot performance in generating universal cell representations and exhibits excellent transferability in cell type annotation and cross-omics prediction. By uncovering enhancer-gene links undetected by existing computational methods, ChromFound offers a promising framework for understanding disease risk variants in the noncoding genome.</description>

      <title>SHAP zero Explains Biological Sequence Models with Near-zero Marginal Cost for Future Queries</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.19236</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.19236v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The growing adoption of machine learning models for biological sequences has intensified the need for interpretable predictions, with Shapley values emerging as a theoretically grounded standard for model explanation. While effective for local explanations of individual input sequences, scaling Shapley-based interpretability to extract global biological insights requires evaluating thousands of sequences--incurring exponential computational cost per query. We introduce SHAP zero, a novel algorithm that amortizes the cost of Shapley value computation across large-scale biological datasets. After a one-time model sketching step, SHAP zero enables near-zero marginal cost for future queries by uncovering an underexplored connection between Shapley values, high-order feature interactions, and the sparse Fourier transform of the model. Applied to models of guide RNA efficacy, DNA repair outcomes, and protein fitness, SHAP zero explains predictions orders of magnitude faster than existing methods, recovering rich combinatorial interactions previously inaccessible at scale. This work opens the door to principled, efficient, and scalable interpretability for black-box sequence models in biology.</description>
