      <title>Valuation Model of Chinese Convertible Bonds Based on Monte Carlo Simulation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.06496</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.06496v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We address the problem of pricing Chinese convertible bonds(CCB) by Monte Carlo simulation and dynamic programming. At each exercising time, we use the state variables of the underlying stock to regress the continuation value, and then we apply standard backward induction to get the coefficients until the moment of time zero, thus the price of the CCB is obtained. We apply the pricing of CCBs by simulation and test the performance of an under-priced strategy: long the 10 most underpriced CCBs and rebalance daily. The result show this strategy significantly outperforms the double-low strategy which is used as a benchmark. In practice, CCB issuers usually use the downward adjustment clause to to avoid financial distress upon put provision. Therefore, we treat the downward adjustment clause as a probabilistic event triggering the put provision. In this way, we combine the downward adjustment clause with put provision in a simple manner.</description>

      <title>Automate Strategy Finding with LLM in Quant investment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.06289</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.06289v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Despite significant progress in deep learning for financial trading, existing models often face instability and high uncertainty, hindering their practical application. Leveraging advancements in Large Language Models (LLMs) and multi-agent architectures, we propose a novel framework for quantitative stock investment in portfolio management and alpha mining. Our framework addresses these issues by integrating LLMs to generate diversified alphas and employing a multi-agent approach to dynamically evaluate market conditions. This paper proposes a framework where large language models (LLMs) mine alpha factors from multimodal financial data, ensuring a comprehensive understanding of market dynamics. The first module extracts predictive signals by integrating numerical data, research papers, and visual charts. The second module uses ensemble learning to construct a diverse pool of trading agents with varying risk preferences, enhancing strategy performance through a broader market analysis. In the third module, a dynamic weight-gating mechanism selects and assigns weights to the most relevant agents based on real-time market conditions, enabling the creation of an adaptive and context-aware composite alpha formula. Extensive experiments on the Chinese stock markets demonstrate that this framework significantly outperforms state-of-the-art baselines across multiple financial metrics. The results underscore the efficacy of combining LLM-generated alphas with a multi-agent architecture to achieve superior trading performance and stability. This work highlights the potential of AI-driven approaches in enhancing quantitative investment strategies and sets a new benchmark for integrating advanced machine learning techniques in financial trading can also be applied on diverse markets.</description>
