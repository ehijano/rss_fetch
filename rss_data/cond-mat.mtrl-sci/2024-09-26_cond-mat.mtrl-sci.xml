      <title>Thickness-dependent anisotropic Gilbert damping in heterostructures of ferromagnets and two-dimensional ferroelectric bismuth monolayer</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.16514</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.16514v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Gilbert damping parameter, which describes magnetization dynamics, is crucial for the performance of modern spintronic devices, affecting factors such as the switching speed and critical current density of magnetoresistive random access memory. Thus, the ability to engineer it on demand is pivotal for developing novel spintronic applications. In this work, we systematically examine the Gilbert damping parameter of Fe films in contact with a black phosphorus-like bismuth monolayer using first-principles calculations. In these Bi/Fe heterostructures, we obtain a significantly enhanced Gilbert damping owing to strong interfacial spin-orbit couplings (SOCs). Interestingly, we find non-monotonic thickness-dependent Gilbert damping anisotropy and attribute that to the competition between the interfacial SOC and the intrinsically anisotropic SOC of Fe films. We further demonstrate that these SOC effects lead to anisotropic band structures, which are responsible for the anisotropic Gilbert damping. Our work provides a deep understanding of the anisotropic Gilbert damping and opens avenues for exploring it in ferromagnetic heterostructures.</description>

      <title>The effect of MgO insertion into the interstitial spaces of $BaY_2O_4$ on the upconversion response of $Er^{3+}:Yb^{3+}$ at illumination with 976 nm excitation light</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.16568</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.16568v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The efficiencies and form of the upconversion spectra of rare earth ions embedded in crystalline matrices strongly depend upon the phonon dispersion of these, since the inter-level energy transition probabilities are influenced by the phonon energies. The aim of this study is to show a novel method of influencing the phonon energy values of crystalline $BaY_2O_4$ and, by this, to finely tune the spectra of any rare earth ion as a dopant of it. We used $Er^{3+}$ sensitized by $Yb^{3+}$ as dopants, but the same method can be generalized for other kind of rare earth ions. As such, we synthesized $BaY_2O_4$ and $BaY_2O_4:MgO (BaY_2MgO_5)$ ceramics having as activator-sensitizer pairs the $Er^{3+}$ 1% and $Yb^{3+}$ 2% relative to the substituted $Y^{3+}$. Firstly, we synthesized the mix of precursor metallic oxides by the citrate-gel method, pressed these into pellets, and sintered them to obtain doped crystalline ceramic samples. The ceramic samples were illuminated with 976 nm from a laser diode, and the resulting upconversion spectra of $Er^{3+}$ were measured. $BaY_2O_4$ and $BaY_2O_4:MgO (BaY_2MgO_5)$ have almost the same XRD signature, showing that the crystal unit cells have the same parameters but they differ in the phononic energies due to the presence of the additional MgO. Comparing the results of these two extreme cases $BaY_2O_4$ vs. $BaY_2O_4:MgO (BaY_2MgO_5)$ reveals that the presence of the MgO modifies the upconversion response. So, this study fulfills two goals: First, it reveals the structure of the undocumented $BaY_2O_4:MgO (BaY_2MgO_5)$ and shows how it is based on the crystal structure of $BaY_2O_4$ with $Mg^{2+}$ ions occupying the unit cell interstitions. Secondly, it suggests a method of tuning the phononic energies of $BaY_2O_4$ and, as a consequence, the upconversion response of $Er^{3+}$.</description>

      <title>Growth and Spectroscopy of Lanthanide Doped Y$_2$SiO$_5$ Microcrystals for Quantum Information Processing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.16580</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.16580v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Lanthanide-doped Y$_{2}$SiO$_{5}$ microcrystals were prepared using the solution combustion, solid state and sol-gel synthesis techniques. Of these, the sol-gel method yields the most reliable and high-quality X2 phase Y$_{2}$SiO$_{5}$ microcrystals. Absorption and laser site-selective fluorescence measurements of Nd$^{3+}$, Eu$^{3+}$ and Er$^{3+}$ doped material, performed at cryogenic temperatures, indicate that the as-grown microcrystals are of high optical quality with inhomogeneously broadened optical linewidths that are comparable to bulk crystals at similar dopant concentrations.</description>

      <title>Tin-Based Chalcogenide Perovskites: A Promising Lead-Free Alternative for Stable and High-Performance Photovoltaics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.16657</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.16657v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Chalcogenide perovskites (CPs) have sparked interest as promising optoelectronic materials due to their stability, nontoxicity, small bandgaps, large absorption coefficients, and high defect tolerance. Here, using state-of-the-art first-principles-based density functional theory, density functional perturbation theory, and many-body perturbation theory (i.e., GW and BSE), we explicate the excitonic and polaronic phenomena as well as the relative stability and optoelectronic properties in a series of distorted CPs ASnX$_3$ (A = Ca, Sr, Ba; X = S, Se). Our findings reveal that these perovskites are mechanically stable and exhibit direct G$_{0}$W$_{0}$ bandgaps ranging from 0.79 to 1.50 eV. Moreover, we find that the exciton binding energy of these compounds (0.04-0.23 eV) is comparable to that of Zr- and Hf-based CPs but little higher than that of conventional lead halide perovskites (HPs). Additionally, we look into polaron-facilitated charge carrier mobility for electrons (21.33-416.02 cm$^{2}$V$^{-1}$s$^{-1}$) and holes (7.02-260.69 cm$^{2}$V$^{-1}$s$^{-1}$), which are comparable to or higher than those observed in lead HPs and significantly exceed those in Zr- and Hf-based CPs, owing to reduced carrier-phonon couplings in the former. Finally, the estimated spectroscopic limited maximum efficiency (24.2%-31.2%) reflects that they can be promising candidates for photovoltaic applications. This has been further confirmed by assessing the performance of perovskite solar cells through conventional device (FTO/TiO$_{2}$/ASnX$_{3}$/Spiro-OMeTAD/Au) simulations using SCAPS-1D software.</description>

      <title>Theory and Atomistic Simulation of Electrodeposition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.16704</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.16704v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Electrodeposition is a fundamental process in electrochemistry, and has applications in numerous industries, such as corrosion protection, decorative finishing, energy storage, catalysis, and electronics. While there is a long history of using electrodeposition, its application for controlled nanostructure growth is limited. The establishment of an atomic-scale understanding of the electrodeposition process and dynamics is crucial to enable the controlled fabrication of metal nanoparticles and other nanostructures. Significant advancements in molecular simulation capabilities and the electronic structure theory of electrified solid-liquid interfaces bring theory closer to realistic applications, but a gap remains between realistic applications, theoretical understanding of dynamics, and atomistic simulation. In this review we briefly summarize the current state-of-the-art computational techniques available for the simulation of electrodeposition and electrochemical growth on surfaces, and identify the remaining open challenges.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.16712v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The recent study of viscoelastic amorphous oxychloride electrolytes has opened up a new field of research for solid-state electrolytes. In this work, we chose Li-Al-O-Cl system containing disordered structures with varying O/Cl ratio and Li$^+$ content to study their structural characteristics and ion transport mechanism using ab-initio molecular dynamics (AIMD) simulation and machine learning interatomic potential based molecular dynamics (MLIP-based MD) simulation. It is found that O-doping results in the presence of a skeleton of Al-chains formed by AlOCl tetrahedra and the increase of glass forming ability, causing Cl atoms' rotation around centered-Al within the tetrahedron thus facilitating the motion of Li$^+$ ions. However, further increase of O/Cl ratio decreases the number of rotating Cl atoms, weakening the transport of Li$^+$. So increasing glass forming ability without reducing Cl content or by methods through controlling synthesis conditions, are useful to promote Li$^+$ ion conducting of oxychloride electrolytes.</description>

      <title>Evolution of the surface morphology of GaSb epitaxial layers deposited by molecular beam epitaxy (MBE) on GaAs (100) substrates</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.16729</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.16729v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study presents a demonstration of the surface morphology behavior of gallium antimonide (GaSb) layers deposited on gallium arsenide (GaAs) (100) substrates using three different methods: metamorphic, interfacial misfit (IMF) matrix, and a method based on a Polish patent application number P.443805. The first two methods are commonly used, while the third differs in the sequence of successive steps and the presence of Be doping at the initial growth stage. By comparing GaSb layers made by these methods for the same growth parameters, the most favorable procedure for forming a GaSb buffer layer is selected. Using GaAs substrates with a GaSb buffer layer is a cheaper alternative to using GaSb substrates in infrared detector structures based on II-type superlattices T2SL, such as InAs/GaSb. The quality of the GaSb buffer layer determines the quality of the subsequent layers that form the entire T2SL and affects factors such as dark current in terms of application</description>

      <title>On the band gap variation in CH$_3$NH$_3$Pb(I$_{1-x}$Br$_x$)$_3$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.16775</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.16775v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The electronic structure and the band gap behavior of CH$_3$NH$_3$Pb(I$_{1-x}$Br$_x$)$_3$ for $x$=0.25, 0.33, 0.50, 0.67, 0.75, 1.00 were studied using the full-relativistic density-functional-theory calculations. A combination of the parameter-free Armiento-K\"{u}mmel generalized gradient approximation exchange functional with the nonseparable gradient approximation Minnesota correlation functional was employed. The calculated band gap sizes for the CH$_3$NH$_3$Pb(I$_{1-x}$Br$_x$)$_3$ series were found to be similar to the experimentally measured values. While the change of the optimized lattice parameter with an increasing Br content can be described by a linear fit, the calculated band gap variation exhibits rather a quadratic-like behavior over the $x$ region of the cubic crystal structure. While the experimental reports are divided on whether the bowing parameter value is being very small or significant, our calculated results support the latter case.</description>

      <title>Computational electron-phonon superconductivity: from theoretical physics to material science</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.16975</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.16975v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The search for room-temperature superconductors is a major challenge in modern physics. The discovery of copper-oxide superconductors in 1986 brought hope but also revealed complex mechanisms that are difficult to analyze and compute. In contrast, the traditional electron-phonon coupling (EPC) mechanism facilitated the practical realization of superconductivity in metallic hydrogen. Since 2015, the discovery of new hydrogen compounds has shown that EPC can enable room-temperature superconductivity under high pressures, driving extensive research. Advances in computational capabilities, especially exascale computing, now allow for the exploration of millions of materials. This paper reviews newly predicted superconducting systems in 2023-2024, focusing on hydrides, boron-carbon systems, and compounds with nitrogen, carbon, and pure metals. Although many computationally predicted high-Tc superconductors were not experimentally confirmed, some low-temperature superconductors were successfully synthesized. This paper provides a review of these developments and future research directions.</description>

      <title>Temperature-activated dislocation avalanches signaling brittle-to-ductile transition in BCC micropillars</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.16987</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.16987v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We carry out strain-controlled in situ compression experiments of micron-sized tungsten micropillars (W) in the temperature range 300-900K, together with simulations of three-dimensional discrete dislocation dynamics (DDD) on the same scale. Two distinct regimes are observed. At low temperatures, plastic deformation appears smooth, both temporally and spatially. Stress fluctuations are consistent with a Wiener stochastic process resulting from uncorrelated dislocation activity within the pillars. However, high-temperature stress fluctuations are highly correlated and exhibit features of self-organized criticality (SOC), with deformation located within well-defined slip bands. The high-temperature stress relaxation statistics are consistent with a thermally activated nucleation process from the surface. It is argued that the nature of the transition between the two regimes is the same as in the brittle to ductile transition in bulk BCC metals.</description>

      <title>Improper flexoelectricity in hexagonal rare-earth ferrites</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.17022</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.17022v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Flexoelectricity is a universal effect that generates electric polarization due to broken inversion symmetry caused by local strain gradient. The large strain gradient at nanoscale makes flexo-electric effects, especially in nanoscopic ferroelectric materials, promising in sensors, actuator, energy harvesting, and memory applications. In this work, we studied flexoelectricity in hexagonal ferrites h-YbFeO3, an improper ferroelectric expected to have weak piezoelectricity and low sensitivity to depolarization field, which are advantageous for studying flexoelectric effects. We show that in h-YbFeO3 epitaxial thin films, strain gradient on the order of 10^6 m-1 occurs near grain boundaries, which has a significant impact on the non-polar K3 structural distortion that induces spontaneous polarization. The phenomenological model based on the Landau theory of improper ferroelectricity suggests an indirect flexoelectric effect on the order of 10 nC/m in h-YbFeO3, which is substantially larger than the expectation from Kogan mechanism. These results reveal a novel microscopic mechanism of coupling between strain gradient and polarization mediated by structural distortion, which we call improper flexoelectricity.</description>

      <title>Thermo-mechanical Properties of Hierarchical Biocomposite Materials from Photosynthetic Microorganisms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.16318</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.16318v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Extrusion 3D-printing of biopolymers and natural fiber-based biocomposites allows for the fabrication of complex structures, ranging from gels for healthcare applications to eco-friendly structural materials. However, traditional polymer extrusion demands high-energy consumption to pre-heat the slurries and reduce material viscosity. Additionally, natural fiber reinforcement often requires harsh treatments to improve adhesion to the matrix. Here, we overcome these challenges by introducing a systematic framework to fabricate natural biocomposite materials via a sustainable and scalable process. Using Chlorella vulgaris microalgae as the matrix, we optimize the bioink composition and the 3D-printing process to fabricate multifunctional, lightweight, hierarchical materials. A systematic dehydration approach prevents cracking and failure of the 3D-printed structure, maintaining a continuous morphology of aggregated microalgae cells that can withstand high shear forces during processing. Hydroxyethyl cellulose acts as a binder and reinforcement for Chlorella cells, leading to biocomposites with a bending stiffness above 1.5 GPa. The Chlorella biocomposites demonstrate isotropic heat transfer, functioning as effective thermal insulators with a thermal conductivity of 0.10 W/mK at room temperature. These materials show promise in applications requiring balanced thermal insulation and structural capabilities, positioning them as a sustainable alternative to conventional materials in response to increasing global materials demand.</description>

      <title>Gapped and gapless quantum spin liquids on the ruby lattice</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.16344</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.16344v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The ruby lattice has been the subject of much interest recently due its realization in Rydberg atom arrays, where its rich variety of frustrated interactions gives rise to topologically ordered quantum spin liquids. Similarly, numerical studies of ruby-lattice spin models, with both isotropic and anisotropic interactions, have provided evidence of gapped and gapless spin-liquid ground states with different low-energy gauge structures. Motivated by these findings, we perform a projective symmetry group (PSG) classification of U(1) and $\mathbb{Z}_{2}$ fermionic spinon mean-field theories$\unicode{x2014}$respecting space-group and time-reversal symmetries$\unicode{x2014}$for $S=1/2$ spins. We obtain a total of 50 U(1) and 64 $\mathbb{Z}_{2}$ PSGs, and upon restricting their realization via mean-field $\textit{Ans\"atze}$ with up to second-nearest-neighbor singlet amplitudes (relevant to the models studied here), only 8 U(1) and 18 $\mathbb{Z}_{2}$ distinct states are obtained. We present the singlet fields for all $\textit{Ans\"atze}$ up to third-nearest-neighboring bonds and discuss their spinon dispersions as well as their dynamical spin structure factors. Building on this information, we also obtain the phase diagram of the Heisenberg model in the presence of first ($J_{1}$), second ($J_{1}'$), and third ($J_{2}$) neighbor antiferromagnetic couplings within a self-consistent mean-field approximation.</description>

      <title>The multi-state geometry of shift current and polarization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.16358</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.16358v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The quantum metric and Berry curvature capture essential properties of non-trivial Bloch states and underpin many fascinating phenomena. However, it becomes increasingly evident that a more comprehensive understanding of quantum state geometry is necessary to explain properties involving Bloch states of multiple bands, such as optical transitions. To this end, we employ quantum state projectors to develop an explicitly gauge-invariant formalism and demonstrate its power with applications to non-linear optics and the theory of electronic polarization. We provide a simple expression for the shift current that resolves its precise relation to the moments of electronic polarization, clarifies the treatment of band degeneracies, and reveals its decomposition into the sum of the skewness of the occupied states and intrinsic multi-state geometry. The projector approach is applied to calculate non-linear optical properties of transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDs) layers, using minimal tight-binding models previously calculated by ab initio methods. We close with comments on potential further applications of the projector operator approach to multi-state geometry.</description>

      <title>A multi-scale probabilistic model for fatigue lifetime characterization of alloys in the presence of random process-induced pores</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.16565</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.16565v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A probabilistic fatigue lifetime model is developed in conjunction with a multi-scale method for structures with pores whose exact distribution, i.e. geometries and locations, is unknown. The model takes into account uncertainty in fatigue lifetimes in structures due to defects at two scales: micro-scale heterogeneity &amp; meso-scale pores. An element-wise probabilistic strain-life model with its criterion modified for taking into account multiaxial loading is developed for taking into account the effect of micro-scale defects on the fatigue lifetime. The effect of meso-scale pores in the structure is taken into account via statistical modelling of the expected pore populations via a finite element method, based on tomographic scans of a small region of porous material used to make the structure. A previously implemented Neuber-type plastic correction algorithm is used for fast full-field approximation of the strain-life criterion around the statistically generated pore fields. The probability of failure of a porous structure is obtained via a weakest link assumption at the level of its constituent finite elements. The fatigue model can be identified via a maximum likelihood estimate on experimental fatigue data of structures containing different types of pore populations. The proposed method is tested on an existing data-set of an aluminium alloy with two levels of porosity. The model requires lesser data for identification than traditional models that consider porous media as a homogeneous material, as the same base material is considered for the two grades of porous material. Numerical studies on synthetically generated data show that the model is capable of taking into account the statistical size effect in fatigue, and demonstrate that fatigue properties of subsurface porous material are lower than that of core porous material, which makes homogenisation of the model non-trivial.</description>

      <title>Squeezing Quantum States in Three-Dimensional Twisted Crystals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.16602</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.16602v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A fundamental idea in wave mechanics is that propagation in a periodic medium can be described by Bloch waves whose conserved crystal momenta define their transformations when displaced by the set of discrete lattice translations. In ordered materials where incommensurate spatial periods compete, this general principle is rendered ineffective, often with dramatic consequences. Examples are crystals with broken symmetries from charge or spin density waves, quasiperiodic lattices that produce diffraction patterns with crystallographically forbidden point symmetries, and stacks of two-dimensional lattices with a relative rotation (twist) between layers. In special cases when there is a small difference between the competing periods, a useful work-around is a continuum description where a periodic long-wavelength field produces Bragg scattering that coherently mixes short-wavelength carrier waves. In this work, we advocate an alternative approach to study three-dimensional twisted crystals that replaces their spectrally congested momentum-space Bloch band structures with a representation using squeezed coherent states in a Fock space of free-particle vortex states. This reorganization of the Hilbert space highlights the crucial role of the Coriolis force in the equations of motion that leads to unconventional phase space dynamics and edge state structure generic to a family of complex crystals.</description>

      <title>Broadband measurement of Feibelman's quantum surface response functions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.16616v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Feibelman $d$-parameter, a mesoscopic complement to the local bulk permittivity, describes quantum optical surface responses for interfaces, including nonlocality, spill-in and-out, and surface-enabled Landau damping. It has been incorporated into the macroscopic Maxwellian framework for convenient modeling and understanding of nanoscale electromagnetic phenomena, calling for the compilation of a $d$-parameter database for interfaces of interest in nano-optics. However, accurate first-principles calculations of $d$-parameters face computational challenges, whereas existing measurements of $d$-parameters are scarce and restricted to narrow spectral windows. We demonstrate a general broadband ellipsometric approach to measure $d$-parameters at a gold--air interface across the visible--ultraviolet regimes. Gold is found to spill in and spill out at different frequencies. We also observe gold's Bennett mode, a surface-dipole resonance associated with a pole of the $d$-parameter, around 2.5 eV. Our measurements give rise to and are further validated by the passivity and Kramers--Kronig causality analysis of $d$-parameters. Our work advances the understanding of quantum surface response and may enable applications like enhanced electron field emission.</description>

      <title>Exploring the Magnetotransport Signature of antiskyrmions in Mn$_{1.4}$PtSn</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.16649</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.16649v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Emerging magnetic fields related to the presence of topologically protected spin textures such as skyrmions are expected to give rise to additional, topology-related contributions to the Hall effect. In order to doubtlessly identify this so-called topological Hall effect, it is crucial to disentangle such contributions from the anomalous Hall effect. This necessitates a direct correlation of the transversal Hall voltage with the underlying magnetic textures. We utilize a novel measurement platform that allows to acquire high-resolution Lorentz transmission electron microscopy images of magnetic textures as a function of an external magnetic field and to concurrently measure the (anomalous) Hall voltage in-situ in the microscope on one and the same specimen. We use this approach to investigate the transport signatures of the chiral soliton lattice and antiskyrmions in Mn$_{1.4}$PtSn. Notably, the observed textures allow to fully understand the measured Hall voltage without the need of any additional contributions due to a topological Hall effect, and the field-controlled formation and annihilation of anstiskyrmions are found to have no effect on the measurend Hall voltage.</description>

Abstract: We study the $S = 1/2$ Heisenberg antiferromagnet on the Lieb lattice accompanied by additional interactions that create frustration. The system exhibits a ferrimagnetic ground state in the absence of frustration. Further, we successfully observe a novel type of collapsing behavior of the ferrimagnetism via numerical diagonalization. The ferrimagnetic state is observed to collapse in a discontinuous manner. Furthermore, different ground states with small spontaneous magnetizations are obtained before the spontaneous magnetization finally disappears.</description>

      <title>Fundamental nature of the self-field critical current in superconductors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.16758</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.16758v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The ability to conduct electric current without dissipating energy is a property of superconductors that is used in magnetic systems utilized in healthcare, natural sciences, and ongoing global projects in nuclear fusion and aviation. The highest dissipation-less current is named the critical current, and this is one of the prime practical properties of superconductors (together with the critical current density, Jc). Recently, Goyal et al reported a record high Jc~190 MA/cm2 at 4.2 K in (RE)BCO films, exceeding the highest Jc in the best commercial (RE)BCO wires by a factor of five. Based on the huge potential practical impact of this high Jc, we examined the raw experimental data and found that this high value originates from an error in the conversion of units. The real Jc is 10 times smaller than the reported Jc, consistent with values currently achieved by many manufacturers.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.17096v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider self-organization and memory formation of a sheared amorphous solid subject to a random shear strain protocol confined to a strain range $\pm \varepsilon_{\rm max}$. We show that, as in the case of applied cyclic shear, the response of the driven system retains a memory of the strain range that can subsequently be retrieved. Our findings suggest that self-organization and memory formation of disordered materials can emerge under more general conditions, such as a system interacting with its fluctuating environment.</description>

      <title>Surface Second Harmonic Generation from Topological Dirac Semimetal PdTe$_2$</title>

      <description>arXiv:2308.09053v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Recent experiments and calculations in topological semimetals have observed anomalously strong second-order optical nonlinearity, but yet whether the enhancement also occurs at surfaces of topological semimetals in general remains an open question. In this work, we tackle this problem by measuring polarization-dependent and rotational-anisotropy optical second harmonic generation (SHG) from centrosymmetric type-II Dirac semimetal PdTe$_2$. We found the SHG to follow C$_{3v}$ surface symmetry with a time-varying intensity dictated by the oxidation kinetics of the material after its surface cleavage, indicating the surface origin of SHG. Quantitative characterization of the surface nonlinear susceptibility indicates a large out-of-plane response of PdTe$_2$ with $|\chi_{ccc}^{(2)}|$ up to 25 $\times$ 10$^{-18}$ m$^2$/V. Our results support the topological surfaces/interfaces as a new route toward applications of nonlinear optical effects with released symmetry constraints, and demonstrate SHG as a viable means to in situ study of kinetics of topological surfaces.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2402.05200v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) create exciting possibilities for powerful language processing tools to accelerate research in materials science. While LLMs have great potential to accelerate materials understanding and discovery, they currently fall short in being practical materials science tools. In this position paper, we show relevant failure cases of LLMs in materials science that reveal current limitations of LLMs related to comprehending and reasoning over complex, interconnected materials science knowledge. Given those shortcomings, we outline a framework for developing Materials Science LLMs (MatSci-LLMs) that are grounded in materials science knowledge and hypothesis generation followed by hypothesis testing. The path to attaining performant MatSci-LLMs rests in large part on building high-quality, multi-modal datasets sourced from scientific literature where various information extraction challenges persist. As such, we describe key materials science information extraction challenges which need to be overcome in order to build large-scale, multi-modal datasets that capture valuable materials science knowledge. Finally, we outline a roadmap for applying future MatSci-LLMs for real-world materials discovery via: 1. Automated Knowledge Base Generation; 2. Automated In-Silico Material Design; and 3. MatSci-LLM Integrated Self-Driving Materials Laboratories.</description>

      <title>Bond Dipole based Geometric Theory of Band Alignment</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.05509v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The band alignment (BA) between two materials is a fundamental property that governs the functionality and performance of electronic, as well as electrochemical, devices. However, despite decades of study, the inability to separate surface properties from those of bulk have made a deep understanding of the physics of BA illusive. Building on the theory of ideal vacuum level to separate surface from bulk [CWZ, Phys. Rev. B 103, 235202 (2021)], here we present a geometric theory for the band alignment, particularly, explaining the insensitivity of the alignment to interfacial orientation between isotropic materials. First, we adopt charge neutral polyhedron, termed Wigner-Seitz atoms (WSA), to partition the charge of atoms in a way which maintains crystal symmetry and tessellates the space. In contrast to CWZ theory, the band alignment of two materials constructed from such WSAs is independent of interface orientation. Upon electron relaxation at the interface, here we show that the interfacial charge transfer dipole can be faithfully descibed by the sum of localized point dipoles which exist between atoms at the interface (bond dipoles). For interfaces between isotropic materials, the magnitude of the bond dipole can be factored out as a multiplier, leaving only geometric factors, such as the crystal symmetry and dimension of the material, to determine band alignment, irrespective of the orientation of the interface. We considered 29 distinct interfaces and found that this bond dipole theory yields excellent agreement (RMS deviation &lt; 30 meV) with first-principles results. Our theory can be straightforwardly applied to interface between alloys, as well as between anisotropic systems.</description>

      <title>Coherent Collections of Rules Describing Exceptional Materials Identified with a Multi-Objective Optimization of Subgroups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.18437</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.18437v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Useful materials are often statistically exceptional and they might be overlooked by AI models that attempt to describe all materials simultaneously. These global models perform well for the majority of (useless) materials, but they do not necessarily capture the useful ones. Subgroup discovery (SGD) identifies rules describing subsets of materials (SGs) associated to exceptional values, e.g., high values, of a materials property of interest. Thus, SGD can better capture exceptional materials compared to most widely used AI techniques. Previous works focused on the SG that maximizes an objective function that establishes one tradeoff between the size of the SG and the exceptionality of the distribution of property values in the SG. However, this optimization does not give a unique solution, but many SGs typically have similar objective-function values. Here, we identify a Pareto region of SGs presenting a multitude of size-exceptionality tradeoffs. The approach is demonstrated by the learning of rules describing perovskites with high bulk modulus. These rules are used to screen a large space of perovskites and to efficiently identify materials with bulk modulus up to 13 % higher than the highest value of the training set.</description>

Abstract: The Janus VSBrI monolayer, identified by first-principles calculations, emerges as a promising semiconducting material with desirable ferromagnetic and ferroelectric properties. It's in-plane magnetic anisotropic energy is up to 460 $\mu$eV/V , and in-plane and out-of-plane piezoelectric strain coefficients are larger than many other known two-dimensional materials. The energy variations among different magnetic states show a strong correlate with polarization. Interestingly, the stability of the ferroelectric phase can be further enhanced by the application of biaxial tensile strain. These intriguing properties make the Janus VSBrI monolayer highly desirable for practical applications in piezoelectronic devices, and a promising candidate for multifunctional spintronic devices.</description>

      <title>Interpretable Machine Learning for High-Strength High-Entropy Alloy Design</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.14905v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: High-entropy alloys (HEAs) are metallic materials with solid solutions stabilized by high mixing entropy. Some exhibit excellent strength, often accompanied by additional properties such as magnetic, invar, corrosion, or cryogenic response. This has spurred efforts to discover new HEAs, but the vast compositional search space has made these efforts challenging. Here we present a framework to predict and optimize the yield strength of face-centered cubic (FCC) HEAs, using CoCrFeMnNi-based alloys as a case study due to abundant available data. Our novel Residual Hybrid Learning Model (RELM) integrates Random Forest and Gradient Boosting, enhanced by material attribute data, to handle sparse, skewed datasets for real-world alloys. A hybrid Generative Adversarial Network-Variational Autoencoder model explores new alloy compositions beyond existing datasets. By incorporating processing parameters, which determine the microstructure and thus strength, RELM achieves an R$^2$ score of 0.915, surpassing traditional models. SHapley Additive Explanations (SHAP) and Partial Dependencies enhance interpretability, revealing composition-processing-property relationships, as validated by experiments, including X-ray diffraction, SEM analysis, and tensile testing. The model discovered two novel Co$_{20}$Cr$_{16}$Fe$_{20}$Mn$_{16}$Ni$_{24}$Al$_4$ and Co$_{24}$Cr$_{12}$Fe$_{12}$Mn$_{16}$Ni$_{28}$Al$_4$Si$_4$ HEAs with a maximum possible yield strength of 842 and 937 MPa, significantly exceeding previously reported values for these alloy systems. This study pioneers interpretable machine learning in alloy design, providing a rigorous, data-driven approach to discovering, processing, and optimizing real-world materials. The findings highlight the critical role of both compositional and post-fabrication processing parameters in advancing the understanding of composition-processing-property relationships.</description>

Abstract: It was recently discovered that friction between surfaces bearing phosphatidylcholine (PC) lipid bilayers can be increased by two orders of magnitude or more via an externally-applied electric field, and that this increase is fully reversible when the field is switched off. While this striking effect holds promising application potential, its molecular origin remains unknown due to difficulty in experimentally probing confined membrane structure at a molecular level. Our earlier molecular dynamics simulations revealed the equilibrium electroporated structure of such confined lipid membranes under an electric field; here we extend this approach to study the associated sliding friction between two solid surfaces across such PC bilayers. We identify the enhanced friction in the field as arising from membrane undulations due to the electroporation; this leads to some dehydration at the lipid-water interfaces, leading to closer contact and thus increased attraction between the zwitterionic headgroups, which results in increased frictional dissipation between the bilayers as they slide past each other. Additionally, the electric field facilitates formation of lipid bridges spanning the intersurface gap; at the sliding velocities of the experiments, these bridges increase the friction by topologically-forcing the slip-plane to pass through the acyl tail-tail interface, associated with higher dissipation during sliding. Our results account quantitatively for the experimentally-observed electro-modulated friction with boundary lipid bilayers, and indicate more generally how they may affect interactions between contacting surfaces, where high local transverse fields may be ubiquitous.</description>

      <title>Possible realization of a randomness-driven quantum disordered state in an S = 1/2 antiferromagnet Sr3CuTa2O9</title>

Abstract: Collective behavior of spins, frustration-induced strong quantum fluctuations, and subtle interplay between competing degrees of freedom in quantum materials can lead to correlated quantum states with exotic excitations that are essential ingredients for establishing paradigmatic models and have immense potential for quantum technologies. Disorder is ubiquitous in real materials, and the detailed insights into the role of disorder on the intriguing ground state borne out of quenched randomness provide a route toward the design and discovery of functional quantum materials. Herein, we report magnetization, specific heat, electron spin resonance, and muon spin resonance studies on a 3d-electron-based antiferromagnet Sr3CuTa2O9. The negative Curie- Weiss temperature value, obtained from the Curie-Weiss fit of high-temperature magnetic susceptibility data, indicates antiferromagnetic interaction between Cu2+ moments. Specific heat data show the absence of long-range magnetic ordering down to 64 mK despite a reasonably strong exchange interaction between Cu2+ (S =1/2) spins as reflected from a Curie-Weiss temperature of -27 K. The power-law behavior and the data collapse of specific heat and magnetization data evince the emergence of a random-singlet state in Sr3CuTa2O9. The power-law-like spin auto-correlation function and the data collapse of muon polarization asymmetry with longitudinal field dependence of t({\mu}0H)^{\gamma} further support credence to the presence of a randomness-induced quantum disordered state. Our results suggest that randomness induced by disorder is an alternate route to realize a quantum disordered state in this antiferromagnet.</description>

      <title>A finite element method for anisotropic crystal growth on surfaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.14206</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.14206v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Phase transition problems on curved surfaces can lead to a panopticon of fascinating patterns. In this paper we consider finite element approximations of phase field models with a spatially inhomogeneous and anisotropic surface energy density. The problems are either posed in $\mathbb R^3$ or on a two-dimensional hypersurface in $\mathbb R^3$. In the latter case, a fundamental choice regarding the anisotropic energy density has to be made. One possibility is to use a density defined in the ambient space $\mathbb R^3$. However, we propose and advocate for an alternative, where a density is defined on a fixed chosen tangent space, and is then moved along geodesics to the other tangent spaces. Our numerical method can be employed in all of the above situations, where for the problems on hypersurfaces the algorithm uses parametric finite elements. We prove an unconditional stability result for our schemes and present several numerical experiments, including for the modelling of ice crystal growth on a sphere.</description>

      <title>Local insulator-to-superconductor transition in amorphous InO$_x$ films modulated by e-beam irradiation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.02276</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.02276v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present a novel method enabling precise post-fabrication modulation of the electrical resistance in micrometer-scale regions of amorphous indium oxide (a-InO$_x$) films. By subjecting initially insulating films to an electron beam at room temperature, we demonstrate that the exposed region of the films becomes superconducting. The resultant superconducting transition temperature ($T_c$) is adjustable up to 2.8 K by changing the electron dose and accelerating voltage. This technique offers a compelling alternative to traditional a-InO$_x$ annealing methods for both fundamental investigations and practical applications. Moreover, it empowers independent adjustment of electrical properties across initially identical a-InO$_x$ samples on the same substrate, facilitating the creation of superconducting microstructures with precise $T_c$ control at the micrometer scale. The observed resistance modifications likely stem from photoreduction induced by X-ray and/or UV radiation emitted during electron beam interactions with the film and substrate.</description>

      <title>Effect of UV light irradiation on charge neutralization in XPS measurements</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.00663</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.00663v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: When XPS analyses are performed on insulator surfaces, shift and deformation of spectra peaks typically take place due to the surface charging. To achieve reliable XPS measurements, neutralization techniques have been widely adopted but their effectiveness are still limited, and thus, new neutralization technologies are urgently needed. Here, stable XPS spectra in which all the peaks undergo a reduced and nearly constant shift without significant deformation and broadening were obtained by introducing the UV light irradiation, implying that the introduction of the UV light can not only greatly attenuate the strength but also significantly improve both the temporal stability and the spatial uniformity of the surface charging during XPS measurements. This phenomenon, referred to as UV-assisted neutralization in this article, was found as effective as the most commonly used dual beam charge neutralization. Further observations show that the suppression of the charging issue comes from the adsorption of the UV-excited photoelectrons onto the X-ray irradiation region. This neutralization method, combined with the binding energy referencing, can be expected to become a promising alternative technique for solving the charging issues in XPS measurements.</description>
