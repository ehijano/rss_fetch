      <title>HAMIL-QA: Hierarchical Approach to Multiple Instance Learning for Atrial LGE MRI Quality Assessment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.07254</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.07254v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The accurate evaluation of left atrial fibrosis via high-quality 3D Late Gadolinium Enhancement (LGE) MRI is crucial for atrial fibrillation management but is hindered by factors like patient movement and imaging variability. The pursuit of automated LGE MRI quality assessment is critical for enhancing diagnostic accuracy, standardizing evaluations, and improving patient outcomes. The deep learning models aimed at automating this process face significant challenges due to the scarcity of expert annotations, high computational costs, and the need to capture subtle diagnostic details in highly variable images. This study introduces HAMIL-QA, a multiple instance learning (MIL) framework, designed to overcome these obstacles. HAMIL-QA employs a hierarchical bag and sub-bag structure that allows for targeted analysis within sub-bags and aggregates insights at the volume level. This hierarchical MIL approach reduces reliance on extensive annotations, lessens computational load, and ensures clinically relevant quality predictions by focusing on diagnostically critical image features. Our experiments show that HAMIL-QA surpasses existing MIL methods and traditional supervised approaches in accuracy, AUROC, and F1-Score on an LGE MRI scan dataset, demonstrating its potential as a scalable solution for LGE MRI quality assessment automation.

      <title>Deformation-Recovery Diffusion Model (DRDM): Instance Deformation for Image Manipulation and Synthesis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.07295</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.07295v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In medical imaging, the diffusion models have shown great potential in synthetic image generation tasks. However, these models often struggle with the interpretable connections between the generated and existing images and could create illusions. To address these challenges, our research proposes a novel diffusion-based generative model based on deformation diffusion and recovery. This model, named Deformation-Recovery Diffusion Model (DRDM), diverges from traditional score/intensity and latent feature-based approaches, emphasizing morphological changes through deformation fields rather than direct image synthesis. This is achieved by introducing a topological-preserving deformation field generation method, which randomly samples and integrates a set of multi-scale Deformation Vector Fields (DVF). DRDM is trained to learn to recover unreasonable deformation components, thereby restoring each randomly deformed image to a realistic distribution. These innovations facilitate the generation of diverse and anatomically plausible deformations, enhancing data augmentation and synthesis for further analysis in downstream tasks, such as few-shot learning and image registration. Experimental results in cardiac MRI and pulmonary CT show DRDM is capable of creating diverse, large (over 10% image size deformation scale), and high-quality (negative ratio of folding rate is lower than 1%) deformation fields. The further experimental results in downstream tasks, 2D image segmentation and 3D image registration, indicate significant improvements resulting from DRDM, showcasing the potential of our model to advance image manipulation and synthesis in medical imaging and beyond.

      <title>Pairwise Distance Distillation for Unsupervised Real-World Image Super-Resolution</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.07302</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.07302v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Standard single-image super-resolution creates paired training data from high-resolution images through fixed downsampling kernels. However, real-world super-resolution (RWSR) faces unknown degradations in the low-resolution inputs, all the while lacking paired training data. Existing methods approach this problem by learning blind general models through complex synthetic augmentations on training inputs; they sacrifice the performance on specific degradation for broader generalization to many possible ones. We address the unsupervised RWSR for a targeted real-world degradation. We study from a distillation perspective and introduce a novel pairwise distance distillation framework. Through our framework, a model specialized in synthetic degradation adapts to target real-world degradations by distilling intra- and inter-model distances across the specialized model and an auxiliary generalized model. Experiments on diverse datasets demonstrate that our method significantly enhances fidelity and perceptual quality, surpassing state-of-the-art approaches in RWSR.

      <title>Trustworthy Contrast-enhanced Brain MRI Synthesis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.07372</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.07372v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Contrast-enhanced brain MRI (CE-MRI) is a valuable diagnostic technique but may pose health risks and incur high costs. To create safer alternatives, multi-modality medical image translation aims to synthesize CE-MRI images from other available modalities. Although existing methods can generate promising predictions, they still face two challenges, i.e., exhibiting over-confidence and lacking interpretability on predictions. To address the above challenges, this paper introduces TrustI2I, a novel trustworthy method that reformulates multi-to-one medical image translation problem as a multimodal regression problem, aiming to build an uncertainty-aware and reliable system. Specifically, our method leverages deep evidential regression to estimate prediction uncertainties and employs an explicit intermediate and late fusion strategy based on the Mixture of Normal Inverse Gamma (MoNIG) distribution, enhancing both synthesis quality and interpretability. Additionally, we incorporate uncertainty calibration to improve the reliability of uncertainty. Validation on the BraTS2018 dataset demonstrates that our approach surpasses current methods, producing higher-quality images with rational uncertainty estimation.</description>

      <title>Swin SMT: Global Sequential Modeling in 3D Medical Image Segmentation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.07514</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.07514v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent advances in Vision Transformers (ViTs) have significantly enhanced medical image segmentation by facilitating the learning of global relationships. However, these methods face a notable challenge in capturing diverse local and global long-range sequential feature representations, particularly evident in whole-body CT (WBCT) scans. To overcome this limitation, we introduce Swin Soft Mixture Transformer (Swin SMT), a novel architecture based on Swin UNETR. This model incorporates a Soft Mixture-of-Experts (Soft MoE) to effectively handle complex and diverse long-range dependencies. The use of Soft MoE allows for scaling up model parameters maintaining a balance between computational complexity and segmentation performance in both training and inference modes. We evaluate Swin SMT on the publicly available TotalSegmentator-V2 dataset, which includes 117 major anatomical structures in WBCT images. Comprehensive experimental results demonstrate that Swin SMT outperforms several state-of-the-art methods in 3D anatomical structure segmentation, achieving an average Dice Similarity Coefficient of 85.09%. The code and pre-trained weights of Swin SMT are publicly available at https://github.com/MI2DataLab/SwinSMT.</description>

      <title>HDKD: Hybrid Data-Efficient Knowledge Distillation Network for Medical Image Classification</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.07516</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.07516v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Vision Transformers (ViTs) have achieved significant advancement in computer vision tasks due to their powerful modeling capacity. However, their performance notably degrades when trained with insufficient data due to lack of inherent inductive biases. Distilling knowledge and inductive biases from a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) teacher has emerged as an effective strategy for enhancing the generalization of ViTs on limited datasets. Previous approaches to Knowledge Distillation (KD) have pursued two primary paths: some focused solely on distilling the logit distribution from CNN teacher to ViT student, neglecting the rich semantic information present in intermediate features due to the structural differences between them. Others integrated feature distillation along with logit distillation, yet this introduced alignment operations that limits the amount of knowledge transferred due to mismatched architectures and increased the computational overhead. To this end, this paper presents Hybrid Data-efficient Knowledge Distillation (HDKD) paradigm which employs a CNN teacher and a hybrid student. The choice of hybrid student serves two main aspects. First, it leverages the strengths of both convolutions and transformers while sharing the convolutional structure with the teacher model. Second, this shared structure enables the direct application of feature distillation without any information loss or additional computational overhead. Additionally, we propose an efficient light-weight convolutional block named Mobile Channel-Spatial Attention (MBCSA), which serves as the primary convolutional block in both teacher and student models. Extensive experiments on two medical public datasets showcase the superiority of HDKD over other state-of-the-art models and its computational efficiency.

      <title>Parameter Efficient Fine Tuning for Multi-scanner PET to PET Reconstruction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.07517</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.07517v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Reducing scan time in Positron Emission Tomography (PET) imaging while maintaining high-quality images is crucial for minimizing patient discomfort and radiation exposure. Due to the limited size of datasets and distribution discrepancy across scanners in medical imaging, fine-tuning in a parameter-efficient and effective manner is on the rise. Motivated by the potential of Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning (PEFT), we aim to address these issues by effectively leveraging PEFT to improve limited data and GPU resource issues in multi-scanner setups. In this paper, we introduce PETITE, Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning for MultI-scanner PET to PET REconstruction that uses fewer than 1% of the parameters. To the best of our knowledge, this study is the first to systematically explore the efficacy of diverse PEFT techniques in medical imaging reconstruction tasks via prevalent encoder-decoder-type deep models. This investigation, in particular, brings intriguing insights into PETITE as we show further improvements by treating encoder and decoder separately and mixing different PEFT methods, namely, Mix-PEFT. Using multi-scanner PET datasets comprised of five different scanners, we extensively test the cross-scanner PET scan time reduction performances (i.e., a model pre-trained on one scanner is fine-tuned on a different scanner) of 21 feasible Mix-PEFT combinations to derive optimal PETITE. We show that training with less than 1% parameters using PETITE performs on par with full fine-tuning (i.e., 100% parameter)</description>

      <title>Federated Foundation Model for Cardiac CT Imaging</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.07557</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.07557v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Federated learning (FL) is a renowned technique for utilizing decentralized data while preserving privacy. However, real-world applications often involve inherent challenges such as partially labeled datasets, where not all clients possess expert annotations of all labels of interest, leaving large portions of unlabeled data unused. In this study, we conduct the largest federated cardiac CT imaging analysis to date, focusing on partially labeled datasets ($n=8,124$) of Transcatheter Aortic Valve Implantation (TAVI) patients over eight hospital clients. Transformer architectures, which are the major building blocks of current foundation models, have shown superior performance when trained on larger cohorts than traditional CNNs. However, when trained on small task-specific labeled sample sizes, it is currently not feasible to exploit their underlying attention mechanism for improved performance. Therefore, we developed a two-stage semi-supervised learning strategy that distills knowledge from several task-specific CNNs (landmark detection and segmentation of calcification) into a single transformer model by utilizing large amounts of unlabeled data typically residing unused in hospitals to mitigate these issues. This method not only improves the predictive accuracy and generalizability of transformer-based architectures but also facilitates the simultaneous learning of all partial labels within a single transformer model across the federation. Additionally, we show that our transformer-based model extracts more meaningful features for further downstream tasks than the UNet-based one by only training the last layer to also solve segmentation of coronary arteries. We make the code and weights of the final model openly available, which can serve as a foundation model for further research in cardiac CT imaging.</description>

      <title>Few-Shot Domain Adaptive Object Detection for Microscopic Images</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.07633</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.07633v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In recent years, numerous domain adaptive strategies have been proposed to help deep learning models overcome the challenges posed by domain shift. However, even unsupervised domain adaptive strategies still require a large amount of target data. Medical imaging datasets are often characterized by class imbalance and scarcity of labeled and unlabeled data. Few-shot domain adaptive object detection (FSDAOD) addresses the challenge of adapting object detectors to target domains with limited labeled data. Existing works struggle with randomly selected target domain images that may not accurately represent the real population, resulting in overfitting to small validation sets and poor generalization to larger test sets. Medical datasets exhibit high class imbalance and background similarity, leading to increased false positives and lower mean Average Precision (map) in target domains. To overcome these challenges, we propose a novel FSDAOD strategy for microscopic imaging. Our contributions include a domain adaptive class balancing strategy for few-shot scenarios, multi-layer instance-level inter and intra-domain alignment to enhance similarity between class instances regardless of domain, and an instance-level classification loss applied in the middle layers of the object detector to enforce feature retention necessary for correct classification across domains. Extensive experimental results with competitive baselines demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach, achieving state-of-the-art results on two public microscopic datasets.

      <title>SvANet: A Scale-variant Attention-based Network for Small Medical Object Segmentation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.07720v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Early detection and accurate diagnosis can predict the risk of malignant disease transformation, thereby increasing the probability of effective treatment. A mild syndrome with small infected regions is an ominous warning and is foremost in the early diagnosis of diseases. Deep learning algorithms, such as convolutional neural networks (CNNs), have been used to segment natural or medical objects, showing promising results. However, analyzing medical objects of small areas in images remains a challenge due to information losses and compression defects caused by convolution and pooling operations in CNNs. These losses and defects become increasingly significant as the network deepens, particularly for small medical objects. To address these challenges, we propose a novel scale-variant attention-based network (SvANet) for accurate small-scale object segmentation in medical images. The SvANet consists of Monte Carlo attention, scale-variant attention, and vision transformer, which incorporates cross-scale features and alleviates compression artifacts for enhancing the discrimination of small medical objects. Quantitative experimental results demonstrate the superior performance of SvANet, achieving 96.12%, 96.11%, 89.79%, 84.15%, 80.25%, 73.05%, and 72.58% in mean Dice coefficient for segmenting kidney tumors, skin lesions, hepatic tumors, polyps, surgical excision cells, retinal vasculatures, and sperms, which occupy less than 1% of the image areas in KiTS23, ISIC 2018, ATLAS, PolypGen, TissueNet, FIVES, and SpermHealth datasets, respectively.</description>

      <title>Serial coherent diffraction imaging of dynamic samples based on inter-frame constraint</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.07318</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.07318v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We proposed a novel approach to coherent imaging of dynamic samples. The inter-frame similarity of the sample's local structures is found to be a powerful constraint in phasing a sequence of diffraction patterns. We devised a new image reconstruction algorithm that exploits this inter-frame constraint enabled by an adaptive similar region determination approach. We demonstrated the feasibility of this technique in visible light experiments with various real samples, achieving reconstructions of good quality within a few hundred iterations. With a setup as simple as conventional coherent diffraction imaging but with much-improved convergence and robustness to missing data and noise, our method is expected to enrich X-ray imaging techniques and electron microscopy, offering a new tool for dynamics studies.</description>

      <title>MNeRV: A Multilayer Neural Representation for Videos</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.07347</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.07347v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: As a novel video representation method, Neural Representations for Videos (NeRV) has shown great potential in the fields of video compression, video restoration, and video interpolation. In the process of representing videos using NeRV, each frame corresponds to an embedding, which is then reconstructed into a video frame sequence after passing through a small number of decoding layers (E-NeRV, HNeRV, etc.). However, this small number of decoding layers can easily lead to the problem of redundant model parameters due to the large proportion of parameters in a single decoding layer, which greatly restricts the video regression ability of neural network models. In this paper, we propose a multilayer neural representation for videos (MNeRV) and design a new decoder M-Decoder and its matching encoder M-Encoder. MNeRV has more encoding and decoding layers, which effectively alleviates the problem of redundant model parameters caused by too few layers. In addition, we design MNeRV blocks to perform more uniform and effective parameter allocation between decoding layers. In the field of video regression reconstruction, we achieve better reconstruction quality (+4.06 PSNR) with fewer parameters. Finally, we showcase MNeRV performance in downstream tasks such as video restoration and video interpolation. The source code of MNeRV is available at https://github.com/Aaronbtb/MNeRV.</description>

      <title>Standard compliant video coding using low complexity, switchable neural wrappers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.07395</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.07395v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The proliferation of high resolution videos posts great storage and bandwidth pressure on cloud video services, driving the development of next-generation video codecs. Despite great progress made in neural video coding, existing approaches are still far from economical deployment considering the complexity and rate-distortion performance tradeoff. To clear the roadblocks for neural video coding, in this paper we propose a new framework featuring standard compatibility, high performance, and low decoding complexity. We employ a set of jointly optimized neural pre- and post-processors, wrapping a standard video codec, to encode videos at different resolutions. The rate-distorion optimal downsampling ratio is signaled to the decoder at the per-sequence level for each target rate. We design a low complexity neural post-processor architecture that can handle different upsampling ratios. The change of resolution exploits the spatial redundancy in high-resolution videos, while the neural wrapper further achieves rate-distortion performance improvement through end-to-end optimization with a codec proxy. Our light-weight post-processor architecture has a complexity of 516 MACs / pixel, and achieves 9.3% BD-Rate reduction over VVC on the UVG dataset, and 6.4% on AOM CTC Class A1. Our approach has the potential to further advance the performance of the latest video coding standards using neural processing with minimal added complexity.</description>

      <title>VEnhancer: Generative Space-Time Enhancement for Video Generation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.07667</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.07667v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present VEnhancer, a generative space-time enhancement framework that improves the existing text-to-video results by adding more details in spatial domain and synthetic detailed motion in temporal domain. Given a generated low-quality video, our approach can increase its spatial and temporal resolution simultaneously with arbitrary up-sampling space and time scales through a unified video diffusion model. Furthermore, VEnhancer effectively removes generated spatial artifacts and temporal flickering of generated videos. To achieve this, basing on a pretrained video diffusion model, we train a video ControlNet and inject it to the diffusion model as a condition on low frame-rate and low-resolution videos. To effectively train this video ControlNet, we design space-time data augmentation as well as video-aware conditioning. Benefiting from the above designs, VEnhancer yields to be stable during training and shares an elegant end-to-end training manner. Extensive experiments show that VEnhancer surpasses existing state-of-the-art video super-resolution and space-time super-resolution methods in enhancing AI-generated videos. Moreover, with VEnhancer, exisiting open-source state-of-the-art text-to-video method, VideoCrafter-2, reaches the top one in video generation benchmark -- VBench.</description>

      <title>Functional Assessment of Cerebral Capillaries using Single Capillary Reporters in Ultrasound Localization Microscopy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.07857</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.07857v2 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The brain's microvascular cerebral capillary network plays a vital role in maintaining neuronal health, yet capillary dynamics are still not well understood due to limitations in existing imaging techniques. Here, we present Single Capillary Reporters (SCaRe) for transcranial Ultrasound Localization Microscopy (ULM), a novel approach enabling non-invasive, whole-brain mapping of single capillaries and estimates of their transit-time as a neurovascular biomarker. We accomplish this first through computational Monte Carlo and ultrasound simulations of microbubbles flowing through a fully-connected capillary network. We unveil distinct capillary flow behaviors which informs methodological changes to ULM acquisitions to better capture capillaries in vivo. Subsequently, applying SCaRe-ULM in vivo, we achieve unprecedented visualization of single capillary tracks across brain regions, analysis of layer-specific capillary heterogeneous transit times (CHT), and characterization of whole microbubble trajectories from arterioles to venules. Lastly, we evaluate capillary biomarkers using injected lipopolysaccharide to induce systemic neuroinflammation and track the increase in SCaRe-ULM CHT, demonstrating the capability to detect subtle capillary functional changes. SCaRe-ULM represents a significant advance in studying microvascular dynamics, offering novel avenues for investigating capillary patterns in neurological disorders and potential diagnostic applications.</description>

      <title>Online Video Quality Enhancement with Spatial-Temporal Look-up Tables</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.13616</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.13616v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Low latency rates are crucial for online video-based applications, such as video conferencing and cloud gaming, which make improving video quality in online scenarios increasingly important. However, existing quality enhancement methods are limited by slow inference speed and the requirement for temporal information contained in future frames, making it challenging to deploy them directly in online tasks. In this paper, we propose a novel method, STLVQE, specifically designed to address the rarely studied online video quality enhancement (Online-VQE) problem. Our STLVQE designs a new VQE framework which contains a Module-Agnostic Feature Extractor that greatly reduces the redundant computations and redesign the propagation, alignment, and enhancement module of the network. A Spatial-Temporal Look-up Tables (STL) is proposed, which extracts spatial-temporal information in videos while saving substantial inference time. To the best of our knowledge, we are the first to exploit the LUT structure to extract temporal information in video tasks. Extensive experiments on the MFQE 2.0 dataset demonstrate that our STLVQE achieves a satisfactory performance-speed trade-off.</description>

      <title>PhenDiff: Revealing Subtle Phenotypes with Diffusion Models in Real Images</title>

      <description>arXiv:2312.08290v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: For the past few years, deep generative models have increasingly been used in biological research for a variety of tasks. Recently, they have proven to be valuable for uncovering subtle cell phenotypic differences that are not directly discernible to the human eye. However, current methods employed to achieve this goal mainly rely on Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs). While effective, GANs encompass issues such as training instability and mode collapse, and they do not accurately map images back to the model's latent space, which is necessary to synthesize, manipulate, and thus interpret outputs based on real images. In this work, we introduce PhenDiff: a multi-class conditional method leveraging Diffusion Models (DMs) designed to identify shifts in cellular phenotypes by translating a real image from one condition to another. We qualitatively and quantitatively validate this method on cases where the phenotypic changes are visible or invisible, such as in low concentrations of drug treatments. Overall, PhenDiff represents a valuable tool for identifying cellular variations in real microscopy images. We anticipate that it could facilitate the understanding of diseases and advance drug discovery through the identification of novel biomarkers.</description>

      <title>MaskCRT: Masked Conditional Residual Transformer for Learned Video Compression</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.15829</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.15829v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Conditional coding has lately emerged as the mainstream approach to learned video compression. However, a recent study shows that it may perform worse than residual coding when the information bottleneck arises. Conditional residual coding was thus proposed, creating a new school of thought to improve on conditional coding. Notably, conditional residual coding relies heavily on the assumption that the residual frame has a lower entropy rate than that of the intra frame. Recognizing that this assumption is not always true due to dis-occlusion phenomena or unreliable motion estimates, we propose a masked conditional residual coding scheme. It learns a soft mask to form a hybrid of conditional coding and conditional residual coding in a pixel adaptive manner. We introduce a Transformer-based conditional autoencoder. Several strategies are investigated with regard to how to condition a Transformer-based autoencoder for inter-frame coding, a topic that is largely under-explored. Additionally, we propose a channel transform module (CTM) to decorrelate the image latents along the channel dimension, with the aim of using the simple hyperprior to approach similar compression performance to the channel-wise autoregressive model. Experimental results confirm the superiority of our masked conditional residual transformer (termed MaskCRT) to both conditional coding and conditional residual coding. On commonly used datasets, MaskCRT shows comparable BD-rate results to VTM-17.0 under the low delay P configuration in terms of PSNR-RGB and outperforms VTM-17.0 in terms of MS-SSIM-RGB. It also opens up a new research direction for advancing learned video compression.</description>

      <title>I2I-Mamba: Multi-modal medical image synthesis via selective state space modeling</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.14022v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In recent years, deep learning models comprising transformer components have pushed the performance envelope in medical image synthesis tasks. Contrary to convolutional neural networks (CNNs) that use static, local filters, transformers use self-attention mechanisms to permit adaptive, non-local filtering to sensitively capture long-range context. However, this sensitivity comes at the expense of substantial model complexity, which can compromise learning efficacy particularly on relatively modest-sized imaging datasets. Here, we propose a novel adversarial model for multi-modal medical image synthesis, I2I-Mamba, that leverages selective state space modeling (SSM) to efficiently capture long-range context while maintaining local precision. To do this, I2I-Mamba injects channel-mixed Mamba (cmMamba) blocks in the bottleneck of a convolutional backbone. In cmMamba blocks, SSM layers are used to learn context across the spatial dimension and channel-mixing layers are used to learn context across the channel dimension of feature maps. Comprehensive demonstrations are reported for imputing missing images in multi-contrast MRI and MRI-CT protocols. Our results indicate that I2I-Mamba offers superior performance against state-of-the-art CNN- and transformer-based methods in synthesizing target-modality images.</description>

Abstract: Diffusion MRI (dMRI) is an important neuroimaging technique with high acquisition costs. Deep learning approaches have been used to enhance dMRI and predict diffusion biomarkers through undersampled dMRI. To generate more comprehensive raw dMRI, generative adversarial network based methods are proposed to include b-values and b-vectors as conditions, but they are limited by unstable training and less desirable diversity. The emerging diffusion model (DM) promises to improve generative performance. However, it remains challenging to include essential information in conditioning DM for more relevant generation, i.e., the physical principles of dMRI and white matter tract structures. In this study, we propose a physics-guided diffusion model to generate high-quality dMRI. Our model introduces the physical principles of dMRI in the noise evolution in the diffusion process and introduce a query-based conditional mapping within the difussion model. In addition, to enhance the anatomical fine detials of the generation, we introduce the XTRACT atlas as prior of white matter tracts by adopting an adapter technique. Our experiment results show that our method outperforms other state-of-the-art methods and has the potential to advance dMRI enhancement.</description>

      <title>An efficient method to automate tooth identification and 3D bounding box extraction from Cone Beam CT Images</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.05892v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Accurate identification, localization, and segregation of teeth from Cone Beam Computed Tomography (CBCT) images are essential for analyzing dental pathologies. Modeling an individual tooth can be challenging and intricate to accomplish, especially when fillings and other restorations introduce artifacts. This paper proposes a method for automatically detecting, identifying, and extracting teeth from CBCT images. Our approach involves dividing the three-dimensional images into axial slices for image detection. Teeth are pinpointed and labeled using a single-stage object detector. Subsequently, bounding boxes are delineated and identified to create three-dimensional representations of each tooth. The proposed solution has been successfully integrated into the dental analysis tool Dentomo.</description>

      <title>A Clinical Benchmark of Public Self-Supervised Pathology Foundation Models</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.06508v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The use of self-supervised learning (SSL) to train pathology foundation models has increased substantially in the past few years. Notably, several models trained on large quantities of clinical data have been made publicly available in recent months. This will significantly enhance scientific research in computational pathology and help bridge the gap between research and clinical deployment. With the increase in availability of public foundation models of different sizes, trained using different algorithms on different datasets, it becomes important to establish a benchmark to compare the performance of such models on a variety of clinically relevant tasks spanning multiple organs and diseases. In this work, we present a collection of pathology datasets comprising clinical slides associated with clinically relevant endpoints including cancer diagnoses and a variety of biomarkers generated during standard hospital operation from two medical centers. We leverage these datasets to systematically assess the performance of public pathology foundation models and provide insights into best practices for training new foundation models and selecting appropriate pretrained models.</description>

      <title>Asymmetric Mask Scheme for Self-Supervised Real Image Denoising</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.06514v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In recent years, self-supervised denoising methods have gained significant success and become critically important in the field of image restoration. Among them, the blind spot network based methods are the most typical type and have attracted the attentions of a large number of researchers. Although the introduction of blind spot operations can prevent identity mapping from noise to noise, it imposes stringent requirements on the receptive fields in the network design, thereby limiting overall performance. To address this challenge, we propose a single mask scheme for self-supervised denoising training, which eliminates the need for blind spot operation and thereby removes constraints on the network structure design. Furthermore, to achieve denoising across entire image during inference, we propose a multi-mask scheme. Our method, featuring the asymmetric mask scheme in training and inference, achieves state-of-the-art performance on existing real noisy image datasets. All the source code will be made available to the public.</description>

      <title>AHDGAN: An Attention-Based Generator and Heterogeneous Dual-Discriminator Generative Adversarial Network for Infrared and Visible Image Fusion</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.15992v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Infrared and visible image fusion (IVIF) aims to preserve thermal radiation information from infrared images while integrating texture details from visible images. The differences that infrared images primarily express thermal radiation through image intensity while visible images mainly represent texture details via image gradients, has long been considered a significant obstacle to IVIF technology development. Existing dual-discriminator Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) use two identical discriminators to guide the model in learning different types of information. However, given the intrinsic differences between infrared and visible images, using two heterogeneous discriminators is more effective. This paper proposes a novel attention-based generator and heterogeneous dual-discriminator generative adversarial network (AHDGAN) for infrared and visible image fusion. Specifically, the model employs two structurally different discriminators to address the distinct learning needs of infrared and visible image information. These include a global discriminator for thermal radiation information and a Markovian discriminator for detailed information. Additionally, different multi-scale attention modules are introduced to help the discriminators focus better on their respective source images. Based on this, to integrate the learned information from different source images effectively, an attention mechanism is designed in the generator to construct an information fusion layer. This approach guides the model to learn thermal radiation information from infrared images while simultaneously capturing texture details from visible images. Extensive experiments on various public datasets demonstrate the superiority of our proposed AHDGAN over other state-of-the-art (SOTA) algorithms, highlighting its enhanced potential for practical applications.</description>

Abstract: Damage to road pavement can develop into cracks, potholes, spallings, and other issues posing significant challenges to the integrity, safety, and durability of the road structure. Detecting and monitoring the evolution of these damages is crucial for maintaining the condition and structural health of road infrastructure. In recent years, researchers have explored various data-driven methods for image-based damage detection in road monitoring applications. The field gained attention with the introduction of the Road Damage Detection Challenge (RDDC2018), encouraging competition in developing object detectors on street-view images from various countries. Leading teams have demonstrated the effectiveness of ensemble models, mostly based on the YOLO and Faster R-CNN series. Data augmentations have also shown benefits in object detection within the computer vision field, including transformations such as random flipping, cropping, cutting out patches, as well as cut-and-pasting object instances. Applying cut-and-paste augmentation to road damages appears to be a promising approach to increase data diversity. However, the standard cut-and-paste technique, which involves sampling an object instance from a random image and pasting it at a random location onto the target image, has demonstrated limited effectiveness for road damage detection. This method overlooks the location of the road and disregards the difference in perspective between the sampled damage and the target image, resulting in unrealistic augmented images. In this work, we propose an improved Cut-and-Paste augmentation technique that is both content-aware (i.e. considers the true location of the road in the image) and perspective-aware (i.e. takes into account the difference in perspective between the injected damage and the target image).</description>

      <title>Identity-enabled CDMA LiDAR for massively parallel ranging with a single-element receiver</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.06918v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Light detection and ranging (LiDAR) have emerged as a crucial tool for high-resolution 3D imaging, particularly in autonomous vehicles, remote sensing, and augmented reality. However, the increasing demand for faster acquisition speed and higher resolution in LiDAR systems has highlighted the limitations of traditional mechanical scanning methods. This study introduces a novel wavelength-multiplexed code-division multiple access (CDMA) parallel laser ranging approach with a single-pixel receiver to address these challenges. By leveraging the unique properties of Gold-sequences in a direct-sequence spread spectrum (DSSS) framework, our design enables comprehensive parallelization in detection and ranging activities to significantly enhance system efficiency and user capacity. The proposed coaxial architecture simplifies hardware requirements using a single avalanche photodiode (APD) for multi-reception, reducing susceptibility to ambient noise and external interferences. We demonstrate 3D imaging at 5 m and 10 m, and the experimental results highlight the capability of our CDMA LiDAR system to achieve 40 parallel ranging channels with centimeter-level depth resolution and an angular resolution of 0.03 degree. Furthermore, our system allows for user identification modulation, enabling identity-based ranging among different users. The robustness of our proposed system against interference and speckle noise and near-far signal problems, combined with its potential for miniaturization and integration into chip-scale optics, presents a promising avenue to develop high-performance, compact LiDAR systems suitable for commercial applications.</description>

Abstract: Low-Light Image Enhancement (LLIE) has advanced with the surge in phone photography demand, yet many existing methods neglect compression, a crucial concern for resource-constrained phone photography. Most LLIE methods overlook this, hindering their effectiveness. In this study, we investigate the effects of JPEG compression on low-light images and reveal substantial information loss caused by JPEG due to widespread low pixel values in dark areas. Hence, we propose the Compression-Aware Pre-trained Transformer (CAPformer), employing a novel pre-training strategy to learn lossless information from uncompressed low-light images. Additionally, the proposed Brightness-Guided Self-Attention (BGSA) mechanism enhances rational information gathering. Experiments demonstrate the superiority of our approach in mitigating compression effects on LLIE, showcasing its potential for improving LLIE in resource-constrained scenarios.</description>
