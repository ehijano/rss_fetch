      <title>Detecting Causality with Conjugation Quandles over Dihedral Groups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.03544</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.03544v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study whether quandle colorings can detect causality of events for links realized as skies in a $(2+1)$-dimensional globally hyperbolic spacetime $X$. Building off the Allen--Swenberg paper in which their $2$-sky link was conjectured to be causally related, they showed that the Alexander--Conway polynomial does not distinguish that link from the connected sum of two Hopf links, corresponding to two causally unrelated events. We ask whether the Alexander--Conway polynomial together with different types of quandle invariants suffice. We show that the conjugation quandle of the dihedral group $D_5$, together with the Alexander--Conway polynomial, does distinguish the two links and hence likely does detect causality in $X$. The $2$-sky link shares the same Alexander--Conway polynomial but has different $D_5$ conjugation-quandle counting invariants. Moreover, for $D_5$ the counting invariant alone already separates the pair, whereas for other small dihedral groups $D_3$, $D_4$, $D_6$, $D_7$ even the enhanced counting polynomial fails to detect causality. In fact we prove more that the conjugation quandle over D5 distinguishes all the infinitely many Allen-Swenberg links from the connected sum of two Hopf links. These results present an interesting reality where only the conjugation quandle over $D_5$ coupled with the Alexander--Conway polynomial can detect causality in $(2+1)$ dimensions. This results in a simple, computable quandle that can determine causality via the counting invariant alone, rather than reaching for more complicated counting polynomials and cocycles.</description>

      <title>Johnson homomorphisms and the second rational cohomology of handlebody Torelli groups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.03742</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.03742v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce two Torelli subgroups of the handlebody group. The group $HI_{g,p}^b$ is the subgroup of the handlebody group acting trivially on the first homology of the boundary surface, and $H_B I_{g,p}^b$ is the subgroup of the handlebody group acting trivially on the first homology of the handlebody. Using the symplectic representation and the Johnson homomorphisms for the Torelli subgroups of the mapping class group and of $\operatorname{Aut}(F_g)$, we define abelian quotients of these handlebody Torelli groups. In terms of the representation theory of the special linear group, we describe cup products of two classes in the first rational cohomology groups of $HI_{g,p}^b$ and $H_B I_{g,p}^b$ obtained by the rational duals of these abelian quotients.</description>

      <title>Finiteness of purely cosmetic fillings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.03788</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.03788v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A pair of Dehn fillings on a compact, orientable 3-manifold with a torus boundary is said to be purely cosmetic if the resulting 3-manifolds are orientation-preservingly homeomorphic. In this paper, we show that if the torus boundary is incompressible, then there are only finitely many pairs of purely cosmetic fillings.</description>

      <title>On the number of components of folds of image simple fold maps</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.03878</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.03878v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A smooth map between manifolds is said to be \emph{image simple} if its restriction to its singular point set is a topological embedding. We study the parity of the number of connected components of the singular point set for image simple fold maps from a closed manifold of dimension $\ge 2$ to a surface. It is known that this parity is a homotopy invariant when the source manifold is of even dimension and the target surface is orientable. In this paper we show that for an arbitrary image simple fold map from a closed odd-dimensional manifold of dimension $\ge 3$ to a (possibly non-orientable) surface, this parity is not a homotopy invariant. We give two constructive proofs: one uses techniques from open book decompositions and round fold maps, and the other uses allowable moves. The constructed homotopies add one new component to the singular point set. We also give a new proof of the homotopy invariance of the parity of the number of connected components of the singular point set for image simple fold maps from a closed even-dimensional manifold to an orientable surface together with an example showing that this does not hold for maps into non-orientable surfaces in general.</description>

      <title>The linear minimal 4-chart with three crossings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.04114</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.04114v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Charts are oriented labeled graphs in a disk. Any simple surface braid (2-dimensional braid) can be described by using a chart. Also, a chart represents an oriented closed surface embedded in 4-space. In this paper, we investigate embedded surfaces in 4-space by using charts.
  Let $\Gamma$ be a chart, and we denote by $Cross(\Gamma)$ the set of all the crossings of $\Gamma$, and we denote by $\Gamma_m$ the union of all the edges of label $m$. For a 4-chart $\Gamma$, if the closure of each connected component of the set $(\Gamma_1\cup \Gamma_3)-Cross(\Gamma)$ is acyclic, then $\Gamma$ is said to be {\it linear}. In this paper, we shall show that any linear minimal $4$-chart with three crossings is lor-equivalent (Label-Orientation-Reflection equivalent) to the chart describing a $2$-twist spun trefoil knot by omitting free edges and hoops.</description>

      <title>Quantum Cocycle Invariants of Knots from Yang-Baxter Cohomology</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.04267</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.04267v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Yang-Baxter operators (YBOs) have been employed to construct quantum knot invariants. More recently, cohomology theories for YBOs have been independently developed, drawing inspiration from analogous theories for quandles and other discrete algebraic structures. Quandle cohomology, in particular, gives rise to cocycle invariants for knots via $2$-cocycles, which are closely related to quandle extensions, and knotted surfaces via $3$-cocycles. These quandle cocycle knot invariants have also been shown to admit interpretations as quantum invariants. Similarly, $2$-cocycles in Yang-Baxter cohomology can be interpreted in terms of deformations of YBOs. Building on these parallels, we introduce quantum cocycle invariants of knots using $2$-cocycles of Yang-Baxter cohomology, from the perspective of deformation theory. In particular, we demonstrate that the quandle cocycle invariant can be interpreted in this framework, while the quantum version yields stronger invariants in certain examples. We develop our theory along two primary approaches to quantum invariants: via trace constructions and through (co)pairings. Explicit examples are provided, including those based on the Kauffman bracket. Furthermore, we show that both the Jones and Alexander polynomials can be derived within this framework as invariants arising from higher-order formal Laurent polynomial deformations via Yang-Baxter cohomology.</description>

      <title>Volume comparison on finite-volume hyperbolic 3-manifolds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.03566</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.03566v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: On finite-volume hyperbolic $3$-manifolds, we compare volumes of different metrics using the exponential convergence of Ricci-DeTurck flow toward the hyperbolic metric $h_0$. We prove that among metrics with scalar curvature bounded below by $-6$, $h_0$ minimizes the volume. Moreover, for metrics that are either uniformly $C^2$-close to $h_0$ or asymptotically cusped of order at least two, equality holds if and only if the metric is isometric to $h_0$.</description>

      <title>Finite Index Rigidity of Relatively Hyperbolic Groups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.04323</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.04323v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We prove that, given a torsion-free relatively hyperbolic group G with non-relatively-hyperbolic peripherals, isomorphic finite index subgroups of G have the same index. This applies for instance to fundamental groups of finite-volume negatively curved manifolds, to limit groups, and to free-by-cyclic groups. More generally, we show that if two finite index subgroups of a relatively hyperbolic group are isomorphic via a map that respects their peripheral structures, then their indices in the ambient group are equal. The proof relies on demonstrating that the number of simplices in a simplicial classifying space of a finite index subgroup in a relatively hyperbolic group grows linearly with its index. These results generalize earlier work of the first author in the context of hyperbolic groups.</description>

      <title>Milnor's invariants for knots and links in closed orientable 3-manifolds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.10918</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.10918v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In his 1957 paper, John Milnor introduced a collection of invariants for links in $S^3$ detecting higher-order linking phenomena by studying lower central quotients of link groups and comparing them to those of the unlink. These invariants, now known as Milnor's $\overline{\mu}$-invariants, were later shown to be topological link concordance invariants and have since inspired decades of consequential research. Milnor's invariants have many interpretations, and there have been numerous attempts to extend them to other settings. In this paper, we extend Milnor's invariants to topological concordance invariants of knots and links in general closed orientable 3-manifolds. These invariants unify and generalize all previous versions of Milnor's invariants in dimension 3, including Milnor's original invariants for links in $S^3$.</description>

      <title>Toward Riemannian diffeology</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.04170</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.04170v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We introduce a framework for Riemannian diffeology. To this end, we use the tangent functor in the sense of Blohmann and one of the options of a metric on a diffeological space in the sense of Iglesias-Zemmour. As a consequence, the category consisting of weak Riemannian diffeological spaces and isometries is established. With a technical condition for a definite weak Riemannian metric, we show that the psudodistance induced by the metric is indeed a distance. As examples of weak Riemannian diffeological spaces, an adjunction space of manifolds, a space of smooth maps and the mixed one are considered.</description>
