      <title>Making Software FAIR: A machine-assisted workflow for the research software lifecycle</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.10415</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.10415v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A key issue hindering discoverability, attribution and reusability of open research software is that its existence often remains hidden within the manuscript of research papers. For these resources to become first-class bibliographic records, they first need to be identified and subsequently registered with persistent identifiers (PIDs) to be made FAIR (Findable, Accessible, Interoperable and Reusable). To this day, much open research software fails to meet FAIR principles and software resources are mostly not explicitly linked from the manuscripts that introduced them or used them. SoFAIR is a 2-year international project (2024-2025) which proposes a solution to the above problem realised over the content available through the global network of open repositories. SoFAIR will extend the capabilities of widely used open scholarly infrastructures (CORE, Software Heritage, HAL) and tools (GROBID) operated by the consortium partners, delivering and deploying an effective solution for the management of the research software lifecycle, including: 1) ML-assisted identification of research software assets from within the manuscripts of scholarly papers, 2) validation of the identified assets by authors, 3) registration of software assets with PIDs and their archival.</description>

      <title>A bibliometric analysis of Canadian LIS scholars and practitioners' research contributions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.10892</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.10892v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Canada's research productivity in Library and Information Science (LIS) is significant: studies have found that Canada ranks third globally in terms of output. As the LIS field continues to grow, the pace of output accelerates, and the scope of this work expands. The recently launched Canadian Publications in Library and Information Science Database compiles all Canadian scientific publications, including those authored by faculty members and academic librarians. This database offers the advantage of encompassing articles and librarian publications that may not be typically included in traditional bibliometric surveys, such as those conducted using databases like Web of Science, Scopus, and Library and Information Science Abstracts (LISA). Using this data, this study maps the scholarly contributions of Canadian LIS scholars and academic librarians to the field of LIS and examines whether Canadian LIS research is characterized by silos. This paper examines the similarities and differences in research output, impact, topics, and publication venues between academic librarians and scholars in Canada, as well as the extent to which academics and practitioners engage in research collaborations or reference each other's work. We find that while there is some degree of overlap in research topics and publication venues between LIS academics and academic librarians, the two groups appear to act as distinct research communities with distinct topical foci and publishing habits. The two groups also do not appear to engage with each other strongly, either through collaboration or citing each other's work.</description>

      <title>Societal citations undermine the function of the science reward system</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.10990</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.10990v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Citations in the scientific literature system do not simply reflect relationships between knowledge but are influenced by non-objective and societal factors. Citation bias, irresponsible citation, and citation manipulation are widespread and have become a serious and growing problem. However, it has been difficult to assess the consequences of mixing societal factors into the literature system because there was no observable literature system unmixed with societal factors for comparison. In this paper, we construct a mathematical theorem network, representing a logic-based and objective knowledge system, to address this problem. By comparing the mathematical theorem network and the scientific citation networks, we find that these two types of networks are significantly different in their structure and function. In particular, the reward function in citation networks is impaired: The scientific citation network fails to provide more recognition for more disruptive results, while the mathematical theorem network can achieve. We develop a network generation model that can create two types of links$\unicode{x2014}$logical and societal$\unicode{x2014}$to account for these differences. The model parameter $q$, which we call the human influence factor, can control the number of societal links and thus regulate the degree of mixing of societal factors in the networks. Under this design, the model successfully reproduces the differences among real networks. These results suggest that the presence of societal factors undermines the function of the scientific reward system. To improve the status quo, we advocate for reforming the reference list format in papers, urging journals to require authors to separately disclose logical references and social references.</description>

      <title>Leveraging Large Language Models for Realizing Truly Intelligent User Interfaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.12221</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.12221v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The number of published scholarly articles is growing at a significant rate, making scholarly knowledge organization increasingly important. Various approaches have been proposed to organize scholarly information, including describing scholarly knowledge semantically leveraging knowledge graphs. Transforming unstructured knowledge, presented within articles, to structured and semantically represented knowledge generally requires human intelligence and labor since natural language processing methods alone typically do not render sufficient precision and recall for many applications. With the recent developments of Large Language Models (LLMs), it becomes increasingly possible to provide truly intelligent user interfaces guiding humans in the transformation process. We present an approach to integrate non-intrusive LLMs guidance into existing user interfaces. More specifically, we integrate LLM-supported user interface components into an existing scholarly knowledge infrastructure. Additionally, we provide our experiences with LLM integration, detailing best practices and obstacles. Finally, we evaluate the approach using a small-scale user evaluation with domain experts.</description>
