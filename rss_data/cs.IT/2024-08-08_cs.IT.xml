      <title>Molecular Absorption-Aware User Assignment, Spectrum, and Power Allocation in Dense THz Networks with Multi-Connectivity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.03451</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.03451v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper develops a unified framework to maximize the network sum-rate in a multi-user, multi-BS downlink terahertz (THz) network by optimizing user associations, number and bandwidth of sub-bands in a THz transmission window (TW), bandwidth of leading and trailing edge-bands in a TW, sub-band assignment, and power allocations. The proposed framework incorporates multi-connectivity and captures the impact of molecular absorption coefficient variations in a TW, beam-squint, molecular absorption noise, and link blockages. To make the problem tractable, we first propose a convex approximation of the molecular absorption coefficient using curve fitting in a TW, determine the feasible bandwidths of the leading and trailing edge-bands, and then derive closed-form optimal solution for the number of sub-bands considering beam-squint constraints. We then decompose joint user associations, sub-band assignment, and power allocation problem into two sub-problems, i.e., \textbf{(i)} joint user association and sub-band assignment, and \textbf{(ii)} power allocation. To solve the former problem, we analytically prove the unimodularity of the constraint matrix which enables us to relax the integer constraint without loss of optimality. To solve power allocation sub-problem, a fractional programming (FP)-based centralized solution as well as an alternating direction method of multipliers (ADMM)-based light-weight distributed solution is proposed. The overall problem is then solved using alternating optimization until convergence. Complexity analysis of the algorithms and numerical convergence are presented. Numerical findings validate the effectiveness of the proposed algorithms and extract useful insights about the interplay of the density of base stations (BSs), Average order of multi-connectivity (AOM), molecular absorption, {hardware impairment}, {imperfect CSI}, and link blockages.</description>

      <title>Real time parameter estimation for adaptive OFDM/OTFS selection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.03460</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.03460v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Future wireless communication systems must simultaneously address multiple challenges to ensure accurate data detection, deliver high Quality of Service (QoS), adding enable a high data transmission with low system design. Additionally, they need to reduce energy consumption and latency without increasing system complexity. Orthogonal Frequency Division Multiplexing (OFDM) is a commonly used waveform in 4G and 5G systems, it has limitations in handling significant delay and Doppler spread in high mobility scenarios. To overcome these weaknesses, a novel waveform named Orthogonal Time Frequency Space (OTFS) has been proposed, which aims to improve upon OFDM by closely matching signals to channel behavior. In this study, we propose a novel strategy that enables operators to dynamically select the best waveform based on estimated mobile user parameters. We use an Integrated Radar Sensing and Communication System (ISAC) to estimate delay and Doppler, as well as speed and range. This approach allows the base station to adapt to the mobile target, thereby enhancing the performance of wireless communication systems in high mobility and low complexity scenarios. Simulation results demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed approach and show that it outperforms existing methods.</description>

      <title>Limitations of the decoding-to-LPN reduction via code smoothing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.03742</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.03742v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Learning Parity with Noise (LPN) problem underlines several classic cryptographic primitives. Researchers have endeavored to demonstrate the algorithmic difficulty of this problem by attempting to find a reduction from the decoding problem of linear codes, for which several hardness results exist. Earlier studies used code smoothing as a technical tool to achieve such reductions, showing that they are possible for codes with vanishing rate. This has left open the question of attaining a reduction with positive-rate codes. Addressing this case, we characterize the efficiency of the reduction in terms of the parameters of the decoding and LPN problems. As a conclusion, we isolate the parameter regimes for which a meaningful reduction is possible and the regimes for which its existence is unlikely.</description>

      <title>A Versatile Pilot Design Scheme for FDD Systems Utilizing Gaussian Mixture Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.03756</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.03756v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, we propose a Gaussian mixture model (GMM)-based pilot design scheme for downlink (DL) channel estimation in single- and multi-user multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) frequency division duplex (FDD) systems. In an initial offline phase, the GMM captures prior information during training, which is then utilized for pilot design. In the single-user case, the GMM is utilized to construct a codebook of pilot matrices and, once shared with the mobile terminal (MT), can be employed to determine a feedback index at the MT. This index selects a pilot matrix from the constructed codebook, eliminating the need for online pilot optimization. We further establish a sum conditional mutual information (CMI)-based pilot optimization framework for multi-user MIMO (MU-MIMO) systems. Based on the established framework, we utilize the GMM for pilot matrix design in MU-MIMO systems. The analytic representation of the GMM enables the adaptation to any signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) level and pilot configuration without re-training. Additionally, an adaption to any number of MTs is facilitated. Extensive simulations demonstrate the superior performance of the proposed pilot design scheme compared to state-of-the-art approaches. The performance gains can be exploited, e.g., to deploy systems with fewer pilots.</description>

      <title>Trustworthy Image Semantic Communication with GenAI: Explainablity, Controllability, and Efficiency</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.03806</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.03806v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Image semantic communication (ISC) has garnered significant attention for its potential to achieve high efficiency in visual content transmission. However, existing ISC systems based on joint source-channel coding face challenges in interpretability, operability, and compatibility. To address these limitations, we propose a novel trustworthy ISC framework. This approach leverages text extraction and segmentation mapping techniques to convert images into explainable semantics, while employing Generative Artificial Intelligence (GenAI) for multiple downstream inference tasks. We also introduce a multi-rate ISC transmission protocol that dynamically adapts to both the received explainable semantic content and specific task requirements at the receiver. Simulation results demonstrate that our framework achieves explainable learning, decoupled training, and compatible transmission in various application scenarios. Finally, some intriguing research directions and application scenarios are identified.</description>

      <title>On Fast SC-based Polar Decoders: Metric Polarization and a Pruning Technique</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.03840</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.03840v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Short- to medium-block-length polar-like and polarization-adjusted convolutional (PAC) codes have demonstrated exceptional error-correction performance through sequential decoding. Successive cancellation list (SCL) decoding of polar-like and PAC codes can potentially match the performance of sequential decoding though a relatively large list size is often required. By benefiting from an optimal metric function, sequential decoding can find the correct path corresponding to the transmitted data by following almost one path on average at high Eb/N0 regimes. When considering a large number of paths in SCL decoding, a main bottleneck emerges that is the need for a rather expensive sorting operation at each level of decoding of data bits. In this paper, we propose a method to obtain the optimal metric function for each depth of the polarization tree through a process that we call polarization of the metric function. One of the major advantages of the proposed metric function is that it can be utilized in fast SC-based (FSC) and SCL-based (FSCL) decoders, i.e., decoders that opt to skip the so-called rate-1 and rate-0 nodes in the binary tree representation for significantly more efficient implementation. Furthermore, based on the average value of the polarized metric function of FSC-based decoders, we introduce a pruning technique that keeps only the paths whose metric values are close to the average value. As a result, our proposed technique significantly reduces the number of required sorting operations for FSCL-based decoding algorithms. For instance, for a high-rate PAC(128,99) code, SCL decoding with a list size of 32 achieves error-correction performance comparable to the Fano algorithm. Our method reduces the number of sorting operations of FSCL decoding to 33%, further decreasing latency.</description>

      <title>Sample Complexity of Low-rank Tensor Recovery from Uniformly Random Entries</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.03504</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.03504v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We show that a generic tensor $T\in \mathbb{F}^{n\times n\times \dots\times n}$ of order $k$ and CP rank $d$ can be uniquely recovered from $n\log n+dn\log \log n +o(n\log \log n) $ uniformly random entries with high probability if $d$ and $k$ are constant and $\mathbb{F}\in \{\mathbb{R},\mathbb{C}\}$. The bound is tight up to the coefficient of the second leading term and improves on the existing $O(n^{\frac{k}{2}}{\rm polylog}(n))$ upper bound for order $k$ tensors. The bound is obtained by showing that the projection of the Segre variety to a random axis-parallel linear subspace preserves $d$-identifiability with high probability if the dimension of the subspace is $n\log n+dn\log \log n +o(n\log \log n) $ and $n$ is sufficiently large.</description>

      <title>Bayes-optimal learning of an extensive-width neural network from quadratically many samples</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.03733</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.03733v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider the problem of learning a target function corresponding to a single hidden layer neural network, with a quadratic activation function after the first layer, and random weights. We consider the asymptotic limit where the input dimension and the network width are proportionally large. Recent work [Cui &amp; al '23] established that linear regression provides Bayes-optimal test error to learn such a function when the number of available samples is only linear in the dimension. That work stressed the open challenge of theoretically analyzing the optimal test error in the more interesting regime where the number of samples is quadratic in the dimension. In this paper, we solve this challenge for quadratic activations and derive a closed-form expression for the Bayes-optimal test error. We also provide an algorithm, that we call GAMP-RIE, which combines approximate message passing with rotationally invariant matrix denoising, and that asymptotically achieves the optimal performance. Technically, our result is enabled by establishing a link with recent works on optimal denoising of extensive-rank matrices and on the ellipsoid fitting problem. We further show empirically that, in the absence of noise, randomly-initialized gradient descent seems to sample the space of weights, leading to zero training loss, and averaging over initialization leads to a test error equal to the Bayes-optimal one.</description>

      <title>User-to-User Interference Mitigation in Dynamic TDD MIMO Systems with Multi-Antenna Users</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.03740</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.03740v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose a novel method for user-to-user interference (UUI) mitigation in dynamic time-division duplex multiple-input multiple-output communication systems with multi-antenna users. Specifically, we consider the downlink data transmission in the presence of UUI caused by a user that simultaneously transmits in uplink. Our method introduces an overhead for estimation of the user-to-user channels by transmitting pilots from the uplink user to the downlink users. Each downlink user obtains a channel estimate that is used to design a combining matrix for UUI mitigation. We analytically derive an achievable spectral efficiency for the downlink transmission in the presence of UUI with our mitigation technique. Through numerical simulations, we show that our method can significantly improve the spectral efficiency performance in cases of heavy UUI.</description>

      <title>Bi-Level Spatial and Channel-aware Transformer for Learned Image Compression</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.03842</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.03842v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recent advancements in learned image compression (LIC) methods have demonstrated superior performance over traditional hand-crafted codecs. These learning-based methods often employ convolutional neural networks (CNNs) or Transformer-based architectures. However, these nonlinear approaches frequently overlook the frequency characteristics of images, which limits their compression efficiency. To address this issue, we propose a novel Transformer-based image compression method that enhances the transformation stage by considering frequency components within the feature map. Our method integrates a novel Hybrid Spatial-Channel Attention Transformer Block (HSCATB), where a spatial-based branch independently handles high and low frequencies at the attention layer, and a Channel-aware Self-Attention (CaSA) module captures information across channels, significantly improving compression performance. Additionally, we introduce a Mixed Local-Global Feed Forward Network (MLGFFN) within the Transformer block to enhance the extraction of diverse and rich information, which is crucial for effective compression. These innovations collectively improve the transformation's ability to project data into a more decorrelated latent space, thereby boosting overall compression efficiency. Experimental results demonstrate that our framework surpasses state-of-the-art LIC methods in rate-distortion performance.</description>

      <title>A Low-Complexity Diversity-Preserving Universal Bit-Flipping Enhanced Hard Decision Decoder for Arbitrary Linear Codes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.03561</link>
      <description>arXiv:2304.03561v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: V2X (Vehicle-to-everything) communication relies on short messages for short-range transmissions over a fading wireless channel, yet requires high reliability and low latency.
  Hard-decision decoding sacrifices the preservation of diversity order, leading to pronounced performance degradation in fading channels. By contrast, soft-decision decoding retains diversity order, albeit at the cost of increased computational complexity.
  We introduce a novel enhanced hard-decision decoder termed as the Diversity Flip decoder (DFD) designed for preserving the diversity order. Moreover, it exhibits 'universal' applicability to all linear block codes. For a $\mathscr{C}(n,k)$ code having a minimum distance ${d_{\min}}$, the proposed decoder incurs a worst-case complexity order of $2^{({d_{\min}}-1)}-1$. Notably, for codes having low ${d_{\min}}$, this complexity represents a significant reduction compared to the popular soft and hard decision decoding algorithms. Due to its capability of maintaining diversity at a low complexity, it is eminently suitable for applications such as V2X (Vehicle-to-everything), IoT (Internet of Things), mMTC (Massive Machine type Communications), URLLC (Ultra-Reliable Low Latency Communications) and WBAN (Wireless Body Area Networks) for efficient decoding with favorable performance characteristics. The simulation results provided for various known codes and decoding algorithms validate the performance versus complexity benefits of the proposed decoder.</description>

      <title>Towards Atomic MIMO Receivers</title>

Abstract: The advancement of Rydberg atoms in quantum sensing is driving a paradigm shift from classical receivers to atomic receivers. Capitalizing on the extreme sensitivity of Rydberg atoms to external disturbance, atomic receivers can measure radio-waves more precisely than classical receivers to support high-performance wireless communication and sensing. Although the atomic receiver is developing rapidly in quantum-sensing domain, its integration with wireless communications is still at a nascent stage. Particularly, systematic methods to enhance communication performance through this integration are largely uncharted. Motivated by this observation, we propose to incorporate atomic receivers into multiple-input-multiple-output (MIMO) communication to implement atomic-MIMO receivers. Specifically, we establish the framework of atomic-MIMO receivers exploiting the principle of quantum sensing, and reveal that its signal detection is intrinsically a non-linear biased phase-retrieval (PR) problem, as opposed to the linear model in classical MIMO systems. To this end, we modify the Gerchberg-Saxton (GS) algorithm, a typical PR solver, with a biased GS algorithm to solve the discovered biased PR problem. Moreover, we propose an Expectation-Maximization-GS (EM-GS) algorithm by introducing a high-pass filter constructed by Bessel functions into the iteration of GS, which improves the detection accuracy efficiently. Finally, the effectiveness of atomic MIMO receivers is demonstrated by theoretical analysis and numerical simulation.</description>

      <title>The Support Designs of Several Families of Lifted Linear Codes</title>

Abstract: A generator matrix of a linear code $\C$ over $\gf(q)$ is also a matrix of the same rank $k$ over any extension field $\gf(q^\ell)$ and generates a linear code of the same length, same dimension and same minimum distance over $\gf(q^\ell)$, denoted by $\C(q|q^\ell)$ and called a lifted code of $\C$. Although $\C$ and their lifted codes $\C(q|q^\ell)$ have the same parameters, they have different weight distributions and different applications. Few results about lifted linear codes are known in the literature. This paper proves some fundamental theory for lifted linear codes, and studies the support $2$-designs of the lifted projective Reed-Muller codes, lifted Hamming codes and lifted Simplex codes. In addition, this paper settles the weight distributions of the lifted Reed-Muller codes of certain orders, and investigates the support $3$-designs of these lifted codes. As a by-product, an infinite family of three-weight projective codes over $\gf(4)$ is obtained.</description>

      <description>arXiv:1510.03045v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A random access code (RAC), corresponding to a communication primitive with various applications in quantum information theory, is an instance of a preparation-and-measurement scenario. In this work, we consider (n,d)-RACs constituting an "n"-length string, constructed from a "d" size set of letters, and send an encoding of the string in a single d-level physical system and present their quantum advantages. We first characterize optimal classical RACs, proving that the well-known classical strategy known as majority-encoding-identity-decoding is indeed optimal. We then construct a quantum protocol by exploiting only two incompatible measurements, the minimal requirement, and show the advantages beyond the classical one. We also discuss the generality of our results and whether quantum advantages are valid for all types of (n, d)-&gt;1 RACs.</description>

Abstract: Classical-quantum hybrid algorithms have recently garnered significant attention, which are characterized by combining quantum and classical computing protocols to obtain readout from quantum circuits of interest. Recent progress due to Lubasch et al in a 2019 paper provides readout for solutions to the Schrodinger and Inviscid Burgers equations, by making use of a new variational quantum algorithm (VQA) which determines the ground state of a cost function expressed with a superposition of expectation values and variational parameters. In the following, we analyze additional computational prospects in which the VQA can reliably produce solutions to other PDEs that are comparable to solutions that have been previously realized classically, which are characterized with noiseless quantum simulations. To determine the range of nonlinearities that the algorithm can process for other IVPs, we study several PDEs, first beginning with the Navier-Stokes equations and progressing to other equations underlying physical phenomena ranging from electromagnetism, gravitation, and wave propagation, from simulations of the Einstein, Boussniesq-type, Lin-Tsien, Camassa-Holm, Drinfeld-Sokolov-Wilson (DSW), and Hunter-Saxton equations. To formulate optimization routines that the VQA undergoes for numerical approximations of solutions that are obtained as readout from quantum circuits, cost functions corresponding to each PDE are provided in the supplementary section after which simulations results from hundreds of ZGR-QFT ansatzae are generated.</description>

      <title>$L^1$ Estimation: On the Optimality of Linear Estimators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.09129</link>
      <description>arXiv:2309.09129v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Consider the problem of estimating a random variable $X$ from noisy observations $Y = X+ Z$, where $Z$ is standard normal, under the $L^1$ fidelity criterion. It is well known that the optimal Bayesian estimator in this setting is the conditional median. This work shows that the only prior distribution on $X$ that induces linearity in the conditional median is Gaussian.
  Along the way, several other results are presented. In particular, it is demonstrated that if the conditional distribution $P_{X|Y=y}$ is symmetric for all $y$, then $X$ must follow a Gaussian distribution. Additionally, we consider other $L^p$ losses and observe the following phenomenon: for $p \in [1,2]$, Gaussian is the only prior distribution that induces a linear optimal Bayesian estimator, and for $p \in (2,\infty)$, infinitely many prior distributions on $X$ can induce linearity. Finally, extensions are provided to encompass noise models leading to conditional distributions from certain exponential families.</description>

      <title>Reinforcement Learning for Optimal Transmission of Markov Sources over Noisy Channels: Belief Quantization vs Sliding Finite Window Codes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.06742</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.06742v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the problem of zero-delay coding for the transmission a Markov source over a noisy channel with feedback and present a rigorous reinforcement theoretic solution which is guaranteed to achieve near-optimality. To this end, we formulate the problem as a Markov decision process (MDP) where the state is a probability-measure valued predictor/belief and the actions are quantizer maps. This MDP formulation has been used to show the optimality of certain classes of encoder policies in prior work. Despite such an analytical approach in determining optimal policies, their computation is prohibitively complex due to the uncountable nature of the constructed state space and the lack of minorization or strong ergodicity results which are commonly assumed for average cost optimal stochastic control. These challenges invite rigorous reinforcement learning methods, which entail several open questions addressed in our paper. We present two complementary approaches for this problem. In the first approach, we approximate the set of all beliefs by a finite set and use nearest-neighbor quantization to obtain a finite state MDP, whose optimal policies become near-optimal for the original MDP as the quantization becomes arbitrarily fine. In the second approach, a sliding finite window of channel outputs and quantizers together with a prior belief state serve as the state of the MDP. We then approximate this state by marginalizing over all possible beliefs, so that our coding policies only use the finite window term to encode the source. Under an appropriate notion of predictor stability, we show that such policies are near-optimal for the zero-delay coding problem as the window length increases. We give sufficient conditions for predictor stability to hold. Finally, we propose a reinforcement learning algorithm to compute near-optimal policies.</description>

      <title>Optimal, and approximately optimal, quantum strategies for $\mathrm{XOR}^{*}$ and $\mathrm{FFL}$ games</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.12887</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.12887v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We analyze optimal, and approximately optimal, quantum strategies for a variety of non-local XOR games. Building upon previous arguments due to Ostrev in 2016, which characterized approximately optimal, and optimal, strategies that players Alice and Bob can adopt for maximizing a linear functional to win non-local games after a Referee party examines each answer to a question drawn from some probability distribution, we identify additional applications of the framework for analyzing the performance of a broader class of quantum strategies in which it is possible for Alice and Bob to realize quantum advantage if the two players adopt strategies relying upon quantum entanglement, two-dimensional resource systems, and reversible transformations. For the Fortnow-Feige-Lovasz (FFL) game, the 2016 framework is directly applicable, which consists of five steps, including: (1) constructing a suitable, nonzero, linear transformation for the intertwining operations, (2) demonstrating that the operator has unit Frobenius norm, (3) constructing error bounds, and corresponding approximate operations, for $\big( A_k \otimes \textbf{I} \big) \ket{\psi}$, and $\big( \textbf{I} \otimes \big( \frac{\pm B_{kl} + B_{lk}}{\sqrt{2}} \big) \big) \ket{\psi}$, (4) constructing additional bounds for permuting the order in which $A^{j_i}_i$ operators are applied, (5) obtaining Frobenius norm upper bounds for Alice and Bob's strategies. We draw the attention of the reader to applications of this framework in other games with less regular structure.</description>

      <title>Improving the Privacy Loss Under User-Level DP Composition for Fixed Estimation Error</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.06261</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.06261v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper considers the private release of statistics of several disjoint subsets of a datasets. In particular, we consider the $\epsilon$-user-level differentially private release of sample means and variances of sample values in disjoint subsets of a dataset, in a potentially sequential manner. Traditional analysis of the privacy loss under user-level privacy due to the composition of queries to the disjoint subsets necessitates a privacy loss degradation by the total number of disjoint subsets. Our main contribution is an iterative algorithm, based on suppressing user contributions, which seeks to reduce the overall privacy loss degradation under a canonical Laplace mechanism, while not increasing the worst estimation error among the subsets. Important components of this analysis are our exact, analytical characterizations of the sensitivities and the worst-case bias errors of estimators of the sample mean and variance, which are obtained by clipping or suppressing user contributions. We test the performance of our algorithm on real-world and synthetic datasets and demonstrate improvements in the privacy loss degradation factor, for fixed estimation error. We also show improvements in the worst-case error across subsets, via a natural optimization procedure, for fixed numbers of users contributing to each subset.</description>
