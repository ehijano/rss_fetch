      <title>The trade-off between data minimization and fairness in collaborative filtering</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.07182</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.07182v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: General Data Protection Regulations (GDPR) aim to safeguard individuals' personal information from harm. While full compliance is mandatory in the European Union and the California Privacy Rights Act (CPRA), it is not in other places. GDPR requires simultaneous compliance with all the principles such as fairness, accuracy, and data minimization. However, it overlooks the potential contradictions within its principles. This matter gets even more complex when compliance is required from decision-making systems. Therefore, it is essential to investigate the feasibility of simultaneously achieving the goals of GDPR and machine learning, and the potential tradeoffs that might be forced upon us. This paper studies the relationship between the principles of data minimization and fairness in recommender systems. We operationalize data minimization via active learning (AL) because, unlike many other methods, it can preserve a high accuracy while allowing for strategic data collection, hence minimizing the amount of data collection. We have implemented several active learning strategies (personalized and non-personalized) and conducted a comparative analysis focusing on accuracy and fairness on two publicly available datasets. The results demonstrate that different AL strategies may have different impacts on the accuracy of recommender systems with nearly all strategies negatively impacting fairness. There has been no to very limited work on the trade-off between data minimization and fairness, the pros and cons of active learning methods as tools for implementing data minimization, and the potential impacts of AL on fairness. By exploring these critical aspects, we offer valuable insights for developing recommender systems that are GDPR compliant.</description>

      <title>No Free Lunch: Retrieval-Augmented Generation Undermines Fairness in LLMs, Even for Vigilant Users</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.07589</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.07589v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) is widely adopted for its effectiveness and cost-efficiency in mitigating hallucinations and enhancing the domain-specific generation capabilities of large language models (LLMs). However, is this effectiveness and cost-efficiency truly a free lunch? In this study, we comprehensively investigate the fairness costs associated with RAG by proposing a practical three-level threat model from the perspective of user awareness of fairness. Specifically, varying levels of user fairness awareness result in different degrees of fairness censorship on the external dataset. We examine the fairness implications of RAG using uncensored, partially censored, and fully censored datasets. Our experiments demonstrate that fairness alignment can be easily undermined through RAG without the need for fine-tuning or retraining. Even with fully censored and supposedly unbiased external datasets, RAG can lead to biased outputs. Our findings underscore the limitations of current alignment methods in the context of RAG-based LLMs and highlight the urgent need for new strategies to ensure fairness. We propose potential mitigations and call for further research to develop robust fairness safeguards in RAG-based LLMs.</description>

      <title>Firzen: Firing Strict Cold-Start Items with Frozen Heterogeneous and Homogeneous Graphs for Recommendation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.07654</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.07654v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recommendation models utilizing unique identities (IDs) to represent distinct users and items have dominated the recommender systems literature for over a decade. Since multi-modal content of items (e.g., texts and images) and knowledge graphs (KGs) may reflect the interaction-related users' preferences and items' characteristics, they have been utilized as useful side information to further improve the recommendation quality. However, the success of such methods often limits to either warm-start or strict cold-start item recommendation in which some items neither appear in the training data nor have any interactions in the test stage: (1) Some fail to learn the embedding of a strict cold-start item since side information is only utilized to enhance the warm-start ID representations; (2) The others deteriorate the performance of warm-start recommendation since unrelated multi-modal content or entities in KGs may blur the final representations. In this paper, we propose a unified framework incorporating multi-modal content of items and KGs to effectively solve both strict cold-start and warm-start recommendation termed Firzen, which extracts the user-item collaborative information over frozen heterogeneous graph (collaborative knowledge graph), and exploits the item-item semantic structures and user-user behavioral association over frozen homogeneous graphs (item-item relation graph and user-user co-occurrence graph). Furthermore, we build four unified strict cold-start evaluation benchmarks based on publicly available Amazon datasets and a real-world industrial dataset from Weixin Channels via rearranging the interaction data and constructing KGs. Extensive empirical results demonstrate that our model yields significant improvements for strict cold-start recommendation and outperforms or matches the state-of-the-art performance in the warm-start scenario.</description>

      <title>DISCO: A Hierarchical Disentangled Cognitive Diagnosis Framework for Interpretable Job Recommendation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.07671</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.07671v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The rapid development of online recruitment platforms has created unprecedented opportunities for job seekers while concurrently posing the significant challenge of quickly and accurately pinpointing positions that align with their skills and preferences. Job recommendation systems have significantly alleviated the extensive search burden for job seekers by optimizing user engagement metrics, such as clicks and applications, thus achieving notable success. In recent years, a substantial amount of research has been devoted to developing effective job recommendation models, primarily focusing on text-matching based and behavior modeling based methods. While these approaches have realized impressive outcomes, it is imperative to note that research on the explainability of recruitment recommendations remains profoundly unexplored. To this end, in this paper, we propose DISCO, a hierarchical Disentanglement based Cognitive diagnosis framework, aimed at flexibly accommodating the underlying representation learning model for effective and interpretable job recommendations. Specifically, we first design a hierarchical representation disentangling module to explicitly mine the hierarchical skill-related factors implied in hidden representations of job seekers and jobs. Subsequently, we propose level-aware association modeling to enhance information communication and robust representation learning both inter- and intra-level, which consists of the interlevel knowledge influence module and the level-wise contrastive learning. Finally, we devise an interaction diagnosis module incorporating a neural diagnosis function for effectively modeling the multi-level recruitment interaction process between job seekers and jobs, which introduces the cognitive measurement theory.</description>

      <title>DyVo: Dynamic Vocabularies for Learned Sparse Retrieval with Entities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.07722</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.07722v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Learned Sparse Retrieval (LSR) models use vocabularies from pre-trained transformers, which often split entities into nonsensical fragments. Splitting entities can reduce retrieval accuracy and limits the model's ability to incorporate up-to-date world knowledge not included in the training data. In this work, we enhance the LSR vocabulary with Wikipedia concepts and entities, enabling the model to resolve ambiguities more effectively and stay current with evolving knowledge. Central to our approach is a Dynamic Vocabulary (DyVo) head, which leverages existing entity embeddings and an entity retrieval component that identifies entities relevant to a query or document. We use the DyVo head to generate entity weights, which are then merged with word piece weights to create joint representations for efficient indexing and retrieval using an inverted index. In experiments across three entity-rich document ranking datasets, the resulting DyVo model substantially outperforms state-of-the-art baselines.</description>

      <title>CSA: Data-efficient Mapping of Unimodal Features to Multimodal Features</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.07610</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.07610v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Multimodal encoders like CLIP excel in tasks such as zero-shot image classification and cross-modal retrieval. However, they require excessive training data. We propose canonical similarity analysis (CSA), which uses two unimodal encoders to replicate multimodal encoders using limited data. CSA maps unimodal features into a multimodal space, using a new similarity score to retain only the multimodal information. CSA only involves the inference of unimodal encoders and a cubic-complexity matrix decomposition, eliminating the need for extensive GPU-based model training. Experiments show that CSA outperforms CLIP while requiring $300,000\times$ fewer multimodal data pairs and $6\times$ fewer unimodal data for ImageNet classification and misinformative news captions detection. CSA surpasses the state-of-the-art method to map unimodal features to multimodal features. We also demonstrate the ability of CSA with modalities beyond image and text, paving the way for future modality pairs with limited paired multimodal data but abundant unpaired unimodal data, such as lidar and text.</description>

      <title>Orthogonal Nonnegative Matrix Factorization with the Kullback-Leibler divergence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.07786</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.07786v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Orthogonal nonnegative matrix factorization (ONMF) has become a standard approach for clustering. As far as we know, most works on ONMF rely on the Frobenius norm to assess the quality of the approximation. This paper presents a new model and algorithm for ONMF that minimizes the Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence. As opposed to the Frobenius norm which assumes Gaussian noise, the KL divergence is the maximum likelihood estimator for Poisson-distributed data, which can model better vectors of word counts in document data sets and photo counting processes in imaging. We have developed an algorithm based on alternating optimization, KL-ONMF, and show that it performs favorably with the Frobenius-norm based ONMF for document classification and hyperspectral image unmixing.</description>

      <title>Rewriting Conversational Utterances with Instructed Large Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.07797</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.07797v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Many recent studies have shown the ability of large language models (LLMs) to achieve state-of-the-art performance on many NLP tasks, such as question answering, text summarization, coding, and translation. In some cases, the results provided by LLMs are on par with those of human experts. These models' most disruptive innovation is their ability to perform tasks via zero-shot or few-shot prompting. This capability has been successfully exploited to train instructed LLMs, where reinforcement learning with human feedback is used to guide the model to follow the user's requests directly. In this paper, we investigate the ability of instructed LLMs to improve conversational search effectiveness by rewriting user questions in a conversational setting. We study which prompts provide the most informative rewritten utterances that lead to the best retrieval performance. Reproducible experiments are conducted on publicly-available TREC CAST datasets. The results show that rewriting conversational utterances with instructed LLMs achieves significant improvements of up to 25.2% in MRR, 31.7% in Precision@1, 27% in NDCG@3, and 11.5% in Recall@500 over state-of-the-art techniques.</description>

      <title>HiNet: Novel Multi-Scenario &amp; Multi-Task Learning with Hierarchical Information Extraction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.06095</link>
      <description>arXiv:2303.06095v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Multi-scenario &amp; multi-task learning has been widely applied to many recommendation systems in industrial applications, wherein an effective and practical approach is to carry out multi-scenario transfer learning on the basis of the Mixture-of-Expert (MoE) architecture. However, the MoE-based method, which aims to project all information in the same feature space, cannot effectively deal with the complex relationships inherent among various scenarios and tasks, resulting in unsatisfactory performance. To tackle the problem, we propose a Hierarchical information extraction Network (HiNet) for multi-scenario and multi-task recommendation, which achieves hierarchical extraction based on coarse-to-fine knowledge transfer scheme. The multiple extraction layers of the hierarchical network enable the model to enhance the capability of transferring valuable information across scenarios while preserving specific features of scenarios and tasks. Furthermore, a novel scenario-aware attentive network module is proposed to model correlations between scenarios explicitly. Comprehensive experiments conducted on real-world industrial datasets from Meituan Meishi platform demonstrate that HiNet achieves a new state-of-the-art performance and significantly outperforms existing solutions. HiNet is currently fully deployed in two scenarios and has achieved 2.87% and 1.75% order quantity gain respectively.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.00009v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper develops an agent-based automated fact-checking approach for detecting misinformation. We demonstrate that combining a powerful LLM agent, which does not have access to the internet for searches, with an online web search agent yields better results than when each tool is used independently. Our approach is robust across multiple models, outperforming alternatives and increasing the macro F1 of misinformation detection by as much as 20 percent compared to LLMs without search. We also conduct extensive analyses on the sources our system leverages and their biases, decisions in the construction of the system like the search tool and the knowledge base, the type of evidence needed and its impact on the results, and other parts of the overall process. By combining strong performance with in-depth understanding, we hope to provide building blocks for future search-enabled misinformation mitigation systems.</description>

      <title>TiM4Rec: An Efficient Sequential Recommendation Model Based on Time-Aware Structured State Space Duality Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.16182</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.16182v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Sequential recommendation represents a pivotal branch of recommendation systems, centered around dynamically analyzing the sequential dependencies between user preferences and their interactive behaviors. Despite the Transformer architecture-based models achieving commendable performance within this domain, their quadratic computational complexity relative to the sequence dimension impedes efficient modeling. In response, the innovative Mamba architecture, characterized by linear computational complexity, has emerged. Mamba4Rec further pioneers the application of Mamba in sequential recommendation. Nonetheless, Mamba 1's hardware-aware algorithm struggles to efficiently leverage modern matrix computational units, which lead to the proposal of the improved State Space Duality (SSD), also known as Mamba 2. While the SSD4Rec successfully adapts the SSD architecture for sequential recommendation, showing promising results in high-dimensional contexts, it suffers significant performance drops in low-dimensional scenarios crucial for pure ID sequential recommendation tasks. Addressing this challenge, we propose a novel sequential recommendation backbone model, TiM4Rec, which ameliorates the low-dimensional performance loss of the SSD architecture while preserving its computational efficiency. Drawing inspiration from TiSASRec, we develop a time-aware enhancement method tailored for the linear computation demands of the SSD architecture, thereby enhancing its adaptability and achieving state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance in both low and high-dimensional modeling. The code for our model is publicly accessible at https://github.com/AlwaysFHao/TiM4Rec.</description>

      <title>Cryptanalysis of the SIMON Cypher Using Neo4j</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.04735</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.04735v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The exponential growth in the number of Internet of Things (IoT) devices has seen the introduction of several Lightweight Encryption Algorithms (LEA). While LEAs are designed to enhance the integrity, privacy and security of data collected and transmitted by IoT devices, it is hazardous to assume that all LEAs are secure and exhibit similar levels of protection. To improve encryption strength, cryptanalysts and algorithm designers routinely probe LEAs using various cryptanalysis techniques to identify vulnerabilities and limitations of LEAs. Despite recent improvements in the efficiency of cryptanalysis utilising heuristic methods and a Partial Difference Distribution Table (PDDT), the process remains inefficient, with the random nature of the heuristic inhibiting reproducible results. However, the use of a PDDT presents opportunities to identify relationships between differentials utilising knowledge graphs, leading to the identification of efficient paths throughout the PDDT. This paper introduces the novel use of knowledge graphs to identify intricate relationships between differentials in the SIMON LEA, allowing for the identification of optimal paths throughout the differentials, and increasing the effectiveness of the differential security analyses of SIMON.</description>
