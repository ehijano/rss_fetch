      <title>Medium effects of charged-hadron production in $p+Pb$ and $Pb+Pb$ collisions at LHC energies using modified Tsallis distribution</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.12231</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.12231v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The transverse momentum ($p_T$) spectra of charged hadrons in $p+p$, $p+Pb$ and $Pb+Pb$ collisions at $\sqrt {s_{NN}} = 5.02$ TeV are presented here within the rapidity range of $-2.5&lt;y&lt;2.0$. We study the medium effects, which is produced by heavy ion collisions, on the behaviour of charged hadrons, by using a phenomenological fit function. These effects are attributed to two main factors: the transverse collective flow and the the energy loss of charged hadrons due to multiple scatterings. We observe the transverse collective flow at low and intermediate $p_T$ region and the energy loss at high $p_T$ region. Here we take all the published data from the ATLAS collaboration.</description>

      <title>Quantum entanglement between neutrino eigenstates in the presence of the subsequent phase shift of the neutrino oscillations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.12239</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.12239v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this Letter, using von Neumann entropy we examine the entanglement entropy for the neutrino oscillations in the presence of the subsequent phase shift. We numerically show that the entanglement entropy for the subsequent periods of the two-flavor neutrino oscillations increases asymmetrically with time depending on the space-time deformation. We also explored the obtained results for the three-flavor neutrino oscillations to show that this result is also valid for the three-flavor neutrino oscillations. These results, obtained for the first time in this Letter, are quite different from the computing for the standard neutrino oscillation theory. We concluded that these interesting results play an important role in the cosmology.</description>

      <title>Pheno &amp; Cosmo Implications of Scotogenic 3-loop Neutrino Mass Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.12242</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.12242v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Radiative seesaw models are examples of interesting and testable extensions of the Standard Model to explain the light neutrino masses. In radiative models at 1-loop level, such as the popular scotogenic model, in order to successfully reproduce neutrino masses and mixing, one has to rely either on unnaturally small Yukawa couplings or on a very small mass splitting between the CP-even and CP-odd components of the neutral scalar mediators. We discuss here scotogenic-like models where light-active neutrino masses arise at the three-loop level, providing a more natural explanation for their smallness. The proposed models are consistent with the neutrino oscillation data and allow to successfully accommodate the measured dark matter relic abundance. Depending on the specific realization, it is also possible to explain the W-mass anomaly and to generate the baryon asymmetry of the Universe via leptogenesis. The models lead to rich phenomenology, predicting sizable charged-lepton flavor violation rates, potentially observable in near future experiments, while satisfying all current constraints imposed by neutrinoless double-beta decay, charged-lepton flavor violation and electroweak precision observables.</description>

      <title>Axion baryogenesis puts a new spin on the Hubble tension</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.12268</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.12268v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We show that a rotating axion field that makes a transition from a matter-like equation of state to a kination-like equation of state around the epoch of recombination can significantly ameliorate the Hubble tension, i.e., the discrepancy between the determinations of the present-day expansion rate $H_0$ from observations of the cosmic microwave background on one hand and Type Ia supernovae on the other. We consider a specific, UV-complete model of such a rotating axion and find that it can relax the Hubble tension without exacerbating tensions in determinations of other cosmological parameters, in particular the amplitude of matter fluctuations $S_8$. We subsequently demonstrate how this rotating axion model can also generate the baryon asymmetry of our universe, by introducing a coupling of the axion field to right-handed neutrinos. This baryogenesis model predicts heavy neutral leptons that are most naturally within reach of future lepton colliders, but in finely-tuned regions of parameter space may also be accessible at the high-luminosity LHC and the beam dump experiment SHiP.</description>

      <title>Cosmology of self-replicating universes in black holes formed by dark matter-seeded stellar collapse</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.12277</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.12277v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We show that dark matter with certain minimal properties can convert the majority of baryons in galaxies to black holes over hundred trillion year timescales. We argue that this has implications for cosmologies which propose that new universes are created in black hole interiors. We focus on the paradigm of cosmological natural selection, which connects black hole production to a universe's likelihood for existing. Further, we propose that the universe's timescale for entropy production could be dynamically linked to black hole production in a naturally selected universe. Our universe would fit this scenario for models of particle dark matter that convert helium white dwarfs to black holes in around a hundred trillion years, where the dominant source of entropy in our universe are the helium white dwarfs' stellar progenitors, which cease forming and burning also in around a hundred trillion years. Much of this dark matter could be discovered at ongoing experiments.</description>

      <title>Left-Right model with radiative double seesaw mechanism</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.12283</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.12283v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose an extended Left-Right symmetric model with an additional global symmetry $U(1)_X$, which after spontaneous symmetry breaking collapses to a residual subgroup $\mathbb{Z}_2$, which guarantees that the light active neutrino masses are generated via a double seesaw mechanism at three loop level, with the Dirac submatrix arising at one loop. It also ensures one loop level masses for the SM charged fermions lighter than the top quark and protects Dark Matter (DM) candidates of the model. To the best of our knowledge our model has the first implementation of the radiative double seesaw mechanism with the Dirac submatrix generated at one loop level. We show that the model can successfully accommodate the observed pattern of SM fermion masses as well as mixing and is compatible with the constraints arising from the muon $g-2$ anomaly, neutrinoless double beta decay and DM.</description>

      <title>In-situ Measurements of Dark Photon Dark Matter using Parker Solar Probe: Going beyond the Radio Window</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.12285</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.12285v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Dark photon dark matter emerges as a compelling candidate for ultralight bosonic dark matter, detectable through resonant conversion into photons within a plasma environment. This study employs in-situ measurements from the Parker Solar Probe (PSP), the first spacecraft to venture into the solar corona, to probe for DPDM signatures. The PSP in-situ measurements go beyond the traditional radio window, spanning frequencies between about 10 kHz and 20 MHz, a challenging range inaccessible to Earth-based radio astronomy. Additionally, the proximity of PSP to the resonant conversion location enhances the signal flux, providing a distinct advantage over ground-based observations. As a result, the PSP data establishes the most stringent constraints on the kinetic mixing parameter $\epsilon$ for DPDM frequencies between 70 kHz and 20 MHz, with values of $\epsilon \lesssim 10^{-14}-10^{-13}$. Investigating the data from STEREO satellites resulted in weaker constraints compared to those obtained from PSP. By utilizing state-of-the-art solar observations from space, we have surpassed the cosmic microwave background limits established in the early universe.</description>

      <title>Probing $|V_{td}|$ in single-top production at $pe^{\mp}$ colliders</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.12400</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.12400v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the consequences for top-quark physics of having electron and positron beams available at the LHeC and FCC-he, as was the case in HERA. We show that the asymmetry between top production in $pe^+$ collisions and antitop production in $pe^-$ reactions is sensitive to $|V_{td}|$. By means of detailed parton-level Monte Carlo simulations of single $t$ and $\bar{t}$ production and its backgrounds, we parametrize the asymmetry dependence on $|V_{td}|$ and estimate its uncertainties. We thus obtain limits on $|V_{td}|$ that are substantially stronger than current ones, and also smaller than current projections for the HL-LHC. We have $|V_{td}| &lt; 1.6\times |V_{td}^\mathrm{PDG}|$ at the LHeC, at 68\% C.L.\ with $L_\mathrm{int}=2$/ab.</description>

      <title>Kinetic energy and speed powers $v^n$ of a heavy quark inside $S$ wave and $P$ wave heavy-light mesons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.12440</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.12440v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Based on the instantaneous Bethe-Salpeter equation method, we calculate the average values $\overline{|\vec{q}|^n}\equiv q^n$ and speed powers $\overline{|\vec{v}|^n} \equiv v^n$ ($n=1,2,3,4$) of a heavy quark inside $S$ wave and $P$ wave heavy-light mesons, where $\vec{q}$ and $\vec{v}$ are the three dimensional momentum and velocity of the heavy quark, respectively. We obtain the kinetic energy $\mu^2_{_\pi}=0.455$ GeV$^2$ for the $B$ meson, which is consistent with the experimental result $0.464\pm 0.076$ GeV$^2$. For the $B_{s}$, $D$ and $D_{s}$ mesons, the $\mu^2_{_\pi}$ are $0.530$ GeV$^2$, $0.317$ GeV$^2$ and $0.369$ GeV$^2$, respectively. And $v^2=0.0185$, $0.0215$, $0.121$, and $0.140$ for $B$, $B_{s}$, $D$, and $D_{s}$. We obtain some relationships, for example, $q^n_{_{0^-}}(mS)\approx q^n_{_{1^-}}(mS)$, $q^n_{_{0^+}}(mP)\approx q^n_{_{1^{+'}}}(mP^{'})&gt; q^n_{_{1^+}}(mP)\approx q^n_{_{2^+}}(mP)$, and $q^n(mS)&lt; q^n(mP)$ ($m=1,2,3$), etc.</description>

      <title>Electric field induction in quark-gluon plasma due to thermoelectric effects</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.12510</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.12510v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Relativistic heavy-ion collisions produce quark-gluon plasma (QGP), which is locally thermalized. QGP with higher thermal conductivity advances towards global thermalization. Being made of electrically charged particles (quarks), QGP exhibits interesting thermoelectric phenomena during its evolution, resulting in the induction of an electric field in the medium. For the first time, we estimate the induced electric field in the QGP due to thermoelectric effect. This can be seen even in the QGP produced in the head-on collisions. The Seebeck coefficient is essential in determining the induced field. However, spectator current can produce a magnetic field in peripheral heavy-ion collisions. This breaks the isotropy of the thermoelectric coefficient matrix and introduces magneto-Seebeck and Nernst coefficients that contribute to the induced electric field in peripheral collisions. We have taken care of the temperature evolution of QGP with different hydrodynamic cooling rates to calculate the transport coefficients. The induced electric field is estimated with the cooling rate obtained from Gubser hydrodynamic flow. We estimated the space-time profile of the induced field and found that it is zero at the center and increases as we go away from the center. At the early time of evolution, the electric field can reach a maximum value of $eE \approx 1~m_\pi^2$, and the strength decreases in time. Moreover, we estimated the transport coefficients in the presence of the external time-varying magnetic field. The effect of the intensity and decay parameter of the magnetic field on the induced electric field is also explored.</description>

      <title>Cosmic rays from annihilation of heavy dark matter particles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.12560</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.12560v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The origin of the ultra high energy cosmic rays via annihilation of heavy stable, fermions "f", of the cosmological dark matter (DM) is studied. The particles in question are supposed to be created by the scalaron decays in $R^2$ modified gravity. Novel part of our approach is the assumption that the mass of these carriers of DM is slightly below than a half of the scalaron mass. In such a case the phase space volume becomes tiny. It leads to sufficiently low probability of "f" production, so their average cosmological energy density could be equal to the observed energy density of dark matter. Several regions of the universe, where the annihilation could take place, are studied. They include the whole universe under assumption of homogeneous energy density, the high density DM clump in the galactic centre, the cloud of DM in the Galaxy with realistic density distribution, and high density clusters of DM in the Galaxy. Possible resonance annihilation of $f \bar f$ into energetic light particle is considered. We have shown that the proposed scenario can successfully explain the origin of the ultrahigh energy flux of cosmic rays where the canonical astrophysical mechanisms are not operative.</description>

      <title>Monte Carlos for tau lepton -- Standard Model and New Physics signatures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.12570</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.12570v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: One of purposes for High Energy accelerator experiments is confrontation of theory and measurements in ever new realms. Any new agreement extends theory applicability domain, any discrepancy hints to unexplained. That calls for better calculations or new, deeper theory. Often one has to search for small contributions over large Standard Model background. Multi-dimensional signatures and complex background subtraction cuts imply that Monte Carlo techniques are indispensable.

      <title>Dimuons from neutrino-nucleus collisions in the semi-inclusive DIS approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.12677</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.12677v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a next-to-leading order perturbative QCD calculation of dimuon production in neutrino-nucleus collisions. This process is typically calculated by assuming it to be proportional to inclusive charm production, which requires an effective acceptance correction to take the experimental cuts on the decay-muon kinematics into account. Here, we instead compute the dimuon production cross section directly as a convolution of semi-inclusive deep inelastic scattering to produce charmed hadrons, and a decay function fitted to $e^+e^-$ data to produce a muon from the charmed hadrons. The presented approach is in a good agreement with available experimental data and will serve as a starting point for higher-order QCD calculations without an external acceptance correction. The uncertainties arising from the decay function and scale dependence are sizeably smaller than those from the nuclear parton distribution functions. We also calculate the effective acceptances within our approach and compare them to those usually used in global fits of parton distribution functions, finding differences of the order of $10\,\%$, depending on the kinematics, perturbative order, and applied parton distributions.</description>

Abstract: In this work, the spectra and decay properties of $B_c$ mesons ($c\bar{b}$) have been investigated using a non-relativistic potential model incorporating corrections from LQCD. The non-relativistic Schrodinger wave equation is solved numerically using the Matrix Numerov Method. Using the obtained masses and wave functions, decay widths, lifetime, branching ratios and radiative decay widths are computed for the $c\bar{b}$ system. We compare the obtained results with the experimental data and with other theoretical models.</description>

      <title>EW one-loop corrections to the longitudinally polarized Drell-Yan process. II) Charged-current case</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.12692</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.12692v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Complete one-loop electroweak radiative corrections to the charged-current Drell-Yan processes $pp \to \ell^{+}\nu_{\ell}(+X)$ and $pp \to \ell^{-}\bar{\nu}_{\ell}(+X)$ are presented for the case of longitudinal polarization of initial particles for the first time. The results can be used to obtain precise predictions for the kinematic distributions of polarized $W^{\pm}$ production cross sections, and various types of polarized single- and double-spin asymmetries, which are the sources of polarized parton distribution functions. Numerical results are obtained using the Monte-Carlo generator ReneSANCe. This study is a contribution to the research program of the STAR and PHENIX collaborations in experiments of RHIC.</description>

      <title>Revisiting radiative decays of single-charm baryons in the high-precision era of hadron spectroscopy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.12812</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.12812v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, we systematically study the radiative decays of single-charm baryons, which is one aspect of their spectroscopy behavior. In order to promote the accuracy of calculations, we adopt the numerical spatial wave functions of the single-charm baryons as the theoretical input, which are obtained by the Gaussian Expansion Method for getting the mass spectrum of the single-charm baryons. The present study of hadron spectroscopy is entering the era of high precision. We believe that the present work on the radiative decays of single-charm baryons can provide valuable information for further exploration of single-charm baryons.</description>

      <title>The nucleon axial radius</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.12943v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a systematic study of the relativistic axial-vector four-current distributions inside a nucleon. We show in particular that the slope of the axial form factor $G_A(Q^2)$ in the forward limit -- conventionally denoted as $R^2_A$ in the literature -- does not represent the three-dimensional mean-square axial radius in the Breit frame, but corresponds instead to a contribution to the mean-square spin radius. We derive explicit expressions for the latter in different frames and find in general additional contributions that depend on both the nucleon mass and the forward values of the axial-vector form factors $G_A(0)$ and $G_P(0)$.</description>

      <title>Accelerating Resonance Searches via Signature-Oriented Pre-training</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.12972</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.12972v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The search for heavy resonances beyond the Standard Model (BSM) is a key objective at the LHC. While the recent use of advanced deep neural networks for boosted-jet tagging significantly enhances the sensitivity of dedicated searches, it is limited to specific final states, leaving vast potential BSM phase space underexplored. We introduce a novel experimental method, Signature-Oriented Pre-training for Heavy-resonance ObservatioN (Sophon), which leverages deep learning to cover an extensive number of boosted final states. Pre-trained on the comprehensive JetClass-II dataset, the Sophon model learns intricate jet signatures, ensuring the optimal constructions of various jet tagging discriminates and enabling high-performance transfer learning capabilities. We show that the method can not only push widespread model-specific searches to their sensitivity frontier, but also greatly improve model-agnostic approaches, accelerating LHC resonance searches in a broad sense.</description>

      <title>SkyCURTAINs: Model agnostic search for Stellar Streams with Gaia data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.12131</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.12131v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present SkyCURTAINs, a data driven and model agnostic method to search for stellar streams in the Milky Way galaxy using data from the Gaia telescope. SkyCURTAINs is a weakly supervised machine learning algorithm that builds a background enriched template in the signal region by leveraging the correlation of the source's characterising features with their proper motion in the sky. This allows for a more representative template of the background in the signal region, and reduces the false positives in the search for stellar streams. The minimal model assumptions in the SkyCURTAINs method allow for a flexible and efficient search for various kinds of anomalies such as streams, globular clusters, or dwarf galaxies directly from the data. We test the performance of SkyCURTAINs on the GD-1 stream and show that it is able to recover the stream with a purity of 75.4% which is an improvement of over 10% over existing machine learning based methods while retaining a signal efficiency of 37.9%.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.12267v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We show that stars in the inner parsec of the Milky Way can be significantly affected by dark matter annihilation, producing population-level effects that are visible in a Hertzsprung-Russell (HR) diagram. We establish the dark HR diagram, where stars lie on a new stable $\textit{dark main sequence}$ with similar luminosities, but lower temperatures, than the standard main sequence. The dark matter density in these stars continuously replenishes, granting these stars immortality and solving multiple stellar anomalies. Upcoming telescopes could detect the dark main sequence, offering a new dark matter discovery avenue.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.12303v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We demonstrate a tree-level equivalence between four distinct infrared objects in $(d+2)$-dimensional abelian gauge theories. These are ($i$) the large gauge charge $Q_\varepsilon$ where the function $\varepsilon$ on the sphere parameterizing large gauge transformations is identified with the Goldstone mode $\theta$ of spontaneously broken large gauge symmetry; ($ii$) the soft effective action that captures the dynamics of the soft and Goldstone modes; ($iii$) the edge mode action with Neumann boundary conditions; and ($iv$) the Wilson line dressing of a scattering amplitude, including a novel dressing for soft photons, which have local charge distributions despite having vanishing global charge. The promotion of the large gauge parameter to the dynamical Goldstone and the novel dressing of soft gauge particles give rise to intriguing possibilities for the future study of infrared dynamics of gauge theories and gravity.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.12534v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A Planck scale inflationary era -- in a quantum gravity theory predicting discreteness of quantum geometry at the fundamental scale -- produces the scale invariant spectrum of inhomogeneities with very small tensor-to-scalar ratio of perturbations and a hot big bang leading to a natural dark matter genesis scenario. Here we evoke the possibility that some of the major puzzles in cosmology would have an explanation rooted in quantum gravity.</description>

      <title>Measuring Hawking Radiation from Black Hole Morsels in Astrophysical Black Hole Mergers</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.12880v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We show that it is possible to observe the Hawking radiation emitted by small black holes assumed to form in catastrophic astrophysical events such as black hole mergers. Gamma ray bursts in the TeV range are unique footprints of these asteroid-mass black hole morsels ejected during the merger. The time delay of the gamma ray bursts from the gravitational wave event is correlated to the mass distribution of the morsels. The integrated mass of the morsels allowed by the unaccounted merger mass leads to a Hawking induced radiation in photons that is above the sensitivity of atmospheric Cherenkov telescopes such as HESS, LHAASO and HAWC.</description>

      <title>Impact of inhomogeneous diffusion on secondary cosmic ray and antiproton local spectra</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.12918</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.12918v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recent $\gamma$-ray and neutrino observations seem to favor the consideration of non-uniform diffusion of cosmic rays (CRs) throughout the Galaxy. In this study, we investigate the consequences of spatially-dependent inhomogeneous propagation of CRs on the fluxes of secondary CRs and antiprotons detected at Earth. A comparison is made among different scenarios in search of potential features that may guide us toward favoring one over another in the near future. We also examine both the influence of inhomogeneous propagation in the production of secondary CRs from interactions with the gas, and the effects of this scenario on the local fluxes of antiprotons and light antinuclei produced as final products of dark matter annihilation. Our results indicate that the consideration of an inhomogeneous diffusion model could improve the compatibility of the predicted local antiproton flux with that of B, Be and Li, assuming only secondary origin of these particles. In addition, our model predicts a slightly harder local antiproton spectrum, making it more compatible with the high energy measurements of AMS-02. Finally, no significant changes are expected in the predicted local flux of antiprotons and antinuclei produced from dark matter among the different considered propagation scenarios.</description>

Abstract: We investigate the implications of decoherence induced by quantum spacetime properties on neutrino oscillation phenomena. We develop a general formalism where the evolution of neutrinos is governed by a Lindblad-type equation and we compute the oscillation damping factor for various models that have been proposed in the literature. Furthermore, we discuss the sensitivity to these effects of different types of neutrino oscillation experiments, encompassing astrophysical, atmospheric, solar, and reactor neutrino experiments. By using neutrino oscillation data from long-baseline reactors and atmospheric neutrino observations, we establish stringent constraints on the energy scale governing the strength of the decoherence induced by stochastic metric fluctuations, amounting to, respectively, $E_{QG}\geq 2.6 \cdot 10^{34}\; \text{GeV}$ and $E_{QG}\geq 2.5\cdot 10^{55}\;\text{GeV}$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2308.10739v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Semi-inclusive deep inelastic scattering off nuclei is a unique process to study the parton propagation mechanism and its modification induced by the presence of the nuclear medium. It allows us to probe the medium properties, particularly the cold nuclear matter transport coefficient, which can be directly linked to the nuclear gluon density. We present here a model for hadron production in deep inelastic lepton-nucleus scattering, which takes into account the hadronic transverse momentum of final state particles via transverse-momentum dependent (TMD) parton distributions and fragmentation functions. We implement parton energy loss and hadronic absorption with a geometrical model of the nucleus. The model is compared with the nuclear SIDIS multiplicity ratios and transverse-momentum broadening data from the CLAS, HERMES, and EMC collaborations, aiming for a simultaneous description of these data sets. We obtain a good agreement over the various nuclear targets and the wide kinematical range of those experiments. We best describe the data with a transport coefficient \hat{q} = 0.3 GeV/fm^2, and we highlight the importance and the role of correlations in extracting this quantity.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2309.05474v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Gravitational wave (GW) predictions of cosmological phase transitions are almost invariably evaluated at either the nucleation or percolation temperature. We investigate the effect of the transition temperature choice on GW predictions, for phase transitions with weak, intermediate and strong supercooling. We find that the peak amplitude of the GW signal varies by a factor of a few for weakly supercooled phase transitions, and by an order of magnitude for strongly supercooled phase transitions. The variation in amplitude for even weakly supercooled phase transitions can be several orders of magnitude if one uses the mean bubble separation, while the variation is milder if one uses the mean bubble radius instead. We also investigate the impact of various approximations used in GW predictions. Many of these approximations introduce at least a 10% error in the GW signal, with others introducing an error of over an order of magnitude.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2309.16794v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we discuss the possibility to probe a nearly-degenerate $Z^{\prime}$-$Z$ system by analyzing the $Z$-lineshape at an electron-positron collider. Compared with the usual $Z^{\prime}$ in the literature well separated with the standard model (SM) $Z$ boson in mass, the nearly-degenerate $Z^{\prime}$-$Z$ mixing affects the observed effective ``oblique parameters'' $\tilde{S}$, $\tilde{T}$, $\tilde{U}$, and the effective deviation of ``number of neutrino species'' $\delta \tilde{N}_{\nu}$ in a more complicated way and cannot be simply computed perturbatively up to a particular order. Aiming at solving this problem, we write down a general simplified effective Lagrangian and enumerate some parameter spaces corresponding to some typical models, and suggest a method to extract the constraints by looking into the line-shape of the $Z$-like resonance at an electron-positron collider.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2310.12628v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In the present study, we investigate the decays of the top quark $t\rightarrow c\gamma$, $t\rightarrow cg$, $t\rightarrow cZ$ and $t\rightarrow ch$. They are extremely rare processes in the Standard Model (SM). As the $U(1)$ extension of the minimal supersymmetric standard model (MSSM), the $U(1)_X$SSM features new superfields such as the right-handed neutrinos and three Higgs singlets. We analyze the effects of different sensitive parameters on the results and make reasonable theorecial predictions, which provides a useful reference for future experimental development. Considering the constraint of the updated experimental data, the numerical results show that the branching ratios of all four processes $t\rightarrow c\gamma,~cg,~cZ,~ch$ can reach the same order of magnitude as their experimental upper limits. Among them, $\tan\beta$ has the most obvious effect on each process and is the main parameter. $g_X$, $g_{YX}$, $\mu$, $M_2$, $\lambda_H$, $M_{U23}^2$ and $M_{Q23}^2$ are important parameters for the processes, and have effects on the numerical results.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2312.00861v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study higher-order QCD corrections for the associated production of a top-antitop quark pair and a $W$ boson ($t{\bar t}W$ production) in proton-proton collisions. We calculate approximate NNLO (aNNLO) and approximate N$^3$LO (aN$^3$LO) cross sections, with second-order and third-order soft-gluon corrections added to the exact NLO QCD result, and we also include electroweak (EW) corrections through NLO. We calculate uncertainties from scale dependence, which are reduced at higher orders, and from parton distributions, and we also provide separate results for $t{\bar t}W^+$ and $t{\bar t}W^-$ production. We compare our results to recent measurements from the LHC, and we find that the aN$^3$LO QCD + NLO EW predictions provide improved agreement with the data. We also calculate differential distributions in top-quark transverse momentum and rapidity and find significant enhancements from the higher-order corrections. This is the first calculation of soft-gluon corrections in single-particle-inclusive kinematics for a $2 \to 3$ process where all final-state particles are massive.</description>

      <title>Exploring correlations between HEFT Higgs couplings $\kappa_V$ and $\kappa_{2V}$ via HH production at $e^+e^-$ colliders</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.03877</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.03877v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this work we explore the phenomenological implications at future $e^+e^-$ colliders of assuming anomalous couplings of the Higgs boson to gauge bosons $HVV$ and $HHVV$ ($V=W,Z$) given by the $\kappa$-modifiers with respect to the Standard Model couplings, $\kappa_V$ and $\kappa_{2V}$, respectively. For this study we use the Higgs Effective Field Theory (HEFT) where these two $\kappa$ parameters are identified with the two most relevant effective couplings at leading order, concretely $a=\kappa_V$ and $b=\kappa_{2V}$. Our focus is put on these two couplings and their potential correlations which we believe carry interesting information on the underlying ultraviolet theory. The particular studied process is $e^+e^- \to HH \nu \bar \nu$, where the vector boson scattering subprocess $WW \to HH$ plays a central role, specially at the largest planned energy colliders. Our detailed study of this process as a function of the energy and the angular variables indicates that the produced Higgs bosons in the BSM scenarios will have in general a high transversality as compared to the SM case if $\kappa_V^2 \neq \kappa_{2V}$. In order to enhance the sensitivity to these HEFT parameters $\kappa_V$ and $\kappa_{2V}$ and their potential correlations we propose here some selected differential cross sections for the $e^+e^- \to HH \nu \bar\nu$ process where different kinematic properties of the BSM case with respect to the SM are manifested. Finally, we will focus on the dominant Higgs decays to $b \bar b$ pairs leading to final events with 4 $b$-jets and missing transverse energy from the undetected neutrinos and will provide the expected accessibility to the $(\kappa_V,\kappa_{2V})$ effective couplings and their potential correlations. In our study we will consider the three projected energies for $e^+e^-$ colliders of 500 GeV, 1000 GeV and 3000 GeV.</description>

Abstract: Recent work from the last years has raised the possibility that a portion of Dark Matter could consist of exotic particles, such as axion (anti)quark nuggets (AQN, A\bar{Q}N). After a brief review outlining the main features of axion antiquark nuggets, we explore potential experimental signatures that can be leveraged to search for these stable supermassive particles in future surface and underground experiments using large liquid detectors. These expected signals are discussed in relation to the specific characteristics of each detection system.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2402.12830v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We discuss the spectrum and the internal composition of ground and excited four-quark states in the charm and bottom energy region. To this end we extend previous calculations within the framework of the relativistic four-body Faddeev-Yakubovsky equation to include quantum numbers with $J^{P C} = 0^{++} , 0^{-+} , 1^{--} , 1^{+-}$ and $1^{+ +}$ and study their internal composition in terms of heavy-light meson pairs, hadroquarkonia and diquark-antidiquark clusters. We observe similar patterns in the charm and bottom energy region with different compositions of the four-quark states depending on $J^{P C}$ quantum numbers. Most notably, we find that all states with $C \cdot P = +1$ are dominated by heavy-light meson contributions, whereas for axialvector states with $J^{P C} = 1^{+-}$ including the $Z_c (3900)$ we find a much more complicated picture depending on the flavour content. We systematically compare our results for the spectrum with existing experimental results and provide predictions for future analyses.</description>

      <title>Cluster Scanning: a novel approach to resonance searches</title>

      <description>arXiv:2402.17714v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We propose a new model-independent method for new physics searches called Cluster Scanning. It uses the k-means algorithm to perform clustering in the space of low-level event or jet observables, and separates potentially anomalous clusters to construct a signal-enriched region. The spectra of a selected observable (e.g. invariant mass) in these two regions are then used to determine whether a resonant signal is present. A pseudo-analysis on the LHC Olympics dataset with a $Z'$ resonance shows that Cluster Scanning outperforms the widely used 4-parameter functional background fitting procedures, reducing the number of signal events needed to reach a $3\sigma$ significant access by a factor of 0.61. Emphasis is placed on the speed of the method, which allows the test statistic to be calibrated on synthetic data.</description>

      <title>Revisiting $O(N)$ $\sigma$ model at unphysical pion masses and high temperatures</title>

Abstract: Roy-equation analyses on lattice data of $\pi\pi$ scattering phase shifts at $m_\pi=391$MeV reveals that the lowest $f_0$ meson becomes a bound state under this condition. In addition, there is a pair of complex poles below threshold generated by crossing symmetry [X.-H. Cao et al., Phys. Rev. D 108, 034009 (2023)]. We use the $N/D$ method to partially recover crossing symmetry of the $O(N)$ $\sigma$ model amplitude at leading order of $1/N$ expansion, and qualitatively reproduce the pole structure and pole trajectories with varying pion masses as revealed by Roy-equation analyses. The $\sigma$ pole trajectory with varying temperature is also discussed and found to be similar to its properties when varying $m_\pi$. As the temperature increases, the complex $\sigma$ poles firstly move from the second Riemann sheet to the real axis becoming two virtual state poles, and then one virtual state pole moves to the first sheet turning into a bound state pole and finally tends to the pion pole position at high temperature which is as expected from the chiral symmetry restoration. Our results provide further evidences that the lowest $f_0$ state extracted from experiments and lattice data plays the role of $\sigma$ meson in the spontaneous breaking of chiral symmetry. Finally, we also briefly discuss the problems of the effective potential in the situation when $m_\pi$ and temperature get large.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.04644v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Scalar leptoquarks naturally arise within unified theories, offering a promising avenue for addressing one of the most significant challenges of the Standard Model--the existence of non-zero neutrino masses. In this work, we present a unified theory based on the SU(5) gauge group, where neutrino mass appears at the two-loop level via the propagation of scalar leptoquarks. Due to the unified framework, the charged fermion and neutrino masses and mixings are entangled and determined by a common set of Yukawa couplings. These exotic particles not only shed light on the neutrino mass generation mechanism but also help to achieve the unification of gauge couplings and are expected to lead to substantial lepton flavor violating rates, offering tangible opportunities for experimental verification. Reproducing the observed neutrino mass scale necessitates that a set of leptoquarks reside a few orders of magnitude below the unification scale--a specific feature of the proposed scenario. Moreover, maximizing the unification scale implies TeV scale new physics states, making them accessible at colliders. The diverse roles that leptoquarks play highlight the elegance and predictive ability of the proposed unified model.</description>

Abstract: Relativistic bubble walls from cosmological phase transitions (PT) necessarily accumulate expanding shells of particles. We systematically characterize shell properties, and identify and calculate the processes that prevent them from free streaming: phase-space saturation effects, out-of-equilibrium $2\to2$ and $3\to2$ shell-shell and shell-bath interactions, and shell interactions with bubble walls. We find that shells do not free stream in scenarios widely studied in the literature, where standard predictions will need to be reevaluated, including those of bubble wall velocities, gravitational waves (GW) and particle production. Our results support the use of bulk-flow GW predictions in all regions where shells free stream, irrespectively of whether or not the latent heat is mostly converted in the scalar field gradient.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.16568v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study domain wall induced by spontaneously broken $\mathbb{Z}_2$ symmetry and its gravitational wave signature in the standard model with a complex scalar in connection with dark matter physics. In a minimal setup, a linear term of the singlet field is added to the scalar potential as an explicit $\mathbb{Z}_2$ breaking term to make the domain wall unstable. We obtain its minimal size from cosmological constraints and show that the parameter space that can be probed by current and future pulsar time array experiments requires the vacuum expectation value of the singlet field to be greater than $\mathcal{O}(10-100)$ TeV, along with a singlet-like Higgs mass of $\mathcal{O}(1-100)$ TeV. However, such a region is severely restricted by the dark matter relic density, which places an upper bound on the singlet vacuum expectation value at approximately 200 TeV, and limits the dark matter mass to about half of the singlet-like Higgs boson mass.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.00646v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate the formation of primordial black holes (PBHs) through delayed vacuum decay during slow cosmic first-order phase transitions. Two specific models, the polynomial potential and the real singlet extension of the Standard Model, are used as illustrative examples. Our findings reveal that models with zero-temperature scalar potential barriers are conducive to the realization of this mechanism, as the phase transition duration is extended by the U-shaped Euclidean action. We find that the resulting PBH density is highly sensitive to the barrier height, with abundant PBH formation observed for sufficiently high barriers. Notably, the phase transition needs not to be ultra-supercooled (i.e. the parameter $\alpha\gg1$), and the commonly used exponential nucleation approximation $\Gamma(t)\sim e^{\beta t}$ fails to capture the PBH formation dynamics in such models.</description>

      <title>Analysis of Hadronic Weak Decays of Charmed Baryons in the Topological Diagrammatic Approach</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.01350v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We perform a global fit to the experimental data of two-body charmed baryon decays based on the topological diagrammatic approach (TDA) and take into account the phase shifts between $S$- and $P$-wave amplitudes as inspired by the recent BESIII measurement of the decay asymmetry in the decay $\Lambda_c^+\to \Xi^0K^+$. The TDA has the advantage that it is more intuitive, graphic and easier to implement model calculations. The measured branching fractions and decay asymmetries are well accommodated in the TDA except for a few modes, in particular, the predicted ${\cal B}(\Xi_c^0\to \Xi^-\pi^+)=(2.83\pm0.10)\%$ is larger than its current value. The equivalence of the TDA and the irreducible SU(3) approach (IRA) is established. We show that the number of the minimum set of tensor invariants in the IRA and the topological amplitudes in the TDA is the same and present their relations. The predicted magnitudes of $S$- and $P$-wave amplitudes and their phase shifts are presented for measured and yet-to-be-measured modes in both the TDA and IRA which can be tested in the near future. Besides the decay $\Lambda_c^+\to \Xi^0 K^+$, there exist several modes which proceed only through $W$-exchange. In particular, the observed channel $\Xi_c^0\to \Sigma^+ K^-$ should have phase shifts similar to that in $\Lambda_c^+\to \Xi^0 K^+$ and its decay asymmetry is predicted to be $-0.21\pm0.17$ which can be used to test our theoretical framework. In contrast, the TDA leads to a large $\alpha$ of order $-0.93$ for the decay $\Xi_c^+\to \Xi^0\pi^+$ even after the phase-shift effect is incorporated in the fit.</description>

      <title>Tunneling away the relic neutrino asymmetry</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.11664v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The Earth acts as a matter potential for relic neutrinos which modifies their index of refraction from vacuum by $\delta\sim10^{-8}$. It has been argued that the refractive effects from this potential should lead to a large $\mathcal O(\sqrt\delta)$ neutrino-antineutrino asymmetry at the surface of the Earth. This result was computed by treating the Earth as flat. In this work, we revisit this calculation in the context of a perfectly spherical Earth. We demonstrate, both numerically and through analytic arguments, that the flat-Earth result is only recovered under the condition $\delta^{3/2}kR\gg1$, where $k$ is the typical momentum of the relic neutrinos and $R$ is the radius of the Earth. This condition is required to prevent antineutrinos from tunneling into classically inaccessible trajectories below the Earth's surface and washing away the large asymmetry. As the physical parameters of the Earth do not satisfy this condition, we find that the asymmetry at the surface should only be $\mathcal O(\delta)$. While the asphericity of the Earth may serve as a loophole to our conclusions, we argue that it is still difficult to generate a large asymmetry even in the presence of local terrain.</description>

Abstract: The Ultra-relativistic Quantum Molecular Dynamics model is employed to simulate $\pi^-+\mathrm{C}$ and $\pi^-+\mathrm{W}$ collisions at p$_\mathrm{lab}=1.7$ GeV motivated by the recent HADES results. By comparing the proton and $\Lambda$ transverse momentum spectra, it was observed that the data and transport model calculation show a good agreement, if cluster formation is included to obtain the free proton spectra. Predictions of light cluster ($d$, $t$, $^3$He, $^4$He, as well as ${}^{3}_\Lambda$H and $\Xi$N) multiplicities and spectra are made using a coalescence mechanism. The resulting multiplicities suggest that the pion beam experiment can produce a substantial amount of ${}^{3}_\Lambda$H, especially in $\pi^-+\mathrm{W}$ collisions due to the stopping of the $\Lambda$ inside the large tungsten nucleus. The findings are supplemented by a statistical multi-fragmentation analysis suggesting that even larger hyper-fragments are produced copiously. It is suggested that even double strange hypernuclei are in reach and might be studied in more detail using a slightly higher pion beam momentum.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2310.15812v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: To determine whether or not H II starburst galaxies (H IIG) are standardizable candles, we study the correlation between the H$\beta$ luminosity ($L$) and the velocity dispersion ($\sigma$) of the ionized gas from H IIG measurements by simultaneously constraining the $L-\sigma$ relation parameters and the cosmological model parameters. We investigate six flat and nonflat relativistic dark energy cosmological models. We find that low-redshift and high-redshift H IIG data subsets are standardizable but obey different $L-\sigma$ relations. Current H IIG data are too sparse and too non-uniformly distributed in redshift to allow for a determination of why the samples follow different relations, but it could be caused by the high-redshift sample containing relatively fewer intrinsically dimmer sources (Malmquist bias) or it could be a consequence of H IIG evolution. Until this issue is better understood, H IIG data cosmological constraints must be treated with caution.</description>

      <title>Gravitational Wave Signals From Early Matter Domination: Interpolating Between Fast and Slow Transitions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2311.12340v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: An epoch of matter domination in the early universe can enhance the primordial stochastic gravitational wave signal, potentially making it detectable to upcoming gravitational wave experiments. However, the resulting gravitational wave signal is quite sensitive to the end of the early matter-dominated epoch. If matter domination ends gradually, a cancellation results in an extremely suppressed signal, while in the limit of an instantaneous transition, there is a resonant-like enhancement. The end of the matter dominated epoch cannot be instantaneous, however, and previous analyses have used a Gaussian smoothing technique to account for this, and consider only a limited regime around the fast transition limit. In this work, we present a study of the enhanced gravitational wave signal from early matter domination without making either approximation and show how the signal smoothly evolves from the strongly suppressed to strongly enhanced regimes.</description>

Abstract: The causal-stable Muller-Israel-Stewart (MIS) theory is known to have a finite number of out of equilibrium derivative order corrections but requires treating the viscosity tensor as a separate degree of freedom with its own equations of motion, apart from the fundamental fluid degrees of freedom like velocity and temperature. In this work, I will show that it is possible to rewrite the MIS theory only in terms of velocity and temperature, but the resultant constitutive relation for dissipation must include all orders of gradient corrections. In this work I will argue that an all-order resummation of gradient contributions is equivalent to introducing new `non-fluid' degrees of freedom in the MIS theory. It will also be shown, using the relativistic quantum causality condition, that any finitely truncated order of derivative correction, however high it is, leads to a theory that is acausal, unless the corrections are infinitely summed up to all orders.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2312.12894v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The rapid progress in gravitational wave astronomy has provided an opportunity for investigating the presence of long-range scalar forces that exclusively manifest around astrophysical black holes. In this paper, we explore a new possibility in this context, particularly in connection to the hypothesis that astrophysical black holes might be horizonless ultracompact objects (UCOs). In the absence of horizons, UCOs could feature unique interiors with extreme environments. This could help generate non-trivial scalar profiles and significant scalar charges. For demonstration, we consider 2-2-holes in quadratic gravity as a concrete example of UCOs. These objects can be formed by ordinary gases and closely resemble black holes externally. However, they have distinct interiors characterized by high curvatures and substantial redshift. In particular, the gases inside could reach extremely high temperatures or densities, making them an ideal object for investigating the generation of scalar profiles by UCOs. Within a minimal model of the scalar field, we find that this unique environment enables the generation of a substantial scalar charge for astrophysical 2-2-holes, which is challenging for other stellar objects. The predicted scalar charge-to-mass ratio of 2-2-holes remains nearly constant across a wide range of masses, offering different predictions for gravitational wave observations compared to other mechanisms.</description>

      <title>Imaging a semi-classical horizonless compact object with strong redshift</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.09388v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The recent advancements in black hole imaging have opened a new era of probing horizon-scale physics with electromagnetic radiation. However, a feature of the observed images, a bright ring encircling a relatively dark region, has not sufficiently proved the existence of event horizons. It thus requires extreme care when studying the possibility of using such image features to examine quantum effects that may change the classical picture of black holes slightly or drastically. In this work, we investigate the image of a horizonless compact object, whose interior metric satisfies the 4D semi-classical Einstein equation non-perturbatively for the Planck constant, and whose entropy agrees with the Bekenstein-Hawking formula. Although the absence of an event horizon allows light rays to pass through the dense interior, the extremely strong redshift significantly darkens the image, making it almost identical to the classical black-hole image. In particular, if there is light emission a bit inside the surface of the object, the intensity around the inner shadow is slightly enhanced, which could be a future observable prediction to characterize the object. We also find through a phenomenological parameter that the image is further darkened due to interactions inside. Thus, the image is consistent with current observations, and the object could be a candidate for black holes in quantum theory.</description>

      <title>Geometric Interpretation of a nonlinear extension of Quantum Mechanics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.07289</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.07289v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We recently introduced a particular nonlinear generalization of quantum mechanics which has the property that it is exactly solvable in terms of the eigenvalues and eigenfunctions of the Hamiltonian of the usual linear quantum mechanics problem. In this paper we suggest that the two components of the wave function represent the system described by the Hamiltonian H in two different asymptotic regions of spacetime and we show that the non-linear terms can be viewed as giving rise to gravitational effects.</description>

      <title>A study of the fine-structure constant dependence of radiative capture in Halo-EFT</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.09971</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.09971v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the fine-structure constant dependence of the rates of some selected radiative capture reactions within the framework of so-called Halo Effective Field Theory in order to assess the adequacy of some assumptions made on the Coulomb penetrability. We find that this dependence deviates from that implied by a parameterization of the cross sections of this effect via a simple penetration factor. Some features of this fine-structure dependence are discussed, in particular its potential impact on the abundances of the light elements in primordial nucleosynthesis.</description>
