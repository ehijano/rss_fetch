      <title>Inversion by Partial Evaluation: A Reversible Interpreter Experiment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.03122</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.03122v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A computational limit of combining partial evaluation and program inversion is investigated. Using a reversible Turing machine interpreter, we show that the first Futamura and inversion projections can produce not only functionally but also textually equivalent programs. The construction of the interpreter in a reversible flowchart language is shown in full. Insights are provided on the practical interplay between reversible interpreters, program inverters, and partial evaluators. We conclude that both projections must be included in the program transformation toolbox.</description>

      <title>A Lower Bound on Unambiguous Context Free Grammars via Communication Complexity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.03199</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.03199v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Motivated by recent connections to factorised databases, we analyse the efficiency of representations by context free grammars (CFGs). Concretely, we prove a recent conjecture by Kimelfeld, Martens, and Niewerth (ICDT 2025), that for finite languages representations by general CFGs can be doubly-exponentially smaller than those by unambiguous CFGs. To do so, we show the first exponential lower bounds for representation by unambiguous CFGs of a finite language that can efficiently be represented by CFGs. Our proof first reduces the problem to proving a lower bound in a non-standard model of communication complexity. Then, we argue similarly in spirit to a recent discrepancy argument to show the required communication complexity lower bound. Our result also shows that for finite languages nondeterministic finite automata may be exponentially smaller than unambiguous CFGs.</description>

      <title>Safe Networked Robotics with Probabilistic Verification</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2302.09182</link>
      <description>arXiv:2302.09182v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Autonomous robots must utilize rich sensory data to make safe control decisions. To process this data, compute-constrained robots often require assistance from remote computation, or the cloud, that runs compute-intensive deep neural network perception or control models. However, this assistance comes at the cost of a time delay due to network latency, resulting in past observations being used in the cloud to compute the control commands for the present robot state. Such communication delays could potentially lead to the violation of essential safety properties, such as collision avoidance. This paper develops methods to ensure the safety of robots operated over communication networks with stochastic latency. To do so, we use tools from formal verification to construct a shield, i.e., a run-time monitor, that provides a list of safe actions for any delayed sensory observation, given the expected and maximum network latency. Our shield is minimally intrusive and enables networked robots to satisfy key safety constraints, expressed as temporal logic specifications, with desired probability. We demonstrate our approach on a real F1/10th autonomous vehicle that navigates in indoor environments and transmits rich LiDAR sensory data over congested WiFi links.</description>
