      <title>Classification of the Discrete Symmetries for the Four-Higgs-Doublet Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.01977</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.01977v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The multi-Higgs model (NHDM) is a class of new physics models that go beyond the Standard Model with fewer assumptions, namely by postulating the existence of multiple Higgs doublets, while yielding a rich phenomenology. Among them, the Four-Higgs-Doublet model (4HDM) has attracted increasing attention in recent years, with nearly a hundred papers dedicated to its study. Scientists have attempted to use it to explain many phenomena that the Standard Model cannot account for, such as dark matter, fermion mass hierarchies, neutrino masses, cosmological phase transitions, and cosmic strings, among others. In these efforts, imposing finite symmetries on the 4HDM is a standard procedure, because finite symmetries are central to explaining many physical phenomena, such as dark matter, and can also constrain excessively large parameter spaces technically. Therefore, given the recent attention to 4HDM and the importance of finite symmetries in model building, it is crucial from a mathematical perspective to classify all possible finite symmetries, as the classification results can guide model construction and phenomenological studies. So far, two scenarios of discrete symmetries of 4HDM have been classified, but there are still cases that haven't been studied. During our study, we found out situations that have never appeared in 2HDM or 3HDM, and we developed many new techniques to help us handle the difficulties. Therefore, before any further progresses are made towards a full classification, it is timely to revisit the current progress of 4HDM discrete symmetry classification in a beginner-friendly manner, and to provide a look towards future research.</description>

      <title>Enabling Strong Neutrino Self-interaction with an Unparticle Mediator</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.02049</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.02049v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent explorations of the cosmic microwave background and the large-scale structure of the universe have indicated a preference for sizable neutrino self-interactions, much stronger than what the Standard Model offers. When interpreted in the context of simple particle-physics models with a light, neutrinophilic scalar mediator, some of the hints are already in tension with the combination of terrestrial, astrophysical and cosmological constraints. We take a novel approach by considering neutrino self-interactions through a mediator with a smooth, continuous, spectral density function. We consider Georgi's unparticle with a mass gap as a concrete example and point out two useful effects for mitigating two leading constraints. 1) The Unparticle is ``broadband'' -- it occupies a wide range of masses which allows it to pass the early universe constraint on effective number of extra neutrinos ($\Delta N_{\rm eff.}$) even if the mass gap lies below the MeV scale. 2) Scattering involving unparticles is less resonant -- which lifts the constraint set by IceCube based on a recent measurement of ultra-high-energy cosmogenic neutrinos. Our analysis shows that an unparticle mediator can open up ample parameter space for strong neutrino self-interactions of interest to cosmology and serves a well-motivated target for upcoming experiments.</description>

      <title>Electric dipole moments from the TNMSSM perspective: A study of neutrons, electron, mercury, and b,c quarks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.02217</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.02217v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the framework of the minimal supersymmetric model extension with new scalar triplets and singlet (TNMSSM), we analyze the electric dipole moment (EDM) of neutron ($d_n$), electron EDM($d_e$), the mercury EDM($d_{Hg}$), $b$ quark ($d_b$) and $c$ quark ($d_c$) by considering the contributions from the one-loop diagrams, some two-loop diagrams and the Weinberg operators. The effects of TNMSSM specific CPV sources $\chi_d,\;\chi_t$ on $d_n$, $d_e$, $d_{Hg}$, $d_b$, $d_c$ are specialized, it is found that they have significant contributions to these EDMs, and the current upper bounds on $d_n$ impose strict constraints on $\chi_d,\;\chi_t$. The theoretical predictions on $d_b$, $d_c$ can reach about $10^{-22}$ e$\cdot$cm and $10^{-23}$ e$\cdot$cm respectively by taking the upper bounds on $d_n$, $d_e$, $d_{Hg}$ into account, which have great potential to be observed in future.</description>

      <title>Probing a Heavy Dark $Z$ Boson at Multi-TeV Muon Colliders: Leveraging the Optimized Recoil Mass Technique</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.02224</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.02224v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the discovery potential of multi-TeV muon colliders for a heavy dark $Z$ boson ($Z_{\rm D}$) with a mass above 1 TeV through the associated production channel $\mu^+\mu^- \to Z_{\rm D}\gamma$. This process enables precise $M_{Z_{\rm D}}$ reconstruction using the photon recoil mass ($m_{\rm recoil}$). Focusing on the $Z_{\rm D} \to jjX$ and $Z_{\rm D} \to e^+e^-$ decay modes, we present strategies for achieving high sensitivity to the kinetic mixing parameter $\varepsilon$ at 3, 6, and 10 TeV muon colliders with integrated luminosities of 1, 4, and 10 ab$^{-1}$ respectively, assuming $Z_{\rm D}$ decays exclusively into Standard Model particles. A key innovation is our optimized implementation of $M_{Z_{\rm D}}$-dependent cuts on $m_{\rm recoil}$, which accounts for the energy-dependent detector response. For heavier $Z_{\rm D}$, the associated photon becomes less energetic, leading to better photon energy resolution and thus enabling more stringent $m_{\rm recoil}$ cuts. This approach enhances $\varepsilon$ sensitivity for heavier $Z_{\rm D}$. Conversely, for lighter $Z_{\rm D}$, the lower-energy electron pair from $Z_{\rm D} \to e^+e^-$ enables tighter cuts on the invariant mass of the electron pair ($m_{ee}$), providing better sensitivity in the lighter mass regime. Combining these complementary $m_{\rm recoil}$- and $m_{ee}$-based selections with both $jjX$ and $e^+e^-$ channels, we achieve $\varepsilon$ sensitivity down to $O\left(10^{-3}\right)$ as $M_{Z_{\rm D}}$ approaches $\sqrt{s}$, substantially surpassing the reach of a 100 TeV proton-proton collider. Even if $Z_{\rm D}$ decays into dark-sector particles, the recoil mass method remains effective, establishing muon colliders as powerful facilities for exploring heavy dark sectors.</description>

      <title>Constraining electromagnetic couplings of ultralight scalars from compact stars</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.02286</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.02286v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: If an ultralight scalar interacts with the electromagnetic fields of a compact rotating star, then a long-range scalar field is developed outside the star. The Coulomb-like profile of the scalar field is equivalent to an effective scalar charge on the star. In a binary star system, the scalar-induced charge would result in a long-range force between the stars, with the scalar field acting as the mediator. The scalar-photon interactions would modify Maxwell's equations for electromagnetic fields in vacuum, resulting in a modified dispersion relation. This could be observed as an apparent redshift for photons emitted by such sources. The scalar field would also induce additional electric and magnetic fields and hence affect the electromagnetic energy radiated from such compact objects. A scalar field sourced by time-varying electromagnetic fields can also carry away energy from a compact star in the form of radiation, and hence contribute to its spin-down luminosity. We constrain the scalar-photon coupling from the measurements of the electromagnetic radiation of the compact star and its spin-down luminosity. We also project the prospective bounds on these couplings with future measurements of the apparent redshifts of compact stars and of the long-range force between two magnetars in a binary. We analyze the systems of the binary pulsar PSR J0737-3039, the Crab pulsar, the soft gamma repeater SGR 1806-20, and the gamma ray burst GRB 080905A. The bounds on the coupling can be significantly improved by future measurements of compact stars with large magnetic fields, experiments with better sensitivity, and precision clock measurements.</description>

      <title>How to determine nucleon polarization at existing collider experiments?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.02439</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.02439v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose a novel approach to measure spin polarization of nucleons produced in electron--positron collisions. Using existing tracking devices and supporting structure material, general-purpose spectrometers can be utilized as a large-acceptance polarimeter without hardware upgrade. With the proposed approach, the spin polarization of nucleons can be revealed, providing a complementary and accurate description of the final-state particles. This could have far-reaching implications, such as enabling the complete determination of the time-like electromagnetic form factors of nucleons.</description>

      <title>Non-linear corrections to the derivative of nuclear reduced cross-section at small $x$ at a future electron-ion collider</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.02459</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.02459v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The determination of non-linear corrections to the nuclear distribution functions due to the HIJING parametrization within the framework of perturbative QCD, specifically the GLR-MQ equations, is discussed. We analyze the possibility of constraining the non-linear corrections present in distribution functions using the inclusive observables that will be measured in future electron-ion colliders (EIC and EICc). The results show that non-linear corrections play an important role in heavy nuclear reduced cross sections at low $x$ and low $Q^2$ values. We find that the non-linear corrections provide the correct behavior of the extracted nuclear cross sections and that our results align with data from the nCETQ15 parametrization group. We are currently discussing a satisfactory description of the non-linear corrections to the shadowing effect at small $x$.</description>

      <title>Wide-angle pion-Delta(1232) photoproduction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.02502</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.02502v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: High-energy wide-angle photoproduction of pion-Delta final states is investigated within the handbag mechanism to twist-3 accuracy. In this approach the process amplitudes factorize in a hard partonic subprocess and and in form factors which represent 1/x-moments of p-Delta transition generalized parton distributions (GPDs) at zero skewness. The subproces, calculated to twist-3 accuracy, is the same as in pion photoproduction. The p-Delta GPDs are related to the proton-proton GPDs exploiting large-N_C results. The proton-proton GPDs as well as the twist-2 and twist-3 pion distribution amplitudes appearing in the subprocess are taken from other work. Reasonable agreement with experiment is found in this almost parameter-free analysis.</description>

      <title>Intrinsic charm and D+D- asymmetry produced in proton-proton collisions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.02507</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.02507v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the contribution of the charm-anticharrm ($c{\bar c}) asymmetry of the proton eigenstate obtained from QCD lattice gauge to the asymmetry of $D^+D^-$ and $D^0{\bar D}^0$ mesons produced in $pp$ collisions at large Feynman variables $x$. It is shown that an important tool for the establishing the intrinsic charm (IC) content of the proton is the charm hadron-antihadron asymmetry formed in $pp$ collisions. Predictions for the asymmetry as function of $x$ for different IC probabilities are presented. We show that the interference of the intrinsic $|uud c{\bar c}&gt;$ Fock state with the standard contribution from the PQCD evolution leads to a large $D^+D^-$ asymmetry at large Feynman $x$.</description>

      <title>Hybrid high-energy factorization and evolution at NLO from the high-energy limit of collinear factorization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.02619</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.02619v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We derive the scheme of NLO computations of generic observables in high-energy hadron-hadron collisions within the framework of high-energy factorization (HEF) with one off-shell initial-state parton, by taking a high-energy limit of the NLO computation in collinear factorization (CF). The NLO terms belonging to the projectile and target are identified and the ambiguity of projectile-target separation is related with the Collins-Soper scale ($\mu_Y$). The NLO unintegrated PDF(UPDF) is constructed in terms of the usual PDFs, and its $\mu_Y$-evolution reproduces the Collins-Soper-Sterman equation in the TMD limit ($|k_\perp|\ll \mu_Y$). The resummation of high-energy logarithms is taken care of by the BFKL-Collins-Ellis evolution of the Green's function in the UPDF.</description>

      <title>Footprint in fitting $B\to D$ vector form factor and determination for $D$-meson leading-twist LCDA</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.02694</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.02694v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we fit the $B\to D$ vector transition form factor (TFF) by using the data measured by BABAR and Belle Collaborations within Monte Carlo (MC) method. Meanwhile, the $B\to D$ TFF is also calculated by using the QCD light-cone sum rules approach (LCSRs) within right-handed chiral current correlation function. In which, the $D$-meson leading-twist light-cone distribution amplitude (LCDA) serves as crucial input parameter is reconstructed with light-cone harmonic oscillator model where its longitudinal behavior primarily determined by the model-free parameter $B_{2;D}$. After matching the TFF with two scenarios from MC and LCSRs, we have $B_{2;D}=0.17$. Then, we present the curve of $D$-meson leading-twist LCDA in comparison with other theoretical approaches. Subsequently, the $B\to D$ TFF $f_{+}^{BD}(q^2)$ at the large recoil region is $f_{+}^{BD}(0)=0.625^{+0.087}_{-0.113}$, which is compared in detail with theoretical estimates and experimental measurements. Furthermore, we calculate the decay width and branching ratio of the Cabibbo-favored semileptonic decays $B\to D\ell \bar{\nu}_{\ell}$, which lead to the results $\mathcal{B}(B^0\to D^-\ell ^+\nu _{\ell}) =(1.96_{-0.55}^{+0.51})\times 10^{-2}$ and $\mathcal{B}(B^+\to \bar{D}^0\ell ^+\nu _{\ell}) =(2.12_{-0.59}^{+0.55})\times 10^{-2}$. Finally, we predict the CKM matrix element with two scenarios $|V_{cb}|_{\rm SR}=42.97_{-2.57}^{+2.42}\times 10^{-3}$ and $|V_{cb} |_{\rm MC}=42.82_{-1.29}^{+1.07}\times 10^{-3}$ from $B^0\to D^-\ell^+\nu_{\ell}$, $|V_{cb}|_{\rm SR}=41.93_{-1.05}^{+1.03}\times 10^{-3}$ and $|V_{cb} |_{\rm MC}=41.82_{-0.25}^{+0.23}\times 10^{-3}$ from $B^+\to \bar{D}^0\ell^+\nu_{\ell}$ which are in good agreement with theoretical and experimental predictions.</description>

      <title>Topological susceptibility and axion properties in the presence of a strong magnetic field within the three-flavor NJL model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.02782</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.02782v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We analyze the topological susceptibility and the axion properties in the presence of an external uniform magnetic field, considering a three flavor NJL model that includes strong CP violation through a 't Hooft-like flavor mixing term. Both thermal and finite density effects are studied for magnetic fields up to 1 GeV$^2$, and the corresponding phase transitions are analyzed. To capture the inverse magnetic catalysis effect at finite temperatures and densities, a magnetic field-dependent coupling constant is considered. Our analytical and numerical results are compared with those previously obtained from lattice QCD, chiral perturbation theory and other effective models.</description>

      <title>Valence quark-stopping and gluon junction-stopping scenarios in electron-nucleus collisions at the forthcoming Electron-Ion Collider: Which one is correct?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.02819</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.02819v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the current literature, two stopping scenarios are being discussed in the context of high-energy collisions: the valence quark scenario and the gluon or baryon junction scenario. In the valence quark-stopping scenario, three valence quarks each contribute one-third of the baryon number within a baryon. Conversely, in the gluon junction-stopping scenario, the gluon junction is responsible for carrying the entire baryon number. At present, there is no consensus regarding which type of stopping scenario is correct. Based on a multi-source thermal model, our investigation indicates that experimental data analyzed in previous studies suggest that the valence quark-stopping scenario is indeed accurate. It is anticipated that this scenario can be further validated through electron-nucleus ($eA$) collisions at the forthcoming Electron-Ion Collider (EIC).</description>

      <title>Evidence of the open-flavor tetraquark $T_{c\bar{s}2}$ in the process $B^+\to D^{*-}D_s^+\pi^+$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.02839</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.02839v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The newly observed open-flavor tetraquark $T_{c\bar{s}0}(2900)$ has attracted many attentions, and searching for its spin partners is crucial to exploring the internal structure of those states. In this work, we will show that, the $D_s^+\pi^+$ invariant mass distribution of the process $B^+\to D^{*-}D_s^+\pi^+$ measured by LHCb has a resonant-like structure around 2830~MeV, which could be associated with the predicted $T_{c\bar{s}2}$, the spin $J=2$ partner of $T_{c\bar{s}0}(2900)$. Furthermore, we have evaluated the momenta of the angular mass distribution, which are very different for each of the spin assumptions, and have larger strength at the resonant energy than the peaks seen in the angular integrated mass distribution.
  We make a call for the experimental determination of these magnitudes, which could be used to pin down the existence of the $T_{c\bar{s}2}$.</description>

      <title>Roles of the $N(1535)$ and $a_0(980)$ in the process $\Lambda_c^+ \to \pi^+\eta n$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.02859</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.02859v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We have investigated the process $\Lambda_c^+ \to \pi^+\eta n$ by taking into account the contributions from the nucleon resonance $N(1535)$ and the scalar meson $a_0(980)$, which could be dynamically generated by the interaction of the $S$-wave pseudosalar meson-octet baryon and the $S$-wave pseudosalar meson-pseudosalar meson, respectively. Our results show that, in $\eta n$ invariant mass distribution, there is a significant near-threshold enhancement structure, which could be associated with $N(1535)$. On the other hand, one can find a clear cusp structure of $a_0(980)$ in $\pi^+\eta$ invariant mass distribution. We further estimate the ratio $R$ = $\mathcal{B}(\Lambda_c^+ \to a_0(980)^+ n)/\mathcal{B}(\Lambda_c^+ \to \pi^+\eta n)\approx 0.313$. Our results can be tested by BESIII, Belle~II, and the proposed Super Tau-Charm Facility experiments in the future.</description>

      <title>Electroweak phase transition with the confinement scale of the strong sector or Dilaton in the minimal composite Higgs model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.02972</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.02972v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The minimal Composite Higgs model (MCHM) provides an effective trigger for the Baryogenesis scenario through the confinement scale of the strong sector ($f$) or Dilaton ($\chi$). $f$ is a parameter with mass dimension, which stores the resonances of particles at high energies, has a suitable value of about 800 GeV. But when $300$ GeV $\le f \le 400$ GeV, the effective Higgs potential has a first order electroweak phase transition. Therefore, although $f$ cannot be a perfect trigger, it does suggest an effective approach that accommodates the resonances of particles. Thus the investigation of the electroweak phase transition according to $f$ has confirmed that the inclusion of Dilaton in the effective potential is reasonable. Accordingly, we derive a Dilaton potential with appropriate parameter domains and $f=800$ GeV, the mass of Dilaton ranges from 300 GeV to 700 GeV, which will give an electroweak phase transition strength greater than 1 and less than 3, enough for a first order phase transition. This is a directly and clearly prove of the triggers for the first order EWPT in MCHM.</description>

      <title>Geometric optics analysis in Lorentz violating Chern-Simons electrodynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.03047</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.03047v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the geometric optics limit of the electrodynamics in the presence of Lorentz violating Chern-Simons term in (3+1) dimensions. The Chern-Simons term couples the dual electromagnetic tensor to an external four-vector and the electromagnetic gauge field. For a fixed external four-vector, such a Chern-Simons term violates Lorentz invariance while maintaining the gauge invariance of the theory. In this analysis, we look into the consequences of Lorentz symmetry violating Chern-Simons term within the geometric optics limit of light rays propagating from a source to an observation point. We argue that the Ricci tensor and the Lorentz-violating term modify the dynamical equation for the gauge vector field. However, in the geometric optics limit, neither the space-time curvature nor the Chern-Simons term influences the intensity of light. Unlike the intensity, the polarization of light, on the other hand, can be influenced by the Lorentz-violating Chern-Simons term. Due to such an effect in the presence of Chern-Simons term, the photon emitting from astrophysical objects can undergo a change in polarization as it propagates in space.</description>

      <title>Experimental limits on quantum decoherence from $B$ meson systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.03136</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.03136v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Neutral $B$-meson systems serve as critical tests of the Standard Model and play a key role in limiting its extensions. While these systems are typically studied under the assumption of perfect quantum coherence, interactions with the environment can lead to decoherence. Such decoherence effects can obscure the measured values of key parameters such as the oscillation frequency $ \Delta m $ and $CP$-violating parameter $ \sin 2\beta $. Using the experimental data, we present the first combined analysis of mixing asymmetry and $CP$-asymmetry measurements for $ B_d $-mesons, which indicates that $ \lambda_d $ is non-zero at approximately $ 6 \,\sigma $. We also establish the first experimental constraints on the decoherence parameter $ \lambda_s $ for $ B_s $-mesons, finding it to be non-zero at $ 3 \,\sigma $.</description>

      <title>Predictions for Bottomonium from a Relativistic Screened Potential Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.03147</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.03147v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, a comprehensive analysis of the mass spectra and decay properties of bottomonium states using a relativistic screened potential model is carried out. The mass spectrum, decay constants, $E1$ transitions, $M1$ transitions, and annihilation decay widths are evaluated. The interpretation of $\Upsilon(10355)$, $\Upsilon(10580)$,$\Upsilon(10860)$, and $\Upsilon(11020)$ as $S-D$ mixed bottomonium states are analysed. The $\Upsilon(10355)$ state is considered to be $3S-2D$, $\Upsilon(10580)$ state is considered to be $4S-3D$ mixed state, the $\Upsilon(10753)$ is obtained as purely $\Upsilon_{1}(3D)$ bottomonium state, and the $\Upsilon(10860)$ and $\Upsilon(11020)$ are deemed to be $5S-4D$ mixed states.</description>

      <title>Search for continuous gravitational wave signals from luminous dark photon superradiance clouds with LVK O3 observations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.02052</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.02052v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Superradiance clouds of kinetically-mixed dark photons around spinning black holes can produce observable multi-messenger electromagnetic and gravitational wave signals. The cloud generates electric fields of up to a Teravolt-per-meter, which lead to a cascade production of charged particles, yielding a turbulent quasi-equilibrium plasma around the black hole, and resulting in electromagnetic fluxes ranging from supernova to pulsar-like luminosities. For stellar mass black holes, such systems resemble millisecond pulsars and are expected to emit pulsating radio waves and continuous gravitational waves (CWs) within the LIGO-Virgo-KAGRA (LVK) sensitivity band. We select 44 sources with approximately coincident frequencies or positive frequency drifts from existing pulsar catalogs as potential candidates of long-lasting superradiance clouds around old galactic black holes. For a subset of 34 sources that are well measured and have not been previously targeted, we perform the first search for CW emission in LVK data from the third observing run. We find no evidence of a CW signal and place 95% confidence level upper limits on the emitted strain amplitude. We interpret these results, together with limits from previous searches, in terms of the underlying dark photon theory by performing an analysis of the expected signals from superradiance clouds from galactic black holes. We find that, even for moderately spinning black holes, the absence of an observed CW signal disfavors a discrete set of dark photon masses between about $10^{-13}$ $\rm{eV}/c^2$ and $10^{-12}$ $\rm{eV}/c^2$ and kinetic mixing couplings in the range of $10^{-9}$-$10^{-7}$, subject to assumptions about the properties of the black hole population and the cloud's electromagnetic emission.</description>

      <title>Parity doubled nucleons can rapidly cool neutron stars</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.02055</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.02055v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In confined hadronic matter, the spontaneous breaking and restoration of chiral symmetry can be described by considering nucleons, $N_{+}(939)$, and excited states of opposite parity, $N_{-}(1535)$. In a cold, dense hadronic phase where chiral symmetry remains spontaneously broken, direct Urca decay processes involving the $N_{-}$ are possible, e.g. $N_- \rightarrow N_+ + e^- + \bar{\nu}_e$. We show that at low temperature and moderate densities, because the $N_-$ is much heavier than the $N_+$, such cooling dominates over standard $N_+$ direct Urca processes. This provides a strong constraint on chiral symmetry restoration in neutron stars.</description>

      <title>Does the Z boson have a lighter cousin?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.02083</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.02083v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In the quenched electroweak theory on the lattice I construct a set of physical states which overlap the physical photon and Z boson states. This is done by employing eigenstates of the covariant lattice Laplacian, in addition to the Higgs and lattice link variables, to construct gauge invariant vector boson creation operators. Diagonalizing the transfer matrix in the subspace of Hilbert space spanned by this set yields a massless photon and massive Z particle, as expected. But in the numerical data there is evidence for more vector bosons in the spectrum, albeit with considerable uncertainty in their masses, with the lowest finite mass particle in the range of 3-4 GeV.</description>

      <title>Multi-wavelength observations of a jet launch in real time from the post-changing-look Active Galaxy 1ES 1927+654</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.02340</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.02340v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present results from a high cadence multi-wavelength observational campaign of the enigmatic changing look AGN 1ES 1927+654 from May 2022- April 2024, coincident with an unprecedented radio flare (an increase in flux by a factor of $\sim 60$ over a few months) and the emergence of a spatially resolved jet at $0.1-0.3$ pc scales (Meyer et al. 2024). Companion work has also detected a recurrent quasi-periodic oscillation (QPO) in the $2-10$ keV band with an increasing frequency ($1-2$ mHz) over the same period (Masterson et al., 2025). During this time, the soft X-rays ($0.3-2$ keV) monotonically increased by a factor of $\sim 8$, while the UV emission remained near-steady with $&lt;30\%$ variation and the $2-10$ keV flux showed variation by a factor $\lesssim 2$. The weak variation of the $2-10$ keV X-ray emission and the stability of the UV emission suggest that the magnetic energy density and accretion rate are relatively unchanged, and that the jet could be launched due to a reconfiguration of the magnetic field (toroidal to poloidal) close to the black hole. Advecting poloidal flux onto the event horizon would trigger the Blandford-Znajek (BZ) mechanism, leading to the onset of the jet. The concurrent softening of the coronal slope (from $\Gamma= 2.70\pm 0.04$ to $\Gamma=3.27\pm 0.04$), the appearance of a QPO, and low coronal temperature ($kT_{e}=8_{-3}^{+8}$ keV) during the radio outburst suggest that the poloidal field reconfiguration can significantly impact coronal properties and thus influence jet dynamics. These extraordinary findings in real time are crucial for coronal and jet plasma studies, particularly as our results are independent of coronal geometry.</description>

      <title>Atmospheric Antideuteron Flux Within a Dynamical Coalescence Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.02422</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.02422v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Cosmic antideuterons are considered as one of the most promising tools for the indirect detection of dark matter due to their ultra-low astrophysical backgrounds. Currently only upper limits on the antideuteron flux exist, but advancements in experimental detection technology may soon lead to positive signals. A major source of background is the production of secondary antideuterons through collisions of cosmic rays with the surrounding medium. In this study, antideuteron production is modeled using a multiphase transport model (AMPT) coupled with a dynamical coalescence model. By applying a widely used leaky box model and incorporating specific processes, we present a new theoretical baseline for atmospheric secondary antideuteron flux, including a tertiary contribution, from primary cosmic rays interacting with Earth's atmosphere. Our results indicate that the atmospheric antideuteron flux are within the range of various existing calculations and remain well below the upper limits set by the Balloon-borne Experiment with a Superconducting Spectrometer (BESS). The atomospheric antideuteron is found to dominate the antideuteron background at kinetic energies below $0.26 $ GeV/n.</description>

      <title>Effect of Impurity on Inhomogeneous Vacuum and Interacting Vortices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.02500</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.02500v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the inhomogeneous abelian Higgs model with a magnetic impurity. The vacuum configuration of the symmetry-broken phase is not simply the constant Higgs vacuum but is a nontrivial function of spatial coordinates, satisfying the Euler-Lagrange equations. The vacuum of zero winding number has zero magnetic flux but its non-zero magnetic field depends on spatial coordinates. The corresponding vacuum energy is negative for weak coupling $(\lambda &lt; 1)$, zero for critical BPS coupling $(\lambda = 1)$, and positive for strong coupling $(\lambda &gt; 1)$ by an over-, exact-, and under-cancellation of the huge positive impurity energy. This distinct vacuum energies are consistent with classification of the type I and I$\!$I superconductivity in dirty conventional superconductors. Non-BPS vortex configurations are also obtained in the presence of inhomogeneity. Their rest energies favor energetically vortex-impurity composite in conventional type I$\!$I superconductivity, consistent with imperfect diamagnetism. The delta function limit of Gaussian type impurity suggests the formation of vortex-lattice composite which elucidates flux-pinning in the context of inhomogeneous field theory.</description>

      <title>Extracting more information from entropy</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.02668v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We extract the complex frequency of the lowest quasi-normal mode from the holographically computed entropy density near thermodynamic equilibrium. The system consists of a purely thermal Supersymmetric Yang-Mills N=4 plasma in homogeneous isotropization dynamics. The initial state is far-from-equilibrium, proceeding to thermalization over time. The system evolves to equilibrium entropy forming a stairway pattern. The analysis reveals that the rate of increase of the stairway is twice the decay rate of the lowest quasi-normal mode. This leads us to propose a model explaining how this information is encoded in entropy. The model is extended to consider finite temperature, R-charge density and scalar condensate of the medium, disclosing an additional feature. The system's main dissipation channel may shift to one driven by the scalar condensate, depending on the chemical potential.</description>

      <title>Species scale associated with Weinberg operator and bound on Majorana neutrino mass</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.02682</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.02682v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: When states in a tower like the Kaluza-Klein or the string tower couple to another state through the irrelevant operators of the same type, their contributions to the loop corrections of the relevant or the marginal operators are not negligible, threatening the perturbativity. This can be avoided provided the cutoff scale is lower than the species scale associated with the irrelevant operator. We apply this to towers of states associated with the neutrino which couple to the Higgs through the Weinberg operator, the dimension-5 irrelevant operator generating the Majorana neutrino mass. Requiring the `Majorana species scale', the species scale associated with the Weinberg operator, to be below the gravitational species scale, one finds the lower bound on the Majorana neutrino mass determined by the species number. The Festina-Lente bound also gives the lower bound on the Majorana neutrino mass, but it is not so stringent. Meanwhile, even if the neutrino mass is of the Dirac type at the renormalizable level, the Majorana mass term still can be written in the effective field theory action so far as the Weinberg operator is not forbidden. Even if the Majorana neutrino mass is larger than the Dirac one, so far as there are sufficient degrees of freedom with mass smaller than the scale of the cosmological constant, the observation of the Majorana nature of the neutrino may not contradict to quantum gravity constraints which rules out the neutrino mass purely given by the Majorana type.</description>

      <title>Axial-Vector and Tensor Spin Polarization and Chiral Restoration in Quark Matter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.02713</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.02713v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study spontaneous spin-polarizations of quark matter with flavour $SU(2)$ symmetry at zero temperature in the NJL model. In a relativistic framework, there are two types of the spin-spin interactions: axial-vector (AV) and tensor (T), which accordingly give rise to different types of spin-polarized materials. When the spin-spin interaction is sufficiently strong, the spin-polarized phase emerges within a specific density region. As the spin-spin interaction becomes stronger, this phase extends over higher density region beyond the critical density of chiral restoration in normal quark matter. We show that the spin-polarized phase leads to another kind of the spontaneous chiral symmetry breaking phase.</description>

      <title>Contribution of Unresolved Sources to Diffuse Gamma-Ray Emission from the Galactic Plane</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.02720</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.02720v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The diffuse gamma-ray emission from the Milky Way serves as a crucial probe for understanding the propagation and interactions of cosmic rays within our galaxy. The Galactic diffuse gamma-ray emission between 10 TeV and 1 PeV has been recently measured by the square kilometer array (KM2A) of the Large High Altitude Air Shower Observatory (LHAASO). The flux is higher than predicted for cosmic rays interacting with the interstellar medium. In this work, we utilize a non-parametric method to derive the source count distribution using the published first LHAASO source catalog. Based on this distribution, we calculate the contribution of unresolved sources to the diffuse emission measured by KM2A. When comparing our results to the measured diffuse gamma-ray emission, we demonstrate that for the outer Galactic region, the contributions from unresolved sources and those predicted by models are roughly consistent with experimental observations within the uncertainty. However, for the inner Galactic region, additional components are required to account for the observed data.</description>

      <title>Extracting the Speed of Sound in Heavy-Ion Collisions: A Study of Quantum Fluctuations and Thermalization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.02777</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.02777v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The thermalization of quark-gluon plasma created in heavy-ion collisions is crucial for understanding its behavior as a relativistic fluid and the thermodynamic properties of the Quantum Chromodynamics (QCD). This study investigates the role of fluctuations in the relationship between transverse momentum and particle multiplicity, with a particular focus on their impact on extracting the QCD speed of sound. In a thermalized quark-gluon plasma, fluctuations are dominantly quantum in origin and follow a Gaussian distribution due to their independence from the thermodynamic response. In contrast, non-thermalized systems display non-Gaussian fluctuations, reflecting the breakdown of thermalization. By leveraging the Gaussianity condition of quantum fluctuations, the physical value of the speed of sound can be extracted statistically, even in the presence of significant event-by-event fluctuations. This framework provides a robust diagnostic tool for probing thermalization and extracting thermodynamic properties in both large and small collision systems.</description>

      <title>Constraining the chiral magnetic effect using spectator and participant planes across Au+Au and isobar collisions at $\sqrt{s_{_{\rm NN}}} = 200$ GeV</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.02794</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.02794v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the chiral magnetic effect (CME) in relativistic heavy-ion collisions through an improved two-plane method analysis of the $\Delta\gamma$ observable, probing $\mathcal{CP}$-symmetry breaking in strong interactions and topological properties of the QCD vacuum. Using a multiphase transport model with tunable CME strengths, we systematically compare Au+Au and isobar collisions at $\sqrt{s_{_{\rm NN}}} = 200$ GeV. We observe a reduced difference in the CME signal-to-background ratio between the spectator and participant planes for Au+Au collisions compared to isobar collisions. A comprehensive chi-square analysis across all three collision systems reveals stronger CME signatures in Au+Au collisions relative to isobar collisions, particularly when measured with respect to the spectator plane. Our findings demonstrate an enhanced experimental reliability of the two-plane method for the CME detection in Au+Au collisions.</description>

      <title>Revisiting the Chern-Simons interaction during inflation with a non-canonical pseudo-scalar</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.02890</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.02890v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A Chern-Simons interaction between a pseudo-scalar field and a U(1) gauge field results in the generation of a chiral gravitational wave background. The detection of this signal is contrasted by the fact that this coupling also generates primordial scalar perturbations, on which strong limits exist, particularly at CMB scales. In this study, we propose a new extension of this mechanism characterized by a non-canonical kinetic term for the pseudo-scalar. We find that a decrease of the sound speed of the pseudo-scalar field highly suppresses the sourced scalar with respect to the sourced tensor modes, thus effectively allowing for the production of a greater tensor signal. Contrary to the case of a canonical axion inflaton, it is in this case possible for the sourced tensor modes to dominate over the vacuum ones without violating the non-Gaussianity constraints from the scalar sector, which results in a nearly totally polarized tensor signal at CMB scales. We also study the extension of this mechanisms to the multiple field case, in which the axion is not the inflaton.</description>

      <title>Radiation-Reaction and Angular Momentum Loss at $\mathcal{O}(G^4)$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.02904</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.02904v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We point out that the contribution to the $\mathcal{O}(G^4)$ angular momentum loss for two-body scattering involving two radiation modes, $J_\text{2rad}$, is determined by the radiation-reaction contribution to the one-loop waveform. The latter is proportional to the tree-level one, and this reduces the calculation of $J_\text{2rad}$ to cut two-loop integrals. We exploit this simplification, which follows from unitarity, to obtain a closed-form expression for $J_\text{2rad}$ for generic velocities, which resums all fractional post-Newtonian (PN) corrections to the $\mathcal{O}(G^4)$ angular momentum loss starting at 1.5PN.</description>

      <title>Isotropic background and anisotropies of gravitational waves induced by cosmological soliton isocurvature perturbations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.02965</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.02965v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Cosmological solitons are widely predicted by scenarios of the early Universe. In this work, we investigate the isotropic background and anisotropies of gravitational waves (GWs) induced by soliton isocurvature perturbations, especially considering the effects of non-Gaussianity in these perturbations. Regardless of non-Gaussianity, the energy-density fraction spectrum of isocurvature-induced GWs approximately has a universal shape within the perturbative regime, thus serving as a distinctive signal of solitons. We derive the angular power spectrum of isocurvature-induced GWs to characterize their anisotropies. Non-Gaussianity plays a key role in generating anisotropies through the couplings between large- and small-scale isocurvature perturbations, making the angular power spectrum to be a powerful probe of non-Gaussianity. Moreover, the isocurvature-induced GWs have nearly no cross-correlations with the cosmic microwave background, providing a new observable to distinguish them from other GW sources, e.g., GWs induced by cosmological curvature perturbations enhanced at small scales. Therefore, detection of both the isotropic background and anisotropies of isocurvature-induced GWs could reveal important implications for the solitons as well as the early Universe.</description>

      <title>Cosmic Whispers of the Early Universe: Gravitational Waves and Dark Matter from Primordial Black Holes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.03065</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.03065v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Various mechanisms have been suggested for the formation of Primordial Black Holes (PBHs), and this thesis focuses on the standard mechanism based on the critical collapse of cosmological fluctuations. The underlying idea is that during inflation, a period of rapid expansion in the early Universe, large cosmological fluctuations could have been generated. After inflation, when the cosmic horizon reached a size comparable to these fluctuations, if the latter were high enough, they could collapse and form a PBH.
  Beyond the fascinating possibility that these compact objects might make up all or part of the Dark Matter (DM) we observe today, their formation and existence is also associated with the generation of gravitational waves (GWs). These waves could contribute to the merger events observed by the LIGO/Virgo/KAGRA Collaboration (LVK) or account for signals detected by pulsar timing array experiments (PTA). In the first part of this thesis, we investigate the PBH scenario, examining the computation of the abundance beyond the Gaussian paradigm. In the second part, we discuss how PBH formation can produce a stochastic GW background and how observations, related to recent experiments such as LVK and PTA collaborations, can help in distinguishing between different PBH production models. Finally, in the last part, we investigate some aspects of the interplay between black holes and fundamental physics in the early Universe, describing some characteristics and challenges of various PBH production models.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2501.03105v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We use resurgent extrapolation and continuation methods to extract detailed analytic information about the tilted cusp anomalous dimension solely from its weak coupling and strong coupling expansions. This enables accurate and smooth interpolation between the weak and strong coupling limits, and identifies the relevant singularities governing the finite radius of convergence of the weak coupling expansion and the asymptotic nature of the strong coupling expansion. The input data is purely perturbative, generated from the BES equations, and these resurgent methods extract accurate non-perturbative information which matches the underlying physical structure.</description>

      <title>Computing the UV-finite electromagnetic corrections to the hadronic vacuum polarization in the muon $(g-2)$ from lattice QCD</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.03192</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.03192v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In order to reach a precision of $0.2\%$ on the hadronic vacuum polarization (HVP) contribution to the anomalous magnetic moment of the muon, $(g-2)_\mu$, such that the full Standard-Model prediction matches in precision the direct experimental measurement, it is crucial to include the leading, O($\alpha$) electromagnetic corrections to HVP. In this work, we determine an important contribution to the latter from a diagram comprised of two two-point quark-loops, connected by the internal photon and gluons. This ultraviolet-finite correction is calculated from lattice QCD using a coordinate-space formalism, where photons are treated in the continuum and infinite volume. Our result amounts to a $(-0.89\pm 0.18)\%$ correction to the leading-order HVP contribution to $(g-2)_\mu$. To overcome the worsening statistical noise at large distances, our analysis is combined with phenomenological models featuring light pseudoscalar mesons with masses below 1 GeV. In particular, our data show a very steep mass dependence as dictated by the charged pion loop. Similarly, the other diagrams appearing in the O$(\alpha)$-corrections to the HVP with the internal photon connecting two separate quark loops are also ultraviolet-finite and can be computed with the same formalism.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2007.14300v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In high-energy leptonic collisions well above the electroweak scale, the collinear splitting mechanism of the electroweak gauge bosons becomes the dominant phenomena via the initial state radiation and the final state showering. We point out that at future high-energy lepton colliders, such as a multi-TeV muon collider, the electroweak parton distribution functions (EW PDFs) should be adopted as the proper description for partonic collisions of the initial states. The leptons and electroweak gauge bosons are the EW partons, that evolve according to the unbroken Standard Model (SM) gauge group and that effectively resum potentially large collinear logarithms. We present a formalism for the EW PDFs at the Next-to-Leading-Log (NLL) accuracy. We calculate semi-inclusive cross sections for some important SM processes at a future multi-TeV muon collider. We conclude that it is appropriate to adopt the EW PDF formalism for future high-energy lepton colliders.</description>

      <title>Exposing the dead-cone effect of jet quenching in QCD medium</title>

      <description>arXiv:2205.14668v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: When an energetic parton traverses the hot QCD medium it may suffer multiple scattering and lose its energy. The medium-induced gluon radiation for a massive quark will be suppressed relative to that of a light quark due to the dead-cone effect. The development of new declustering techniques of jet evolution makes a direct study of the dead-cone effect in the QCD medium possible for the first time. In this work, we compute the emission angle distribution of the charm-quark initiated splittings in $\rm D^0$ meson tagged jet and that of the light parton initiated splittings in an inclusive jet in p+p and Pb+Pb at $\rm 5.02$~TeV by utilizing the declustering techniques of jet evolution. The heavy quark propagation and indued energy loss in the QCD medium are simulated with the SHELL model based on the Langevin equation. By directly comparing the emission angle distributions of charm-quark-initiated splittings with those of light parton-initiated splittings at the same energy intervals of the initial parton, we provide insights into the fundamental splitting structure in A+A collisions, thereby exploring the possible observation of the dead-cone effect in medium-induced radiation. We further investigate the case of the emission angle distributions normalized to the number of splittings and find the dead-cone effect will broaden the emission angle of the splitting and reduce the possibility to occur such splitting, therefore leading the massive parton to lose less energy. We also find the collisional energy loss mechanism has a negligible impact on the medium modification to the emission angle distribution of the charm-quark initiated splittings for $\rm D^0$-meson tagged jets.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2211.05143v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A major task in particle physics is the measurement of rare signal processes. Even modest improvements in background rejection, at a fixed signal efficiency, can significantly enhance the measurement sensitivity. Building on prior research by others that incorporated physical symmetries into neural networks, this work extends those ideas to include additional physics-motivated features. Specifically, we introduce energy-dependent particle interaction strengths, derived from leading-order SM predictions, into modern deep learning architectures, including Transformer Architectures (Particle Transformer), and Graph Neural Networks (Particle Net). These interaction strengths, represented as the SM interaction matrix, are incorporated into the attention matrix (transformers) and edges (graphs). Our results in event classification show that the integration of all physics-motivated features improves background rejection by $10\%-40\%$ over baseline models, with an additional gain of approximately $10\%$ (absolute) due to the SM interaction matrix. This study also provides one of the broadest comparisons of event classifiers to date, demonstrating how various architectures perform across this task. A simplified statistical analysis demonstrates that these enhanced architectures yield significant improvements in signal significance compared to a graph network baseline.</description>

      <title>Asymmetric long-lived dark matter and leptogenesis from type-III seesaw framework</title>

      <description>arXiv:2305.11138v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We propose a simple model in the type-III seesaw framework to explain the neutrino mass, asymmetric dark matter (ADM), and baryon asymmetry of the Universe. We extend the standard model with a vector-like singlet lepton ($\chi$) and a hypercharge zero scalar triplet ($\Delta$) in addition to three hypercharge zero triplet fermions($\Sigma_i~,i=1,2,3$). A $Z_2$ symmetry is imposed under which $\chi$ and $\Delta$ are odd, while all other particles are even. As a result, the lightest $Z_2$ odd particle $\chi$ behaves as a candidate of DM. In the early Universe, the $CP$-violating out-of-equilibrium decay of heavy triplet fermions to the Standard Model lepton ($L$) and Higgs ($H$) generate a net lepton asymmetry, while that of triplet fermions to $\chi$ and $\Delta$ generate a net asymmetric DM. The lepton asymmetry is converted to the required baryon asymmetry of the Universe via the electroweak sphalerons, while the asymmetry in $\chi$ remains as a DM relic that we observe today. We introduce a singlet scalar $\Phi$, with mass $M_\phi &lt; M_\chi$, which not only assists to deplete the symmetric component of $\chi$ through the annihilation process: $\bar{\chi} \chi \to \Phi \Phi$ but also paves a path to detect DM $\chi$ at direct search experiments through $\Phi-H$ mixing. The electro-weak symmetry breaking induces a non-zero vacuum expectation value to $\Delta$, which leads to an unstable asymmetric DM ranging from a few MeV to hundreds of GeV. We then explore the displaced vertex signatures of the charged components of the scalar triplet $\Delta$ at colliders.</description>

      <title>Inclusive $\bar{B} \to X_s \ell^+ \ell^-$ with a hadronic mass cut</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.03134</link>
      <description>arXiv:2306.03134v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The hadronic mass spectrum of inclusive $\bar{B} \to X_s \ell^+ \ell^-$ is investigated at next to leading order in the heavy quark expansion. For mild cuts on the hadronic mass, the expansion, which applies when the cut is released, remains convergent. However, the cuts used at BaBar and Belle to reduce backgrounds from charged current semileptonic processes are too severe for a description in terms of matrix elements of local operators to apply. Strategies for interpolating between the two regions are discussed.</description>

      <title>Linear relation between short range correlation and EMC effect of gluons in nuclei</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.16662</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.16662v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We explore the EMC effect of gluons through heavy quark production in deep inelastic scattering (DIS) and the nucleon-nucleon short range correlation (SRC) from sub-threshold photoproduction of the $J/\psi$. Applying an effective field theory analysis, we scrutinize the gluon parton distribution functions in nuclear environment and propose a linear relation between the slope of reduced cross section ratio, which reflects the magnitude of gluon EMC effect, and the $J/\psi$ production cross section at the photon energy $E_\gamma = 7.0\,\textrm{GeV}$ in the nucleus rest frame, a characteristic representative of SRC. This finding is supported by a numerical calculation using the available phenomenological results for gluon nuclear parton distribution functions (nPDFs). Examining this linear relation by the forthcoming experimental data on electron-ion collider allows to decipher nuclear effects of gluon distributions and enhance our comprehension of the substructure in bound nuclei.</description>

      <title>Constraints from the Neutron EDM on Subleading Effective Operators for Direct Dark Matter Searches</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.02083</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.02083v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Interactions between Dark Matter (DM) and nucleons relevant for direct search experiments can be organised in a model independent manner using a Galiliean invariant, non--relativistic effective field theory (NREFT). Here one expands the interactions in powers of the momentum transfer $\vec{q}$ and DM velocity $\vec{v}$. This approach generates many operators. The potentially most important subleading operators are odd under $T$, and can thus only be present in a theory with $CP$ violating interactions. We consider two such operators, called $\mathcal{O}_{10}$ and $\mathcal{O}_{11}$ in the literature, in simplified models with neutral spin$-0$ mediators; the couplings are chosen such that the coefficient of the leading spin independent (SI) operator, which survives for $\vec{v} \rightarrow 0$, vanishes at tree level. However, it is generically induced at the next order in perturbation theory. We perform a numerical comparison of the number of scattering events between interactions involving the $T-$odd operators and the corresponding loop induced SI contributions. We find that for ''maximal'' $CP$ violation the former can dominate over the latter. However, in two of the three models we consider, an electric dipole moment of the neutron (nEDM) is induced at two--loop order. We find that the experimental bound on the nEDM typically leads to undetectably small rates induced by ${\mathcal O}_{10}$. On the other hand, the model leading to a nonvanishing coefficient of ${\mathcal O}_{11}$ does not induce an nEDM.</description>

      <title>The structure of the f_0(980) from system size dependent hadronic resonance ratios in p+p, p+Pb, and Pb+Pb collisions at the LHC</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.12629</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.12629v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: It is shown that the hadronic phase in ultra-relativistic heavy ion collisions can be used to understand the properties of the $f_0(980)$ resonance. In particular it is shown that the centrality dependence of the $f_0(980)/\pi$ and $f_0(980)/\phi$ ratios depends strongly on the $f_0(980)\rightarrow \overline{K}+K$ branching ratio and whether the $f_0(980)$ is produced as a $\left | \overline{q}q \right \rangle$ or $\left | \overline{s}s \right \rangle$ state. These conclusions are drawn from calculations within the partial chemical equilibrium of the HRG model within Thermal-FIST as well as with the fully non-equilibrium hybrid-transport approach UrQMD. Our findings show how the hadronic phase in heavy ion collisions can be used for studies of exotic hadron properties otherwise possible only in dedicated experiments such as PANDA.</description>

      <title>Background-Induced Forces from Dark Relics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.13894</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.13894v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Light particles quadratically coupled to nucleons induce macroscopic forces in matter. While a quantum effect always exists, an additional force occurs in the presence of a finite density of the light particles. We compute and classify such background-induced forces for particles of spin $0,\frac{1}{2},1$ in the framework of effective field theory. We show that, at short distance, the background-induced forces exhibit a universal behavior that depends solely on the moments of the phase space distribution function of the light particles. We compute the forces in the case of dark particles densities that may realistically occur in cosmology, assuming either cosmically homogeneous or virialized phase space distributions. For homogeneous distributions -- analogous to cosmic neutrinos, all the background-induced forces remain, unlike the quantum ones, exponentially unsuppressed at large distance, implying that large scale fifth force experiments are highly sensitive to dark relics. Moreover at zero mass the forces from dark bosons are generically enhanced with respect to their quantum counterpart due to Bose-Einstein distribution. Overall, we find that the resulting fifth force bounds can compete with those from quantum forces. For virialized distributions -- identifiable as cold dark matter, the reach is also enhanced beyond the dark matter Compton wavelength. We obtain significant bounds on sub-keV scalar cold dark matter, that can appear in certain cosmological scenarios. A thorough adaptation of the results from the E\"ot-Wash experiment may produce powerful additional bounds.</description>

      <title>Solving arbitrary one-loop reduction via generating function</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.04644v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Recently, the concept of generating function has been employed in one-loop reduction. For one-loop integrals encompassing arbitrary tensor ranks and higher-pole contributions, the generating function can be decomposed into a tensor part and a higher-pole part. While the tensor component has been thoroughly addressed in recent studies, there remains a lack of satisfactory investigations regarding the higher-pole part. In this work, we completely solve the problem. We first establish the partial differential equations governing the higher-pole generating function. Based on these equations, we derive an integration recursion relation and solve it iteratively. This approach enables us to explore the analytical structure of higher-pole reduction and provides a valuable tool for generating reduction coefficients efficiently.</description>

      <title>Mysterious anomalies in Earth's atmosphere and strongly interacting Dark Matter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.04635</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.04635v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: It has been recently argued in \cite{Bertolucci:2016xjm, Zioutas:2020ndf, Zioutas:2023ybw} that numerous enigmatic observations remain challenging to explain within the framework of conventional physics. These anomalies include unexpected correlations between temperature variations in the stratosphere, the total electron content of the Earth's atmosphere, and earthquake activity on one hand, and the positions of planets on the other. Decades of collected data provide statistically significant evidence for these observed correlations. The work in \cite{Bertolucci:2016xjm, Zioutas:2020ndf, Zioutas:2023ybw} suggests that these correlations arise from strongly interacting ``streaming invisible matter'' which gets gravitationally focused by the solar system bodies including the Earth's inner mass distribution. Here, we propose that some of these, as well as other anomalies, may be explained by rare yet energetic events involving the so-called axion quark nuggets (AQNs) impacting the Earth. In other words, we identify the ``streaming invisible matter'' conjectured in \cite{Bertolucci:2016xjm, Zioutas:2020ndf, Zioutas:2023ybw} with AQNs, offering a concrete microscopic mechanism to elucidate the observed correlations. It is important to note that the AQN model was originally developed to address the observed similarity between the dark matter and visible matter densities in the Universe \cite{Zhitnitsky:2002qa, Zhitnitsky:2021iwg}, i.e., $\Omega_{\rm DM} \sim \Omega_{\rm visible}$ and not explain the anomalies discussed here. Nonetheless, we support our proposal by demonstrating that the intensity and spectral characteristics of AQN-induced events are consistent with the aforementioned puzzling observations.</description>

      <title>A new standard for the logarithmic accuracy of parton showers</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.02661v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We report on a major milestone in the construction of logarithmically accurate final-state parton showers, achieving next-to-next-to-leading-logarithmic (NNLL) accuracy for the wide class of observables known as event shapes. The key to this advance lies in the identification of the relation between critical NNLL analytic resummation ingredients and their parton-shower counterparts. Our analytic discussion is supplemented with numerical tests of the logarithmic accuracy of three shower variants for more than a dozen distinct event-shape observables in $Z \to q \bar q$ and Higgs $\to gg$ decays. The NNLL terms are phenomenologically sizeable, as illustrated in comparisons to data.</description>

      <title>Scaling violation in power corrections to energy correlators from the light-ray OPE</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.06668v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In recent years, energy correlators have emerged as a powerful tool to explore the field theoretic structure of strong interactions at particle colliders. In this Letter we initiate a novel study of the non-perturbative power corrections to the projected $N$-point energy correlators in the limit where the angle between the detectors is small. Using the light-ray operator product expansion (OPE) as a guiding principle, we derive the power corrections in terms of two non-perturbative quantities describing the fragmentation of quarks and gluons. In analogy with their perturbative leading-power counterpart, we show that power corrections obey a classical scaling behavior that is violated at the quantum level. This crucially results in a dependence on the hard scale $Q$ of the problem that is calculable in perturbation theory. Our analytic predictions are successfully tested against Monte Carlo simulations for both lepton and hadron colliders, marking a significant step forward in the understanding of these observables.</description>

      <title>Double pion photoproduction off nucleons in covariant chiral perturbation theory</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.08165v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The double pion photoproduction off nucleons near threshold is analyzed in a covariant baryon chiral perturbation theory up to next to leading order, where the $\Delta(1232)$, $N^*(1400)$ and $\rho(770)$ resonances are included as explicit degrees of freedom. For the process $\gamma p \to \pi^+ \pi^0 n$, the chiral results of total cross sections, invariant-mass distributions and beam-helicity asymmetry are in good agreement with the experimental data within uncertainties. For the process $\gamma p \to \pi^0 \pi^0 p$, the prediction of total cross section deviates from the existing experimental data. Once the final-state interaction of $\pi \pi$ in the isoscalar S-wave channel is taken into account, a good description of the cross section is achieved. The effect of the Roper resonance always turns out be negligible, and hence can be thrown away in future study of this process.</description>

      <title>Loop-induced masses for the first two generations with optimum flavour violation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.19179</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.19179v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A mechanism for the masses of third, second, and first generation charged fermions at the tree, 1-loop, and 2-loop levels, respectively, is proposed. The fermionic self-energy corrections that lead to this arrangement are induced through heavy vector bosons of a new gauged flavour symmetry group $G_F$. It is shown that a single Abelian group suffices as $G_F$. Moreover, the gauge charges are optimized to result in relatively smaller flavour violations in processes involving the first and second generation fermions. The scheme is explicitly implemented on the Standard Model fermions in an anomaly-free manner and is shown to be viable with observed charged fermion masses and quark mixings. Constraints from flavour violations dictate the lower limit on the new physics scale in these types of frameworks. Through optimal flavour violation, it is shown that nearly two orders of magnitude improvement can be achieved on the lower limit, leading to the new physics scale $\ge 10^3$ TeV in this case. Further improvements are possible at the cost of the down quark mass deviating more than $3 \sigma$ from its value extracted from lattice calculations. Options for inducing tiny masses for light neutrinos are also discussed.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.02701v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study thermal leptogenesis in realistic supersymmetric flipped $SU(5)\times U(1)$ unification. As up-type quarks and neutrinos are arranged in the same multiplets, they exhibit strong correlations, and it is commonly believed that the masses of right-handed (RH) neutrinos are too hierarchical to fit the low-energy neutrino data. This pattern generally predicts a lightest RH neutrino too light to yield successful leptogenesis, with any lepton-antilepton asymmetry generated from heavier neutrinos being washed out unless special flavour structures are assumed. We propose a different scenario in which the lightest two RH neutrinos $N_1$ and $N_2$ have nearby masses of order $10^9$ GeV, with thermal leptogenesis arising non-resonantly from both $N_1$ and $N_2$. We show that this pattern is consistent with all data on fermion masses and mixing and predicts the lightest physical left-handed neutrino mass to be smaller than about $10^{-7}$~eV. The Dirac phase, which does not take the maximal CP-violating value, plays an important role in leptogenesis.</description>

Abstract: This work investigates the capability of future lepton colliders to determine the sign of the gauge-Higgs coupling through the vector boson fusion (VBF) $Zh$ process. This channel offers a model-independent way to probe the sign of the gauge-Higgs coupling. Its sensitivity to interference effects and universal coupling with new physics makes it particularly effective. We show that a high-energy lepton collider such as CLIC can fully determine the sign of the gauge-Higgs coupling in a model-independent way and with high confidence.</description>

      <title>Probing $|V_{cs}|$ and lepton flavor universality through $D\to K_0^\ast(1430)\ell\nu_{\ell}$ decay</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.01512</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.01512v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we calculate the semileptonic decays $D\to K_0^\ast(1430)\ell\nu_{\ell}$ with $\ell=(e,\mu)$ induced by $c\to s\ell\nu_{\ell}$ transition. For the key component, $D\to K_0^\ast(1430)$ transition form factors (TFFs) $f_{\pm}(q^2)$ are calculated within the framework of QCD light cone sum rule. Then, we consider two scenarios for $K_0^\ast(1430)$-meson twist-2 distribution amplitude. For the scenario 1 (S1), we take the truncated form based on Gegenbauer polynomial series. Meanwhile, we also consider the scenario 2 (S2) constructed by light cone harmonic oscillator model, where the model parameters are fixed by the $K_0^\ast(1430)$-meson twist-2 distribution amplitude tenth-order $\xi$ moments calculated by using the background field theory. For the TFFs at a large recoil point, we have $f_+^{\rm (S1)}(0)=0.597^{+0.122}_{-0.121}$ and $f_-^{\rm (S1)}(0)=-0.136^{+0.023}_{-0.035}$, $f_+^{\rm (S2)}(0)= 0.663^{+0.135}_{-0.134}$, and $f_-^{\rm (S2)}(0)=-0.202^{+0.026}_{-0.046}$. After extrapolating TFFs to the whole physical $q^2$ region, we calculate the branching fractions of $D^0\to K_0^{\ast +}(1430)\ell^-\bar\nu_\ell$ and $D^+\to K_0^{\ast 0}(1430)\ell^+\nu_\ell$, which at $10^{-4}$-order level for the S1 and S2 cases. Meanwhile, we predict the CKM matrix $|V_{cs}|^{\rm (S1)}=0.973^{+0.259}_{-0.183}, |V_{cs}|^{\rm (S2)}=0.880^{+0.234}_{-0.165}$, and lepton flavor universality $\mathcal{R}^{\rm (S1)}_{K_0^*}=0.768^{+0.560}_{-0.368}, \mathcal{R}_{K_0^*}^{\rm (S2)}=0.764^{+0.555}_{-0.365}$. Finally, we discuss the angular observables of forward-backward asymmetries, lepton polarization asymmetries, and $q^2$-differential flat terms for this decay.</description>

      <title>Charged scalars at finite electric field and temperature in the optimized perturbation theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.05967</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.05967v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the symmetry breaking and restoration behavior of a self-interacting charged scalar field theory under the influence of a constant electric field and finite temperature. Our study is performed in the context of the optimized perturbation theory. The dependence of the effective potential with constant electric fields is established by means of the bosonic propagators in the Schwinger proper-time method. Explicit analytical expressions for the electric and thermal contributions are found. Our results show a very weak decreasing behavior of the vacuum expectation value as a function of the electric field, which is strengthened by the temperature effect. A first-order phase transition that occurs at zero/weak electric fields changes to a second-order phase transition under strong electric fields. The critical temperature for the phase transition exhibited a very weak dependence on the electric field. Additionally, we computed the vacuum persistence probability rate for the interacting theory, finding a peak at the critical point. The maximum value of this rate at the critical point is found to be independent of the coupling constant but depended solely on the magnitude of the electric field.</description>

      <title>$\nu$-point energy correletors with FastEEC: small-$x$ physics from LHC jets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.12235</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.12235v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In recent years, energy correlators have emerged as a powerful tool for studying jet substructure, with promising applications such as probing the hadronization transition, analyzing the quark-gluon plasma, and improving the precision of top quark mass measurements. The projected $N$-point correlator measures correlations between $N$ final-state particles by tracking the largest separation between them, showing a scaling behavior related to DGLAP splitting functions. These correlators can be analytically continued in $N$, commonly referred to as $\nu$-correlators, allowing access to non-integer moments of the splitting functions. Of particular interest is the $\nu \to 0$ limit, where the small momentum fraction behavior of the splitting functions requires resummation. Originally, the computational complexity of evaluating $\nu$-correlators for $M$ particles scaled as $2^{2M}$, making it impractical for real-world analyses. However, by using recursion, we reduce this to $M 2^M$, and through the FastEEC method of dynamically resolving subjets, $M$ is replaced by the number of subjets. This breakthrough enables, for the first time, the computation of $\nu$-correlators for LHC data. In practice, limiting the number of subjets to 16 is sufficient to achieve percent-level precision, which we validate using known integer-$\nu$ results and convergence tests for non-integer $\nu$. We have implemented this in an update to FastEEC and conducted an initial study of power-law scaling in the perturbative regime as a function of $\nu$, using CMS Open Data on jets. The results agree with DGLAP evolution, except at small $\nu$, where the anomalous dimension saturates to a value that matches the BFKL anomalous dimension.</description>

      <title>$\rho$ meson form factors and parton distribution functions in impact parameter space</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.19525</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.19525v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we investigate the form factors and impact parameter space parton distribution functions of the $\rho$ meson derived from the generalized parton distributions within the framework of the Nambu--Jona-Lasinio model,employing a proper time regularization scheme. We compare the charge $G_C$, magnetic $G_M$, and quadrupole $G_Q$ form factors with lattice data. The dressed form factors, $G_C^D$ and $G_M^D$, exhibit good agreement with lattice results; however, $G_Q^D$ is found to be harder than what is observed in lattice calculations. The Rosenbluth cross section for elastic electron scattering on a spin-one particle can be expressed through the structure functions $A(Q^2)$ and $B(Q^2)$. Additionally, the tensor polarization $T_{20}(Q^2,\theta)$ can also be formulated in terms of these form factors. We analyze the structure functions $A(Q^2)$, $B(Q^2)$ and tensor polarization function $T_{20}(Q^2,\theta)$; our findings quantitatively align with predicted values across various limits. In impact parameter space, we examine parton distribution functions along with their dependence on longitudinal momentum fraction $x$ and impact parameter $\bm{b}_{\perp}$. The width distributions in impact parameter space reveal that the range of the charge distribution \( q_C(x,\bm{b}_{\perp}^2) \) is the most extensive. In contrast, the transverse magnetic radius falls within a moderate range, while the quadrupole distribution \( q_Q(x,\bm{b}_{\perp}^2) \) demonstrates the narrowest extent.</description>

      <title>Black Holes and Baryon Number Violation: Unveiling the Origins of Early Galaxies and the Low-Mass Gap</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.10847</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.10847v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We propose that modifications to the Higgs potential within a narrow atmospheric layer near the event horizon of an astrophysical black hole could significantly enhance the rate of sphaleron transitions, as well as transform the Chern-Simons number into a dynamic variable. As a result, sphaleron transitions in this region occur without suppression, in contrast to low-temperature conditions, and each transition may generate a substantially greater baryon number than would be produced by winding around the Higgs potential in Minkowski spacetime. This effect amplifies baryon number violation near the black hole horizon, potentially leading to a considerable generation of matter. Given the possibility of a departure from equilibrium during the absorption of matter and the formation of relativistic jets in supermassive black holes, we conjecture that this process could contribute to the creation of a significant amount of matter around such black holes. This phenomenon may offer an alternative explanation for the rapid growth of supermassive black holes and their surrounding galaxies in the early Universe, as suggested by recent observations from the JWST. Furthermore, this mechanism may provide insights into the low-mass gap puzzle, addressing the observed scarcity of black holes with masses near the Oppenheimer-Volkoff limit.</description>

Abstract: Under the assumption that the various evidences of a `95 GeV' excess, seen in data at the Large Electron Positron (LEP) collider as well as the Large Hadron Collider (LHC), correspond to actual signals of new physics Beyond the Standard Model (BSM), we characterise the underlying particle explaining these in terms of its Charge/Parity (CP) quantum numbers in a model independent way. In doing so, we assume the new object having spin-0 and test the CP-even (scalar) and CP-odd (pseudoscalar) hypotheses as well superpositions of these in its $\tau^+\tau^-$ decays. We prove that the High Luminosity LHC (HL-LHC) will be in a position to disentangle the CP nature of such a new particle.</description>

      <title>Tribute to Henry Primakoff: Tests of Chiral Perturbation Theory via Primakoff Reactions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.03669</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.03669v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: INTRODUCTION: Henry Primakoff founded a field of study based on the scattering of very high energy particles (pions, kaons, $\gamma$ gamma-rays) from the Coulomb field of an atomic nucleus. Effectively, the Coulomb field acts like a target of $\gamma^*$ virtual photons, with target density proportional to $Z^2$. Primakoff was the first to describe how to determine the $\pi^0$ lifetime by measuring the $\gamma\gamma^*\to\pi^0$ production cross section. For the case that a high energy (190 GeV/c) pion beam is used, Primakoff scattering, viewed in the rest frame of the pion, is effectively low-energy soft scattering of $\approx$ 250 MeV gamma rays from a pion at rest. Together, low-energy soft scattering and high-energy hard scattering studies play crucial complementary roles in testing the Quantum Chromodynamics (QCD) framework. OBJECTIVES: This article presents a short description of Primakoff's scientific career and personal life. It reviews Primakoff scattering studies of pion polarizability and the chiral anomaly $\gamma \rightarrow \pi \pi \pi$ at CERN COMPASS and the $\pi^0$ lifetime study at Jefferson Laboratory (JLab). A review of Chiral Perturbation Theory (ChPT) is presented. RESULTS: We discuss the good agreement of these studies with 2-flavor (u,d) ChPT predictions. CONCLUSIONS: We discuss why Primakoff studies at CERN AMBER and JLab will be important for validating the theoretical framework of 3-flavor (u, d, s) ChPT. These include the kaon polarizability, $\gamma\to\pi\pi\eta$ and $\gamma\to KK\pi$ chiral anomalies, kaonic hybrid states, and $\pi^0$ and $\eta$ lifetimes. DISCUSSION: By comparing 3-flavor ChPT predictions with data for kaons, $\pi^0$ and $\eta$, it will be possible to assess how well the model captures the interplay of the additional flavor and the effects of strange quarks.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.08311v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present results from SMEFiT3.0, a global SMEFT fit of Higgs, top quark, and diboson production data from the LHC. Our updated analysis includes recent inclusive and differential measurements from the LHC Run II, together with the exact implementation of electroweak precision observables (EWPOs) from LEP and SLD. We then analyse the impact of HL-LHC measurements by adding to SMEFiT3.0 the projections obtained by extrapolating from Run II data. Finally we estimate the potential of two proposed high-energy circular $e^+e^-$ colliders, the FCC-ee and the CEPC, in further improving the bounds on the SMEFT parameters.</description>

Abstract: In this paper, we present an algorithm to generate the collider events of the GeV-scale oscillating sterile neutrinos with the ready-made event generation tools in the case that the crossing-widths among the nearly-degenerate fermionic fields arise. We prove the validity of our algorithm, and adopt some tricks for practical calculations. The formulations of the particle oscillation processes are also improved in the framework of the quantum field theory, offering us the ability to simulate the flying distances of the oscillating intermediate sterile neutrinos while regarding them as the internal lines in the Feynmann diagrams.</description>

      <title>Update on non-unitary mixing in the recent NO$\nu$A and T2K data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.00146</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.00146v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this letter, we have used a non-unitary mixing scheme to resolve the tension between NO$\nu$A and T2K data. It is demonstrated that the results of NO$\nu$A and T2K can be explained by the effects by non-unitary mixing arising from $\alpha_{00}$ and $\alpha_{10}$. For $\alpha_{00}$ there is a large overlap between the allowed NO$\nu$A and T2K regions for NH on the $\sin^2\theta_{23}-\delta_{\rm CP}$ plane at $1\,\sigma$. However, the tension still exists. NO$\nu$A rules out unitary mixing at a $3\,\sigma$ level, whereas T2K strongly prefers unitary mixing. For $\alpha_{10}$, the tension can be \textbf{well resolved} with the best-fit point for NH at $|\alpha_{10}|=0.06$ for both experiments.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2308.13285v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Neutrino Events Reconstruction has always been crucial for IceCube Neutrino Observatory. In the Kaggle competition "IceCube -- Neutrinos in Deep Ice", many solutions use Transformer. We present ISeeCube, a pure Transformer model based on TorchScale (the backbone of BEiT-3). When having relatively same amount of total trainable parameters, our model outperforms the 2nd place solution. By using TorchScale, the lines of code drop sharply by about 80% and a lot of new methods can be tested by simply adjusting configs. We compared two fundamental models for predictions on a continuous space, regression and classification, trained with MSE Loss and CE Loss respectively. We also propose a new metric, overlap ratio, to evaluate the performance of the model. Since the model is simple enough, it has the potential to be used for more purposes such as energy reconstruction, and many new methods such as combining it with GraphNeT can be tested more easily. The code and pretrained models are available at https://github.com/chenlinear/ISeeCube</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.00099v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Cosmological correlators encode invaluable information about the wavefunction of the primordial universe. In this letter we present a duality between correlators and wavefunction coefficients that is valid to all orders in the loop expansion and manifests itself as a $\mathbb{Z}_4$ symmetry. To demonstrate the power of the duality, we derive a correlator-to-correlator factorisation (CCF) formula for the parity-odd part of cosmological correlators that relates $n$-point observables to lower-point ones via a series of diagrammatic cuts. These relations serve as the first example of physically testable cutting rules as they involve observables defined for arbitrary physical kinematics. We further show how the duality allows us to translate the cosmological optical theorem for wavefunction coefficients into statements about cosmological correlators.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.07624v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recent observations of two nearby black hole low-mass X-ray binaries have suggested possible indication of dark matter density spikes. While the evidence is compelling, one issue with this interpretation is that light black holes formed from stellar collapse are not expected to form dark matter spikes, and so it is unclear how the stellar-mass black holes in these binaries could have acquired such features. Since primordial black holes are expected to form ultra-dense dark matter mini-spikes, in this article we explore the possibility of a primordial origin for these light black holes.</description>

Abstract: The determination of the speed of sound in quark-gluon plasma is a crucial aspect of understanding the properties of strongly interacting matter created in relativistic heavy-ion collisions. In this study, we investigate the impact of initial-state fluctuations on the extraction of the speed of sound in a quark-gluon plasma in the ultra-central collisions. By employing the TRENTo model for simulating initial conditions, we demonstrate that these fluctuations lead to sizable volume effect, which in turn corrects the measured values of the sound velocity. With respect to realistic conditions of high-energy heavy-ion experiments, we provide quantitative estimate of these corrections.</description>

      <title>On the Generality and Persistence of Cosmological Stasis</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.00835v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Hierarchical decays of $N$ matter species to radiation may balance against Hubble expansion to yield stasis, a new phase of cosmological evolution with constant matter and radiation abundances. We analyze stasis with various machine learning techniques on the full $2N$-dimensional space of decay rates and abundances, which serve as inputs to the system of Boltzmann equations that governs the dynamics. We construct a differentiable Boltzmann solver to maximize the number of stasis $e$-folds $\mathcal{N}$. High-stasis configurations obtained by gradient ascent motivate log-uniform distributions on rates and abundances to accompany power-law distributions of previous works. We demonstrate that random configurations drawn from these families of distributions regularly exhibit many $e$-folds of stasis. We additionally use them as priors in a Bayesian analysis conditioned on stasis, using stochastic variational inference with normalizing flows to model the posterior. All three numerical analyses demonstrate the generality of stasis and point to a new model in which the rates and abundances are exponential in the species index. We show that the exponential model solves the exact stasis equations, is an attractor, and satisfies $\mathcal{N}\propto N$, exhibiting inflation-level $e$-folding with a relatively low number of species. This is contrasted with the $\mathcal{N}\propto \log(N)$ scaling of power-law models. Finally, we discuss implications for the emergent string conjecture and string axiverse.</description>

      <title>Modeling net-charge fluctuations in heavy-ion collisions at the LHC</title>

Abstract: The analysis of Pb+Pb data for net-charge fluctuations at LHC energies within the HYDJET++ model is presented. The strongly intensive quantities $D$ and $\Sigma$ are used to get rid of the effects related to volume fluctuations of the system. We employ two versions of the HYDJET++ for the analysis. The first one is the standard or default version, whereas the second one represents its further modification, which takes into account explicit event-by-event conservation of the electric net-charge of produced particles. Inclusion of the canonical net-charge conservation in the model allows one for better description of the experimental data obtained by the ALICE and the CMS Collaborations. Comparison with calculations of other models is also presented.</description>

      <title>From Landau two-fluid model to de Sitter Universe</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.04392</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.04392v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The condensed matter analogs are useful for consideration of the phenomena related to the quantum vacuum. This is because in condensed matter we know physics both in the infrared and in the ultraviolet limits, while in particle physics and gravity the physics at trans-Planckian scale is unknown. One of the corner stones of the connections between the non-relativistic condensed matter and the modern relativistic theories is the two-fluid hydrodynamics of superfluid helium. The dynamics and thermodynamics of the de Sitter state of the expansion of the Universe bear some features of the multi-fluid system. There are actually three components: the quantum vacuum, the gravitational component and relativistic matter. The expanding de Sitter vacuum serves as the thermal bath with local temperature, which is twice the Gibbons-Hawking temperature related to the cosmological horizon. This local temperature leads to the heating of matter component and the gravitational component. The latter behaves as Zel'dovich stiff matter and represents the dark matter. In equilibrium and in the absence of the conventional matter the positive partial pressure of dark matter compensates the negative partial pressure of quantum vacuum. That is why in the full equilibrium the total pressure is zero. This is similar to the superfluid and normal components in superfluids, which together produce the zero pressure of the liquid in the absence of environment. If one assumes that in dynamics, the gravitational dark matter behaves as the real Zel'dovich stiff matter, one obtains that both components experience the power law decay due to the energy exchange between these components. Then it follows that their values at present time have the correct order of magnitude. We also consider the other problems through the prism of condensed matter physics, including the black holes and Planck constant.</description>

      <title>Gravitational waves from burdened primordial black holes dark matter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.17544</link>

Abstract: Primordial black holes (PBHs) are the natural candidate of dark matter (DM) as they only interact gravitationally and can evade any experiments on earth. In the standard semiclassical calculation of Hawking radiation, PBHs with mass below $10^{15}\rm g$ evaporated by now and therefore cannot be DM. However, the recently-discovered quantum memory burden effect can significantly suppress the evaporation of PBHs after the half-decay time. This quantum effect could open up a new mass window below $10^{10} \rm g$ where PBHs can still exist today and be DM. In this paper, we compute the gravitational wave (GW) signals associated with the formation of PBHs in this new mass window. We consider two formation scenarios: PBHs formed from inflationary perturbation and PBHs formed from collapse of Fermi-balls in a first-order phase transition (FOPT). GWs produced from these two scenarios have distinct features and, while the GW from inflation peaks at high frequency, the GW from FOPT peaks at lower frequency that can be within the reach of future experiments.</description>

      <title>XTE J1814-338 as a dark matter admixed neutron star</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.17105</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.17105v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The existence of the ultracompact object XTE J1814-338, with an inferred mass and radius of $M$ = 1.21 $\pm$ 0.05 $M_\odot$ and R = 7.0 $\pm$ 0.4 km, presents a great challenge for the theory of neutron stars. Within this context, we revisit the theory of dark-matter-admixed neutron stars and infer the physical properties of this compact object, such as the Fermi momentum of dark matter necessary to compress the star at such low radius, its equation of state, speed of sound, and some macroscopic properties, such as the moment of inertia and the dimensionless tidal parameter. We also compare the physical properties of the XTE J1814-338 with other pulsars, such as the canonical 1.4 M$_\odot$, the PSR J0740 + 6620, and the HESS J1731-347.</description>

      <title>Stringy scaling of multi-tensor hard string scattering amplitudes and the K-identities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.19640</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.19640v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We calculate n-point hard string scattering amplitudes (HSSA) with n-2 tachyons and 2 tensor states at arbitrary mass levels. We discover the stringy scaling behavior of these HSSA. It is found that for HSSA with more than 2 transverse directions, the degree of stringy scaling dimM2 decreases comparing to the degree of stringy scaling dimM1 of the n-1 tachyons and 1 tensor HSSA calculated previously. Moreover, we propose a set of K-identities which is the key to demonstrate the stringy scaling behavior of HSSA. We explicitly prove both the diagonal and off-diagonal K-identities for the 4-point HSSA and give numerical proofs of these K-identities for some higher point HSSA.</description>

      <title>Open Questions and Future Directions in Titan Science</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.00971</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.00971v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this chapter we attempt to distill the very large number of possible future inquiries of Titan into a relatively concise list of twenty high level questions - each of which of would necessarily entail a multitude of more specific investigations and studies. While this list does not encompass all possible open questions, and is divided into topics according to our preference and not in any way uniquely, we believe that it does however span a wide range of the most intriguing topics about Titan, and may form some sort of guide especially for those embarking into Titan studies for the first time. At the end of this chapter we return to explore how these four techniques may be used to answer the large, high-level open questions in Titan science.</description>
