      <title>The CHEPA model: assessing the impact of HEPA filter units in classrooms using a fast-running coupled indoor air quality and dynamic thermal model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.10837</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.10837v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The quality of the classroom environment, including ventilation, air quality and thermal conditions, has an important impact on children's health and academic achievements. The use of portable HEPA filter air cleaners is widely suggested as a strategy to mitigate exposure to particulate matter and airborne viruses. However, there is a need to quantify the relative benefits of such devices including the impacts on energy use. We present a simple coupled dynamic thermal and air quality model and apply it to naturally ventilated classrooms, representative of modern and Victorian era construction. We consider the addition of HEPA filters with, and without, reduced opening of windows, and explore concentrations of carbon dioxide (\co), \PM, airborne viral RNA, classroom temperature and energy use. Results indicate the addition of HEPA filters was predicted to reduce \PM~ by 40--60\% and viral RNA by 30--50\% depending on the classroom design and window opening behaviour. The energy cost of running HEPA filters is likely to be only 1\%--2\% of the classroom heating costs. In scenarios when HEPA filters were on and window opening was reduced (to account for the additional clean air delivery rate of the filters), the heating cost was predicted to be reduced by as much as -13\%, and these maximum reductions grew to -46\% in wintertime simulations. In these scenarios the HEPA filters result in a notable reduction in \PM~and viral RNA, but the \co\ concentration is significantly higher. The model provides a mechanism for exploring the relative impact of ventilation and air cleaning strategies on both exposures and energy costs, enabling an understanding of where trade-offs lie.</description>

      <title>Urban highways are barriers to social ties</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.11596</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.11596v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Urban highways are common, especially in the US, making cities more car-centric. They promise the annihilation of distance but obstruct pedestrian mobility, thus playing a key role in limiting social interactions locally. Although this limiting role is widely acknowledged in urban studies, the quantitative relationship between urban highways and social ties is barely tested. Here we define a Barrier Score that relates massive, geolocated online social network data to highways in the 50 largest US cities. At the unprecedented granularity of individual social ties, we show that urban highways are associated with decreased social connectivity. This barrier effect is especially strong for short distances and consistent with historical cases of highways that were built to purposefully disrupt or isolate Black neighborhoods. By combining spatial infrastructure with social tie data, our method adds a new dimension to demographic studies of social segregation. Our study can inform reparative planning for an evidence-based reduction of spatial inequality, and more generally, support a better integration of the social fabric in urban planning.</description>

      <title>Global topological synchronization of weighted simplicial complexes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.11337</link>

Abstract: Higher-order networks are able to capture the many-body interactions present in complex systems and to unveil new fundamental phenomena revealing the rich interplay between topology, geometry, and dynamics. Simplicial complexes are higher-order networks that encode higher-order topology and dynamics of complex systems. Specifically, simplicial complexes can sustain topological signals, i.e., dynamical variables not only defined on nodes of the network but also on their edges, triangles, and so on. Topological signals can undergo collective phenomena such as synchronization, however, only some higher-order network topologies can sustain global synchronization of topological signals. Here we consider global topological synchronization of topological signals on weighted simplicial complexes. We demonstrate that topological signals can globally synchronize on weighted simplicial complexes, even if they are odd-dimensional, e.g., edge signals, overcoming thus a limitation of the unweighted case. These results thus demonstrate that weighted simplicial complexes are more advantageous for observing these collective phenomena than their unweighted counterpart. In particular, we present two weighted simplicial complexes the Weighted Triangulated Torus and the Weighted Waffle. We completely characterize their higher-order spectral properties and we demonstrate that, under suitable conditions on their weights, they can sustain global synchronization of edge signals. Our results are interpreted geometrically by showing, among the other results, that in some cases edge weights can be associated with the lengths of the sides of curved simplices.</description>

      <title>Effective one-dimension reduction of multi-compartment complex systems dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.11366</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.11366v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A broad class of systems, including ecological, epidemiological, and sociological ones, are characterized by populations of individuals assigned to specific categories, e.g., a chemical species, an opinion or an epidemic state, that are modeled as compartments. Due to interactions and intrinsic dynamics, individuals are allowed to change category, leading to concentrations varying over time with complex behavior, typical of reaction-diffusion systems. While compartmental modeling provides a powerful framework for studying the dynamics of such populations and describe the spatiotemporal evolution of a system, it mostly relies on deterministic mean-field descriptions to deal with systems with many degrees of freedom. Here, we propose a method to alleviate some of the limitations of compartmental models by capitalizing on tools originating from quantum physics to systematically reduce multi-dimensional systems to an effective one-dimensional representation. Using this reduced system, we are able to not only investigate the mean-field dynamics and their critical behavior, but we can additionally study stochastic representations that capture fundamental features of the system. We demonstrate the validity of our formalism by studying the critical behavior of models widely adopted to study epidemic, ecological and economic systems.</description>

      <title>Nested Skills in Labor Ecosystems: A Hidden Dimension of Human Capital</title>

Abstract: Modern economies, characterized by their vast output of goods and services, operate through globally interconnected networks. As economies become more complex, so do these networks, coordinating increasingly diverse portfolios of specialized efforts and knowledge. In this study, we analyze U.S. survey data (2005--2019) to infer an underlying interdependency tree within the fabric of skill portfolios. Hierarchically constructed, this skill tree starts from widely needed, foundational abilities, constituting the root, and extends to highly specialized, niche skills required by select jobs at the extremities. The directionality is defined by the asymmetrical conditional probabilities of the presence of one skill given the existence of another. Examining 70 million job transitions in resumes and national surveys, we observe that individuals tend to delve deeper into these nested specialization paths as they ascend the career ladder to enjoy higher wage premiums. Nevertheless, we find the role of foundational skills for such ascent remains pivotal; without reinforcing them, the anticipated wage premiums may vanish. Hence, we further differentiate \textit{nested} skills from others, with the former building on common prerequisites while the latter does not, and analyze disparities in these skill gaps across different genders and racial/ethnic groups. Our analysis reveals a growing and concerning fragmentation in the divide between these two skill groups over the past two decades, suggesting further polarization within the job landscape. Our findings highlight the critical role of robust foundational skills as a stepping stone to specialization and the economic advantages it can confer, reinforcing the need for balanced skill development strategies in complex economies.</description>

      <title>An entropy-based measurement for understanding origin-destination trip distributions: a case study of New York City taxis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.17467</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.17467v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A comprehensive understanding of human mobility patterns in urban areas is essential for urban development and transportation planning. In this study, we create entropy-based measurements to capture the geographical distribution diversity of trip origins and destinations. Specifically, we develop origin-entropy and destination-entropy based on taxi and ride-sharing trip records. The origin-entropy for a given zone accounts for all the trips that originate from this zone and calculates the level of geographical distribution diversity of these trips destinations. Likewise, the destination-entropy for a given zone considers all the trips that end in this zone and calculates the level of geographical distribution diversity of these trips origins. Furthermore, we have created an interactive geovisualization that enables researchers to delve into and juxtapose the spatial and temporal dynamics of origin and destination entropy, in conjunction with trip counts for both origins and destinations. Results indicate that entropy-based measurements effectively capture shifts in the diversity of trips geographical origins and destinations, reflecting changes in travel decisions due to major events like the COVID-19 pandemic. These measurements, alongside trip counts, offer a more comprehensive understanding of urban human flows.</description>

      <title>Effects of group size and noise on cooperation in population evolution of dynamic groups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.16317</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.16317v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In a large population, the agents temporally form group of the Public Goods Game (PGG) one after another, and size of one group is randomly distributed at $g\in [g_l,g_h]$. Players in it have two strategies to be chosen to cooperate, or to defect for playing the PGG. Based on this structure we investigate the evolution of cooperation in PGG as a function of the noise level underlying strategy adoptions with the group size distribution. In the process of the evolution, the payoffs of cooperators(defectors) have related to the strategy selection implemented by the death-birth process. With a smaller group size $g$, different noise value $K$ induces different dynamic behavior with the increase of multiplication factor $r$. These cooperative behavior can be analytically solved. For a greater group size $g$, the system finally evolve to the bistable state(AllC and hybrid state with cooperators and defectors)starting from different initial concentrations of cooperation. The numerical computation also fit well with the simulation results. We focus on the bistable phenomenon in the equilibrium for a given value of $K$ and a greater group size when the intrusion of one C(D)-player into D(C)-population is investigated from upwards(downwards) branch after experiencing a unstable cooperative evolution. Here, the hysteresis phenomenon can be observed. Further, when one D-player invades into the C-population, the critical value $r_c$ can be obtained in the simulation and the mathematical relationship between the critical value $r_c$ and noise $K$ is analysed.</description>
