      <title>Optimal Computation from Fluctuation Responses</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.03900</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.03900v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The energy cost of computation has emerged as a central challenge at the intersection of physics and computer science. Recent advances in statistical physics -- particularly in stochastic thermodynamics -- enable precise characterizations of work, heat, and entropy production in information-processing systems driven far from equilibrium by time-dependent control protocols. A key open question is then how to design protocols that minimize thermodynamic cost while ensur- ing correct outcomes. To this end, we develop a unified framework to identify optimal protocols using fluctuation response relations (FRR) and machine learning. Unlike previous approaches that optimize either distributions or protocols separately, our method unifies both using FRR-derived gradients. Moreover, our method is based primarily on iteratively learning from sampled noisy trajectories, which is generally much easier than solving for the optimal protocol directly from a set of governing equations. We apply the framework to canonical examples -- bit erasure in a double-well potential and translating harmonic traps -- demonstrating how to construct loss functions that trade-off energy cost against task error. The framework extends trivially to underdamped systems, and we show this by optimizing a bit-flip in an underdamped system. In all computations we test, the framework achieves the theoretically optimal protocol or achieves work costs comparable to relevant finite time bounds. In short, the results provide principled strategies for designing thermodynamically efficient protocols in physical information-processing systems. Applications range from quantum gates robust under noise to energy-efficient control of chemical and synthetic biological networks.</description>

      <title>Dynamics of the Kac Ring Model with switching scatterers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.04104</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.04104v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce a generalized version of the Kac ring model in which particles are of two types, black and white. Black particles modify the environment through which all particles move, thereby inducing indirect and potentially long-range interactions among them. Unlike the inert scatterers of Kac's original model, the scatterers in our setting possess internal states that change upon interaction with black particles and can be interpreted as energy levels of the environment. This makes the model self-consistent, as it incorporates a form of particle interactions, mediated by the environment, that drives the system toward some kind of stationary state. Although indirect and long-range interactions do not necessarily promote thermodynamic states, interactions are necessary for energy to be shared among the elementary constituents of matter, enabling the establishment of equipartition, which is a prerequisite for defining temperature. Therefore, our model is one step forward in this direction, elucidating the role of interactions and energy exchange. We prove that any initial state of the system converges to a time periodic state (i.e. a phase space orbit) and describe basins of attraction for some of such asymptotic periodic states.</description>

      <title>Strong coupling phases of conserved growth models are crumpled</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.04109</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.04109v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We show that stochastically driven nonequilibrium conserved growth models admit strong coupling phases for sufficiently strong nonlocal chemical potentials underlying the dynamics. The models exhibit generic roughening transitions between perturbatively accessible weak coupling phases satisfying an exact relation between the dynamic $z$ and roughness $\chi$ exponents in all dimensions $d$ and strong coupling phases. In dimensions below the critical dimension, the latter phases are unstable and argued to be crumpled, and thus distinct from the well-known strong coupling rough phase of the Kardar-Parisi-Zhang equation in dimensions $d\geq 2$. At the critical dimension, conventional spatio-temporal scaling in the weak coupling phase is logarithmically modulated and are exactly obtained. These results obtained by employing a combination of nonperturbative arguments and perturbative theories, corroborated by numerical results.</description>

      <title>Interplay of order and disorder in two-dimensional critical systems with mixed boundary conditions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.04238</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.04238v2 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In spin systems such as the Ising model, the local order and disorder can be characterized by the order-parameter and energy density profiles $\langle \sigma ({\bf r}_1) \rangle$ and $\langle \epsilon ({\bf r}_2) \rangle$, respectively. Does increasing the order at ${\bf r}_1$ always decrease the disorder at ${\bf r}_2$? Does increasing the disorder at ${\bf r}_2$ always decrease the order at ${\bf r}_1$? The answer to these questions is contained in the cumulant response function $\langle\sigma ({\bf r}_1) \, \epsilon ({\bf r}_2) \rangle^{(\rm cum)}$. This correlation function vanishes in the unbounded bulk but not in systems with fixed-spin boundary conditions. Using the universal operator-product expansion of $\sigma ({\bf r}_1) \, \epsilon ({\bf r}_2)$ and exact results for the Ising model, we analyze $\langle\sigma ({\bf r}_1) \, \epsilon ({\bf r}_2) \rangle^{(\rm cum)}$ in two-dimensional critical systems defined on the $x-y$ plane with mixed $+$ and $-$ boundary conditions. Particularly interesting behavior is found when either of the operators $\sigma$ or $\epsilon$ is located on a ``zero line" in the $x-y$ plane, along which $\langle\sigma ({\bf r})\rangle$ vanishes. Results for half-plane, triangular, and rectangular geometries are presented.</description>

      <title>Identifying non-equilibrium fluctuations in Intracellular Motion Using Recurrent Neural Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.04485</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.04485v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Distinguishing active from passive dynamics is a fundamental challenge in understanding the motion of living cells and other active matter systems. Here, we introduce a framework that combines physical modeling, analytical theory, and machine learning to identify and characterize active fluctuations from trajectory data. We train a long short-term memory (LSTM) neural network on synthetic trajectories generated from well-defined stochastic models of active particles, enabling it to classify motion as passive or active and to infer the underlying active process. Applied to experimental trajectories of a tracer in the cytoplasm of a living cell, the method robustly identifies actively driven motion and selects an Ornstein-Uhlenbeck active noise model as the best description. Crucially, the classifier's performance on simulated data approaches the theoretical optimum that we derive, and it also yields accurate estimates of the active diffusion coefficient. This integrated approach opens a powerful route to quantify non-equilibrium fluctuations in complex biological systems from limited data.</description>

      <title>Directed percolation transition to active turbulence driven by non-reciprocal forces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.04575</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.04575v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We numerically study the collective dynamics of dense particle assemblies driven by non-reciprocal pairwise forces of amplitude $\kappa$. At a critical value $\kappa_{\rm c}$, the system undergoes a dynamical phase transition from an absorbing state ($\kappa &lt; \kappa_{\rm c}$) to a chaotic steady state ($\kappa &gt; \kappa_{\rm c}$). The chaotic phase is marked by nontrivial spatiotemporal velocity correlations and mixing, reminiscent of active turbulence in self-propelled systems. The sharp onset of chaos shows critical scaling consistent with the universality class of directed percolation. We argue that this transition is generic to a broad class of locally-driven, dense disordered materials.</description>

      <title>Field-Theoretic Simulation of Dean-Kawasaki Dynamics for Interacting Particles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.05042</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.05042v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The formulation of a fluctuating hydrodynamic theory for interacting particles is a crucial step in the theoretical description of liquids. The microscopic mappings proposed decades ago by Dean and Kawasaki have played a central role in the analytical treatment of such problems. However, the singular mathematical nature of the density distributions used in these derivations raises concerns about the validity and practical utility of the resulting stochastic partial differential equations, particularly for direct numerical simulations. Recent efforts have centered on establishing a rigorous coarse-graining procedure to regularize the effective Dean-Kawasaki equation. Building on this foundation, we numerically investigate weakly interacting fluids within such a regularized framework for the first time. Our work reveals, at the level of structural correlations, the effects of regularization on the Dean-Kawasaki formalism and paves the way for improved numerical approaches to simulate fluctuating hydrodynamics in liquids.</description>

      <title>A Holographic prescription for generalized Schwinger-Keldysh contours</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.03404</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.03404v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We provide a holographic prescription to compute real-time thermal correlators with arbitrary operator ordering. In field theory, these correlation functions are captured by a multi-fold Schwinger-Keldysh time contour. We propose a holographic dual for these contours, which generalizes the gravitational Schwinger-Keldysh geometry previously advocated in the literature. Our geometry consists of multiple AdS-black holes glued together at the future and past horizons, with matching conditions determined by unitarity and the KMS condition. As a proof of concept, we solve for a probe scalar field in this geometry and compute bulk-bulk and bulk-boundary propagators, in terms of which we evaluate the 4-point functions at tree-level. We show that in perturbation theory, the lowest-order diagrams that contribute non-trivially to the out-of-time order four-point function are exchange diagrams which explore the full four-fold geometry. Furthermore, these diagrams reduce to a simple factorized expression. We propose a conjecture on the structure of higher order observables and provide a partial proof by studying a subset of the contributing diagrams.</description>

      <title>High-spin magnetic ground states of neutral dopant clusters in semiconductors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.03575</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.03575v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: High-spin states hold significant promise for classical and quantum information storage and emerging magnetic memory technologies. Here, we present a systematic framework for engineering such high-spin magnetic states in dopant clusters formed from substitutional impurities in semiconductors. In single-valley materials such as gallium arsenide, impurity states are hydrogenic and exchange interactions generally favor low-spin configurations, except in special geometries. In contrast, multivalley semiconductors exhibit oscillatory form factors in their exchange couplings, enabling the controlled suppression of selected hopping processes and exchange couplings. Exploiting this feature, we demonstrate how carefully arranged impurities in aluminum arsenide, germanium, and silicon can stabilize ground states with a net spin that scale extensively with system size. Within effective mass theory and the tight-binding approximation for hopping, we construct explicit examples ranging from finite clusters to extended lattices and fractal-like tilings. In two dimensions, we identify several favorable dopant geometries supporting a net spin equal to around half of the fully polarized value in the thermodynamic limit, including one which achieves over $70\%$ polarization. Our results provide a general design principle for harnessing valley degeneracy in semiconductors to construct robust high-spin states and outline a pathway for their experimental realization via precision implantation of dopants.</description>

      <title>Dimension dependence of critical phenomena in long-range percolation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.03951</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.03951v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Statistical mechanical systems at and near their points of phase transition are expected to exhibit rich, fractal-like behaviour that is independent of the small-scale details of the system but depends strongly on the dimension in which the model is defined. Moreover, many models are conjectured to have an upper critical dimension with important quantitative and qualitative differences between critical behaviour at, above, and below the upper critical dimension. For models with long-range interactions, one expects additional transitions between effectively long-range and effectively short-range regimes, with further marginal effects on the boundary of these two regimes, leading to (at least) eight qualitatively distinct forms of critical behaviour in total for each given model. We give a broad overview of these conjectures aimed at a general mathematical audience before surveying the significant recent progress that has been made towards understanding them in the context of long-range percolation.</description>

      <title>Approaching the scaling limit of transport through lattices with dephasing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.04062</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.04062v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We examine the stationary--state equations for lattices with generalized Markovian dephasing and relaxation. When the Hamiltonian is quadratic, the single--particle correlation matrix has a closed system of equations even in the presence of these two processes. The resulting equations have a vectorized form related to, but distinct from, Lyapunov's equation. We present an efficient solution that helps to achieve the scaling limit, e.g., of the current decay with lattice length. As an example, we study the super--diffusive--to--diffusive transition in a lattice with long--range hopping and dephasing. The approach enables calculations with up to $10^4$ sites, representing an increase of $10$ to $40$ times over prior studies. This enables a more precise extraction of the diffusion exponent, enhances agreement with theoretical results, and supports the presence of a phase transition. There is a wide range of problems that have Markovian relaxation, noise, and driving. They include quantum networks for machine--learning--based classification and extended reservoir approaches (ERAs) for transport. The results here will be useful for these classes of problems.</description>

      <title>Clifford Circuits Augmented Grassmann Matrix Product States</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.04164</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.04164v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recent advances in combining Clifford circuits with tensor network (TN) states have shown that classically simulable disentanglers can significantly reduce entanglement, mitigating the bond-dimension bottleneck in TN simulations. In this work, we develop a variational TN framework based on Grassmann tensor networks, which natively encode fermionic statistics while preserving locality. By incorporating locally defined Clifford circuits within the fermionic formalism, we simulate benchmark models including the tight-binding and $t$-$V$ models. Our results show that Clifford disentangling removes the classically simulable component of entanglement, leading to a reduced bond dimension and improved accuracy in ground-state energy estimates. Interestingly, imposing the natural Grassmann-evenness constraint on the Clifford circuits significantly reduces the number of disentangling gates, from 720 to just 32, yielding a far more efficient implementation. These findings highlight the potential of Clifford-augmented Grassmann TNs as a scalable and accurate tool for studying strongly correlated fermionic systems, particularly in higher dimensions.</description>

      <title>Operational Quasiprobability in Quantum Thermodynamics: Work Extraction by Coherence and Non-joint Measurability</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.04253</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.04253v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We employ the operational quasiprobability (OQ) as a work distribution, which reproduces the Jarzynski equality and yields the average work consistent with the classical definition. The OQ distribution can be experimentally implemented through the end-point measurement and the two-point measurement scheme. Using this framework, we demonstrate the explicit contribution of coherence to the fluctuation, the average, and the second moment of work. In a two-level system, we show that non-joint measurability, a generalized notion of measurement incompatibility, can increase the amount of extractable work beyond the classical bound imposed by jointly measurable measurements. We further prove that the real part of Kirkwood-Dirac quasiprobability (KDQ) and the OQ are equivalent in two-level systems, and they are nonnegative for binary unbiased measurements if and only if the measurements are jointly measurable. In a three-level Nitrogen-vacancy center system, the OQ and the KDQ exhibit different amounts of negativities while enabling the same work extraction, implying that the magnitude of negativity is not a faithful indicator of nonclassical work. These results highlight that coherence and non-joint measurability play fundamental roles in the enhancement of work.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2510.04267v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We determine the late-time dynamics of a generic spin ensemble with inhomogeneous broadening - equivalently, qubits with arbitrary Zeeman splittings - coupled to a dissipative environment with strength decreasing as $1/t$. The approach to the steady state follows a power law, reflecting the interplay between Hamiltonian dynamics and vanishing dissipation. The decay exponents vary non-analytically with the ramp rate, exhibiting a cusp singularity, and $n$-point correlation functions factorize into one- and two-point contributions. Our exact solution anchors a universality class of open quantum systems with explicitly time-dependent dissipation.</description>

Abstract: We introduce a cumulant-expansion framework for quantifying how large language models (LLMs) internalize higher-order statistical structure during next-token prediction. By treating the softmax entropy of each layer's logit distribution as a perturbation around its "center" distribution, we derive closed-form cumulant observables that isolate successively higher-order correlations. Empirically, we track these cumulants in GPT-2 and Pythia models on Pile-10K prompts. (i) Structured prompts exhibit a characteristic rise-and-plateau profile across layers, whereas token-shuffled prompts remain flat, revealing the dependence of the cumulant profile on meaningful context. (ii) During training, all cumulants increase monotonically before saturating, directly visualizing the model's progression from capturing variance to learning skew, kurtosis, and higher-order statistical structures. (iii) Mathematical prompts show distinct cumulant signatures compared to general text, quantifying how models employ fundamentally different processing mechanisms for mathematical versus linguistic content. Together, these results establish cumulant analysis as a lightweight, mathematically grounded probe of feature-learning dynamics in high-dimensional neural networks.</description>

      <title>Integrable Floquet Time Crystals in One Dimension</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.04326</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.04326v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We demonstrate the realization of a discrete-time crystal (DTC) phase in a family of periodically driven, one-dimensional quadratic lattice Hamiltonians that can be obtained using spin chains. These interactions preserve integrability while opening controllable gaps at resonant quasienergies and pinning the emergent quasienergy modes that are responsible for subharmonics. We demonstrate that the DTC phase is rigid in the parameter space of transverse field and an additional interaction like NNN coupling strength, with the drive frequency optimized to produce the strongest subharmonic response. We also provide a detailed phase portrait of the model, exhibiting a variety of new dynamical phases, such as a fragile time crystal and both spin-liquid and paramagnetic phases, as well as sharp quantum phase transitions between them. Finite-size scaling of the Floquet quasienergy splitting between the emergent subharmonic mode and its conjugate shows that the DTC lifetime diverges exponentially with system size. Our work thus establishes a novel mechanism for realizing robust, long-lived DTCs in one dimension, and paves the way for their experimental realization in near-term quantum simulators. Motivation for this work stems from the limitations of disorder-based stabilization schemes that rely on many-body localization and exhibit only prethermal or finite-lived plateaus, eventually restoring ergodicity. Disorder-free routes are therefore highly desirable. Integrable (or Floquet-integrable) systems provide an attractive alternative because their extensive set of conserved quantities and constrained scattering strongly restrict thermalization channels. Our construction exploits these integrable restrictions together with short-range NNN engineering to produce a clean, robust DTC that avoids the prethermal fragility of disordered realizations.</description>

      <title>Equilibrium properties of strongly confined fluids</title>

Abstract: The statistical-mechanical study of the equilibrium properties of fluids, starting from the knowledge of the interparticle interaction potential, is essential to understand the role that microscopic interaction between individual particles play in the properties of the fluid. The study of these properties from a fundamental point of view is therefore a central goal in condensed matter physics. These properties, however, might vary greatly when a fluid is confined to extremely narrow channels and, therefore, must be examined separately. This thesis investigates fluids in narrow pores, where particles are forced to stay in single-file formation and cannot pass one another. The resulting systems are highly anisotropic: motion is free along the channel axis but strongly restricted transversely. To quantify these effects, equilibrium properties of the confined fluids are compared with their bulk counterparts, exposing the role of dimensionality. We also develop a novel theoretical framework based on a mapping approach that converts single-file fluids with nearest-neighbor interactions into an equivalent one-dimensional mixture. This exact isomorphism delivers closed expressions for thermodynamic and structural quantities. It allows us to compute the anisotropic pressure tensor and revises definitions of spatial correlations to take into account spatial anisotropy. The theory is applied to hard-core, square-well, square-shoulder, and anisotropic hard-body models, revealing phenomena such as zigzag ordering and structural crossovers of spatial correlations. Analytical predictions are extensively validated against Monte Carlo and molecular dynamic simulations (both original and from the literature), showing excellent agreement across the studied parameter ranges.</description>

Abstract: Noncommutativity of observables is a central feature of quantum physics. It plays a fundamental role in the formulation of the uncertainty principle for complementary variables and strongly affects the laws of thermodynamics for systems with noncommuting, that is, non-Abelian, conserved quantities. We here derive nonequilibrium generalizations of the second law of thermodynamics in the form of fluctuation relations, both for mechanically and thermally driven quantum systems. We identify a non-Abelian contribution to the energy and entropy balances, without which these relations would be violated. The latter term can be controlled to enhance both work extraction and nonequilibrium currents compared to what is obtained in commuting thermodynamics. These findings demonstrate that noncommutativity maybe a useful thermodynamic resource.</description>

      <title>Information-thermodynamic bounds on precision in interacting quantum systems</title>

      <description>arXiv:2510.04866v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The thermodynamic uncertainty relation quantifies a trade-off between the relative fluctuations of trajectory currents and the thermodynamic cost, indicating that the current precision is fundamentally constrained by entropy production. In classical bipartite systems, it has been shown that information flow between subsystems can enhance the current precision alongside thermodynamic dissipation. In this study, we investigate how information flow, local dissipation, and quantum effects jointly constrain current fluctuations within a subsystem of interacting quantum systems. Unlike classical bipartite systems, quantum subsystems can exhibit simultaneous state changes and maintain quantum coherence, which fundamentally alters the precision-dissipation trade-off. For this general setting, we derive a quantum thermokinetic uncertainty relation for interacting multipartite systems, establishing a thermodynamic trade-off between current fluctuations, information flow, local dissipation, and quantum effects. Our analysis shows that, in addition to local dissipation, both information exchange and quantum coherence play essential roles in suppressing current fluctuations. These results have important implications for the performance of quantum thermal machines, such as information-thermodynamic engines and quantum clocks. We validate our theoretical findings through numerical simulations on two representative models: an autonomous quantum Maxwell's demon and a quantum clock. These results extend uncertainty relations to multipartite open quantum systems and elucidate the functional role of information flow in fluctuation suppression.</description>

      <title>The role of entropy production and thermodynamic uncertainty relations in the thermalization of open quantum systems</title>

      <description>arXiv:2510.05072v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The asymmetry between heating and cooling in open quantum systems is a hallmark of nonequilibrium dynamics, yet its thermodynamic origin has remained unclear. Here, we investigate the thermalization of a quantum system weakly coupled to a thermal bath, focusing on the entropy production rate and the quantum thermokinetic uncertainty relation (TKUR). We derive an analytical expression for the entropy production rate, showing that heating begins with a higher entropy production, which drives faster thermalization than cooling. The quantum TKUR links this asymmetry to heat current fluctuations, demonstrating that larger entropy production suppresses fluctuations, making heating more stable than cooling. Our results reveal the thermodynamic basis of asymmetric thermalization and highlight uncertainty relations as key to nonequilibrium quantum dynamics.</description>

Abstract: Within its range of applicability, the Boltzmann equation seems unique in its capacity to accurately describe the transition from almost any initial state to a self-equilibrated thermal state. Using information-theoretic methods to rephrase the key idea of Maxwell and Boltzmann, the Sto{\ss}zahlansatz, a far more general, abstract ansatz is developed. An increase of the Gibbs-Shannon-von Neumann entropy results without the usual coarse-graining. The mathematical structure of the ansatz also provides avenues for efficient computation and simulation.</description>

Abstract: An introduction to Bose-Einstein condensation and the $\lambda$-transition is given. Results of quantum loop Monte Carlo simulations are presented for interacting Lennard-Jones helium-4. The optimum condensation fraction is found by minimizing the constrained free energy. The results show that approaching the transition the growth of pure position permutation loops and the consequent divergence of the heat capacity are enabled by the suppression of condensation and consequently of superfluidity. Condensation and superfluidity emerge at the peak of the heat capacity due to mixed position permutation chains.</description>

      <title>Enhanced dispersion of active microswimmers in confined flows</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.08369v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In the presence of a laminar shear flow, the diffusion of passive colloidal particles is enhanced in the direction parallel to the flow. This classical phenomenon is known as Taylor-Aris dispersion. Besides, microorganisms, such as active microswimmers, exhibit an effective diffusive behavior at long times. Combining the two ingredients above, a natural question then emerges on how the effective diffusion of active microswimmers is altered in shear flows -- a widespread situation in natural environments with practical implications, \textit{e.g.} regarding biofilm formation. In this Letter, we investigate the motility and dispersion of \textit{Chlamydomonas reinhardtii} microalgae, within a rectangular microfluidic channel subjected to a sinusoidal Poiseuille flow. Using high-resolution optical microscopy and a particle-tracking algorithm, we reconstruct individual trajectories in various flow conditions and statistically analyze them through moment theory and sliding windowed demodulation. We find that the velocity fluctuations and the dispersion coefficient increase as the flow amplitude is increased, with only weak dependencies on the flow periodicity. Importantly, our results demonstrate that the generalization of Taylor-Aris law to active particles is valid.</description>

Abstract: We study the effects of nonreciprocity and network structure on percolation. To this end, we investigate nonreciprocal random networks - directed networks for which the probability of a link occurring from node i to node j differs from the probability of the reverse link occurring from node j to node i. We analytically determine the degree and percolation properties of such networks with exactly two types of link probability, demonstrating that whether the networks are structured such that the nodes are not statistically indistinguishable has profound effects on these measures, both quantitively and in how such networks need to be approached. In particular, we develop a technique for solving the percolation problem which can be applied to both structured and unstructured networks. The method entails writing self-consistent integral and differential equations for the probability that each node will belong to the network's giant component. Exact solutions to these equations are obtained and simulations which confirm our analytic predictions are presented.</description>

      <title>The Limits of Inference in Complex Systems: When Stochastic Models Become Indistinguishable</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.24977v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Robust inference for stochastic dynamical systems is often hampered by sparse sampling and the absence of closed-form likelihoods. We introduce a Monte Carlo path-inference framework that leverages full-path statistics and bridge processes to deliver reliable parameter estimation and model selection from coarsely sampled time series, without requiring analytical solutions. Crucially, we couple mechanistic stochastic models with their inference procedures to quantify how experimental design -specifically, sampling frequency and dataset size- governs estimator precision and model distinguishability. This analysis reveals optimal sampling regimes and sharp, resolution-dependent limits beyond which competing models become empirically indistinguishable. We validate the approach across four disparate systems -trajectories of optically trapped particles, human microbiome dynamics, social-media topic mentions, and forest population time series- recovering parameters and identifying when inference is fundamentally constrained by measurement resolution, thereby clarifying ongoing debates about dominant noise sources in these systems. Together, these results establish path-based Monte Carlo as a practical, general tool for inference and model discrimination in complex systems and provide principled guidelines for designing measurements that maximize information under real-world constraints.</description>

Abstract: This paper extends the results regarding entropic convergence and the strong linearized limit for the Boltzmann equation (without external force) in [C. David Levermore. Entropic convergence and the linearized limit for the Boltzmann equation. Communications in Partial Differential Equations, 18(7-8):1231--1248, 1993] to the case of the Boltzmann equation with external force. Our starting point is the Boltzmann equation with an external force introduced in [Diogo Ars\'enio and Laure Saint-Raymond. From the Vlasov--Maxwell--Boltzmann System to Incompressible Viscous Electro-magneto-hydrodynamics, EMS Press, 2019], we then find new conditions on the force and rigorously prove the maintaining result by Levermore. More specifically, any sequence of DiPerna-Lions renormalized solutions of the Boltzmann equation with external force are shown to have fluctuations (about the global Maxwellian equilibrium $M$) that converge entropically (and hence strongly in $L^1$) to the solution of the linearized Boltzmann equation for any positive time, given that its initial fluctuations about $M$ converge entropically to the provided $L^2$ initial data of the linearized equation, where the force can be physically significant.</description>

Abstract: We consider the relationship between thermodynamics, fitness, and Darwinian selection in autocatalytic molecular replicators. We uncover a thermodynamic bound that relates fitness, replication rate, and thermodynamic affinity of replication. This bound applies to a broad range of systems, including elementary and non-elementary autocatalytic reactions, polymer-based replicators, and certain kinds of autocatalytic sets. In addition, we show that the critical selection coefficient (the minimal fitness difference visible to selection) is bounded by a simple function of the affinity. Our results imply fundamental thermodynamic bounds on selection strength in molecular evolution, complementary to other bounds that arise from finite population sizes and error thresholds. These bounds may be relevant for understanding thermodynamic constraints faced by early replicators at the origin of life. We illustrate our approach on several examples, including a classic model of replicators in a chemostat.</description>

      <title>Active pattern formation emergent from single-species nonreciprocity</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.10093v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Nonreciprocal interactions violating Newton's third law are common in a plethora of nonequilibrium situations ranging from predator-prey systems to the swarming of birds and effective colloidal interactions under flow. While many recent studies have focused on two species with nonreciprocal coupling, less is examined for the basic single-component system breaking the actio and reactio equality of force within the same species. Here, we systematically derive a field theory for the case of single-species nonreciprocal interactions from the microscopic particle dynamics, leading to a generic continuum model termed Active Model N (N denoting nonreciprocity). We explore the rich dynamics of pattern formation in this nonreciprocal system and the emergence of self-traveling states with persistent variation and flowing of active branched patterns. One particular new characteristic pattern is an interwoven self-knitting "yarn" structure with a unique feature of simultaneous development of micro- and bulk phase separations. The growth dynamics of a "ball-of-wool" active droplet towards these self-knitted yarn or branched states exhibits a crossover between different scaling behaviors. The mechanism underlying this distinct class of active phase separation is attributed to the interplay between nonreciprocity and competition of interparticle forces. Our predictions can be applied to various biological and artificial active matter systems controlled by single-species nonreciprocity.</description>

      <title>Beyond holography: the entropic quantum gravity foundations of image processing</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.14048v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recently, thanks to the development of artificial intelligence (AI) there is increasing scientific attention in establishing the connections between theoretical physics and AI. Traditionally, these connections have been focusing mostly on the relation between string theory and image processing and involve important theoretical paradigms such as holography. Recently G. Bianconi has formulated the Gravity from Entropy (GfE) approach to quantum gravity in which gravity is derived from the geometric quantum relative entropy (GQRE) between two metrics associated with the Lorentzian spacetime. Here it is demonstrated that the famous Perona-Malik algorithm for image processing is the gradient flow that maximizes the GfE action in its simple warm-up scenario. Specifically, this algorithm is the outcome of the maximization of the GfE action calculated between two Euclidean metrics: the one of the support of the image and the one induced by the image. As the Perona-Malik algorithm is known to preserve sharp contours, this implies that the GfE action, does not in general lead to uniform images upon iteration of the gradient flow dynamics as it would be intuitively expected from entropic actions maximising classical entropies. Rather, the outcome of the maximization of the GfE action is compatible with the preservation of complex structures. These results provide the geometrical and information theory foundations for the Perona-Malik algorithm and might contribute to establish deeper connections between GfE, machine learning and brain research.</description>

      <title>Emergent random matrix universality in quantum operator dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.18311</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.18311v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The high complexity of many-body quantum dynamics means that essentially all approaches either exploit special structure or are approximate in nature. One such approach--the memory function formalism--involves a carefully chosen split into fast and slow modes. An approximate model for the fast modes can then be used to solve for Green's functions $G(z)$ of the slow modes. Using a formulation in operator Krylov space known as the recursion method, we prove the emergence of a universal random matrix description of the fast mode dynamics. This is captured by the level-$n$ Green's function $G_n (z)$, which we show approaches universal scaling forms in the fast limit $n\to\infty$. Notably, this emergent universality can occur in both chaotic and non-chaotic systems, provided their spectral functions are smooth. This universality of $G_n (z)$ is precisely analogous to the universality of eigenvalue correlations in random matrix theory (RMT), even though there is no explicit randomness present in the Hamiltonian. At finite $z$ we show that $G_n (z)$ approaches the Wigner semicircle law, while if $G(z)$ is the Green's function of certain hydrodynamical variables, we show that at low frequencies $G_n (z)$ is instead governed by the Bessel universality class from RMT. As an application of this universality, we give a numerical method--the spectral bootstrap--for approximating spectral functions from Lanczos coefficients. Our proof involves a map to a Riemann-Hilbert problem which we solve using a steepest-descent-type method, rigorously controlled in the $n\to\infty$ limit. We are led via steepest-descent to a Coulomb gas optimization problem, and we discuss how a recent conjecture--the `Operator Growth Hypothesis--is linked to a confinement transition in this Coulomb gas. These results elevate the recursion method to a theoretically principled framework with universal content.</description>

      <title>Phases of Floquet code under local decoherence</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.19041v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Floquet code is a dynamical quantum memory with a periodically evolving logical space. As a defining feature, the code exhibits an anyon automorphism after each period, giving rise to a non-trivial evolution of each logical state. In this paper, we study the Floquet code under local decoherence and perfect measurements and demonstrate that below the decoherence threshold, the code is in a robust phase characterized by the anyon automorphism. We first derive the 3D statistical mechanics model for the maximum likelihood decoder of the 2D Floquet code under local Pauli decoherence. We identify a class of two-qubit Pauli channels under which the 3D statistical mechanics model becomes decoupled 2D models and obtain the threshold for such decoherence channels. We then propose a diagnostic of the anyon automorphism in the presence of local decoherence. We analytically show that this diagnostic distinguishes the Floquet code from the toric code under repeated syndrome measurements and undergoes a phase transition at the threshold.</description>

      <title>Interaction effects on electronic Floquet spectra: Excitonic effects</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.07428</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.07428v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Floquet engineering of electronic states by light is a central topic in modern experiments. However, the impact of many-body interactions on the single-electron properties remains unclear in this non-equilibrium situation. We propose that interaction effects could be reasonably understood by performing perturbative expansion in both the pump field and the electron-electron interaction when computing physical quantities. As an example, we apply this approach to semiconductors and show analytically that excitonic effects, i.e., effects of electron-hole interaction, lead to dramatic corrections to the single-electron Floquet spectra even when the excitons are only virtually excited by the pump light. We compute these effects in phosphorene and monolayer MoS$_2$ for time- and angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy and ultrafast optical experiments.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2505.16451v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We analytically solve the critical dynamics of the Kob-Andersen kinetically constrained model of supercooled liquids on the Bethe lattice, employing a combinatorial argument based on the cavity method. For arbitrary values of graph connectivity z and facilitation parameter m, we demonstrate that the critical behavior of the order parameter is governed by equations of motion equivalent to those found in Mode-Coupling Theory. The resulting predictions for the dynamical exponents are validated through direct comparisons with numerical simulations that include both continuous and discontinuous transition scenarios.</description>

      <title>Tuning Steady Shear Rheology through Active Dopants</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.05262v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We numerically investigate the steady shear rheology of mixtures of active and passive Brownian particles, with varying fractions of active components. We find that even a small fraction of active dopants triggers fluidization with comparable efficiency to fully active systems. A combined parameter, active energy, given by dopant fraction multiplied by propulsion speed squared controls the steady shear rheology and glass transition of the active-passive mixtures. These results together provide a quantitative strategy for fine-tuning the mechanical properties of a soft material with small amounts of active dopants.</description>

      <title>Long-Range Interacting Particles on a Helix: A Statistical and Correlation Analysis of Equilibrium Configurations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.19189</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.19189v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We provide a statistical and correlational analysis of the spatial and energetic properties of equilibrium configurations of a few-body system of two to eight equally charged classical particles that are confined on a one-dimensional helical manifold. The two-body system has been demonstrated to yield an oscillatory effective potential, thus providing stable equilibrium configurations despite the repulsive Coulomb interactions. As the system size grows, the number of equilibria increases, approximately following a power-law. This can be attributed to the increasing complexity in the highly non-linear oscillatory behavior of the potential energy surface. This property is reflected in a crossover from a spatially regular distribution of equilibria for the two-body system to a heightened degree of disorder upon the addition of particles. However, in accordance with the repulsion within a helical winding, the observed interparticle distances in equilibrium configurations cluster around values of odd multiples of half a helical winding, thus maintaining an underlying regularity. Furthermore, an energetic hierarchy exists based on the spatial location of the local equilibria, which is subject to increasing fluctuations as the system size grows.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2508.01004v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study a quantum annealing approach for estimating the ground state energy of the Sherrington-Kirpatrick mean field spin glass model using the Suzuki-Kubo dynamics applied for individual local magnetization components. The solutions of the coupled differential equations, in discretized state, give a fast annealing algorithm (cost $N^3$) in estimating the ground state of the model: Classical ($E^0= -0.7629 \pm 0.0002$), Quantum ($E^0=-0.7623 \pm 0.0001$) and Mixed ($E^0=-0.7626 \pm 0.0001$), all of which are to be compared with the best known estimate $E^0= -0.763166726 \dots$ . We infer that the continuous nature of the magnetization variable used in the dynamics here is the reason for reaching close to the ground state quickly and also the reason for not observing the de-Almeida-Thouless line in this approach.</description>

      <title>Casimir Interaction between Polydisperse Colloids Trapped at a Fluid Interface</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.04864</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.04864v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate the effect of polydispersity on fluctuation-induced interactions between colloids trapped at a fluid interface. Using the scattering-matrix formalism, we calculate the interaction energy in two- and three-body systems under three mechanical boundary conditions. We find that size asymmetry can either suppress or enhance the many-body interaction compared to a monodisperse system, with the outcome depending on colloids mobility and separation. For fixed colloids, the interaction is suppressed at short separations but enhanced at large separations. In contrast, for mobile colloids, the interaction is predominantly enhanced at large distances but exhibits a competitive behavior in the near-field. This culminates in a large, multi-order-of-magnitude amplified sensitivity {to size asymmetry} for bobbing and tilting colloids at long range, highlighting a complex interplay between geometry and colloids mobility with significant implications for self-assembly.</description>

      <title>Stabilizer-Shannon Renyi Equivalence: Exact Results for Quantum Critical Chains</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.10700</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.10700v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Shannon-Renyi and stabilizer entropies are key diagnostics of structure, non-stabilizerness, phase transitions, and universality in quantum many-body states. We establish an exact correspondence for quadratic fermions: for any nondegenerate Gaussian eigenstate, the stabilizer Renyi entropy equals the Shannon-Renyi entropy of a number-conserving free-fermion eigenstate on a doubled system, evaluated in the computational basis. Specializing to the transverse-field Ising (TFI) chain, the TFI ground state stabilizer entropies maps to the Shannon-Renyi entropies of the XX-chain ground state of length $2L$. Building on this correspondence, together with other exact identities we prove, closed expressions for the stabilizer entropy at indices $\alpha=\frac{1}{2},2,4$ for a broad class of critical closed free-fermion systems were derived. Each of these can be written with respect to the universal functions of the TFI chain. We further obtain conformal-field-theory scaling laws for the stabilizer entropy under both periodic and open boundaries at arbitrary Renyi index for these critical systems.</description>

      <title>Mpemba Effects in Quantum Complexity</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.22176v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The Mpemba effect is the phenomenon whereby systems farther from equilibrium may relax faster. In this work, we show that this counterintuitive behavior appears in the very measures that define quantum complexity. Using the framework of quantum resource theories, we study the dynamics of coherence, imaginarity, non-Gaussianity, and magic state resources in random circuit models. Our results reveal that coherence and imaginarity display a quantum Mpemba effect when the system is initialized in resourceful product states, while non-Gaussianity and magic do not. Strikingly, all four resources exhibit the so-called Pontus-Mpemba effect: an initial "preheating" stage accelerates relaxation compared to direct "cooling" dynamics. Taken together, our findings show that Mpemba physics extends beyond thermodynamics and asymmetry, emerging broadly in the resource theories that capture aspects of quantum complexity.</description>

      <title>Generalized Wigner theorem for non-invertible symmetries</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.25327</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.25327v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We establish the conditions under which a conservation law associated with a non-invertible operator may be realized as a symmetry in quantum mechanics. As established by Wigner, all quantum symmetries must be represented by either unitary or antiunitary transformations. Relinquishing an implicit assumption of invertibility, we demonstrate that the fundamental invariance of quantum transition probabilities under the application of symmetries mandates that all non-invertible symmetries may only correspond to {\it projective} unitary or antiunitary transformations, i.e., {\it partial isometries}. This extends the notion of physical states beyond conventional rays in Hilbert space to equivalence classes in an {\it extended, gauged Hilbert space}, thereby broadening the traditional understanding of symmetry transformations in quantum theory. We discuss consequences of this result and explicitly illustrate how, in simple model systems, whether symmetries be invertible or non-invertible may be inextricably related to the particular boundary conditions that are being used.</description>

      <title>Quantum Fisher information matrices from R\'enyi relative entropies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.02218</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.02218v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Quantum generalizations of the Fisher information are important in quantum information science, with applications in high energy and condensed matter physics and in quantum estimation theory, machine learning, and optimization. One can derive a quantum generalization of the Fisher information matrix in a natural way as the Hessian matrix arising in a Taylor expansion of a smooth divergence. Such an approach is appealing for quantum information theorists, given the ubiquity of divergences in quantum information theory. In contrast to the classical case, there is not a unique quantum generalization of the Fisher information matrix, similar to how there is not a unique quantum generalization of the relative entropy or the R\'enyi relative entropy. In this paper, I derive information matrices arising from the log-Euclidean, $\alpha$-$z$, and geometric R\'enyi relative entropies, with the main technical tool for doing so being the method of divided differences for calculating matrix derivatives. Interestingly, for all non-negative values of the R\'enyi parameter $\alpha$, the log-Euclidean R\'enyi relative entropy leads to the Kubo-Mori information matrix, and the geometric R\'enyi relative entropy leads to the right-logarithmic derivative Fisher information matrix. Thus, the resulting information matrices obey the data-processing inequality for all non-negative values of the R\'enyi parameter $\alpha$ even though the original quantities do not. Additionally, I derive and establish basic properties of $\alpha$-$z$ information matrices resulting from the $\alpha$-$z$ R\'enyi relative entropies. For parameterized thermal states and time-evolved states, I establish formulas for their $\alpha$-$z$ information matrices and hybrid quantum-classical algorithms for estimating them, with applications in quantum Boltzmann machine learning.</description>
