      <title>Polynomial Complementation of Nondeterministic 2-Way Finite Automata by 1-Limited Automata</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.11209</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.11209v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We prove that, paying a polynomial increase in size only, every unrestricted two-way nondeterministic finite automaton (2NFA) can be complemented by a 1-limited automaton (1-LA), a nondeterministic extension of 2NFAs still characterizing regular languages. The resulting machine is actually a restricted form of 1-LAs -- known as 2NFAs with common guess -- and is self-verifying. A corollary of our construction is that a single exponential is necessary and sufficient for complementing 1-LAs.</description>

      <title>Universality in computable dynamical systems: Old and new</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.10725</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.10725v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The relationship between computational models and dynamics has captivated mathematicians and computer scientists since the earliest conceptualizations of computation. Recently, this connection has gained renewed attention, fueled by T. Tao's programme aiming to discover blowing-up solutions of the Navier-Stokes equations using an embedded computational model. In this survey paper, we review some of the recent works that introduce novel and exciting perspectives on the representation of computability through dynamical systems. Starting from dynamical universality in a classical sense, we shall explore the modern notions of Turing universality in fluid dynamics and Topological Kleene Field Theories as a systematic way of representing computable functions by means of dynamical bordisms. Finally, we will discuss some important open problems in the area.</description>

      <title>Execution and monitoring of HOA automata with HOAX</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.11126</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.11126v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a tool called Hoax for the execution of {\omega}-automata expressed in the popular HOA format. The tool leverages the notion of trap sets to enable runtime monitoring of any (non-parity) acceptance condition supported by the format. When the automaton is not monitorable, the tool may still be able to recognise so-called ugly prefixes, and determine that no further observation will ever lead to a conclusive verdict. The tool is open-source and highly configurable. We present its formal foundations, its design, and compare it against the trace analyser PyContract on a lock acquisition scenario.</description>

      <title>Foundation Models for Logistics: Toward Certifiable, Conversational Planning Interfaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.11352</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.11352v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Logistics operators, from battlefield coordinators rerouting airlifts ahead of a storm to warehouse managers juggling late trucks, often face life-critical decisions that demand both domain expertise and rapid and continuous replanning. While popular methods like integer programming yield logistics plans that satisfy user-defined logical constraints, they are slow and assume an idealized mathematical model of the environment that does not account for uncertainty. On the other hand, large language models (LLMs) can handle uncertainty and promise to accelerate replanning while lowering the barrier to entry by translating free-form utterances into executable plans, yet they remain prone to misinterpretations and hallucinations that jeopardize safety and cost. We introduce a neurosymbolic framework that pairs the accessibility of natural-language dialogue with verifiable guarantees on goal interpretation. It converts user requests into structured planning specifications, quantifies its own uncertainty at the field and token level, and invokes an interactive clarification loop whenever confidence falls below an adaptive threshold. A lightweight model, fine-tuned on just 100 uncertainty-filtered examples, surpasses the zero-shot performance of GPT-4.1 while cutting inference latency by nearly 50%. These preliminary results highlight a practical path toward certifiable, real-time, and user-aligned decision-making for complex logistics.</description>

      <title>On the Intersection Problem for Quantum Finite Automata</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.13797</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.13797v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper is a continuation of a previous study on the so-called measure once finite quantum automata model introduced by Moore and Crutchfield in 2000. We investigate conditions assuring that, given a language recognized by such a device and a language generated by a context-free grammar of finite index or by a matrix context-free grammar, it is recursively decidable whether or not they have a nonempty intersection.</description>

      <title>The structure of polynomial growth for tree automata/transducers and MSO set queries</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.10270</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.10270v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Given an $\mathbb{N}$-weighted tree automaton, we give a decision procedure for exponential vs polynomial growth (with respect to the input size) in quadratic time, and an algorithm that computes the exact polynomial degree of growth in cubic time. As a special case, they apply to the growth of the ambiguity of a nondeterministic tree automaton, i.e. the number of distinct accepting runs over a given input. Our time complexities match the recent fine-grained lower bounds for these problems restricted to ambiguity of word automata.
  We deduce analogous decidability results (ignoring complexity) for the growth of the number of results of set queries in Monadic Second-Order logic (MSO) over ranked trees. In the case of polynomial growth of degree $k$, we also prove a reparameterization theorem for such queries: their results can be mapped to $k$-tuples of input nodes in a finite-to-one and MSO-definable fashion.
  This property of MSO set queries leads directly to a generalization of the dimension minimization theorem for string-to-string polyregular functions. Our generalization applies to MSO set interpretations from trees, which subsume (as we show) tree-walking tree transducers and invisible pebble tree-to-string transducers. Finally, with a bit more work we obtain the following:
  * a new, short and conceptual proof that macro tree transducers of linear growth compute only tree-to-tree MSO transductions;
  * a procedure to decide polynomial size-to-height increase for both macro tree transducers and MSO set interpretations, and compute the degree.
  The paper concludes with a survey of a wide range of related work, with over a hundred references.</description>

      <title>On Complementation of Nondeterministic Finite Automata without Full Determinization (Technical Report)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.03439</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.03439v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Complementation of finite automata is a basic operation used in numerous applications. The standard way to complement a nondeterministic finite automaton (NFA) is to transform it into an equivalent deterministic finite automaton (DFA) and complement the DFA. The DFA can, however, be exponentially larger than the corresponding NFA. In this paper, we study several alternative approaches to complementation, which are based either on reverse powerset construction or on two novel constructions that exploit a commonly occurring structure of NFAs. Our experiment on a large data set shows that using a different than the classical approach can in many cases yield significantly smaller complements.</description>
