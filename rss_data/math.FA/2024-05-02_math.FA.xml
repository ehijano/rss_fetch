      <title>Variational inequalities for the Ornstein--Uhlenbeck semigroup: the higher--dimensional case</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.00497</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.00497v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the $\varrho$-th order variation seminorm of a general Ornstein--Uhlenbeck semigroup $\left(\mathcal H_t\right)_{t&gt;0}$ in $\mathbb R^n$, taken with respect to $t$. We prove that this seminorm defines an operator of weak type $(1,1)$ with respect to the invariant measure when $\varrho&gt; 2$. For large $t$, one has an enhanced version of the standard weak-type $(1,1)$ bound. For small $t$, the proof hinges on vector-valued Calder\'on--Zygmund techniques in the local region, and on the fact that the $t$ derivative of the integral kernel of $\mathcal H_t$ in the global region has a bounded number of zeros in $(0,1]$. A counterexample is given for $\varrho= 2$; in fact, we prove that the second order variation seminorm of $\left(\mathcal H_t\right)_{t&gt;0}$, and therefore also the $\varrho$-th order variation seminorm for any $\varrho\in [1,2)$, is not of strong nor weak type $(p,p)$ for any $p \in [1,\infty)$ with respect to the invariant measure.</description>

      <title>On the best constants of Schur multipliers of second order divided difference functions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.00464</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.00464v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We give a new proof of the boundedness of bilinear Schur multipliers of second order divided difference functions, as obtained earlier by Potapov, Skripka and Sukochev in their proof of Koplienko's conjecture on the existence of higher order spectral shift functions. Our proof is based on recent methods involving bilinear transference and the H\"ormander-Mikhlin-Schur multiplier theorem. Our approach provides a significant sharpening of the known asymptotic bounds of bilinear Schur multipliers of second order divided difference functions. Furthermore, we give a new lower bound of these bilinear Schur multipliers, giving again a fundamental improvement on the best known bounds obtained by Coine, Le Merdy, Potapov, Sukochev and Tomskova.
  More precisely, we prove that for $f \in C^2(\mathbb{R})$ and $1 &lt; p, p_1, p_2 &lt; \infty$ with $\frac{1}{p} = \frac{1}{p_1} + \frac{1}{p_2}$ we have \[ \Vert M_{f^{[2]}}: S_{p_1} \times S_{p_2} \rightarrow S_p \Vert \lesssim \Vert f'' \Vert_\infty D(p, p_1, p_2), \] where the constant $D(p, p_1, p_2)$ is specified in Theorem 7.1 and $D(p, 2p, 2p) \approx p^4 p^\ast$ with $p^\ast$ the H\"older conjugate of $p$. We further show that for $f(\lambda) = \lambda \vert \lambda \vert$, $\lambda \in \mathbb{R}$, for every $1 &lt; p &lt; \infty$ we have \[ p^2 p^\ast \lesssim \Vert M_{f^{[2]}}: S_{2p} \times S_{2p} \rightarrow S_p \Vert. \] Here $f^{[2]}$ is the second order divided difference function of $f$ with $M_{f^{[2]}}$ the associated Schur multiplier. In particular it follows that our estimate $D(p, 2p, 2p)$ is optimal for $p \searrow 1$.</description>

      <title>New estimates for a class of non-local approximations of the total variation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.16471</link>
      <description>arXiv:2307.16471v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider a class of non-local functionals recently introduced by H. Brezis, A. Seeger, J. Van Schaftingen, and P.-L. Yung, which offers a novel way to characterize functions with bounded variation.
  We give a positive answer to an open question related to these functionals in the case of functions with bounded variation. Specifically, we prove that in this case the liminf of these functionals can be estimated from below by a linear combination in which the three terms that sum up to the total variation (namely the total variation of the absolutely continuous part, of the jump part and of the Cantor part) appear with different coefficients. We prove also that this estimate is optimal in the case where the Cantor part vanishes, and we compute the precise value of the limit in this specific scenario.
  In the proof we start by showing the results in dimension one by relying on some measure theoretic arguments in order to identify sufficiently many disjoint rectangles in which the difference quotient can be estimated, and then we extend them to higher dimension by a classical sectioning argument.</description>

      <title>Boundedness of composition operators from Lorentz spaces to Orlicz spaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.18107</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.18107v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The boundedness (continuity) of composition operators from some function space to another one is significant, though there are few results about this problem. Thus, in this study, we provide necessary and sufficient conditions on the boundedness of composition operators from Lorentz spaces to Orlicz spaces. We emphasize that the measure spaces associated with the Lorentz space may be different from those associated with the Orlicz spaces. Moreover we give some examples and counterexamples of the composed mappings in the conditions.</description>
