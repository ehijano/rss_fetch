      <title>An Analysis of Quantum Annealing Algorithms for Solving the Maximum Clique Problem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.07587</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.07587v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum annealers can be used to solve many (possibly NP-hard) combinatorial optimization problems, by formulating them as quadratic unconstrained binary optimization (QUBO) problems or, equivalently, using the Ising formulation. In this paper we analyse the ability of quantum D-Wave annealers to find the maximum clique on a graph, expressed as a QUBO problem. Due to the embedding limit of 164 nodes imposed by the anneler, we conducted a study on graph decomposition to enable instance embedding. We thus propose a decomposition algorithm for the complementary maximum independent set problem, and a graph generation algorithm to control the number of nodes, the number of cliques, the density, the connectivity indices and the ratio of the solution size to the number of other nodes. We then statistically analysed how these variables affect the quality of the solutions found by the quantum annealer. The results of our investigation include recommendations on ratio and density limits not to be exceeded, as well as a series of precautions and a priori analyses to be carried out in order to maximise the probability of obtaining a solution close to the optimum.</description>

      <title>Readout Error Mitigation for Mid-Circuit Measurements and Feedforward</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.07611</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.07611v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Current-day quantum computing platforms are subject to readout errors, in which faulty measurement outcomes are reported by the device. On circuits with mid-circuit measurements and feedforward, readout noise can cause incorrect conditional quantum operations to be applied on a per-shot basis. Standard readout error mitigation methods for terminal measurements which act in post-processing do not suffice in this context. Here we present a general method for readout error mitigation for expectation values on circuits containing an arbitrary number of layers of mid-circuit measurements and feedforward, at zero circuit depth and two-qubit gate count cost. The protocol uses a form of gate twirling for symmetrization of the error channels and probabilistic bit-flips in feedforward data to average over an ensemble of quantum trajectories. The mitigated estimator is unbiased and has a sampling overhead of ${\sim} 1 / (1 - 2 r)^m$ for $m$ total measurements and characteristic readout error rate $r$ per measurement. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our method, obtaining up to a ${\sim} 60\%$ reduction in error on superconducting quantum processors for several examples of feedforward circuits of practical interest, including dynamic qubit resets, shallow-depth GHZ state preparation, and multi-stage quantum state teleportation.</description>

      <title>Breakdown of the quantum distinction of regular and chaotic classical dynamics in dissipative systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.07616</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.07616v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Grobe-Haake-Sommers (GHS) conjecture generalizes the Bohigas-Giannoni-Schmit conjecture to dissipative systems, connecting classically chaotic systems with quantum spectra that exhibit level repulsion as predicted by Ginibre ensembles. Here, we show that the GHS conjecture does not hold for the open Dicke model, which is a spin-boson model of experimental interest. Surprisingly, where the open quantum model shows Ginibre level statistics, we do not always find evidence of chaotic structures in the classical limit. This result challenges the universality of the GHS conjecture and raises the question of what is the source of spectral correlations in open quantum systems.</description>

      <title>Cooperative Sensing with Impurities in a Two-Dimensional Subwavelength Array</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.07619</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.07619v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose a versatile quantum sensing protocol based on two dissipatively coupled distant atoms embedded as impurities in a two-dimensional sub-wavelength atomic array. The array acts as a waveguide for the emitter light, creating cooperative enhancement that allows for more efficient population transfer. By monitoring the population of one of the impurity atoms, it is possible to detect frequency shifts in the emitters' resonance frequencies. We analytically estimate achievable sensitivities as well as the dependence on various system parameters. The proposed protocol is robust against various environmental factors and perturbations, which enhances its applicability in real-world scenarios.</description>

      <title>Recovery of resource through sequential noisy measurements</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.07652</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.07652v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Noisy unsharp measurements incorporated in quantum information protocols may hinder performance, reducing the quantum advantage. However, we show that, unlike projective measurements which completely destroy quantum correlations between nodes in quantum networks, sequential applications of noisy measurements can mitigate the adverse impact of noise in the measurement device on quantum information processing tasks. We demonstrate this in the case of concentrating entanglement on chosen nodes in quantum networks via noisy measurements performed by assisting qubits. In the case of networks with a cluster of three or higher number of qubits, we exhibit that sequentially performing optimal unsharp measurements on the assisting qubits yields localizable entanglement between two nodes akin to that obtained by optimal projective measurements on the same assisting qubits. Furthermore, we find that the proposed approach using consecutive noisy measurements can potentially be used to prepare desired states that are resource for specific quantum schemes. We also argue that assisting qubits have greater control over the qubits on which entanglement is concentrated via unsharp measurements, in contrast to sharp measurement-based protocols, which may have implications for secure quantum communication.</description>

      <title>Generating multipartite nonlocality to benchmark quantum computers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.07659</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.07659v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We show that quantum computers can be used for producing large $n$-partite nonlocality, thereby providing a method to benchmark them. The main challenges to overcome are: (i) The interaction topology might not allow arbitrary two-qubit gates. (ii) Noise limits the Bell violation. (iii) The number of combinations of local measurements grows exponentially with $n$. To overcome (i), we point out that graph states that are compatible with the two-qubit connectivity of the computer can be efficiently prepared. To mitigate (ii), we note that, for specific graph states, there are $n$-partite Bell inequalities whose resistance to white noise increases exponentially with $n$. To address (iii) for any $n$ and any connectivity, we introduce an estimator that relies on random sampling. As a result, we propose a method for producing $n$-partite Bell nonlocality with unprecedented large $n$. This allows in return to benchmark nonclassical correlations regardless of the number of qubits or the connectivity. We test our approach by using a simulation for a noisy IBM quantum computer, which predicts $n$-partite Bell nonlocality for at least $n=24$ qubits.</description>

      <title>Generalized Zeno effect and entanglement dynamics induced by fermion counting</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.07673</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.07673v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study a one-dimensional lattice system of free fermions subjected to a generalized measurement process: the system exchanges particles with its environment, but each fermion leaving or entering the system is counted. In contrast to the freezing of dynamics due to frequent measurements of lattice-site occupation numbers, a high rate of fermion counts induces fast fluctuations in the state of the system. Still, through numerical simulations of quantum trajectories and an analytical approach based on replica Keldysh field theory, we find that instantaneous correlations and entanglement properties of free fermions subjected to fermion counting and local occupation measurements are strikingly similar. We explain this similarity through a generalized Zeno effect induced by fermion counting and a universal long-wavelength description in terms of an $\mathrm{SU}(R)$ nonlinear sigma model. Further, for both types of measurement processes, we present strong evidence against the existence of a critical phase with logarithmic entanglement and conformal invariance at finite measurement rates. Instead, we identify a well-defined and finite critical range of length scales on which signatures of conformal invariance are observable. While area-law entanglement is established beyond a scale that is exponentially large in the measurement rate, the upper boundary of the critical range is only algebraically large and thus numerically accessible.</description>

      <title>Many-body thermal states on a quantum computer: a variational approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.07677</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.07677v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: {Many-body quantum states at thermal equilibrium are ubiquitous in nature. Investigating their dynamical properties is a formidable task due to the complexity of the Hilbert space they live in. Quantum computers may have the potential to effectively simulate quantum systems, provided that the many-body state under scrutiny can be faithfully prepared via an efficient algorithm. With this aim, we present a hybrid quantum--classical variational quantum algorithm for the preparation of the Gibbs state of the quantum $XY$ model. Our algorithm is based on the Grover and Rudolph parametrized quantum circuit for the preparation of the Boltzmann weights of the Gibbs state, and on a parity-preserving ansatz for the allocation of the eigenenergy basis to their respective Boltzmann weight. We explicitly show, with a paradigmatic few-body case instance, how the symmetries of a many-body system can be exploited to significantly reduce the exponentially increasing number of variational parameters needed in the Grover and Rudolph algorithm. Finally, we show that the density matrix, of the Gibbs state of the $XY$ model, obtained by statevector simulations for different parameters, exhibits a fidelity close to unity with the exact Gibbs state; this highlights the potential use of our protocol on current quantum computers.</description>

      <title>Optimized QUBO formulation methods for quantum computing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.07681</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.07681v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Several combinatorial optimization problems can be solved with NISQ devices once that a corresponding quadratic unconstrained binary optimization (QUBO) form is derived. The aim of this work is to drastically reduce the variables needed for these QUBO reformulations in order to unlock the possibility to efficiently obtain optimal solutions for a class of optimization problems with NISQ devices. This is achieved by introducing novel tools that allow an efficient use of slack variables, even for problems with non-linear constraints, without the need to approximate the starting problem. We divide our new techniques in two independent parts, called the iterative quadratic polynomial and the master-satellite methods. Hence, we show how to apply our techniques in case of an NP-hard optimization problem inspired by a real-world financial scenario called Max-Profit Balance Settlement. We follow by submitting several instances of this problem to two D-wave quantum annealers, comparing the performances of our novel approach with the standard methods used in these scenarios. Moreover, this study allows to appreciate several performance differences between the D-wave Advantage and Advantage2 quantum annealers.</description>

      <title>Experimenting with D-Wave Quantum Annealers on Prime Factorization problems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.07732</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.07732v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper builds on top of a paper we have published very recently, in which we have proposed a novel approach to prime factorization (PF) by quantum annealing, where 8,219,999=32,749x251 was the highest prime product we were able to factorize -- which, to the best of our knowledge is the largest number which was ever factorized by means of a quantum device. The series of annealing experiments which led us to these results, however, did not follow a straight-line path; rather, they involved a convoluted trial-and-error process, full of failed or partially-failed attempts and backtracks, which only in the end drove us to find the successful annealing strategies. In this paper, we delve into the reasoning behind our experimental decisions and provide an account of some of the attempts we have taken before conceiving the final strategies that allowed us to achieve the results. This involves also a bunch of ideas, techniques, and strategies we investigated which, although turned out to be inferior wrt. those we adopted in the end, may instead provide insights to a more-specialized audience of D-Wave users and practitioners. In particular, we show the following insights: ($i$) different initialization techniques affect performances, among which flux biases are effective when targeting locally-structured embeddings; ($ii$) chain strengths have a lower impact in locally-structured embeddings compared to problem relying on global embeddings; ($iii$) there is a trade-off between broken chain and excited CFAs, suggesting an incremental annealing offset remedy approach based on the modules instead of single qubits. Thus, by sharing the details of our experiences, we aim to provide insights into the evolving landscape of quantum annealing, and help people access and effectively use D-Wave quantum annealers.</description>

      <title>Field Test of Quantum Key Distribution with High Key Creation Efficiency</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.07786</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.07786v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantumkey distribution (QKD) promises unconditional security for communication. However, the random choices of the measurement basis in QKD usually result in low key creation efficiency. This drawback is overcome in the differential-phase-shift QKD, provided that each photon can be prepared in a large number of time bins with a proper waveform. In this work we develop a miniature 1550-nm single-photon source to generate narrowband single photon in 50 time bins with a nearly optimal waveform for achieving unity key creation efficiency. By utilizing these single photons in the field test, we demonstrate the differential-phase-shift QKD with a key creation efficiency of 97%. Our work shows that the practical QKD can benefit from the narrowband single photons with controllable waveforms.</description>

      <title>Efficient Arbitrated Quantum Digital Signature with Multi-Receiver Verification</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.07824</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.07824v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum digital signature is used to authenticate the identity of the signer with information theoretical security, while providing non-forgery and non-repudiation services. In traditional multi-receiver quantum digital signature schemes without an arbitrater, the transferability of one-to-one signature is always required to achieve unforgeability, with complicated implementation and heavy key consumption. In this article, we propose an arbitrated quantum digital signature scheme, in which the signature can be verified by multiple receivers simultaneously, and meanwhile, the transferability of the signature is still kept. Our scheme can be simplified performed to various quantum secure networks, due to the proposed efficient signature calculation procedure with low secure key consumption and low computation complexity, by employing one-time universal hashing algorithm and one-time pad encryption scheme. The evaluation results show that our scheme uses at least two orders of magnitude less key than existing signature schemes with transferability when signing files of the same length with the same number of receivers and security parameter settings.</description>

      <title>Reinforcement Learning to Disentangle Multiqubit Quantum States from Partial Observations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.07884</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.07884v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Using partial knowledge of a quantum state to control multiqubit entanglement is a largely unexplored paradigm in the emerging field of quantum interactive dynamics with the potential to address outstanding challenges in quantum state preparation and compression, quantum control, and quantum complexity. We present a deep reinforcement learning (RL) approach to constructing short disentangling circuits for arbitrary 4-, 5-, and 6-qubit states using an actor-critic algorithm. With access to only two-qubit reduced density matrices, our agent decides which pairs of qubits to apply two-qubit gates on; requiring only local information makes it directly applicable on modern NISQ devices. Utilizing a permutation-equivariant transformer architecture, the agent can autonomously identify qubit permutations within the state, and adjusts the disentangling protocol accordingly. Once trained, it provides circuits from different initial states without further optimization. We demonstrate the agent's ability to identify and exploit the entanglement structure of multiqubit states. For 4-, 5-, and 6-qubit Haar-random states, the agent learns to construct disentangling circuits that exhibit strong correlations both between consecutive gates and among the qubits involved. Through extensive benchmarking, we show the efficacy of the RL approach to find disentangling protocols with minimal gate resources. We explore the resilience of our trained agents to noise, highlighting their potential for real-world quantum computing applications. Analyzing optimal disentangling protocols, we report a general circuit to prepare an arbitrary 4-qubit state using at most 5 two-qubit (10 CNOT) gates.</description>

      <title>Parameter Estimation in Quantum Metrology Technique for Time Series Prediction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.07893</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.07893v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The paper investigates the techniques of quantum computation in metrological predictions, with a particular emphasis on enhancing prediction potential through variational parameter estimation. The applicability of quantum simulations and quantum metrology techniques for modelling complex physical systems and achieving high-resolution measurements are proposed. The impacts of various parameter distributions and learning rates on predictive accuracy are investigated. Modelling the time evolution of physical systems Hamiltonian simulation and the product formula procedure are adopted. The time block method is analyzed in order to reduce simulation errors, while the Schatten-infinite norm is used to evaluate the simulation precision. Methodology requires estimation of optimized parameters by minimizing loss functions and resource needs. For this purpose, the mathematical formulations of Cramer Rao Bound and Fischer Information are indispensable requirements. The impact of learning rates on regulating the loss function for various parameter values. Using parameterized quantum circuits, the article outlines a four-step procedure for extracting information. This method involves the preparation of input states, the evolution of parameterized quantum states, the measurement of outputs, and the estimation of parameters based on multiple measurements. The study analyses variational unitary circuits with optimized parameter estimation for more precise predictions. The findings shed light on the effects of normal parameter distributions and learning rates on attaining the most optimal state and comparison with classical Long Short Term Memory (LSTM) predictions, providing valuable insights for the development of more appropriate approaches in quantum computing.</description>

      <title>Enhancing phase sensitivity in Mach-Zehnder interferometer with various detection schemes using SU(1,1) coherent states</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.08007</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.08007v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Improving interferometric phase sensitivity is crucial for high-precision measurements in rapidly developing quantum technologies. The Mach-Zehnder interferometer (MZI) is a versatile tool for analyzing this phenomenon. By splitting and recombining a light beam using beam splitters, MZIs allow for precise phase sensitivity analysis using tools like the quantum Cram\'er-Rao bound (QCRB) and the quantum Fisher information (QFI). This paper analyzes the phase sensitivity of a MZI in various scenarios using different detection schemes and input states. We compare the single- and two-parameter quantum estimation and their associated QCRB for three phase-shift situations: in both arms, only in the upper arm (asymmetric), and in both arms symmetrically. We then investigate the phase sensitivity under three detection schemes: difference intensity, single-mode intensity, and balanced homodyne. Additionally, we explore the use of Perelomov and Barut-Girardello coherent states, two types of SU(1,1) coherent states, in all scenarios. Notably, we demonstrate that under optimal conditions, all detection schemes can achieve the QCRB by utilizing entangled SU(1,1) coherent states as input states.</description>

      <title>Quantum Reductive Perturbation Method for Photon Propagations in a Cold Atomic Gas</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.08008</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.08008v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We develop a quantum reductive perturbation method (RPM), a generalization of classical RPM widely used in nonlinear wave theory, to derive a simplified model (i.e. quantum nonlinear Schrodinger equation) from fully quantum Heisenberg-Langevin-Maxwell equations describingphoton propagations in a coherent cold atomic gas. The result is used to discuss two-photon bound states and optical solitons in the gas. Though a specific system is considered, the quantum RPM established here is very general and can be applied to other complex quantum nonlinear problems.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.08049v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The rotating wave approximation (RWA) is ubiquitous in the analysis of driven and coupled resonators. However, the limitations of the RWA seem to be poorly understood and in some cases the RWA disposes of essential physics. We investigate the RWA in the context of electrical resonant circuits. Using a classical Hamiltonian approach, we find that by balancing electrical and magnetic components of the resonator drive or resonator-resonator coupling, the RWA can be made exact. This type of balance, in which the RWA is exact, has applications in superconducting qubits where it suppresses nutation normally associated with strong Rabi driving. In the context of dispersive readout, balancing the qubit-resonator coupling changes the qubit leakage induced by the resonator drive (MIST), but does not remove it in the case of the transmon qubit.</description>

      <title>Quantum harvester enables energy transfer without randomness transfer or dissipation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.08054</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.08054v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider a foundational question in energy harvesting: given a partly random energy source, is it possible to extract the energy without also transferring randomness or accepting another thermodynamical cost? We answer this in the positive, describing scenarios and protocols where in principle energy is extracted from a field with randomness but without any randomness being transferred, and without energy dissipation. Such protocols fundamentally outperform existing methods of rectification which dissipate power, or feedback demon-like protocols which transfer randomness to the feedback system. The protocols exploit the possibility of the harvesting system taking several trajectories that lead to the same final state at a given time. We explain why these protocols do not violate basic physical principles. A key example involves the experimentally well-established phenomenon of Rabi oscillations between energy levels, exploiting the multitude of rotation axes in the state space that take the lower energy state to the excited state. The quantum system is deterministically excited to the highest energy level after interacting with the source for a fixed amount of time, irrespective of the random initial phase of the external potential.</description>

      <title>Gate-based counterdiabatic driving with complexity guarantees</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.08064</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.08064v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose a general, fully gate-based quantum algorithm for counterdiabatic driving. The algorithm does not depend on heuristics as in previous variational methods, and exploits regularisation of the adiabatic gauge potential to suppress only the transitions from the eigenstate of interest. This allows for a rigorous quantum gate complexity upper bound in terms of the minimum gap $\Delta$ around this target eigenstate. We find that the algorithm requires at most $\tilde O(\Delta^{-(3 + o(1))} \epsilon^{-(1 + o(1))})$ quantum gates to achieve a target state fidelity of at least $1 - \epsilon^2$, which is nearly equivalent to the gate complexity of gate-based adiabatic state preparation. This calls into question the perception of counterdiabatic driving as a general shortcut to adiabaticity.</description>

      <title>Bridging Resource Theory and Quantum Key Distribution: Geometric Analysis and Statistical Testing</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.08073v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Discerning between quantum and classical correlations is of great importance. Bell polytopes are well established as a fundamental tool. In this paper, we extend this line of inquiry by applying resource theory within the context of Network scenarios, to a Quantum Key Distribution (QKD) protocol. To achieve this, we consider the causal structure $P3$ that can describe the protocol, and we aim to develop useful statistical tests to assess it.
  More concretely, our objectives are twofold: firstly, to utilise the underlying causal structure of the QKD protocol to obtain a geometrical analysis of the resulting non-convex polytope, with a focus on the classical behaviours. Second, we devise a test within this framework to evaluate the distance between any two behaviours within the generated polytope. This approach offers a unique perspective, linking deviations from expected behaviour directly to the quality of the quantum resource or the residual nonclassicality in protocol execution.</description>

      <title>Classical simulability of constant-depth linear-optical circuits with noise</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.08086</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.08086v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Noise is one of the main obstacles to realizing quantum devices that achieve a quantum computational advantage. A possible approach to minimize the noise effect is to employ shallow-depth quantum circuits since noise typically accumulates as circuit depth grows. In this work, we investigate the complexity of shallow-depth linear-optical circuits under the effects of photon loss and partial distinguishability. By establishing a correspondence between a linear-optical circuit and a bipartite graph, we show that the effects of photon loss and partial distinguishability are equivalent to removing the corresponding vertices. Using this correspondence and percolation theory, we prove that for constant-depth linear-optical circuits with single photons, there is a threshold of loss (noise) rate above which the linear-optical systems can be decomposed into smaller systems with high probability, which enables us to simulate the systems efficiently. Consequently, our result implies that even in shallow-depth circuits where noise is not accumulated enough, its effect may be sufficiently significant to make them efficiently simulable using classical algorithms due to its entanglement structure constituted by shallow-depth circuits.</description>

      <title>Simulation of the Dissipative Dynamics of Strongly Interacting NV Centers with Tensor Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.08108</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.08108v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: NV centers in diamond are a promising platform for highly sensitive quantum sensors for magnetic fields and other physical quantities. The quest for high sensitivity combined with high spatial resolution leads naturally to dense ensembles of NV centers, and hence to strong, long-range interactions between them. Hence, simulating strongly interacting NVs becomes essential. However, obtaining the exact dynamics for a many-spin system is a challenging task due to the exponential scaling of the Hilbert space dimension, a problem that is exacerbated when the system is modelled as an open quantum system. In this work, we employ the Matrix Product Density Operator (MPDO) method to represent the many-body mixed state and to simulate the dynamics of an ensemble of NVs in the presence of strong long-range couplings due to dipole-dipole forces. We benchmark different time-evolution algorithms in terms of numerical accuracy and stability. Subsequently, we simulate the dynamics in the strong interaction regime, with and without dissipation.</description>

      <title>Optical Investigations of Coherence and Relaxation Dynamics of a Thulium-doped Yttrium Gallium Garnet Crystal at sub-Kelvin Temperatures for Optical Quantum Memory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.08167</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.08167v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Rare-earth ion-doped crystals are of great interest for quantum memories, a central component in future quantum repeaters. To assess the promise of 1$\%$ Tm$^{3+}$-doped yttrium gallium garnet (Tm:YGG), we report measurements of optical coherence and energy-level lifetimes of its $^3$H$_6$ $\leftrightarrow$ $^3$H$_4$ transition at a temperature of around 500 mK and various magnetic fields. Using spectral hole burning, we find hyperfine ground-level (Zeeman level) lifetimes of several minutes at magnetic fields of less than 1000 G. We also measure coherence time exceeding one millisecond using two-pulse photon echoes. Three-pulse photon echo and spectral hole burning measurements reveal that due to spectral diffusion, the effective coherence time reduces to a few $\mu$s over a timescale of around two hundred seconds. Finally, temporal and frequency-multiplexed storage of optical pulses using the atomic frequency comb protocol is demonstrated. Our results suggest Tm:YGG to be promising for multiplexed photonic quantum memory for quantum repeaters.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.08169v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The feedback-based algorithm for quantum optimization \\(FALQON) has recently been proposed to solve quadratic unconstrained binary optimization problems. This paper efficiently generalizes FALQON to tackle quadratic constrained binary optimization (QCBO) problems. For this purpose, we introduce a new operator that encodes the problem's solution as its ground state. Using Lyapunov control theory, we design a quantum control system such that the state converges to the ground state of this operator. When applied to the QCBO problem, we show that our proposed algorithm saves computational resources by reducing the depth of the quantum circuit and can perform better than FALQON. The effectiveness of our proposed algorithm is further illustrated through numerical simulations.</description>

      <title>Fluorescence enhancement of single V2 centers in a 4H-SiC cavity antenna</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.08208v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Solid state quantum emitters are a prime candidate in distributed quantum technologies since they inherently provide a spin-photon interface. An ongoing challenge in the field, however, is the low photon extraction due to the high refractive index of typical host materials. This challenge can be overcome using photonic structures. Here, we report the integration of V2 centers in a cavity-based optical antenna. The structure consists of a silver-coated, 135 nm thin 4H-SiC membrane functioning as a planar cavity with a broadband resonance yielding a theoretical photon collection enhancement factor of 34. The planar geometry allows us to identify over 20 single V2 centers at room temperature with a mean (maximum) count rate enhancement factor of 9 (15). Moreover, we observe 10 V2 centers with a mean absorption linewidth below 80MHz at cryogenic temperatures. These results demonstrate a photon collection enhancement that is robust to the lateral emitter position.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.08251v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, we have demonstrated that optically generated fictitious magnetic fields can be utilized to extend the lifetime of quantum memories in cold atomic ensembles. All the degrees of freedom of an AC Stark shift such as polarization, spatial profile, and temporal waveform can be readily controlled in a precise manner. Temporal fluctuations over several experimental cycles, and spatial inhomogeneities along a cold atomic gas have been compensated by an optical beam. The advantage of the use of fictitious magnetic fields for quantum storage stems from the speed and spatial precision that these fields can be synthesized. Our simple and versatile technique can find widespread application in coherent pulse and single-photon storage in any atomic species.</description>

      <title>Suppressing Counter-Rotating Errors for Fast Single-Qubit Gates with Fluxonium</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.08295</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.08295v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Qubit decoherence unavoidably degrades the fidelity of quantum logic gates. Accordingly, realizing gates that are as fast as possible is a guiding principle for qubit control, necessitating protocols for mitigating error channels that become significant as gate time is decreased. One such error channel arises from the counter-rotating component of strong, linearly polarized drives. This error channel is particularly important when gate times approach the qubit Larmor period and represents the dominant source of infidelity for sufficiently fast single-qubit gates with low-frequency qubits such as fluxonium. In this work, we develop and demonstrate two complementary protocols for mitigating this error channel. The first protocol realizes circularly polarized driving in circuit quantum electrodynamics (QED) through simultaneous charge and flux control. The second protocol -- commensurate pulses -- leverages the coherent and periodic nature of counter-rotating fields to regularize their contributions to gates, enabling single-qubit gate fidelities reliably exceeding $99.997\%$. This protocol is platform independent and requires no additional calibration overhead. This work establishes straightforward strategies for mitigating counter-rotating effects from strong drives in circuit QED and other platforms, which we expect to be helpful in the effort to realize high-fidelity control for fault-tolerant quantum computing.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.08320v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Brick-wall circuits composed of the Yang-Baxter gates are integrable. It becomes an important tool to study the quantum many-body system out of equilibrium. To put the Yang-Baxter gate on the quantum computer, it has to be decomposed into the native gates of quantum computers. It is favorable to apply the least number of native two-qubit gates to construct the Yang-Baxter gate. We study the geometric representations of all X-type braid gates and their corresponding Yang-Baxter gates via the Yang-Baxterization. We find that the braid and Yang-Baxter gates can only exist on certain edges and faces of the two-qubit tetrahedron. We identify the parameters by which the braid and Yang-Baxter gates are the Clifford gate, the matchgate, and the dual-unitary gate. The geometric representations provide the optimal decompositions of the braid and Yang-Baxter gates in terms of other two-qubit gates. We also find that the entangling powers of the Yang-Baxter gates are determined by the spectral parameters. Our results provide the necessary conditions to construct the braid and Yang-Baxter gates on quantum computers.</description>

      <title>Exact Correlation Functions for Dual-Unitary Quantum circuits with exceptional points</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.08338v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Dual-unitary quantum circuits can provide analytic spatiotemporal correlation functions of local operators from transfer matrices, enriching our understanding of quantum dynamics with exact solutions. Nevertheless, a full understanding is still lacking as the case of a non-diagonalizable transfer matrix with exceptional points has less been investigated. In this paper, we give an inverse approach for constructing dual-unitary quantum circuits with exceptional points in the transfer matrices, by establishing relations between transfer matrices and local unitary gates. As a consequence of the coalesce of eigenvectors, the correlation functions exhibit a polynomial modified exponential decay, which is significantly different from pure exponential decay, especially at early stages. Moreover, we point out that the Hamiltonian evolution of a kicked XXZ spin chain can be approximately mapped to a dual-unitary circuit with exceptional points by Trotter decomposition. Finally, we investigate the dynamics approaching and at exceptional points, showing that behaviors of correlation functions are distinct by Laplace transformation.</description>

      <title>Operational Interpretation of the Choi Rank Through k-State Exclusion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.08360</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.08360v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Choi-state is an indispensable tool in the study and analysis of quantum channels. Considering a channel in terms of its associated Choi-state can greatly simplify problems. It also offers an alternative approach to the characterisation of a channel, with properties of the Choi-state providing novel insight into a channel's behaviour. The rank of a Choi-state, termed the Choi-rank, has proven to be an important characterising property, and here, its significance is further elucidated through an operational interpretation. The Choi-rank is shown to provide a universal bound on how successfully two agents, Alice and Bob, can perform an entanglement-assisted exclusion task. The task can be considered an extension of super-dense coding, where Bob can only output information about Alice's encoded bit-string with certainty. Conclusive state exclusion, in place of state discrimination, is therefore considered at the culmination of the super-dense coding protocol. In order to prove this result, a necessary condition for conclusive k-state exclusion of a set of states is presented in order to achieve this result, and the notions of weak and strong exclusion are introduced.</description>

Abstract: We report the first experimental demonstration of the odd-cycle game. We entangle two ions separated by ~2 m and the players use them to win the odd-cycle game significantly more often than the best classical strategy allows. The experiment implements the optimal quantum strategy, is free of the detection loophole (the detection efficiency is &gt;~99.999 %), and achieves 97.8(3) % of the theoretical limit to the quantum winning probability. It provides a nonlocal content of 0.54(2) -- the largest value for physically separate devices, free of the detection loophole, ever observed.</description>

      <title>Ultrasensitive single-ion electrometry in a magnetic field gradient</title>

Abstract: Hyperfine energy levels in trapped ions offer long-lived spin states. In addition, the motion of these charged particles couples strongly to external electric field perturbations. These characteristics make trapped ions attractive platforms for the quantum sensing of electric fields. However, the spin states do not exhibit a strong intrinsic coupling to electric fields. This limits the achievable sensitivities. Here, we amplify the coupling between electric field perturbations and the spin states by using a static magnetic field gradient. Displacements of the trapped ion resulting from the forces experienced by an applied external electric field perturbation are thereby mapped to an instantaneous change in the energy level splitting of the internal spin states. This gradient mediated coupling of the electric field to the spin enables the use of a range of well-established magnetometry protocols for electrometry. Using our quantum sensor, we demonstrate AC sensitivities of $\mathrm{S^{AC}_{min}=960(10)\times 10^{-6}~V m^{-1}Hz^{-\frac{1}{2}}}$ at a signal frequency of $\omega_{\epsilon}/2\pi=5.82~\mathrm{Hz}$, and DC sensitivities of $\mathrm{S^{DC}_{min}=1.97(3)\times 10^{-3} ~V m^{-1}Hz^{-\frac{1}{2}}}$ with a Hahn-echo type sensing sequence. We also employ a rotating frame relaxometry technique, with which our quantum sensor can be utilised as an electric field noise spectrum analyser. We measure electric field signals down to a noise floor of $\mathrm{S_{E}(\omega)=6.2(5)\times 10^{-12}~V^2 m^{-2}Hz^{-1}}$ at a frequency of $\mathrm{30.0(3)~kHz}$. We therefore demonstrate unprecedented electric field sensitivities for the measurement of both DC signals and AC signals across a frequency range of sub-Hz to $\sim\mathrm{500~kHz}$. Finally, we describe a set of hardware modifications that are capable of achieving a further improvement in sensitivity by up to six orders of magnitude.</description>

      <title>Tailoring Bound State Geometry in High-Dimensional Non-Hermitian Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.07626</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.07626v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: It is generally believed that the non-Hermitian effect (NHSE), due to its non-reciprocal nature, creates barriers for the appearance of impurity bound states. In this paper, we find that in two and higher dimensions, the presence of geometry-dependent skin effect eliminates this barrier such that even an infinitesimal impurity potential can confine bound states in this type of non-Hermitian systems. By examining bound states around Bloch saddle points, we find that non-Hermiticity can disrupt the isotropy of bound states, resulting in concave dumbbell-shaped bound states. Our work reveals a geometry transition of bound state between concavity and convexity in high-dimensional non-Hermitian systems.</description>

      <title>Coherent Erbium Spin Defects in Colloidal Nanocrystal Hosts</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.07762</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.07762v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We demonstrate nearly a microsecond of spin coherence in Er3+ ions doped in cerium dioxide nanocrystal hosts, despite a large gyromagnetic ratio and nanometric proximity of the spin defect to the nanocrystal surface. The long spin coherence is enabled by reducing the dopant density below the instantaneous diffusion limit in a nuclear spin-free host material, reaching the limit of a single erbium spin defect per nanocrystal. We observe a large Orbach energy in a highly symmetric cubic site, further protecting the coherence in a qubit that would otherwise rapidly decohere. Spatially correlated electron spectroscopy measurements reveal the presence of Ce3+ at the nanocrystal surface that likely acts as extraneous paramagnetic spin noise. Even with these factors, defect-embedded nanocrystal hosts show tremendous promise for quantum sensing and quantum communication applications, with multiple avenues, including core-shell fabrication, redox tuning of oxygen vacancies, and organic surfactant modification, available to further enhance their spin coherence and functionality in the future.</description>

      <title>Quantum Hamilton-Jacobi Theory, Spectral Path Integrals and Exact-WKB</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.07829</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.07829v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose a new way to perform path integrals in quantum mechanics by using a quantum version of Hamilton-Jacobi theory. In classical mechanics, Hamilton-Jacobi theory is a powerful formalism, however, its utility is not explored in quantum theory beyond the correspondence principle. The canonical transformation enables one to set the new Hamiltonian to constant or zero, but keeps the information about solution in Hamilton's characteristic function. To benefit from this in quantum theory, one must work with a formulation in which classical Hamiltonian is used. This uniquely points to phase space path integral. However, the main variable in HJ-formalism is energy, not time. Thus, we are led to consider Fourier transform of path integral, spectral path integral, $\tilde Z(E)$. This admits a representation in terms of a quantum Hamilton's characteristic functions for perturbative and non-perturbative periodic orbits, generalizing Gutzwiller's sum. This results in a path integral derivation of exact quantization conditions, complementary to the exact WKB analysis of differential equations. We apply these to generic $\mathbb Z_2$ symmetric multi-well potential problems and point out some new instanton effects, e.g., the level splitting is generically a multi-instanton effect, unlike double-well.</description>

      <title>Collinear three-photon excitation of a strongly forbidden optical clock transition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.07902</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.07902v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The ${}^1\!S_0-{}^3\!P_0$ clock transition in strontium serves as the foundation for the world's best atomic clocks and for gravitational wave detector concepts in clock atom interferometry. This transition is weakly allowed in the fermionic isotope $^{87}$Sr, but strongly forbidden in bosonic isotopes unless a strong external magnetic field is applied. Here we demonstrate coherent excitation of the clock transition in bosonic ${}^{88}$Sr using a novel collinear three-photon process in a weak magnetic field. We observe Rabi oscillations with frequencies of up to $50~\text{kHz}$ using $\text{W}/\text{cm}^{2}$ laser intensities and Gauss-level magnetic field amplitudes. The absence of nuclear spin in bosonic isotopes offers decreased sensitivity to magnetic fields and optical lattice light shifts, enabling clocks with reduced systematic errors. The collinear propagation of the laser fields permits the interrogation of spatially separated atomic ensembles with common laser pulses, a key requirement for dark matter searches and gravitational wave detection with clock atom interferometers.</description>

Abstract: We perform two-tone spectroscopy on quantum circuits, where high-frequency radiation is generated by a voltage-biased superconductor-normal-superconductor Josephson junction and detection is carried out by an ancillary microwave resonator. We implement this protocol on two different systems, a transmon qubit and a $\lambda/4$ resonator. We demonstrate that this two-tone Josephson spectroscopy operates well into the millimeter-wave band, reaching frequencies larger than 80 GHz, and is well-suited for probing highly coherent quantum systems.</description>

      <title>Designing metasurface optical interfaces for solid-state qubits using many-body adjoint shape optimization</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.08212v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a general strategy for the inverse design of metasurfaces composed of elementary shapes. We use it to design a structure that collects and collimates light from nitrogen-vacancy centers in diamond. Such metasurfaces constitute scalable optical interfaces for solid-state qubits, enabling efficient photon coupling into optical fibers and eliminating free-space collection optics. The many-body shape optimization strategy is a practical alternative to topology optimization that explicitly enforces material and fabrication constraints throughout the optimization, while still achieving high performance. The metasurface is easily adaptable to other solid-state qubits, and the optimization method is broadly applicable to fabrication-constrained photonic design problems.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.08264v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Experimental and numerical spectroscopy have revealed rich physics in antiferromagnets, in particular in frustrated and doped systems. The Majumdar-Ghosh (MG) model has an analytically known spin-disordered ground state of dimerized singlets as a result of magnetic frustration. Here we study the single-hole angle-resolved photoemission spectrum (ARPES) of a doped MG model, where we introduce a spin-hole interaction that is experimentally accessible with ultracold molecules. We report a bound spinon-holon ground state and clear signatures of a spinon-holon molecule state and polarons in the ARPES spectrum at different magnetizations. Moreover, we find signatures of an emergent Feshbach resonance with tunable interactions associated with the unbinding of the spinon and the holon. Our results provide new insights into the physics of dopants in frustrated $t$-$J$ models and establish the latter as a new platform for studies of emergent few-body phenomena.</description>

      <title>GPU-accelerated Auxiliary-field quantum Monte Carlo with multi-Slater determinant trial states</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.08314v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The accuracy of phaseless auxiliary-field quantum Monte Carlo (ph-AFQMC) can be systematically improved with better trial states. Using multi-Slater determinant trial states, ph-AFQMC has the potential to faithfully treat strongly correlated systems, while balancing the static and dynamical correlations on an equal footing. This preprint presents an implementation and application of graphics processing unit-accelerated ph-AFQMC, for multi-Slater determinant trial wavefunctions (GPU-accelerated MSD-AFQMC), to enable efficient simulation of large-scale, strongly correlated systems. This approach allows for nearly-exact computation of ground state energies in multi-reference systems. Our GPU-accelerated MSD-AFQMC is implemented in the open-source code \texttt{ipie}, a Python-based AFQMC package [\textit{J. Chem. Theory Comput.}, 2022, 19(1): 109-121]. We benchmark the performance of the GPU code on transition-metal clusters like [Cu$_2$O$_2$]$^{2+}$ and [Fe$_2$S$_2$(SCH$_3$)]$^{2-}$. The GPU code achieves at least sixfold speedup in both cases, comparing the timings of a single A100 GPU to that of a 32-CPU node. For [Fe$_2$S$_2$(SCH$_3$)]$^{2-}$, we demonstrate that our GPU MSD-AFQMC can recover the dynamical correlation necessary for chemical accuracy with an MSD trial, despite the large number of determinants required ($&gt;10^5$). Our work significantly enhances the efficiency of MSD-AFQMC calculations for large, strongly correlated molecules by utilizing GPUs, offering a promising path for exploring the electronic structure of transition metal complexes.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.08388v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We establish a connection between the electromagnetic Hall response and band topological invariants in hyperbolic Chern insulators by deriving a hyperbolic analog of the Thouless-Kohmoto-Nightingale-den Nijs (TKNN) formula. By generalizing the Kubo formula to hyperbolic lattices, we show that the Hall conductivity is quantized to $-e^2C_{ij}/h$, where $C_{ij}$ is the first Chern number. Through a flux-threading argument, we provide an interpretation of the Chern number as a topological invariant in hyperbolic band theory. We demonstrate that, although it receives contributions from both Abelian and non-Abelian Bloch states, the Chern number can be calculated solely from Abelian states, resulting in a tremendous simplification of the topological band theory. Finally, we verify our results numerically by computing various Chern numbers in the hyperbolic Haldane model.</description>

      <description>arXiv:1812.00954v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Efficient synthesis of arbitrary quantum states and unitaries from a universal fault-tolerant gate-set e.g. Clifford+T is a key subroutine in quantum computation. As large quantum algorithms feature many qubits that encode coherent quantum information but remain idle for parts of the computation, these should be used if it minimizes overall gate counts, especially that of the expensive T-gates. We present a quantum algorithm for preparing any dimension-$N$ pure quantum state specified by a list of $N$ classical numbers, that realizes a trade-off between space and T-gates. Our scheme uses $\mathcal{O}(\log{(N/\epsilon)})$ clean qubits and a tunable number of $\sim(\lambda\log{(\frac{\log{N}}{\epsilon})})$ dirty qubits, to reduce the T-gate cost to $\mathcal{O}(\frac{N}{\lambda}+\lambda\log{\frac{N}{\epsilon}}\log{\frac{\log{N}}{\epsilon}})$. This trade-off is optimal up to logarithmic factors, proven through an unconditional gate counting lower bound, and is, in the best case, a quadratic improvement in T-count over prior ancillary-free approaches. We prove similar statements for unitary synthesis by reduction to state preparation. Underlying our constructions is a T-efficient circuit implementation of a quantum oracle for arbitrary classical data.</description>

Abstract: A semidefinite program (SDP) is a particular kind of convex optimization problem with applications in operations research, combinatorial optimization, quantum information science, and beyond. In this work, we propose variational quantum algorithms for approximately solving SDPs. For one class of SDPs, we provide a rigorous analysis of their convergence to approximate locally optimal solutions, under the assumption that they are weakly constrained (i.e., $N\gg M$, where $N$ is the dimension of the input matrices and $M$ is the number of constraints). We also provide algorithms for a more general class of SDPs that requires fewer assumptions. Finally, we numerically simulate our quantum algorithms for applications such as MaxCut, and the results of these simulations provide evidence that convergence still occurs in noisy settings.</description>

Abstract: This study introduces a method for simulating quantum systems using electrical networks. Our approach leverages a generalized similarity transformation, which connects different Hamiltonians, enabling well-defined paths for quantum system simulation using classical circuits. By synthesizing interaction networks, we accurately simulate quantum systems of varying complexity, from $2-$state to $n-$state systems. Unlike quantum computers, classical approaches do not require stringent conditions, making them more accessible for practical implementation. Our reinterpretation of Born's rule in the context of electrical circuit simulations offers a perspective on quantum phenomena.</description>

Abstract: Quantum entanglement and decoherence are the two counterforces of many quantum technologies and protocols. For example, while quantum teleportation is fueled by a pair of maximally entangled resource qubits, it is vulnerable to decoherence. In this Article, we propose an efficient quantum teleportation protocol in the presence of pure decoherence and without entangled resource qubits entering the Bell-state measurement. Instead, we employ multipartite hybrid entanglement between the auxiliary qubits and their local environments within the open-quantum-system context. Interestingly, with a hybrid-entangled initial state, it is the decoherence that allows us to achieve high fidelities. We demonstrate our protocol in an all-optical experiment.</description>

      <title>Improving social welfare in non-cooperative games with different types of quantum resources</title>

      <description>arXiv:2211.01687v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate what quantum advantages can be obtained in multipartite non-cooperative games by studying how different types of quantum resources can lead to new Nash equilibria and improve social welfare -- a measure of the quality of an equilibrium. Two different quantum settings are analysed: a first, in which players are given direct access to an entangled quantum state, and a second, which we introduce here, in which they are only given classical advice obtained from quantum devices. For a given game $G$, these two settings give rise to different equilibria characterised by the sets of equilibrium correlations $Q_\textrm{corr}(G)$ and $Q(G)$, respectively. We show that $Q(G)\subseteq Q_\textrm{corr}(G)$, and by exploiting the self-testing property of some correlations, that the inclusion is strict for some games $G$. We make use of SDP optimisation techniques to study how these quantum resources can improve social welfare, obtaining upper and lower bounds on the social welfare reachable in each setting. We investigate, for several games involving conflicting interests, how the social welfare depends on the bias of the game and improve upon a separation that was previously obtained using pseudo-telepathic solutions.</description>

      <title>Information scrambling and the growth of errors in noisy tomography -- a quantum signature of chaos</title>

      <description>arXiv:2211.11221v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: How does quantum chaos lead to rapid scrambling of information as well as errors across a system when one introduces perturbations in the dynamics? What are its consequences for the reliability of quantum simulations and quantum information processing? We employ continuous measurement quantum tomography as a paradigm to study these questions. The measurement record is generated as a sequence of expectation values of a Hermitian observable evolving under repeated application of the Floquet map of the quantum kicked top. Interestingly, we find that the reconstruction fidelity initially increases regardless of the degree of chaos or the strength of perturbations in the dynamics. For random states, when the measurement record is obtained from a random initial observable, the subsequent drop in the fidelity obtained is inversely correlated to the degree of chaos in the dynamics. More importantly, this also gives us an operational interpretation of Loschmidt echo for operators by connecting it to the performance of quantum tomography. We define a quantity to capture the scrambling of errors, an out-of-time-ordered correlator (OTOC) between two operators under perturbed and unperturbed system dynamics that serves as a signature of chaos and quantifies the spread of errors. Our results demonstrate not only a fundamental link between Loschmidt echo and scrambling of errors, as captured by OTOCs, but that such a link can have operational consequences in quantum information processing.</description>

      <title>Unifying flavors of fault tolerance with the ZX calculus</title>

      <description>arXiv:2303.08829v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: There are several models of quantum computation which exhibit shared fundamental fault-tolerance properties. This article makes commonalities explicit by presenting these different models in a unifying framework based on the ZX calculus. We focus on models of topological fault tolerance - specifically surface codes - including circuit-based, measurement-based and fusion-based quantum computation, as well as the recently introduced model of Floquet codes. We find that all of these models can be viewed as different flavors of the same underlying stabilizer fault-tolerance structure, and sustain this through a set of local equivalence transformations which allow mapping between flavors. We anticipate that this unifying perspective will pave the way to transferring progress among the different views of stabilizer fault-tolerance and help researchers familiar with one model easily understand others.</description>

      <title>Pauli Manipulation Detection codes and Applications to Quantum Communication over Adversarial Channels</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.06269</link>
      <description>arXiv:2304.06269v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We introduce and explicitly construct a quantum code we coin a "Pauli Manipulation Detection" code (or PMD), which detects every Pauli error with high probability. We apply them to construct the first near-optimal codes for two tasks in quantum communication over adversarial channels. Our main application is an approximate quantum code over qubits which can efficiently correct from a number of (worst-case) erasure errors approaching the quantum Singleton bound. Our construction is based on the composition of a PMD code with a stabilizer code which is list-decodable from erasures.
  Our second application is a quantum authentication code for "qubit-wise" channels, which does not require a secret key. Remarkably, this gives an example of a task in quantum communication which is provably impossible classically. Our construction is based on a combination of PMD codes, stabilizer codes, and classical non-malleable codes (Dziembowski et al., 2009), and achieves "minimal redundancy" (rate $1-o(1)$).</description>

      <title>Reservoir-Free Decoherence in Flying Qubits</title>

      <description>arXiv:2305.02746v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: An effective time-dependent Hamiltonian can be implemented by making a quantum system fly through an inhomogeneous potential, realizing, for example, a quantum gate on its internal degrees of freedom. However, flying systems have a spatial spread that will generically entangle the internal and spatial degrees of freedom, leading to decoherence in the internal state dynamics, even in the absence of any external reservoir. We provide formulas valid at all times for the dynamics, fidelity, and change of entropy for ballistic particles with small spatial spreads, quantified by $\Delta x$. This non-Markovian decoherence can be significant for ballistic flying qubits (scaling as $\Delta x^2$) but usually not for flying qubits carried by a moving potential well (scaling as $\Delta x^6$). We also discuss a method to completely counteract this decoherence for a ballistic qubit later measured.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2305.14883v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We prove that certain classical cyclic redundancy check codes can be used for classical error correction and not just classical error detection. We extend the idea of classical cyclic redundancy check codes to quantum cyclic redundancy check codes. This allows us to construct quantum stabiliser codes which can correct burst errors where the burst length attains the quantum Reiger bound. We then consider a certain family of quantum cyclic redundancy check codes for which we present a fast linear time decoding algorithm.</description>

Abstract: An irreducible complete atomic OML of infinite height cannot both be algebraic and have the covering property. However, Kalmbach's construction provides an example of such an OML that is algebraic and has the 2-covering property, and Keller's construction provides an example of such an OML that has the covering property and is completely hereditarily atomic. Completely hereditarily atomic OMLs generalize algebraic OMLs suitably to quantum predicate logic.</description>

      <title>Quantum-Noise-Driven Generative Diffusion Models</title>

Abstract: Generative models realized with machine learning techniques are powerful tools to infer complex and unknown data distributions from a finite number of training samples in order to produce new synthetic data. Diffusion models are an emerging framework that have recently overcome the performance of the generative adversarial networks in creating synthetic text and high-quality images. Here, we propose and discuss the quantum generalization of diffusion models, i.e., three quantum-noise-driven generative diffusion models that could be experimentally tested on real quantum systems. The idea is to harness unique quantum features, in particular the non-trivial interplay among coherence, entanglement and noise that the currently available noisy quantum processors do unavoidably suffer from, in order to overcome the main computational burdens of classical diffusion models during inference. Hence, we suggest to exploit quantum noise not as an issue to be detected and solved but instead as a very remarkably beneficial key ingredient to generate much more complex probability distributions that would be difficult or even impossible to express classically, and from which a quantum processor might sample more efficiently than a classical one. An example of numerical simulations for an hybrid classical-quantum generative diffusion model is also included. Therefore, our results are expected to pave the way for new quantum-inspired or quantum-based generative diffusion algorithms addressing more powerfully classical tasks as data generation/prediction with widespread real-world applications ranging from climate forecasting to neuroscience, from traffic flow analysis to financial forecasting.</description>

      <title>Wigner function properties for electromagnetic systems</title>

      <description>arXiv:2308.12613v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Using the Wigner-Vlasov formalism, an exact 3D solution of the Schr\"odinger equation for a scalar particle in an electromagnetic field is constructed. Electric and magnetic fields are non-uniform. According to the exact expression for the wave function, the search for two types of the Wigner functions is conducted. The first function is the usual Wigner function with a modified momentum. The second Wigner function is constructed on the basis of the Weyl-Stratonovich transform in papers [Phys. Rev. A 35 2791 (1987)] or [Phys. Rev. B 99 014423 (2019)]. It turns out that the second function, unlike the first one, has areas of negative values for wave functions with the Gaussian distribution (Hudson's theorem). An example of electromagnetic quantum system described by a non-Gaussian wave function has successfully been found. The second Wigner function is positive over the whole phase space for the non-Gaussian wave function. This result is analogous to the Hudson theorem for the gage-invariant Wigner function.
  On the one hand, knowing the Wigner functions allows one to find the distribution of the mean momentum vector field and the energy spectrum of the quantum system. On the other hand, within the framework of the Wigner-Vlasov formalism, the mean momentum distribution and the magnitude of the energy are initially known. Consequently, the mean momentum distributions and energy values obtained according to the Wigner functions can be compared with the exact momentum distribution and energy values. This paper presents this comparison and describes the differences. The Vlasov-Moyal approximation of average acceleration flow has been built in phase space for a quantum system with electromagnetic field. The obtained approximation makes it possible to cut the Vlasov chain off at the second equation and also to analyze the Boltzmann H-function evolution.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2309.09269v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the effect of anharmonicity in quantum anharmonic oscillators, by computing the energy gap between the ground and the 1st excited state using the numerical bootstrap method. Based on perturbative formulae of limiting coupling regimes, we propose a qualitative formula of the energy gap across all coupling values. Except detailed numerical parameter values, the proposed formula has the same functional form as the formula of ground state level splitting of double-well potentials, proposed recently in arXiv:2308.11516. This unifies the effects of anharmonicity in both the anharmonic oscillators and the double-well potentials, although the underlying physical process of them are completely different. We give an explanation of this connection of their anharmonicity from the viewpoint of quantum phase transitions. This connection is justified up to the octic anharmonicities by the numerical bootstrap.</description>

      <title>Ergodic and mixing quantum channels: From two-qubit to many-body quantum systems</title>

      <description>arXiv:2310.02740v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The development of classical ergodic theory has had a significant impact in the areas of mathematics, physics, and, in general, applied sciences. The quantum ergodic theory of Hamiltonian dynamics has its motivations to understand thermodynamics and statistical mechanics. Quantum channel, a completely positive trace-preserving map, represents a most general representation of quantum dynamics and is an essential aspect of quantum information theory and quantum computation. In this work, we study the ergodic theory of quantum channels by characterizing different levels of ergodic hierarchy from integrable to mixing. The quantum channels on single systems are constructed from the unitary operators acting on bipartite states and tracing out the environment. The interaction strength of these unitary operators measured in terms of operator entanglement provides sufficient conditions for the channel to be mixing. By using block diagonal unitary operators, we construct a set of non-ergodic channels. By using canonical form of two-qubit unitary operator, we analytically construct the channels on single qubit ranging from integrable to mixing. Moreover, we also study interacting many-body quantum systems that include the famous Sachdev-Ye-Kitaev (SYK) model and show that they display mixing within the framework of the quantum channel.</description>

Abstract: Lie algebraic techniques are powerful and widely-used tools for studying dynamics and metrology in quantum optics. When the Hamiltonian generates a Lie algebra with finite dimension, the unitary evolution can be expressed as a finite product of exponentials using the Wei-Norman expansion. The system is then exactly described by a finite set of scalar differential equations, even if the Hilbert space is infinite. However, the differential equations provided by the Wei-Norman expansion are nonlinear and often have singularities that prevent both analytic and numerical evaluation. We derive a new Lie algebra expansion for the quantum Fisher information, which results in linear differential equations. Together with existing Lie algebra techniques this allows many metrology problems to be analysed entirely in the Heisenberg picture. This substantially reduces the calculations involved in many metrology problems, and provides analytical solutions for problems that cannot even be solved numerically using the Wei-Norman expansion. We provide detailed examples of these methods applied to problems in quantum optics and nonlinear optomechanics.</description>

Abstract: These are exciting times for quantum physics as new quantum technologies are expected to soon transform computing at an unprecedented level. Simultaneously network science is flourishing proving an ideal mathematical and computational framework to capture the complexity of large interacting systems. Here we provide a comprehensive and timely review of the rising field of complex quantum networks. On one side, this subject is key to harness the potential of complex networks in order to provide design principles to boost and enhance quantum algorithms and quantum technologies. On the other side this subject can provide a new generation of quantum algorithms to infer significant complex network properties. The field features fundamental research questions as diverse as designing networks to shape Hamiltonians and their corresponding phase diagram, taming the complexity of many-body quantum systems with network theory, revealing how quantum physics and quantum algorithms can predict novel network properties and phase transitions, and studying the interplay between architecture, topology and performance in quantum communication networks. Our review covers all of these multifaceted aspects in a self-contained presentation aimed both at network-curious quantum physicists and at quantum-curious network theorists. We provide a framework that unifies the field of quantum complex networks along four main research lines: network-generalized, quantum-applied, quantum-generalized and quantum-enhanced. Finally we draw attention to the connections between these research lines, which can lead to new opportunities and new discoveries at the interface between quantum physics and network science.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2311.18579v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Quantum speed limit (QSL) is the lower bound on the time required for a state to evolve to a desired final state under a given Hamiltonian evolution. Three well-known QSLs exist Mandelstam-Tamm (MT), Margolus-Levitin (ML), and dual ML (ML$^*$) bounds. We consider one-dimensional systems that undergoes delocalization-localization transition in the presence of quasiperiodic and linear potential. By performing sudden quenches across the phase boundary, we find that the exact dynamics get captured very well by QSLs. We show that the MT bound is always tighter in the short time limit for any arbitrary state, while the optimal bound for the time of orthogonalization (time required to reach the orthogonal state) depends on the choice of the initial state. Further, for extreme quenches, we prove that the MT bound remains tighter for the time of orthogonalization, and it can qualitatively describe the non-analyticity in free energy for dynamical quantum phase transition (DQPT). Finally, we also demonstrate that the localization-delocalization transition point can be exactly identified from QSLs, whose computation cost is much less compared to many other diagnostic tools.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2401.04271v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We construct a fault-tolerant quantum error-correcting protocol based on a qubit encoded in a large spin qudit using a spin-cat code, analogous to the continuous variable cat encoding. With this, we can correct the dominant error sources, namely processes that can be expressed as error operators that are linear or quadratic in the components of angular momentum. Such codes tailored to dominant error sources {can} exhibit superior thresholds and lower resource overheads when compared to those designed for unstructured noise models. To preserve the dominant errors during gate operations, we identify a suitable universal gate set. A key component is the CNOT gate that preserves the rank of spherical tensor operators. Categorizing the dominant errors as phase and amplitude errors, we demonstrate how phase errors, analogous to phase-flip errors for qubits, can be effectively corrected. Furthermore, we propose a measurement-free error correction scheme to address amplitude errors without relying on syndrome measurements. Through an in-depth analysis of logical CNOT gate errors, we establish that the fault-tolerant threshold for error correction in the spin-cat encoding surpasses that of standard qubit-based encodings. We consider a specific implementation based on neutral-atom quantum computing, with qudits encoded in the nuclear spin of $^{87}$Sr, and show how to generate the universal gate set, including the rank-preserving CNOT gate, using quantum control and the Rydberg blockade. These findings pave the way for encoding a qubit in a large spin with the potential to achieve fault tolerance, high threshold, and reduced resource overhead in quantum information processing.</description>

On the one hand, a parallel with time and band limiting problems is used to obtain a tridiagonal matrix commuting with the chopped correlation matrix in bispectral situations and on the other, the irreducible decomposition of the Terwilliger algebra arising in the context of $P$-polynomial association schemes is seen to yield a simplifying framework.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2401.09158v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A bang-bang (BB) algorithm prepares the ground state of a two-dimensional (2D) quantum many-body Hamiltonian $H=H_1+H_2$ by evolving an initial product state alternating between $H_1$ and $H_2$. We use the neighborhood tensor update to simulate the BB evolution with an infinite pair-entangled projected state (iPEPS). The alternating sequence is optimized with the final energy as a cost function. The energy is calculated with the tangent space methods for the sake of their stability.
  The method is benchmarked in the 2D transverse field quantum Ising model near its quantum critical point against a ground state obtained by variational optimization of the iPEPS. The optimal BB sequence differs non-perturbatively from a sequence simulating quantum annealing or adiabatic preparation (AP) of the ground state. The optimal BB energy converges with the number of bangs much faster than the optimal AP energy.</description>

Abstract: Peculiarities of multiqubit measurement are for the most part similar to peculiarities of measurement for qudit -- quantum object with finite-dimensional Hilbert space. Three different interpretations of measurement concept are analysed. One of those is purely quantum and is in collection, for a given state of the object to be measured, of incompatible observable measurement results in amount enough for reconstruction of the state. Two others make evident the difference between the reduced density matrix and the density matrices of physical objects involved in the measurement. It is shown that the von Neumann projectors produce an idea of a phase portrait of qudit state as a set of mathematical expectations for projectors on the possible pure states. The phase portrait includes probability distributions for all the resolutions of identity of the qudit observable algebra. The phase portrait of a composite system comprised by a qudit pair generates local and conditional phase portraits of particles. The entanglement is represented by the dependence of the shape of conditional phase portrait on the properties of the observable used in the measurement for the other particle. Analysis of the properties of a conditional phase portrait of a multiqubit qubits shows that absence of the entanglement is possible only in the case of substantial restrictions imposed on the method of multiqubit decomposition into qubits.</description>

Abstract: The accessibility of the Hawking-Page transition in AdS$_5$ through a 1d Heisenberg spin chain is demonstrated. We use the random matrix formulation of the Loschmidt echo for a set of spin chains, and randomize the ferromagnetic spin interaction. It is shown that the thermal Loschmidt echo, when averaged, detects the predicted increase in entropy across the Hawking-Page transition. This suggests that a 1d spin chain exhibits characteristics of black hole physics in 4+1 dimensions. We show that this approach is equally applicable to free fermion systems with a general dispersion relation.</description>

      <title>Mitigation of Channel Tampering Attacks in Continuous-Variable Quantum Key Distribution</title>

      <description>arXiv:2401.15898v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Despite significant advancements in continuous-variable quantum key distribution (CV-QKD), practical CV-QKD systems can be compromised by various attacks. Consequently, identifying new attack vectors and countermeasures for CV-QKD implementations is important for the continued robustness of CV-QKD. In particular, as CV-QKD relies on a public quantum channel, vulnerability to communication disruption persists from potential adversaries employing Denial-of-Service (DoS) attacks. Inspired by DoS attacks, this paper introduces a novel threat in CV-QKD called the Channel Amplification (CA) attack, wherein Eve manipulates the communication channel through amplification. We specifically model this attack in a CV-QKD optical fiber setup. To counter this threat, we propose a detection and mitigation strategy. Detection involves a machine learning (ML) model based on a decision tree classifier, classifying various channel tampering attacks, including CA and DoS attacks. For mitigation, Bob, post-selects quadrature data by classifying the attack type and frequency. Our ML model exhibits high accuracy in distinguishing and categorizing these attacks. The CA attack's impact on the secret key rate (SKR) is explored concerning Eve's location and the relative intensity noise of the local oscillator (LO). The proposed mitigation strategy improves the attacked SKR for CA attacks and, in some cases, for hybrid CA-DoS attacks. Our study marks a novel application of both ML classification and post-selection in this context. These findings are important for enhancing the robustness of CV-QKD systems against emerging threats on the channel.</description>

Abstract: Local measurements cannot create entanglement, but they can convert short-range entanglement to long-range entanglement, as in quantum teleportation. This phenomenon of measurement-induced entanglement (MIE) has been widely discussed in recent work on measurement-induced entanglement phase transitions and related phenomena. Here, we situate MIE in a broader context of the growth of long-range conditional mutual information (CMI) under decoherence. We upper-bound the rate at which decoherence can generate long-range CMI, and derive a characterization of states that saturate this bound. We point out that the structure of states saturating the CMI upper bound can be very different under different decoherent dynamics and provide explicit examples. We additionally explore the dynamics of CMI in random quantum circuits subject to random local decoherence, as a function of circuit depth. We argue that the universality class of the finite-depth teleportation transition, as well as its lower critical dimension, are different for erasures than for measurements.</description>

      <title>Generalized Rate Operator Quantum Jumps via Realization-Dependent Transformations</title>

      <description>arXiv:2402.12445v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The dynamics of open quantum systems is often solved by stochastic unravellings where the average over the state vector realizations reproduces the density matrix evolution. We focus on quantum jump descriptions based on the rate operator formalism. In addition to displaying and exploiting different equivalent ways of writing the master equation, we introduce state-dependent rate operator transformations within the framework of stochastic pure state realizations, allowing us to extend and generalize the previously developed formalism. As a consequence, this improves the controllability of the stochastic realizations and subsequently greatly benefits when searching for optimal simulation schemes to solve open system dynamics. At a fundamental level, intriguingly, our results show that it is possible to have positive unravellings -- without reverse quantum jumps and avoiding the use of auxiliary degrees freedom -- in a number of example cases even when the corresponding dynamical map breaks the property of P-divisibility, thus being in the strongly non-Markovian regime.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.00072v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We propose a scheme for generating a high-purity single photon on the basis of cavity quantum electrodynamics (QED). This scheme employs a four-level system including two excited states, two ground states, and two driving lasers; this structure allows the suppression of the re-excitation process due to the atomic decay, which is known to significantly degrade the single-photon purity in state-of-the-art photon sources using a three-level system. Our analysis shows that the re-excitation probability arbitrarily approaches zero without sacrificing the photon generation probability when increasing the power of the driving laser between the excited states. This advantage is achievable by using current cavity-QED technologies. Our scheme can contribute to developing distributed quantum computation or quantum communication with high accuracy.</description>

Abstract: Adiabatic quantum computation is a paradigmatic model aiming to solve a computational problem by finding the many-body ground state encapsulating the solution. However, its use of an adiabatic evolution depending on the spectral gap of an intricate many-body Hamiltonian makes its analysis daunting. While it is plausible to directly cool the final gapped system of the adiabatic evolution instead, the analysis of such a scheme on a general ground is missing. Here, we propose a specific Hamiltonian model for this purpose. The scheme is inspired by cavity cooling, involving the emulation of a zero-temperature reservoir. Repeated discarding of ancilla reservoir qubits extracts the entropy of the system, driving the system toward its ground state. At the same time, the measurement of the discarded qubits hints at the energy level structure of the system as a return. We show that quantum computation based on this cooling procedure is equivalent in its computational power to the one based on quantum circuits. We then exemplify the scheme with a few illustrative use cases for combinatorial optimization problems. In the first example, the cooling is free from any local energy minima, reducing the scheme to Grover's search algorithm with a few improvements. In the second example, the cooling suffers from abundant local energy minima. To circumvent this, we implant a mechanism in the Hamiltonian so that the population trapped in the local minima can tunnel out by high-order transitions. We support this idea with a numerical simulation for a particular combinatorial optimization problem. We also discuss its application to preparing quantum many-body ground states, arguing that the spectral gap is a crucial factor in determining the time scale of the cooling.</description>

Abstract: The Rabi-Stark model is a non-linear generalization of the quantum Rabi model including the dynamical Stark shift as a tunable term, which can be realized via quantum simulation on a cavity QED platform. When the Stark coupling becomes equal to the mode frequency, the spectrum changes drastically, a transition usually termed "spectral collapse" because numerical studies indicate an infinitely degenerate ground state. We show that the spectrum extends continuously from a threshold value up to infinity. A set of normalizable states are embedded in the continuum which furnishes an unexpected analogy to the atomic Stark effect. Bound states and continuum can be obtained analytically through two equally justified, but different confluence processes of the associated differential equation in Bargmann space. Moreover, these results are obtained independently using a method based on adiabatic elimination of the spin degree of freedom and corroborated through large-scale numerical checks.</description>

Abstract: We derive the theoretical limit of single-photon purity of heralded single-photon sources, and accordingly demonstrate a bright, gigahertz-pulsed heralded source with the purity saturating the limit. Based on spontaneous four-wave mixing in a silicon spiral waveguide, this on-chip source is measured to have a coincidence rate exceeding 1.5 MHz at a coincidence to accidental (CAR) ratio of 16.77. The single-photon purity, quantified by the auto-correlation function $g^{(2)}_h(0)$, reaches the theoretical limit with the lowest value of $0.00094 \pm 0.00002$ obtained at a coincidence rate of 0.8 kHz. We attribute our results to effective spectral filtering as well as the coherent pump condition helped by optical injection locking.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.13928v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In previous work with Ken Wharton, it was proposed that Bell correlations are a special sort of selection artefact, explained by a combination of (i) collider bias and (ii) a boundary constraint on the collider variable. This requires no direct causal influence outside lightcones, and may hence offer a new way to reconcile Bell nonlocality and relativity. This piece outlines a new argument for the proposal. It explains how it is valid for a special class of ('W-shaped') Bell experiments involving delayed-choice entanglement swapping, and argues that it can be extended to the general ('V-shaped') case. A detailed version of the argument is now available in arXiv:2406.04571 [quant-ph].</description>

Abstract: In this work, we present an improved analysis for decoy-state methods, enhancing both achievable key rates and recovering analytical results for the single intensity scenario. Our primary focus is improving the shortcomings observed in current decoy-state methods, particularly recovering results when employing no decoy intensities. Our methods enable the continuous interpolation across varying numbers of intensity settings. Additionally, we extend decoy-state techniques to encompass scenarios where intensities vary depending on the signal state, thereby relaxing the constraints on experimental implementations. Our findings demonstrate that a minimum of two intensities are sufficient for high asymptotic secret key rates, thereby further softening experimental requirements. Additionally, we address inherent imperfections within detection setups like imperfect beamsplitters. We derive provable secure lower bounds on the subspace population estimation, which is required for certain squashing methods such as the flag-state squasher. These analytical bounds allow us to encompass arbitrary passive linear optical setups, and together with intensities varying with each signal state, lets us include a broad class of experimental setups.</description>

Abstract: Fighting against noise is crucial for NISQ devices to demonstrate practical quantum applications. In this work, we give a new paradigm of quantum error mitigation based on the vectorization of density matrices. Different from the ideas of existing quantum error mitigation methods that try to distill noiseless information from noisy quantum states, our proposal directly changes the way of encoding information and maps the density matrices of noisy quantum states to noiseless pure states, which is realized by a novel and NISQ-friendly measurement protocol and a classical post-processing procedure. Our protocol requires no knowledge of the noise model, no ability to tune the noise strength, and no ancilla qubits for complicated controlled unitaries. Under our encoding, NISQ devices are always preparing pure quantum states which are highly desired resources for variational quantum algorithms to have good performance in many tasks. We show how this protocol can be well-fitted into variational quantum algorithms. We give several concrete ansatz constructions that are suitable for our proposal and do theoretical analysis on the sampling complexity, the expressibility, and the trainability. We also give a discussion on how this protocol is influenced by large noise and how it can be well combined with other quantum error mitigation protocols. The effectiveness of our proposal is demonstrated by various numerical experiments.</description>

Abstract: Alternative mathematical explorations in quantum computing can be of great scientific interest, especially if they come with penetrating physical insights. In this paper, we present a critical revisitation of our geometric (Clifford) algebras (GAs) application in quantum computing as originally presented in [C. Cafaro and S. Mancini, Adv. Appl. Clifford Algebras 21, 493 (2011)]. Our focus is on testing the usefulness of geometric algebras (GAs) techniques in two applications to quantum computing. First, making use of the geometric algebra of a relativistic configuration space (a.k.a., multiparticle spacetime algebra or MSTA), we offer an explicit algebraic characterization of one- and two-qubit quantum states together with a MSTA description of one- and two-qubit quantum computational gates. In this first application, we devote special attention to the concept of entanglement, focusing on entangled quantum states and two-qubit entangling quantum gates. Second, exploiting the previously mentioned MSTA characterization together with the GA depiction of the Lie algebras SO(3;R) and SU(2;C) depending on the rotor group formalism, we focus our attention to the concept of universality in quantum computing by reevaluating Boykin's proof on the identification of a suitable set of universal quantum gates. At the end of our mathematical exploration, we arrive at two main conclusions. Firstly, the MSTA perspective leads to a powerful conceptual unification between quantum states and quantum operators. More specifically, the complex qubit space and the complex space of unitary operators acting on them merge in a single multivectorial real space. Secondly, the GA viewpoint on rotations based on the rotor group carries both conceptual and computational upper hands compared to conventional vectorial and matricial methods.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.06497v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Generating high fidelity spin-spin entanglement is an essential task of quantum repeater networks for the distribution of quantum information across long distances. Solid-state based spin-photon interfaces are promising candidates to realize nodes of a quantum network, but are often limited by spectral diffusion of the optical transition, which results in phase errors on the entangled states. Here, we introduce a method to correct phase errors from quasi-static frequency fluctuations after the entangled state is generated, by shelving the emitters in the excited state to refocus the unknown phase. For quasi-static frequency fluctuations, the fidelity is determined only by the lifetime of the excited state used for shelving, making it particularly suitable for systems with a long-lived shelving state with correlated spectral diffusion. Such a shelving state may be found in Kramers doublet systems such as rare-earth emitters and color centers in Si or SiC interfaced with nanophotonic cavities with a strongly frequency-dependent Purcell enhancement. The protocol can be used to generate high-fidelity entangled spin pairs without reducing the rate of entanglement generation.</description>

Abstract: Long-distance quantum communication using quantum repeaters is an enabling technology for secure communication, distributed quantum computing and quantum-enhanced sensing and metrology. As a building block of quantum repeaters, spin-photon entanglement has been demonstrated with both atomic and solid-state qubits. However, previously demonstrated qubits with long spin coherence do not directly emit photons into the low-loss telecom band that is needed for long-distance communication. Here, we demonstrate spin-photon entanglement using a single Er$^{3+}$ ion in a solid-state crystal, integrated into a silicon nanophotonic circuit. Direct emission into the telecom band enables an entanglement rate of 1.48 Hz over 15.6 km of optical fiber, with a fidelity of 73(3)$\%$. This opens the door to large-scale quantum networks based on scalable nanophotonic devices and many spectrally multiplexed Er$^{3+}$ ions.</description>

Abstract: Accurately estimating the overlap between quantum states is a fundamental task in quantum information processing. While various strategies using distinct quantum measurements have been proposed for overlap estimation, the lack of experimental benchmarks on estimation precision limits strategy selection in different situations. Here we compare the performance of four practical strategies for overlap estimation, including tomography-tomography, tomography-projection, Schur collective measurement and optical swap test. With a photonic system, the overlap-dependent estimation precision for each strategy is quantified in terms of the average estimation variance over uniformly sampled states, which highlight the different performance of different strategies. We further propose an adaptive strategy with optimized precision in full-range overlap estimation. Our results shed new light on extracting the parameter of interest from quantum systems, prompting the design of efficient quantum protocols.</description>

Abstract: Matrix product state (MPS) offers a framework for encoding classical data into quantum states, enabling the efficient utilization of quantum resources for data representation and processing. This research paper investigates techniques to enhance the efficiency and accuracy of MPS representations specifically designed for encoding classical data. Based on the observations that MPS truncation error depends on the pattern of the classical data, we devised an algorithm that finds optimal qubit mapping for given classical data, thereby improving the efficiency and fidelity of the MPS representation. Furthermore, we evaluate the impact of the optimized MPS in the context of quantum classifiers, demonstrating their enhanced performance compared to the conventional mapping. This improvement confirms the efficacy of the proposed techniques for encoding classical data into quantum states. MPS representation combined with optimal qubit mapping can pave a new way for more efficient and accurate quantum data representation and processing.</description>

      <title>Detecting Markovianity of Quantum Processes via Recurrent Neural Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.07226</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.07226v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present a novel methodology utilizing Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) to classify Markovian and non-Markovian quantum processes, leveraging time series data derived from Choi states. The model exhibits exceptional accuracy, surpassing 95%, across diverse scenarios, encompassing dephasing and Pauli channels in an arbitrary basis, and generalized amplitude damping dynamics. Additionally, the developed model shows efficient forecasting capabilities for the analyzed time series data. These results suggest the potential of RNNs in discerning and predicting the Markovian nature of quantum processes.</description>

      <title>Three-dimensional imaging of integrated-circuit activity using quantum defects in diamond</title>

      <description>arXiv:2112.12242v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The continuous scaling of semiconductor-based technologies to micron and sub-micron regimes has resulted in higher device density and lower power dissipation. Many physical phenomena such as self-heating or current leakage become significant at such scales, and mapping current densities to reveal these features is decisive for the development of modern electronics. However, advanced non-invasive technologies either offer low sensitivity or poor spatial resolution and are limited to two-dimensional spatial mapping. Here we use near-surface nitrogen-vacancy centres in diamond to probe Oersted fields created by current flowing within a multi-layered integrated circuit in pre-development. We show the reconstruction of the three-dimensional components of the current density with a magnitude down to about $\approx 10 \,\rm \mu A / \mu m^2$ and sub-micron spatial resolution at room temperature. We also report the localisation of currents in different layers and observe anomalous current flow in an electronic chip. Our method provides, therefore a decisive step toward three-dimensional current mapping in technologically relevant nanoscale electronics chips.</description>

      <title>Coherence limits in lattice atom interferometry at the one-minute scale</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2210.07289</link>
      <description>arXiv:2210.07289v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In quantum metrology and quantum simulation, a coherent non-classical state must be manipulated before unwanted interactions with the environment lead to decoherence. In atom interferometry, the non-classical state is a spatial superposition, where each atom coexists in multiple locations as a collection of phase-coherent partial wavepackets. These states enable precise measurements in fundamental physics and inertial sensing. However, atom interferometers usually use atomic fountains, where the available interrogation time is limited to around 3 seconds for a 10 m fountain. Here, we realise an atom interferometer with a spatial superposition state that is maintained for as long as 70 seconds. We analyse the theoretical and experimental limits to coherence arising from collective dephasing of the atomic ensemble. This reveals that the decoherence rate slows down markedly at hold times that exceed tens of seconds. These gains in coherence may enable gravimetry measurements, searches for fifth forces or fundamental probes into the non-classical nature of gravity.</description>

      <title>Efficient adaptive Bayesian estimation of a slowly fluctuating Overhauser field gradient</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.15014</link>
      <description>arXiv:2309.15014v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Slow fluctuations of Overhauser fields are an important source for decoherence in spin qubits hosted in III-V semiconductor quantum dots. Focusing on the effect of the field gradient on double-dot singlet-triplet qubits, we present two adaptive Bayesian schemes to estimate the magnitude of the gradient by a series of free induction decay experiments. We concentrate on reducing the computational overhead, with a real-time implementation of the schemes in mind. We show how it is possible to achieve a significant improvement of estimation accuracy compared to more traditional estimation methods. We include an analysis of the effects of dephasing and the drift of the gradient itself.</description>

      <title>Non-invertible symmetry-protected topological order in a group-based cluster state</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.09272</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.09272v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Despite growing interest in beyond-group symmetries in quantum condensed matter systems, there are relatively few microscopic lattice models explicitly realizing these symmetries, and many phenomena have yet to be studied at the microscopic level. We introduce a one-dimensional stabilizer Hamiltonian composed of group-based Pauli operators whose ground state is a $G\times \text{Rep}(G)$-symmetric state: the $G \textit{ cluster state}$ introduced in Brell, New Journal of Physics 17, 023029 (2015) [at http://doi.org/10.1088/1367-2630/17/2/023029]. We show that this state lies in a symmetry-protected topological (SPT) phase protected by $G\times \text{Rep}(G)$ symmetry, distinct from the symmetric product state by a duality argument. We identify several signatures of SPT order, namely protected edge modes, string order parameters, and topological response. We discuss how $G$ cluster states may be used as a universal resource for measurement-based quantum computation, explicitly working out the case where $G$ is a semidirect product of abelian groups.</description>

      <title>Towards determining the (2+1)-dimensional Quantum Electrodynamics running coupling with Monte Carlo and quantum computing methods</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.17545</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.17545v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we examine a compact $U(1)$ lattice gauge theory in $(2+1)$ dimensions and present a strategy for studying the running coupling and extracting the non-perturbative $\Lambda$-parameter. To this end, we combine Monte Carlo simulations and quantum computing, where the former can be used to determine the numerical value of the lattice spacing $a$, and the latter allows for reaching the perturbative regime at very small values of the bare coupling and, correspondingly, small values of $a$. The methodology involves a series of sequential steps (i.e., the step scaling function) to bridge results from small lattice spacings to non-perturbative large-scale lattice calculations. Focusing on the pure gauge case, we demonstrate that these quantum circuits, adapted to gauge degrees of freedom, are able to capture the relevant physics by studying the expectation value of the plaquette operator, for matching with corresponding Monte Carlo simulations. We also present results for the static potential and static force, which can be related to the renormalized coupling. The procedure outlined in this work can be extended to Abelian and non-Abelian lattice gauge theories with matter fields and might provide a way towards studying lattice quantum chromodynamics utilizing both quantum and classical methods.</description>

      <title>Manipulating the Relaxation Time of Boundary-Dissipative Systems through Bond Dissipation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.04183</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.04183v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Relaxation time plays a crucial role in describing the relaxation processes of quantum systems. We study the effect of a type of bond dissipation on the relaxation time of boundary dissipative systems and find that it can change the scaling of the relaxation time $T_c\sim L^{z}$ from $z=3$ to a value significantly less than $3$. We further reveal that the reason such bond dissipation can significantly reduce the relaxation time is that it can selectively target specific states. For Anderson localized systems, the scaling behavior of the relaxation time changes from an exponential form to a power-law form as the system size varies. This is because the bond dissipation we consider can not only select specific states but also disrupt the localization properties. Our work reveals that in open systems, one type of dissipation can be used to regulate the effects produced by another type of dissipation.</description>

      <title>The magic of entangled top quarks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.07321</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.07321v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recent years have seen an increasing body of work examining how quantum entanglement can be measured at high energy particle physics experiments, thereby complementing traditional table-top experiments. This raises the question of whether more concepts from quantum computation can be examined at colliders, and we here consider the property of magic, which distinguishes those quantum states which have a genuine computational advantage over classical states. We examine top anti-top pair production at the LHC, showing that nature chooses to produce magic tops, where the amount of magic varies with the kinematics of the final state. We compare results for individual partonic channels and at proton-level, showing that averaging over final states typically increases magic. This is in contrast to entanglement measures, such as the concurrence, which typically decrease. Our results create new links between the quantum information and particle physics literatures, providing practical insights for further study.</description>
