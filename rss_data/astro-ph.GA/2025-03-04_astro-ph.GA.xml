      <title>The Physical Properties and Morphologies of Faint Dusty Star-forming Galaxies Identified with JWST</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.00102</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.00102v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We develop a sample of 234 dusty star-forming galaxies (DSFGs) from the A2744 and GOODS-S fields using JWST/NIRCam-selected galaxies as priors for SCUBA-2 measurements. This provides a large number of galaxies both above an 850 $\mu$m flux of 2 mJy (47 bright DSFGs) and below (187 faint DSFGs). It represents the largest sample of individually identified (i.e., not stacked) faint DSFGs to date. We identify a tight negative correlation between redshift and both F444W and F150W flux, suggesting that the observed NIR flux may be an effective way of selecting high-redshift DSFGs. We study the physical properties of the DSFGs through spectral energy distribution fitting and morphological analysis. Other than the lower star formation rates (SFRs) and total infrared luminosities in the faint DSFGs, the two populations have similar properties. The stellar masses do not appear to be strongly dependent on either the SFRs or the submillimeter flux. These results suggest that the faint DSFGs are drawn from the same population of galaxies as the bright DSFGs. We find a lower merger fraction (~21%) relative to previous HST-based studies.</description>

      <title>The THESAN-ZOOM project: Burst, quench, repeat -- unveiling the evolution of high-redshift galaxies along the star-forming main sequence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.00106</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.00106v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Characterizing the evolution of the star-forming main sequence (SFMS) at high redshift is crucial to contextualize the observed extreme properties of galaxies in the early Universe. We present an analysis of the SFMS and its scatter in the THESAN-ZOOM simulations, where we find a redshift evolution of the SFMS normalization scaling as $\propto (1+z)^{2.64\pm0.03}$, significantly stronger than is typically inferred from observations. We can reproduce the flatter observed evolution by filtering out weakly star-forming galaxies, implying that current observational fits are biased due to a missing population of lulling galaxies or overestimated star-formation rates. We also explore star-formation variability using the scatter of galaxies around the SFMS ($\sigma_{\mathrm{MS}}$). At the population level, the scatter around the SFMS increases with cosmic time, driven by the increased importance of long-term environmental effects in regulating star formation at later times. To study short-term star-formation variability, or ''burstiness'', we isolate the scatter on timescales shorter than 50 Myr. The short-term scatter is larger at higher redshift, indicating that star formation is indeed more bursty in the early Universe. We identify two starburst modes: (i) externally driven, where rapid large-scale inflows trigger and fuel prolonged, extreme star formation episodes, and (ii) internally driven, where cyclical ejection and re-accretion of the interstellar medium in low-mass galaxies drive bursts, even under relatively steady large-scale inflow. Both modes occur at all redshifts, but the increased burstiness of galaxies at higher redshift is due to the increasing prevalence of the more extreme external mode of star formation.</description>

      <title>A Local Dwarf Galaxy Search Using Machine Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.00109</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.00109v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a machine learning search for local, low-mass galaxies ($z &lt; 0.02$ and $10^6 M_\odot &lt; M_* &lt; 10^9 M_\odot$) using the combined photometric data from the DESI Imaging Legacy Surveys and the WISE survey. We introduce the spectrally confirmed training sample, discuss evaluation metrics, investigate the features, compare different machine learning algorithms, and find that a 7-class neural network classification model is highly effective in separating the signal (local, low-mass galaxies) from various contaminants, reaching a precision of $95\%$ and a recall of $76\%$. The principal contaminants are nearby sub-$L^*$ galaxies at $0.02 &lt; z &lt; 0.05$ and nearby massive galaxies at $0.05 &lt; z &lt; 0.2$. We find that the features encoding surface brightness information are essential to achieving a correct classification. Our final catalog, which we make available, consists of 112,859 local, low-mass galaxy candidates, where 36,408 have high probability ($p_{\rm signal} &gt; 0.95$), covering the entire Legacy Surveys DR9 footprint. Using DESI-EDR public spectra and data from the SAGA and ELVES surveys, we find that our model has a precision of $\sim 100\%$, $96\%$, and $97\%$, respectively, and a recall of $\sim 51\%$, $68\%$ and $53\%$, respectively. The results of those independent spectral verification demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of our machine learning classification model.</description>

      <title>Tracing the cosmological origin of gas that fuels in situ star formation in TNG50 galaxies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.00111</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.00111v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Based on their cosmological origin, the stars of a galaxy can be divided into two categories: those that enter through merger events (ex situ) and those born in the main progenitor (in situ). We used the TNG50 cosmological magnetohydrodynamical simulation and its Lagrangian tracer particles to explore and quantify the origin of gas that ultimately forms the in situ stars of galaxies. We tracked back the baryonic mass contributing to the $z=0$ in situ stellar populations of galaxies, studying trends in mass from dwarfs to group-scale halos. We find that more massive halos acquire this matter earlier than lower-mass halos, reflecting an overall earlier assembly of their in situ stellar mass. Defining the Lagrangian half-mass radius R$_{\rm L, 1/2}$ of a galaxy as the distance containing half of the mass that will form its in situ stars by $z=0$, we find that R$_{\rm L, 1/2}$ is larger for more massive halos at early times, reflecting larger "in situ Lagrangian regions." However, the dependence of this radius on halo mass becomes flat at $z \simeq 3$ and then inverts toward $z=0$. In addition, R$_{\rm L, 1/2}$ increases rapidly with redshift, surpassing the virial radii of halos at $z \sim 2$. This marks the cosmic epoch at which most of the gas that eventually forms the in situ stars of galaxies leaves the intergalactic medium (IGM) and enters halos, a transition that occurs earlier for more massive halos. The formation redshift of the in situ stellar component increases with halo mass, while the formation redshift of the dark matter halo decreases, indicative of a differential assembly history between these two components. Finally, we decomposed the $z=0$ in situ stellar mass into its distinct modes of accretion. Smooth accretion from the IGM is the most important for low-mass galaxies, while mergers and satellite-stripped gas become relevant and even dominant only for high-mass galaxies.</description>

      <title>Going deeper into the dark with COSMOS-Web: JWST unveils the total contribution of Radio-Selected NIRfaint galaxies to the cosmic Star Formation Rate Density</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.00112</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.00112v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present the first follow-up with JWST of radio-selected NIRfaint galaxies as part of the COSMOS-Web survey. By selecting galaxies detected at radio frequencies ($S_{\rm 3 GHz}&gt;11.5$ $\mu$Jy; i.e. S/N$&gt;5$) and with faint counterparts at NIR wavelengths (F150W$&gt;26.1$ mag), we collect a sample of 127 likely dusty star-forming galaxies (DSFGs). We estimate their physical properties through SED fitting, compute the first radio luminosity function for these types of sources, and their contribution to the total cosmic star formation rate density. Our analysis confirms that these sources represent a population of highly dust-obscured ($\langle A_{\rm v} \rangle \sim3.5$ mag), massive ($\langle M_\star \rangle \sim10^{10.8}$ M$_\odot$) and star-forming galaxies ($\langle {\rm SFR} \rangle\sim300$ M$_\odot$ yr$^{-1}$) located at $\langle z \rangle\sim3.6$, representing the high-redshift tail of the full distribution of radio sources. Our results also indicate that these galaxies could dominate the bright end of the radio luminosity function and reach a total contribution to the cosmic star formation rate density equal to that estimated only considering NIR-bright sources at $z\sim4.5$. Finally, our analysis further confirms that the radio selection can be employed to collect statistically significant samples of DSFGs, representing a complementary alternative to the other selections based on JWST colors or detection at FIR/(sub)mm wavelengths.</description>

      <title>A Supermassive Black Hole in a Diminutive Ultra-compact Dwarf Galaxy Discovered with JWST/NIRSpec+IFU</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.00113</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.00113v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The integral-field unit mode of the Near-Infrared Spectrograph (NIRSpec+IFU) mounted on the James Webb Space Telescope has now enabled kinematic studies of smaller and less massive compact stellar systems in which to search for central massive black holes (BHs) than ever before. We present here the first such detection using NIRSpec+IFU in its highest resolution (R~2700) mode. We report a $3\sigma$ detection of a central black hole with mass ${\cal M}_{BH}=2.2\pm1.1\times10^6\,M_\odot$ in UCD736 orbiting within the Virgo galaxy cluster based on Schwarzschild's modeling of the 1D kinematic profile. The presence of such a massive BH strongly argues against a globular cluster origin of this UCD, and rather suggests a tidally stripped formation route from a former $\gtrsim10^9\,M_\odot$ dwarf galaxy host. Two other methods produce results consistent with Schwarzschild's modelling, but can only provide upper-limits on ${\cal M}_{BH}$. This represents the detection of a BH in the most compact ($r_h\approx15\,{\rm pc}$) stellar system to date, with a ${\cal M}_{BH}$ corresponding to ~9 percent of the system's stellar mass, roughly in line with previously reported UCD BH detections and comparable to the BH detected in the compact elliptical galaxy NGC4486B.</description>

      <title>COSMOS Spectroscopic Redshift Compilation (First Data Release): 165k Redshifts Encompassing Two Decades of Spectroscopy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.00120</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.00120v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present the COSMOS Spectroscopic Redshift Compilation encompassing ~ 20 years of spectroscopic redshifts within the 2 deg$^2$ COSMOS legacy field. This compilation contains 165,312 redshifts of 97,929 unique objects from 108 individual observing programs up to $z \sim 8$ with median stellar mass $\sim 10^{9}$ to $10^{10}$ M$_\odot$ (redshift dependent). Rest-frame $NUVrJ$ colors and SFR -- stellar mass correlations show the compilation primarily contains low- to intermediate-mass star-forming and massive, quiescent galaxies at $z &lt; 1.25$ and mostly low-mass bursty star-forming galaxies at $z &gt; 2$. Sources in the compilation cover a diverse range of environments, including protoclusters such as ``Hyperion''. The full compilation is 50\% spectroscopically complete by $i \sim 23.2$ and $K_s \sim 21.3$ mag; however, this is redshift dependent. Spatially, the compilation is $&gt;50$\% complete within the CANDELS area, while the outer regions of COSMOS are $&gt;10$\% complete limited to $i &lt; 24$ mag and $K_S &lt; 22.5$ mag, separately. We demonstrate how the compilation can be used to validate photometric redshifts and investigate calibration metrics. By training self-organizing maps on COSMOS2020/Classic and projecting the compilation onto it, we find key galaxy subpopulations that currently lack spectroscopic coverage including $z &lt; 1$ intermediate-mass quiescent galaxies and low-/intermediate-mass bursty star-forming galaxies, $z \sim 2$ massive quiescent galaxies, and $z &gt; 3$ massive star-forming galaxies. This approach highlights how combining self-organizing maps with our compilation can provide guidance for future spectroscopic observations to get a complete spectroscopic view of galaxy populations. Lastly, the compilation will undergo periodic data releases that incorporate new spectroscopic redshift measurements, providing a lasting legacy resource for the community.</description>

      <title>The multi-wavelength Tully-Fisher relation in the TNG50 cosmological simulation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.00194</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.00194v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Tully-Fisher relation (TFR) is one of the most important and widely used empirical correlations in extragalactic astronomy. Apart from its importance as a secondary distance indicator, the TFR relation serves as a test for galaxy evolution models, because it connects the baryonic and dark matter components of galaxies. We aim at simulating the multi-wavelength TFR relation from UV to mid-infrared wavelengths for the TNG50 cosmological simulation at $z = 0$, and at comparing the results with observational TFR studies. We want to compare the wavelength dependence of the slope and scatter with the observed values, and search for secondary parameters that reduce the scatter in the TFR. We select a large sample of simulated late-type, disc-dominated galaxies from the TNG50 simulation. For each galaxy, we use the SKIRT radiative transfer code to generate realistic synthetic global fluxes in 12 UV to mid-infrared broadbands and synthetic integrated HI line profiles. We use bivariate linear regression to determine the TFR in each band, and we search for a second TFR parameter by correlating the residuals with different physical parameters. Our TNG50 TFR reproduces the characteristic behaviour of the observed TFR in many studies: the TFR becomes steeper and tighter as we move from UV/optical to infrared wavelengths. The slope changes from $-7.46 \pm 0.14~{\text{mag}}~{\text{dex}}^{-1}$ in the NUV band to $-9.66 \pm 0.09~{\text{mag}}~{\text{dex}}^{-1}$ in the IRAC [4.5] band. Quantitatively, our slopes are well within the spread of different observational results. The ${\textit{u}} - {\textit{r}}$ colour or the sSFR can significantly reduce the scatter in the UV and optical bands. Using ${\textit{u}} - {\textit{r}}$ colour as second parameter, the modified TFR has a roughly constant intrinsic tightness of over the entire UV to MIR range. The combination of the TNG50...</description>

      <title>TDCOSMO XXI: Triaxiality and projection effects in time-delay cosmography</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.00235</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.00235v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Constraining the mass-sheet degeneracy (MSD) is crucial for improving the precision and accuracy of time-delay cosmography. Joint analyses of lensing and stellar kinematics have been widely adopted to break the MSD. A 3D mass and stellar tracer population is required to accurately interpret the kinematics data. We aim at forward-modeling the projection effects in strong lensing and kinematics observables, and finding the best model assumption for the stellar kinematics analysis which leads to unbiased interpretation of the MSD. We numerically simulate the projection and selection effects for both a triaxial ETG sample from the IllustrisTNG simulation and an axisymmetric sample which matches the properties of slow-rotator galaxies representative of the strong lens galaxy population. Using the axisymmetric sample, we generate mock kinematics observables with spherically-aligned axisymmetric Jeans Anisotropic Modeling (JAM) and assess kinematic recovery under different model assumptions. Using the triaxial sample, we quantify the random uncertainty introduced by modeling triaxial galaxies with axisymmetric JAM. We show that a spherical JAM analysis of spatially unresolved kinematic data introduces a bias of up to 2%-4% (depending on the intrinsic shape of the lens) in the inferred MSD. Our model largely corrects this bias, resulting in a residual random uncertainty in the range of 0-2.1% in the stellar velocity dispersion (0-4.2% in $H_0$) depending on the projected ellipticity and the anisotropy of the stellar orbits. This residual uncertainty can be further mitigated using spatially resolved kinematic data which constrain the intrinsic shape. We also show that the random uncertainty in the velocity dispersion recovery using axisymmetric JAM for axisymmetric galaxies is at the level of &lt; 0.17%, and the uncertainty using axisymmetric JAM for triaxial galaxies is at the level of &lt; 0.25%.</description>

      <title>Their currents turn awry, and lose the name of action. I: Fundamental limits to orbit reconstruction due to non-conservation of stellar actions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.00373</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.00373v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The conservation of stellar actions is a fundamental assumption in orbit reconstruction studies in the Milky Way. However, the disc is highly dynamic, with time-dependent, non-axisymmetric features like transient spiral arms and giant molecular clouds (GMCs) driving local fluctuations in the gravitational potential on top of the near-axisymmetric background. Using high-resolution magnetohydrodynamic simulations that incorporate gas dynamics and star formation, we quantify the rate at which these effects drive non-conservation of the actions of young stars from Myr to Gyr timescales. We find that action evolution is well described as a logarithmic random walk, with vertical action evolving more rapidly than radial action; the diffusion rate associated with this random walk is weakly dependent on the stellar birth environment and scales approximately linearly with the galactic orbital frequency at a star's position. The diffusion rates we measure imply a fundamental limit of $\sim 100$ Myr as the timescale over which stellar orbits can be reliably reconstructed using methods that assume action conservation. By comparing diffusion rates for younger stars to those measured for an older and more vertically-extended control population, we conclude that radial action evolution is driven primarily by transient spiral arms, while vertical action evolution is driven by gravitational scattering off gaseous structures. Our results have significant implications for galactic archaeology and disc dynamics studies, necessitating a closer look at the timescales over which actions are assumed to be conserved in the disc.</description>

      <title>Monitoring AGNs with H$\beta$ Asymmetry. V. Long-term Variation and Evolution of the Broad H$\beta$ Emission-Line Profiles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.00398</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.00398v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The physical origins of the diverse emission-line asymmetries observed in the spectra of active galactic nuclei (AGNs) remain incompletely understood. Monitoring the temporal variations of line profiles offers a promising approach to investigating the underlying physics. In this study, we present an analysis of the broad H$\beta$ emission line profiles of eight AGNs observed from the end of 2016 to May 2023 as part of the reverberation mapping campaign titled "Monitoring AGNs with H$\beta$ Asymmetry" (MAHA), utilizing data obtained from the Wyoming Infrared Observatory (WIRO) 2.3-meter telescope. We measure the temporal variations of line asymmetry, width, and central velocity shift for the eight objects. Our findings reveal that the variation in asymmetry is positively correlated with H$\beta$ flux in five of the eight objects, while the remaining objects exhibit negative or complex correlations. Furthermore, we observe anti-correlations between line width and H$\beta$ flux for most objects, indicating the presence of the "breathing" phenomenon in their H$\beta$ emission lines. In contrast, two objects demonstrate an "anti-breathing" phenomenon or complex behavior. We discuss the physical origins of the temporal variations in line profiles and propose the possibility of decomposing the variations in H$\beta$ asymmetry and width into components: one that corresponds to short-term variations in H$\beta$ flux and another that reflects long-term variations in continuum light curves, perhaps driven by radiation pressure.</description>

      <title>Surveying the Whirlpool at Arcseconds with NOEMA (SWAN) II: Survey design and observations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.00534</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.00534v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present Surveying the Whirlpool at Arcseconds with NOEMA (SWAN), a high-resolution, high-sensitivity survey to map molecular lines in the 3mm band in M51 (the Whirlpool galaxy). SWAN has obtained the largest high-sensitivity map (5x7 kpc2) of N2H+ emission at cloud-scale resolution (3" ~125 pc) in an external galaxy to date. We describe the observations and data reduction of ~214 hours of interferometric data from NOEMA, ~55 hours of tailored new observations with the IRAM-30m telescope and the combination of NOEMA, new and ~14 hours of archival 30m observations. We detect widespread emission from 9 molecular transition lines. The J=1-0 transitions of CO isotopologues 13CO and C18O are detected at high significance across the full observed field-of-view (FoV). HCN, HNC, HCO+, and N2H+(1-0) are detected in the center, molecular ring and spiral arms of the galaxy, while the shock tracer HNCO(4-3), (5-4) and PDR tracer C2H(1-0) are detected in the central ~1 kpc and molecular ring only. For most of the lines that we detect, average line ratios with respect to CO are increased by up to a factor of ~3 in the central 1 kpc, where an AGN and its low-inclination outflow are present, compared to the disk. Across the full SWAN FoV, 13CO, C18O, HCN, HNC, HCO+ and N2H+ are 8\pm2, 29\pm6, 17\pm3,37\pm5, 26\pm5 and 63\pm38 times fainter than 12CO, respectively, in pixels where each line is significantly detected. Although we observe variations in line ratios between larger-scale environments like the center and disk of M51, the scatter within each environment also indicates the influence of smaller-scale processes. The ability to measure these effects is only possible thanks to the high resolution and high sensitivity of the SWAN dataset across multiple environments. This provides the sharpest view of these molecular transitions over the largest physical area ever captured in an external galaxy.</description>

      <title>A large-scale ring galaxy at z = 2.2 revealed by JWST/NIRCam: kinematic observations and analytical modelling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.00839</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.00839v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A unique galaxy at z = 2.2, zC406690, has a striking clumpy large-scale ring structure that persists from rest UV to near-infrared, yet has an ordered rotation and lies on the star-formation main sequence. We combine new JWST/NIRCam and ALMA band 4 observations, together with previous VLT/SINFONI integral field spectroscopy and HST imaging to re-examine its nature. The high-resolution H$\alpha$ kinematics are best fitted if the mass is distributed within a ring with total mass $M_{\rm{ring}} = 2 \times 10^{10} M_\odot$ and radius $R_{ring}$ = 4.6 kpc, together with a central undetected mass component (e.g., a "bulge") with a dynamical mass of $M_{bulge} = 8 \times 10^{10} M_\odot$. We also consider a purely flux emitting ring superposed over a faint exponential disk, or a highly "cuspy" dark matter halo, both disfavored against a massive ring model. The low-resolution CO(4-3) line and 142GHz continuum emission imply a total molecular and dust gas masses of $M_{mol,gas} = 7.1 \times 10^{10}M_\odot$ and $M_{dust} = 3 \times 10^8 M_\odot$ over the entire galaxy, giving a dust-to-mass ratio of 0.7%. We estimate that roughly half the gas and dust mass lie inside the ring, and that $\sim 10\%$ of the total dust is in a foreground screen that attenuates the stellar light of the bulge in the rest-UV to near-infrared. Sensitive high-resolution ALMA observations will be essential to confirm this scenario and study the gas and dust distribution.</description>

      <title>The orbital kinematics of kpc-scale dual-core systems with double-peaked narrow emission lines</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.00875</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.00875v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this manuscript, based on SDSS photometry and spectroscopy, a method is proposed to test the hypothesis that the orbital kinematics of kpc-scale dual-core systems can lead to double-peaked narrow emission lines (DPNELs), through analyzing a sample of seven kpc-scale dual-core systems by comparing the upper limits of their orbital velocities (calculated using total stellar mass and projected distance) with the velocity separation of DPNELs (peak separation). To determine accurate total stellar masses, GALFIT is applied to consider the effects of the overlapping components on the photometric images to obtain accurate magnitudes. Then, based on the correlation between absolute Petrosian magnitudes and total stellar masses, the individual masses of the galaxies are determined. Therefore, the maximum orbital velocities can be calculated by combining the projected distance. Meanwhile, the peak separation can be accurately measured after subtracting the pPXF determined host galaxy contributions. Finally, four objects exhibit peak separations almost consistent with their respective maximum orbital velocities under the assumption of a circular orbit, while the remaining three objects display peak separations larger than the maximum orbital velocities. A larger sample will be given later to further test whether DPNELs can arise from kpc-scale dual-core systems.</description>

      <title>Subclustering and Star Formation Efficiency in Three Protoclusters in the Central Molecular Zone</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.00878</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.00878v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present so far the highest resolution ($\sim$0.04") ALMA 1.3 mm continuum observations of three massive star-forming clumps in the Central Molecular Zone, namely 20 km s$^{-1}$ C1, 20 km $^{-1}$ C4, and Sgr C C4, which reveal prevalent compact millimeter emission. We extract the compact emission with $\textit{astrodendro}$ and identify a total of 199 fragments with a typical size of $\sim$370 AU, which represent the first sample of candidates of protostellar envelopes and disks and kernels of prestellar cores in these clumps that are likely forming star clusters. Compared with the protoclusters in the Galactic disk, the three protoclusters display a higher level of hierarchical clustering, likely a result of the stronger turbulence in the CMZ clumps. Compared with the mini-starbursts in the CMZ, Sgr B2 M and N, the three protoclusters also show stronger subclustering in conjunction with a lack of massive fragments. The efficiency of high-mass star formation of the three protoclusters is on average one order of magnitude lower than that of Sgr B2 M and N, despite a similar overall efficiency of converting gas into stars. The lower efficiency of high-mass star formation in the three protoclusters is likely attributed to hierarchical cluster formation.</description>

      <title>Tentative detection of neutral gas in a Little Red Dot at $z=4.46$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.00998</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.00998v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: JWST has revealed a population of broad-line active galactic nuclei at $z&gt;4$ with remarkably red colors, so-called "Little Red Dots." Ubiquitous Balmer breaks suggest that they harbor old stellar populations in massive, compact host galaxies. We present ALMA observations of three LRDs at $z=3.10$, $4.46$, and $7.04$, targeting molecular and neutral gas via CO(7-6) and [CI](2-1), respectively. We do not detect CO in any target, placing conservative limits on the host molecular gas mass $\lesssim 1$-$5\times10^{10}$ M$_\odot$. We report the tentative ($4.9\sigma$) detection of the [CI](2-1) line in A2744-45924 ($z=4.46$), one of the brightest known LRDs. The [CI] line is narrow (FWHM $\sim 80$ km s$^{-1}$), implying a dynamical mass $\lesssim 10^{10}$ M$_\odot$, adopting conservative limits for the galaxy size. The dynamical mass limit is significantly lower than expected from the local $M_{\rm BH}$-$M_{\rm dyn}$ relation, and is an order of magnitude below the stellar mass derived from SED fitting, potentially supporting a non-stellar origin of the Balmer break. These results, while tentative, paint a picture of LRDs that is markedly different than typical high-$z$ quasars, which live in massive, gas-rich, and actively star-forming host galaxies.</description>

      <title>The environments of radio galaxies and quasars in LoTSS data release 2</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.01055</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.01055v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Aims. The orientation-based unification scheme of radio-loud active galactic nuclei (AGNs) asserts that radio galaxies and quasars are essentially the same type of object, but viewed from different angles. To test this unification model, we compared the environments of radio galaxies and quasars, which would reveal similar properties when an accurate model is utilized. Methods. Using the second data release of the LOFAR Two-metre Sky Survey (LoTSS DR2), we constructed a sample of 26,577 radio galaxies and 2028 quasars at 0.08 &lt; z &lt; 0.4. For radio galaxies with optical spectra, we further classified them as 3631 low-excitation radio galaxies (LERGs) and 1143 high-excitation radio galaxies (HERGs). We crossmatched these samples with two galaxy cluster catalogs from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS). Results. We find that $17.1 \pm 0.2%$ of the radio galaxies and $4.1 \pm 0.4%$ of the quasars are associated with galaxy clusters. Luminous quasars are very rare in clusters, while $18.7 \pm 0.7%$ LERGs and $15.2 \pm 1.1%$ HERGs reside in clusters. We also note that in radio galaxies, both HERGs and LERGs tend to reside in the centers of clusters, while quasars do not show a strong preference for their positions in clusters. Conclusions. This study shows that local quasars and radio galaxies exist in different environments, challenging the orientation-based unification model. This means that factors other than orientation may play an important role in distinguishing radio galaxies from quasars. The future WEAVE-LOFAR survey will offer high-quality spectroscopic data for a large number of radio sources and allow for a more comprehensive exploration of the environments of radio galaxies and quasars.</description>

      <title>Turbulence in virtual: II. Origin of skewness and dual fraction processes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.01160</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.01160v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Turbulence is a mysterious phenomenon in physical systems and plays a critical role in the interstellar medium (ISM). Previous simulations and observations have shown that the probability density functions (PDFs) of gas densities in supersonic systems tend to be skewed, exhibiting low-density exponential tails on the $s = \ln{\rho}$ scale. In this work, we argue that these exponential tails originate from the convolution of PDF kernels with skewed tails, which can appear at both ends of the PDF. We introduce two density-fraction strategies -- the mass-fraction and volume-fraction approaches -- to explain the physical origins of the low-$s$ and high-$s$ skewed PDF kernels. The PDF kernels constructed in this work satisfy the relation that its structural entropy equals the PDF variance, as we proposed in Paper I. These two types of PDF kernels define two spaces of skewed PDFs, which are dual to each other and possess highly symmetric mathematical structures. We thus speculate that the high-$s$ skewed PDF kernels are physical and may be related to the power-law tails of the column-density PDFs (on the $\rho$ scale) of molecular clouds, which are shaped by both turbulence and gravity. Inspired by this, we further construct a form of an `isothermal' turbulent system that likely favors the volume-fraction strategy.</description>

      <title>ASKAP observations of the radio shell in the composite supernova remnant G310.6-1.6</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.01364</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.01364v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We report the observations of the radio shell of the supernova remnant (SNR) G310.6-1.6 at 943 MHz from the Evolutionary Map of the Universe (EMU) and the Polarization Sky Survey of the Universe's Magnetism (POSSUM) surveys by using the Australian Square Kilometre Array Pathfinder (ASKAP). We detect polarized emission from the central pulsar wind nebula (PWN) with rotation measures varying from -696 rad m$^{-2}$ to -601 rad m$^{-2}$. We measure the integrated flux density of the shell to be 36.4 +/- 2.2 mJy at 943 MHz and derive a spectral index of -0.4 +/- 0.1 for the PWN and -0.7 +/- 0.3 for the SNR shell. From the combined radio and X-ray observations, the object can be identified as a supernova explosion of about 2500 yr ago with energy of about 1.3 x 10$^{50}$ erg, suggesting an ejected mass of about 10 M_sun. The circular radio shell outside the circular hard X-ray shell is unique among Galactic SNRs. We discuss several possible scenarios, including blast wave, reverse shock, and pulsar-fed emission, but find that none of them can fully explain the observed characteristics of the shell. This poses a challenge for understanding the evolution of SNRs. The results of this paper demonstrate the potential of the ASKAP EMU and POSSUM surveys in discovering more objects of small angular size and low surface brightness.</description>

      <title>Modeling the cool gas clumps in the circumgalactic medium</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.01479v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A major challenge in CGM studies is determining the three-dimensional (3D) properties from the observed projected observations. Here, we decompose the 3D gas density and spatial distribution of cool clouds by fitting a cool CGM model with the absorption observations, including the cool gas density, Ly$\alpha$, and Mg II equivalent widths. The clumpiness in the cool CGM is considered by modeling individual clouds. This model has four major components: the radial profile of the cool gas density; the number density of clouds; the absorption properties within individual clouds; and the velocity dispersion in the CGM. The observed cool gas density exhibits a large dispersion of $\approx2-3$ dex within the virial radius ($r_{vir}$). This dispersion can be reproduced with a combination of the projection effect (i.e., distant low-density clouds projected at small radii) and the intrinsic variation in the gas density. By modeling the probability density functions of gas density at different radii, the cool gas density is modeled as a $\beta$-model with a characteristic gas density of $\log n_{H,0}/{\rm cm^{-3}}=-2.57_{-0.25}^{+0.43}$ at $r_{vir}$ and a slope of $\beta_c=0.63_{-0.20}^{+0.16}$, and the intrinsic dispersion is $\sigma_{n_{H}}\approx 0.56_{-0.20}^{+0.19}$ dex. Assuming a cloud mass of $10^4M_\odot$, we further constrain the number density of cool clouds by jointly reproducing Ly$\alpha$ and Mg II equivalent width samples, resulting into a number density of $\log n_{{\mathcal{N}}_{cl},0}/ r_{vir}^{-3}=4.76^{+0.27}_{-0.21}$ at $r_{vir}$ and a slope of $\beta_N=0.65^{+0.06}_{-0.07}$. This spatial distribution of the cool CGM leads to a total cool gas mass of $\log M_{cool}/M_\odot=10.01^{+0.06}_{-0.06}$ for $L^*$ galaxies, while varying the cloud mass from $10^3M_\odot$ to $10^6M_\odot$ leads to the total cool CGM mass of $9.62_{-0.07}^{+0.05}$ to $10.46_{-0.05}^{+0.05}$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.01533v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: On January 15 2025, the Gaia mission completed the collection of the astrometric, photometric, and spectroscopic data for about 2.5 billion celestial sources, from the solar system to the Milky Way to the distant universe. Work is ongoing to produce Gaia DR4 based on the first 5.5 years of data, with the release expected in 2026. The full 10.5 year survey will be turned into Giaa DR5 which will open up scientific possibilities beyond Gaia DR4}. In this contribution I give a brief overview of the Gaia mission, summarize results from the GaiaUnlimited project, provide a glimpse of what is to come in Gaia DR4, and summarize the new science opportunities that Gaia DR5 will bring. I close with a look ahead at the successor to Gaia, the GaiaNIR mission, which will survey the Milky Way in the infrared, thus probing the Galactic ecosystem in the regions hidden to the Gaia mission.</description>

      <title>Parallax-based Distances to Galactic Hii Regions: Nearby Spiral Structure</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.01551v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The spiral structure of the Milky Way is not conclusive, even for the disc regions in the solar neighbourhood. Especially, the arm-like structures uncovered from the over-density maps of evolved stars are inconsistent with the commonly adopted spiral arm models based on young objects. We aim to re-examine the arm segments traced by young objects and better understand the nearby spiral structure. We identify the exciting stars of 459 hii regions and calculate their parallax-based distances according to the Gaia DR3. Together with other hii regions with spectrophotometric or parallax-based distances in literature, the largest ever sample of 572 hii regions with accurate distances is used to reveal the features shown in their distributions projected onto the Galactic disc. The results are then compared to the features traced by other young objects (high-mass star-forming region masers, O-type stars, and young open clusters) and evolved stars. The structures outlined by different kinds of young objects do not exhibit significant deviation from each other. The distributions of young objects are in agreement with three arm-like features emerging in the over-density map of evolved stars. Especially, the Local Arm outlined by young objects follows an arm-like feature delineated by evolved stars and probably spirals outwards towards the direction of $\ell \sim 240^\circ$ in the third Galactic quadrant. We conclude that the arm segments traced by young objects and evolved stars are consistent with each other at least in the solar neighbourhood. In particular, the Local Arm delineated by young objects is reinterpreted as an arm segment with a large pitch angle of $25.2^\circ \pm 2.0^\circ$, whose inner edge is in good agreement with the recently discovered Radcliffe Wave.</description>

      <title>CANUCS/Technicolor: JWST Medium Band Photometry Finds Half of the Star Formation at $z&gt;7.5$ is Obscured</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.01579</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.01579v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a sample of 146 high-redshift ($z&gt;7.5$) galaxies from the CANUCS/Technicolor surveys, showcasing photometry in every wide- and medium-band NIRCam filter in addition to ancillary HST data sampling $0.4-5 \mu m$ (22 JWST bands out of 29 bands total). Additionally, 48 ($33\%$) galaxies in our sample meet criteria to be classified as extreme emission line galaxies, 15 ($10\%$) of which are completely missed by typical dropout selections due to faint UV emission. By fitting the SEDs covering the rest-frame UV to optical at $z &gt; 7.5$, we investigate the dust obscuration properties, giving an unbiased view of dust buildup in high-redshift galaxies free from spectroscopic follow-up selection effects. Dust attenuation correlates with stellar mass, but more strongly with star formation rate. We find typical galaxies at $z&gt;7.5$ have $\sim 25 \%$ of their star formation obscured. However, since galaxies with higher star formation rates suffer more attenuation, $\sim 50 \%$ of the total star formation rate density at $7.5&lt;z&lt;9$ is obscured. The obscured fraction drops to $\sim 35 \%$ in our $9&lt;z&lt;12$ bin, possibly due to substantial dust grain growth in the interstellar medium not having time to occur. Extrapolating the decline in dust obscuration of galaxies to higher redshifts, we infer that dust obscuration should approach zero at $z &gt; 15$, implying that epoch as when dust first forms in bright galaxies.</description>

      <title>Galaxy populations of ProtoClusters in cosmological hydrodynamical simulations</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.01674v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The study of protoclusters at cosmic noon is essential to understand the impact on galaxies of the environment and of the transformational processes occurring in this epoch. This work tests the predictions of the DIANOGA cosmological hydrodynamical simulations of cluster progenitors at z=2.2, comparing them with observations, and investigates the environmental effects on galaxies by comparing protoclusters with an average volume of the Universe. We analyze 14 protoclusters and a cosmological box of 49 cMpc/h per side. We compare predictions and observations of the galaxy properties, including colors of galaxies obtained with radiative transfer, to analyze UVJ diagrams. We showed that the DIANOGA simulations produce a galaxy stellar mass function in broad agreement with observations, with a higher fraction of high-mass galaxies ($M_{\ast}&gt;10^{10} \ M_{\odot}$) in massive halos in protoclusters, compared to the box. The same signal, with lower significance, is also observed in the wide-field protocluster structures, indicating an accelerated evolution of galaxies before their infall into massive halos. Our simulations underestimate SFRs of galaxies both in protoclusters and in the box, compared to observations, due to low gas reservoirs. We find a weak suppression of SFRs in protocluster galaxies (~0.05 dex), compared to the box, increasing up to ~0.25 dex in massive halos. The quenched galaxy fraction varies significantly across different protocluster halos, consistent with observations. The simulations show a strong dependence of quenched fractions on halo mass and an excess of quenched galaxies in the wide-field protocluster region, compared to the cosmological box. UVJ diagram analysis shows qualitative agreement with observed color distributions of star-forming and quenched galaxies, except for few massive galaxies with steeper reddening vectors than typically assumed in observations.</description>

      <title>Hydrogenation of HOCO and formation of interstellar CO$_2$: A not so straightforward relation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.01692</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.01692v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Carbon dioxide (CO$_2$) is one of the most important interstellar molecules. While it is considered that it forms on the surface of interstellar dust grains, the exact contribution of different chemical mechanisms is still poorly constrained. Traditionally it is deemed that the CO + OH reaction occurring on top of ices is the main reaction path for its formation. Recent investigations showed that in reality the reaction presents a more complex mechanism, requiring an additional H-abstraction step. Building on our previous works, we carried out a detailed investigation of such H abstraction reactions with the hydrogen atom as a reactant for the abstraction reaction. We found an unconventional chemistry for this reaction, markedly depending on the isomeric form of the HOCO radical prior to reaction. The favored reactions are t-HOCO + H -&gt; CO + H$_2$O, c-HOCO + H -&gt; CO$_2$ + H$_2$ and t/c-HOCO + H -&gt; c/t-HCOOH. We estimate bounds for the rate constants of the less favored reaction channels, t-HOCO + H -&gt; CO$_2$ + H and c-HOCO + H -&gt; CO + H$_2$O, to be approximately 10$^{4-6}$ s$^{-1}$. However, these estimates should be interpreted cautiously due to the significant role of quantum tunneling in these reactions and the complex electronic structure of the involved molecules, which complicates their study. Our findings underscore the need for detailed investigation into the chemistry of interstellar CO$_2$ and pave the way for a reevaluation of its primary formation mechanisms in the interstellar medium.</description>

      <title>The Host Galaxy of FRB 20190520B and Its Unique Ionized Gas Distribution</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.01740</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.01740v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The properties of host galaxies associated with Fast Radio Bursts (FRBs) provide critical information for inferring the progenitors and radiation mechanisms of these bursts. We report on the host galaxy of the repeating FRB 20190520B, a dwarf galaxy at the spectroscopic redshift $z=0.241$ with a stellar mass of $(6.2 \pm 0.8) \times 10^8 \ M_{\odot}$. The emission line ratios suggest that the ionized gas is powered by star formation. The total H$\alpha$-traced star formation rate (SFR) is $0.70 \pm 0.01 \ {M_{\odot} ~ \rm yr^{-1}}$, and the metallicity is $\rm 12+log_{10} ([O/H]) \geq 7.4 \pm 0.1$. The specific star formation rate (sSFR) is $\rm log \ sSFR/yr^{-1} = -9.0 \pm 0.1$, higher than the upper limit of $-9.4$ observed in nearby dwarf galaxies. The dispersion measure contribution from the host galaxy is estimated to be $\rm DM_{host} \approx 950 \pm 220 \ pc \ cm^{-3}$, based on the H$\alpha$ emission. The FRB and the associated persistent radio source are located at the H$\alpha$ emission peak, offset by $\sim 1.4^{\prime\prime}$ (5.5 kpc) in projection from the stellar continuum. At this position, the lower limit of $\rm \log \ sSFR/yr^{-1}$ is $-8.5 \pm 0.1$, more than three times the galaxy's total sSFR. The H$\alpha$ velocity difference between the stellar continuum and the offset gas is $39.6 \pm 0.4$ km s$^{-1}$, which is sufficient to draw conclusions about the nature of the offset.</description>

      <title>An 18-25 GHz spectroscopic survey of dense cores in the Chamaeleon I molecular cloud</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.01755</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.01755v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We extend the survey for organics in the southern hemisphere by observing two cores in the Chamaeleon complex using NASA's Deep Space Network 70-m antenna in Canberra, Australia, over the frequency range of 18 to 25 GHz. We surveyed the class 0 protostar Cha-MMS1 and the prestellar core Cha-C2, which represent two stages in the evolution of dense cores. We detect several molecules including HC$_3$N, HC$_5$N, C$_4$H, CCS, C$_3$S, NH$_3$, and c-C$_3$H$_2$. A longer cyanopolyyne, HC$_7$N, is detected with high confidence via spectral stacking analysis. While molecular column densities in the two Chamaeleon cores are typically an order of magnitude lower compared to the cynaopolyyne peak in TMC-1, the molecular abundance ratios are in general agreement with the TMC-1 values. The two exceptions are c-C$_3$H$_2$, which is enhanced by a factor of \about 25 with respect to cyanopolyynes in the Chamaeleon cores, and ammonia, which is enhanced by a factor of ~ 125. The deuterated species c-C$_3$HD is detected in both cores, with a high D/H ratio of ~0.23 in c-C$_3$H$_2$. A rare isotopologue of ammonia, $^{15}$NH$_3$, is also detected in Cha-MMS1 suggesting a high $^{14}$N/$^{15}$N ratio of ~ 690 in ammonia. However, this ratio may be artificially enhanced due to the high optical depth of the $^{14}$NH$_3$ (1,1) line, which increases the effective source size. We use the detections of ammonia, cyanopolyynes, and far-infrared dust continuum to characterize the density and temperature in the Chamaeleon cores and calculate the molecular column densities and their relative ratios. The ring molecule benzonitrile is not detected in either Chamaeleon core. The $3 \sigma$ upper limits for its column density are a factor of 2 higher than the value derived for TMC-1 and the upper limits for its relative abundance with respect to HC$_5$N are a factor of 3 higher than the TMC-1 value.</description>

      <title>TDCOSMO: XX. WFI2033--4723, the First Quadruply-Imaged Quasar Modeled with JWST Imaging</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.00099</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.00099v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Gravitational time delays offer unique, independent measurements of the Hubble constant, $H_0$. Precise measurements of $H_0$ stand as one of the most pressing challenges in modern cosmology, and to do so with time delays requires precise lens models. While much work has focused on streamlining the modeling process to keep pace with the erumpent discovery of strongly-lensed systems, a critical step toward reducing uncertainty in $H_0$ comes from increasing the precision of individual lens models themselves. In this work, we demonstrate that the unprecedented imaging capabilities of JWST make this goal attainable. We present the first lens model for time-delay cosmography derived from JWST data, applied to the quadruply-imaged quasar WFI2033--4723. While the primary source of systematic uncertainty in time-delay cosmography is currently the mass-sheet degeneracy (MSD), the sensitivity of models to this MSD varies on how the point spread function (PSF) errors are mitigated. As the PSF is also the primary source of uncertainty in lens modeling, we focus on a comparison of different PSF modeling methods. Within the context of power-law models, we recover results in agreement with previous Hubble Space Telescope (HST)-based models, but with better precision of key lensing parameters through implementation of new PSF modeling techniques. Despite the record-holding precision of this system's HST modeling, we achieve an additional 22% increase in precision of the Fermat potential difference, directly reducing uncertainties of cosmological inference. These results would produce a 3% ($1\sigma$ of the modeling error) shift of $H_0$ towards a higher value for this lens, keeping all else constant. This work substantiates the groundbreaking potential of JWST for time-delay cosmography and lays the groundwork for modeling systems previously too faint to provide meaningful constraints on $H_0$.</description>

      <title>The Simons Observatory: Science Goals and Forecasts for the Enhanced Large Aperture Telescope</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.00636</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.00636v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We describe updated scientific goals for the wide-field, millimeter-wave survey that will be produced by the Simons Observatory (SO). Significant upgrades to the 6-meter SO Large Aperture Telescope (LAT) are expected to be complete by 2028, and will include a doubled mapping speed with 30,000 new detectors and an automated data reduction pipeline. In addition, a new photovoltaic array will supply most of the observatory's power. The LAT survey will cover about 60% of the sky at a regular observing cadence, with five times the angular resolution and ten times the map depth of Planck. The science goals are to: (1) determine the physical conditions in the early universe and constrain the existence of new light particles; (2) measure the integrated distribution of mass, electron pressure, and electron momentum in the late-time universe, and, in combination with optical surveys, determine the neutrino mass and the effects of dark energy via tomographic measurements of the growth of structure at $z &lt; 3$; (3) measure the distribution of electron density and pressure around galaxy groups and clusters, and calibrate the effects of energy input from galaxy formation on the surrounding environment; (4) produce a sample of more than 30,000 galaxy clusters, and more than 100,000 extragalactic millimeter sources, including regularly sampled AGN light-curves, to study these sources and their emission physics; (5) measure the polarized emission from magnetically aligned dust grains in our Galaxy, to study the properties of dust and the role of magnetic fields in star formation; (6) constrain asteroid regoliths, search for Trans-Neptunian Objects, and either detect or eliminate large portions of the phase space in the search for Planet 9; and (7) provide a powerful new window into the transient universe on time scales of minutes to years, concurrent with observations from Rubin of overlapping sky.</description>

      <title>Search for binary-channel metal-rich RR~Lyrae candidates</title>

Abstract: The existence of dynamically young and metal-rich RR Lyrae stars challenges conventional notions of these variable stars. One possible scenario for their formation and evolution is via binary channels involving mass transfer. This study presents the detection of nine fundamental-mode RR Lyrae stars residing in the thin disk of the Milky Way with metallicities higher than [Fe/H] &gt; -1.0 dex and showing proper motion anomalies. Our thin disk classification is based on kinematics and supported by $\alpha$-element abundances, where possible. We searched for indications of the light-travel time effect (LTTE) in the available literature sources and the TESS photometric data of the stars but found no signs of periodic variations induced by companions within the expected period range. This could be because of a lack of observations as well as sparse measurements and large gaps in the data. We propose a continued search for signs of binarity and a subsequent long-term follow-up of nine targets that satisfy all of our search criteria. Beyond these targets, we also report the detection of slow phase changes in the Blazhko star ST Pic, which could be compatible with the LTTE.</description>

      <title>First X-ray polarimetric view of a Low-Luminosity Active Galactic Nucleus: the case of NGC 2110</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.01071</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.01071v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Low-Luminosity Active Galactic Nuclei (LLAGN) provides a unique view of Comptonization and non-thermal emission from accreting black holes in the low-accretion rate regime. However, to decipher the exact nature of the Comptonizing corona in LLAGN, its geometry and emission mechanism must be understood beyond the limits of spectro-timing techniques. Spectro-polarimetry offers the potential to break the degeneracies between different coronal emission models. Compton-thin LLAGN provide an opportunity for such spectro-polarimetric exploration in the 2-8 keV energy range using IXPE. In this work, we carry out a spectro-polarimetric analysis of the first IXPE observation, in synergy with a contemporaneous NuSTAR observation, of an LLAGN: NGC 2110. Using 554.4 ks of IXPE data from October 2024, we constrain the 99% upper limit on the Polarization Degree (PD) to be less than 8.3% assuming the corresponding Polarization Angle (PA) to be aligned with the radio jet, and less than 3.6% if in the perpendicular direction. In the absence of a significant PD detection, the PA remains formally unconstrained, yet the polarization significance contours appear to be aligned with the radio jet, tentatively supporting models in which the corona is radially extended in the plane of the disk. We also carry out detailed Monte Carlo simulations using MONK and STOKES codes to test different coronal models against our results and compare the polarization properties between NGC 2110 and brighter Seyferts.</description>

      <title>Detection Prospects of Electromagnetic Signatures from OGLE-2011-BLG-0462</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.01172</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.01172v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Stellar-mass isolated black holes (IsoBHs) wandering in interstellar medium (ISM) are expected to be abundant in our Galaxy. Recently, an IsoBH, OGLE-2011-BLG-0462, was unambiguously discovered using astrometric microlensing. We examine prospects for detecting electromagnetic signatures from an accretion flow surrounding the IsoBH. The accretion rate onto the IsoBH should be highly sub-Eddington, which leads to formation of a hot accretion flow. In this paper, we evaluate the detectability of electromagnetic signals from the hot accretion flows in two accretion states: magnetically arrested disk (MAD) and classical radiatively inefficient accretion flows (RIAFs). For the MAD scenario, we find that the optical, infrared, and X-ray signals can be detectable by the current best facilities, such as HST, JWST, and Chandra, if the IsoBH is in a warm neutral medium. In contrast, for the classical RIAF scenario, the optical and X-ray emissions are weaker than MAD scenario, leading to unobservable signals for a typical parameter set. Future follow-up observations of OGLE-2011-BLG-0462 will provide a good test for theories of accretion processes.</description>

      <title>The relation between black hole spin and star formation in massive star-forming galaxies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.01213</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.01213v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: It has always been believed that feedback from active galactic nuclei (AGN) has an important impact on star formation in massive galaxies. Black hole spin is an important physical parameter of AGN. We use a large sample of massive star-forming galaxies to study the effects of AGN on star formation. Our main results are as follows: (i) There are significant correlations between black hole spin and star formation rate, specific star formation rate, and star formation activity parameter for massive star-forming early-type and late-type galaxies, respectively. These results indicate that the spin of supermassive black holes regulates the star formation of massive star-forming early-type and late-type galaxies. (2) The slopes of the relationship between black hole spin and star formation rate, specific star formation rate, and star formation activity parameter for massive star-forming early-type galaxies and late-type galaxies are similar within the error range. These results imply that the mechanism of black hole spin regulating star formation may be similar in massive star-forming early-type and late-type galaxies.</description>

      <title>Investigating dusty Red Supergiant outflows in Westerlund 1 with 3D Hydrodynamic simulations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.01272</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.01272v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recent JWST observations towards Westerlund 1 revealed extensive nebular emission associated with the cluster. Given the age of the region and proximity of that material to massive stars it cannot be primordial star forming gas and the origin is uncertain. We aim to determine whether the nebular emission in Westerlund 1 could be due to ablation flows from Red Supergiant (RSG) stars embedded in the cluster wind driven by the Wolf-Rayet stars in the cluster core. We also aim to explore the efficiency of mass-loading for the RSG wind in this scenario. We use 3D hydrodynamic simulations with the \textsc{pion} code to study the interaction between the cluster and RSG winds. We compare with the JWST observations by generating synthetic dust-emission maps. We find that the ablation flow morphology is consistent with the observations towards Westerlund 1, with clumps and instabilities. Synthetic observations at 11 $\mu$m predict fluxes in the ablation flow of $\sim1000-6000$ MJy ster$^{-1}$ which is consistent with the unsaturated components of the JWST F1130W observations in the vicinity of the red supergiants in the region. This good agreement is achieved without any consideration of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs), which have a known 11.3 $\mu$m feature that appears in the F1130W band. This suggests that the ablation flow is PAH depleted. Ablation of RSG winds can explain the observed nebulosity in Westerlund 1, at least in the vicinity of the RSGs. Further observations are encouraged to enable detailed studies of these interactions.</description>

      <title>Core-collapse supernovae</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.01321v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Core-collapse supernovae (CCSNe) are the explosive end-points of stellar evolution for $M_{ZAMS} \gtrsim 8$ $M_\odot$ stars. The cores of these stars collapse to neutron stars, a process in which high neutrino luminosity drives off the overlying stellar layers, which get ejected with thousands of kilometers per second. These supernovae enrich their host galaxies with elements made both during the star's life and in the explosion, providing the main cosmic source of elements such as oxygen, neon and silicon. Their high luminosities ($\sim$ $10^{42}$ erg s$^{-1}$ at peak) make SNe beacons to large distances, and their light curves and spectra provide rich information on single and binary stellar evolution, nucleosynthesis, and a diverse set of high-energy physical processes. As the SN ejecta sweep up circumstellar and interstellar matter, it eventually enters a supernova remnant phase, exemplified by nearby, spatially resolved remnants such as Cas A and the Crab Nebula. In this phase, shocks and pulsar winds continue to light up the interior of the exploded stars, giving detailed information about their 3D structure. We review the central concepts of CCSNe, from the late stages of evolution of massive stars, through collapse, explosion, and electromagnetic display, to the final remnant phase. We briefly discuss still open questions, and current and future research avenues.</description>

      <title>A kinematically constrained kick distribution for isolated neutron stars</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.01429</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.01429v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The magnitudes of the velocity kicks that neutron stars (NSs) obtain at their formation have long been a topic of discussion, with the latest studies analysing the velocities of young pulsars and favouring a bimodal kick distribution. In previous work, a novel method was proposed to determine kicks based on the eccentricity of Galactic trajectories. We applied this method to the isolated pulsars with known parallax in order to kinematically constrain the NS natal kick distribution and investigate its proposed bimodality. Since this method is applicable to older pulsars, we effectively increase the sample size with ${\sim}50\%$ compared to the pulsars younger than $10$ Myr. We assumed the velocity vectors of the pulsars to be distributed isotropically in the local standard of rest frame. These velocity vectors were used to trace back the trajectories of the NSs through the Galaxy and estimate their eccentricity. Then, we simulated kicked objects in order to evaluate the relationship between kick magnitude and Galactic eccentricity, which was used to infer the kicks corresponding to the estimated eccentricities. The resulting kick distributions indeed show a bimodal structure for young pulsars. However, for older pulsars the bimodality vanishes and instead we find a log-normal kick distribution peaking at ${\sim}200$ km/s and a median of ${\sim}400$ km/s. We therefore conclude that the natal kicks of these isolated NSs are best described by log-normal distribution with $\mu=6.38$ and $\sigma=1.01$. This analysis reveals no evidence for bimodality in the larger sample, and we suggest that the bimodality found by existing literature may be caused by Poisson noise due to their relatively small sample size.</description>

      <title>On the age distribution of Classical Cepheids in the Galaxy</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.06228v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We revisit the problem of the positive correlation between age and Galactocentric distance seen in Galactic Classical Cepheids, which at first sight may seem counter-intuitive in the context of inside-out galaxy formation. To explain it, we use the Besan\c{c}on Galaxy Model and a simulation of star particles in the Galactic disc coupled with stellar evolutionary models. We then select Classical Cepheids from this simulation and test in qualitative terms which ingredients are necessary to find agreement with the observational data. We show that the interplay of the Galactic disc's metallicity gradient and the metallicity dependence of the Cepheids' life-time in the instability strip results in a pronounced positive age-Galactocentric distance relation. This renders a reconstruction of the recent star-formation history based on Classical Cepheids unrealistic. It also has important consequences on our interpretation of the observed scatter about the radial metallicity gradient measured with Galactic Classical Cepheids.</description>

      <title>JADES: The star-formation and chemical enrichment history of a luminous galaxy at z~9.43 probed by ultra-deep JWST/NIRSpec spectroscopy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.02575</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.02575v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We analyse ultra-deep JWST observations of the galaxy JADES-GS-z9-0 at z = 9.4327, and derive detailed stellar and interstellar medium (ISM) properties of this luminous (MUV=-20.43) high-redshift system. Complementary information from NIRCam imaging and NIRSpec (both low- and medium-resolution) spectroscopy reveal a compact system (Re ~110 pc) characterised by a steeply rising star formation history, which is reflected in the inferred young stellar age (t ~ 3 Myr, light-weighted), high star-formation rate surface density ({\Sigma}SFR ~ 72 M yr-1 kpc-2), high ionisation parameter (log(U) ~ -1.5), low metallicity (12+log(O/H) ~ 7.5), and low carbon-over-oxygen abundance ([C/O] = -0.64). Leveraging the detection of N iii]1750 we derive nitrogen-over-oxygen abundance ([N/O] ~ 0) higher than the plateau followed by low-redshift galaxies of similar metallicity, possibly revealing the imprint from (very) massive stars on the ISM enrichment and favouring a top-heavy Initial Mass Function (IMF) scenario. Massive stars powering a hard radiation field are also required to explain the rest-frame UV line ratios, though the presence of the high-excitation [Ne v]{\lambda}3426 emission line possibly hints at additional ionization from an AGN. We also report the tentative detection of Ly{\alpha} emission in the G140M spectrum, shifted by ~450 km/s redward of the systemic redshift. Combined with a modelling of the Ly{\alpha} spectral break, we rule out the presence of very high column densities of neutral gas pertaining to local absorbers, as well as any extended surrounding ionised bubble, suggesting that JADES-GS-z9-0 has not yet significantly contributed to cosmic Reionization.</description>

      <title>Cosmological predictions for minor axis stellar density profiles in the inner regions of Milky Way-mass galaxies</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.03627v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: $\Lambda$CDM cosmology predicts the hierarchical formation of galaxies which build up mass by merger events and accreting smaller systems. The stellar halo of the Milky Way has proven to be useful a tool for tracing this accretion history. However, most of this work has focused on the outer halo where dynamical times are large and the dynamical properties of accreted systems are preserved. In this work, we investigate the inner galaxy regime, where dynamical times are relatively small and systems are generally completely phase-mixed. Using the FIRE-2 and Auriga cosmological zoom-in simulation suites of Milky Way-mass galaxies, we find the stellar density profiles along the minor axis (perpendicular to the galactic disk) within the NFW scale radii (R$\approx$15 kpc) are best described as an exponential disk with scale height &lt;0.3 kpc and a power law component with slope $\alpha\approx$-4. The stellar density amplitude and slope for the power law component is not significantly correlated with metrics of the galaxy's accretion history. Instead, we find the stellar profiles strongly correlate with the dark matter profile. Across simulation suites, the galaxies studied in this work have a stellar to dark matter mass ratio that decreases as $1/r^2$ along the minor axis.</description>

      <title>Compact [OIII] emission-line regions ("Green Seeds") in $\mathrm{H\alpha}$ emitters at Cosmic Noon from JWST Observations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.08520</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.08520v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present a rest-frame optical, spatially resolved analysis of more than 100 $\mathrm{H\alpha}$ emitters (HAEs) at $z\sim2.2$ in the ZFOURGE-CDFS field using NIRCam imaging from the JWST Advanced Deep Extragalactic Survey (JADES). The ultra-deep, high-resolution data gives us maps of the resolved emission line regions of HAEs with stellar mass ranging from $10^{8}\,M_{\odot}$ to $10^{10}\,M_{\odot}$. An [OIII] emission-line map of each HAE is created from the flux excess in the F150W filter, leading to the discovery of a population of kiloparsec-scale compact emission line regions (``Green Seeds") with high equivalent widths ($\mathrm{EW}$). We obtain a sample of 128 Green Seeds from 68 HAEs with rest-frame $\mathrm{EW_{[OIII]}}&gt;200\r{A}$. Moreover, 17 of them have extremely large $\mathrm{EW_{[OIII]}}&gt;1000\r{A}$, suggesting the possible Lyman continuum (LyC) leakage from these emission line regions. Embedded within the host galaxy, many Green Seeds correspond to UV star-forming clumps and H{\sc ii} regions, indicating elevated starburst activity in them, with specific star formation rates (sSFR) several times higher than that of the host galaxy. Based on theoretical frameworks, Green Seeds are expected to be formed through gravitational disk instability and/or galaxy mergers. Considering the stellar masses of Green Seeds, we speculate that high-mass Green Seeds may migrate toward the galactic center to build the central bulge, while low-mass Green Seeds are easily disrupted and short-lived. Besides, we propose that some Green Seeds could be the progenitors of globular clusters or ultracompact dwarf galaxies observed in the local universe.</description>

      <title>PANORAMIC: Discovery of an Ultra-Massive Grand-Design Spiral Galaxy at $z\sim5.2$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.13264</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.13264v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We report the discovery of an ultra-massive grand-design red spiral galaxy, named Zh\'ul\'ong (Torch Dragon), at $z_{\rm phot} = 5.2^{+0.3}_{-0.2}$ in the JWST PANORAMIC survey, identified as the most distant bulge+disk galaxy candidate with spiral arms known to date. Zh\'ul\'ong displays an extraordinary combination of properties: 1) a classical bulge centered in a large, face-on exponential stellar disk (half-light radius of $R_{\rm e} = 3.7 \pm 0.1 \, \mathrm{kpc}$), with spiral arms extending across 19 kpc; 2) a clear transition from the red, quiescent core ($F150W-F444W=3.1$ mag) with high stellar mass surface density ($\log(\Sigma M_{\star}/M_{\odot} \, \mathrm{kpc}^{-2}) = 9.91_{-0.09}^{+0.11}$) to the star-forming outer regions, as revealed by spatially resolved SED analysis, which indicates significant inside-out galaxy growth; 3) an extremely high stellar mass at its redshift, with $\log (M_{\star}/M_{\odot})=11.03_{-0.08}^{+0.10}$ comparable to the Milky Way, and an implied baryon-to-star conversion efficiency ($\epsilon \sim 0.3$) that is 1.5 times higher than even the most efficient galaxies at later epochs; 4) despite an active disk, a relatively modest overall star formation rate ($\mathrm{SFR} =66_{-46}^{+89} ~M_{\odot} \, \mathrm{yr}^{-1}$), which is $&gt;$0.5 dex below the star formation main sequence at $z \sim 5.2$ and $&gt;$10 times lower than ultra-massive dusty galaxies at $z=5-6$. Altogether, Zh\'ul\'ong shows that mature galaxies emerged much earlier than expected in the first billion years after the Big Bang through rapid galaxy formation and morphological evolution. Our finding offers key constraints for models of massive galaxy formation and the origin of spiral structures in the early universe.</description>

To do that, we first select the galaxies with 9.4 $&lt;$ $\log{(M_\mathrm{star}/M_\odot)}$ $&lt;$ 11.5 to make a sample comparable to that of SDSS/MaNGA observations. We then construct the two-dimensional line-of-sight velocity map and conduct the fit to determine the rotational velocity and the slope of the rotation curve in the outer region ($R_\mathrm{t}&lt;r&lt;3\times r_\mathrm{half,*}$). The outer slopes of the simulated galaxies show diverse patterns that are dependent on morphology and stellar mass. The outer slope increases as galaxies are more disky, and decreases as galaxies are more massive, except for the very massive early-type galaxies. The outer slope of the rotation curves shows a correlation with the dark matter fraction, slightly better than for the gas mass fraction. Our study demonstrates that the observed dependence of galaxy rotation curves on morphology and stellar mass can be successfully reproduced in cosmological simulations, and provides a hint that dark matter plays an important role in shaping the rotation curve. The sample of simulated galaxies in this study could serve as an important testbed for the subsequent study tracing galaxies back in time, enabling a deeper understanding of the physical origin behind the diverse rotation curves.</description>

      <title>Detectability of dark matter subhalo impacts in Milky Way stellar streams</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.07781v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Stellar streams are a promising way to probe the gravitational effects of low-mass dark matter (DM) subhalos. In recent years, there has been a remarkable explosion in the number of stellar streams detected in the Milky Way, and hundreds more may be discovered with future surveys such as LSST. Studies of DM subhalo impacts on streams have so far focused on a few of the thinnest and brightest streams, and it is not known how much information can be gained from the others. In this work, we develop a method to quickly estimate the minimum detectable DM subhalo mass of a given stream, where subhalo mass here refers to the total mass of a Plummer sphere. Our work is based on an analytic model for subhalo impacts on circular streams, which allows us to model streams with a wide range of properties including width, length, distance, and stellar density. We consider several observational scenarios, based on current and future surveys including Gaia, DESI, Via, and LSST. We find that at 95% confidence level, a stream like GD-1 has a minimum detectable subhalo mass of $\sim 6\times 10^6~\mathrm{M}_{\odot}$ in Gaia data and $\sim 8\times 10^5~\mathrm{M}_{\odot}$ with LSST 10 year sensitivity. Applying our results to confirmed Milky Way streams, we rank order them by their sensitivity to DM subhalos and identify promising ones for further study.</description>

      <title>Formation and Evolution of Accreting Compact Objects</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.08997</link>
      <description>arXiv:2303.08997v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Accreting compact objects are crucial to understand several important astrophysical phenomena such as Type Ia supernovae, gravitational waves, or X-ray and $\gamma$-ray bursts. In addition, they are natural laboratories to infer fundamental properties of stars, to investigate high-energy phenomena and accretion processes, to test theories of stellar and binary evolution, to explore interactions between high-density plasma and very strong magnetic fields, to examine the interplay between binary evolution and dynamical interactions (in the case they belong to dense star clusters), and they can even be used as a probe for the assembling process of galaxies over cosmic time-scales. Despite the fundamental importance of accreting compact objects for astrophysics and recent progress with the comprehension of these fascinating objects, we still do not fully understand how they form and evolve. In this chapter, we will review the current theoretical status of our knowledge on these objects, and will discuss standing problems and potential solutions to them.</description>

      <title>Prospects for detection of ultra high frequency gravitational waves from hyperbolic encounters with resonant cavities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.08379</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.08379v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this brief article, we pursue the systematic investigation of possible gravitational wave sources in the gigahertz band. We focus on hyperbolic encounters of light black holes and evaluate precisely the expected signal when accounting for the detailed characteristics of haloscope experiments. Considering the GraHal setup as a benchmark, we insist on the correct signal-to-noise ratio expression, taking into account the appropriate timescales resulting from both physical and instrumental constraints. The associated maximum distance - of the order of a hundredth of an astronomical unit - at which an event can be detected is calculated for optimal, suboptimal, and general trajectories. The main conclusion is that detection seems clearly out of reach.</description>

      <title>Constraining cosmological parameters using void statistics from the SDSS survey</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.13736</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.13736v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We identify voids as maximal non-overlapping spheres within the haloes of the Uchuu simulation and three smaller halo simulation boxes with smaller volume and different $\sigma_{8}$ values, and galaxies with redshift in the range $0.02&lt;z&lt;0.132$ and absolute magnitude in the $r-$band $M_{r}&lt;-20.5$ of 32 Uchuu-SDSS simulated lightcones the seventh release of \textit{The Sloan Digital Sky Survey} (SDSS DR7) survey. We compute the Void Probability Function and the abundance of voids larger than $r$ predicted by the theoretical framework used in this work and we check that it predicts successfully both void functions for the halo simulation boxes. Next, we asses the potential of this theoretical framework to constrain cosmological parameters using Uchuu-SDSS void statistics, and we calculate the confidence levels using Monte Carlo Markov Chain techniques to infer the values of $\sigma_{8}$, $\Omega_{\rm m}$ and H$_{0}$ from the SDSS sample used. The constraints we obtain from the SDSS survey sample used. The results are: $\sigma_{8}=1.028^{+0.273}_{-0.305}$, $\Omega_{\rm m}=0.296^{+0.110}_{-0.102}$, H$_{0}=83.43\pm^{+29.27}_{-27.70}$, $\Gamma=0.1947^{+0.0578}_{-0.0516}$ and S$_{8}$=1.017$^{+0.363}_{-0.359}$. If we combine these constraints with KiDS-1000+DESY3, we get $\sigma_{8}=0.858^{+0.040}_{-0.040}$, $\Omega_{\rm m}=0.257\pm^{+0.023}_{-0.020}$, H$_{0}=74.17^{+4.66}_{-4.66}$ and S$_{8}$=0.794$^{+0.016}_{-0.016}$. The combined uncertainties are approximately a factor 2-3 smaller than only-Weak-Lensing uncertainties. This is a consequence of the orientation of the confidence level contours of SDSS voids and Weak Lensing in the plane $\sigma_{8}-\Omega_{\rm m}$, which are almost orthogonal (abridged).</description>

      <title>Evolution of stars with 60 and 200 Msun: predictions for WNh stars in the Milky Way</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.14165</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.14165v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study in detail the evolution of two massive stars at solar metallicity ($Z=0.014$), by calculating their final masses, radial expansion, and chemical enrichment. We run evolutionary models for initial masses 60 and 200 $M_\odot$, using MESA and the Geneva-evolution-code (GENEC). For the mass loss, we adopt the self-consistent m-CAK prescription for the optically thin winds of OB-type stars, a semi-empirical formula for H-rich optically thick wind of WNh stars, and a hydrodynamically consistent formula for the H-poor thick wind of classical Wolf-Rayet stars. The transition from thin to thick winds is set at $\Gamma_\text{e}=0.5$.
  For the 60 $M_\odot$ case, the GENEC model predicts a more efficient rotational mixing and more chemically homogeneous evolution, whereas the MESA model predicts a large radial expansion reaching the LBV phase. For the 200 $M_\odot$ case, differences between both evolution codes are less relevant because their evolution is dominated by wind mass loss with a weaker dependence on internal mixing.
  The switch of the mass-loss prescription based on the Eddington factor instead of the removal of outer layers, implies the existence of WNh stars with a large mass fraction of hydrogen at the surface ($X_\text{surf}\ge0.3$) formed from initial masses of $\gtrsim60$ $M_\odot$. These stars are constrained in a $T_\text{eff}$ range of the HRD which corresponds to the MS band, in agreement with the observations of Galactic WNh stars at $Z=0.014$. While our models employ a fixed $\Gamma_\text{e,trans}$ threshold for the switch to thick winds, rather than a continuous thin-to-thick wind model, the good reproduction of observations during the MS supports the robustness of the wind model upgrades, allowing its application to studies of late-stage stellar evolution before core collapse.</description>

      <title>A new probe of dark matter-baryon interactions in compact stellar systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.01818</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.01818v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate the astrophysical consequences of an attractive long-range interaction between dark matter and baryonic matter. Our study highlights the role of this interaction in inducing dynamical friction between dark matter and stars, which can significantly influence the evolution of compact stellar systems. Using the star cluster in Eridanus II as a case study, we derive a new stringent upper bound on the interaction strength $\tilde{\alpha}\leq 314.5$ for the interaction range $\lambda = 1$ pc. This constraint is independent of the dark matter mass and can improve the existing model-independent limits on $\tilde{\alpha}$ by a few orders of magnitude. Furthermore, we observe that the constraint is insensitive to the mass of the stellar system and the dark matter density in the stellar system as long as the system is dark matter dominated. This new approach can be applied to many other stellar systems, and we obtain comparable constraints from compact stellar halos observed in ultrafaint dwarf galaxies.</description>

      <title>Formation of free-floating planetary mass objects via circumstellar disk encounters</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.21180</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.21180v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The origin of planetary mass objects (PMOs) wandering in young star clusters remains enigmatic, especially when they come in pairs. They could represent the lowest-mass object formed via molecular cloud collapse or high-mass planets ejected from their host stars. However, neither theory fully accounts for their abundance and multiplicity. Here, we show via hydrodynamic simulations that free-floating PMOs have a unique formation channel via the fragmentation of tidal bridges between encountering circumstellar disks. This process can be highly productive in dense clusters like Trapezium forming metal-poor PMOs with disks. Free-floating multiple PMOs also naturally emerge when neighboring PMOs are caught by their mutual gravity. PMOs may thus form a distinct population that is fundamentally different from stars and planets.</description>

      <title>Resolving Pleiades binary stars with Gaia and speckle interferometric observations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.20986</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.20986v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The Pleiades is the most prominent open star cluster visible from Earth and an important benchmark for simple stellar populations, unified by common origin, age, and distance. Binary stars are its essential ingredient, yet their contribution remains uncertain due to heavy observational biases. A resolved multiplicity survey was conducted for a magnitude-limited G &lt; 15mag sample of 423 potential cluster members, including sources with poorly fitted astrometric solutions in Gaia DR3. Speckle interferometric observations at the 2.5 meter telescope of SAI MSU observatory were combined with Gaia data, enabling the identification of 61 resolved binary or multiple systems within the 0.04 - 10 arcsec (5 - 1350 au) separation range. With speckle observations, we discovered 21 components in 20 systems. The existence of a Merope (23 Tau) companion is confirmed after several previous unsuccessful attempts. We show that the Gaia multipeak fraction is a strong predictor of subarcsecond multiplicity, as all sources with ipd_frac_multi_peak &gt; 4% are successfully resolved. We found that 10% of Pleiades stars have a companion with a mass ratio q &gt; 0.5 within projected separation of 27 &lt; s &lt; 1350 au, and confirm a deficit of wide binaries with s &gt; 300 au. An observed dearth of wide pairs with large mass ratio (q &gt; 0.55) may imprint the transition from hard to soft binaries regime at the early stages of cluster evolution. The total binary fraction for q &gt; 0.5 systems is extrapolated to be around 25%.</description>

      <title>Tidal disruption events as the origin of the eROSITA and Fermi bubbles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.18713</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.18713v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Context: The recently discovered spherical eROSITA bubbles arise up to a latitude of $\pm$80\deg-85\deg in the X-ray regime of the Milky Way halo. Similar to the $\gamma$-ray Fermi bubbles, they evolve around the Galactic center, making a common origin plausible. However, the driving mechanism and evolution of both bubbles are still under debate. Aims: We investigate whether hydrodynamic energy injections at the Galactic center, such as e.g. tidal disruption events (TDEs), could have inflated both bubbles. The supermassive black hole Sagittarius A* is expected to tidally disrupt a star every 10-100 kyr, potentially leading to an outflow from the central region that drives a shock propagating into the Galactic halo due to its vertically declining density distribution, ultimately forming a superbubble that extends out of the disk similar to the eROSITA and Fermi bubbles. Methods: We model TDEs in the Galaxy using three-dimensional hydrodynamical simulations, considering different Milky Way mass models and TDE rates. We then generate synthetic X-ray maps and compare them with observations. Results: Our simulation results of a $\beta$-model Milky Way halo show that superbubbles, blown for 16 Myr by regular energy injections at the Galactic center that occur every 100 kyr, can have a shape, shell stability, size, and evolution time similar to estimates for the eROSITA bubbles, and an overall structure reminiscent of the Fermi bubbles. The $\gamma$-rays in our model would stem from cosmic ray interactions at the contact discontinuity, where they were previously accelerated by first-order Fermi acceleration at in situ shocks. Conclusions: Regular TDEs in the past 10-20 Myr near the Galactic center could have driven an outflow resulting in both, the X-ray emission of the eROSITA bubbles and the $\gamma$-ray emission of the Fermi bubbles.</description>

      <title>WilloWISPs: A New Dark Growth Channel for Black Holes Suggests a Full-Spectrum Hierarchical MACHO Mass Function for Dark Matter</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.06981v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Evidence of neutron stars with deconfined quark-matter cores suggest a new pathway for the evolution of black holes. New theories about the cores of neutron stars support the idea that quarkonium is likely to grow there as the neutron star ages. Surveys of stellar remnants have shown that there is no major mass gap between neutron stars and black holes. Black holes, specifically primordial ones (PBHs), have been suggested as an explanation for dark matter before. However, the way that very large black holes can form in the lifetime of the visible universe has only recently been explained with a promising solution to The Final Parsec Problem. If neutron stars can become exotic stars or black holes surrounded by axions, then they may allow Intermediate-Mass Black Holes (IMBH) and Supermassive Black Holes (SMBH) to form quickly enough via coalescence. We find that a hierarchical clustering of Massive and Compact Halo Objects (MACHOs) with axion-dominated mini-halos can help to explain all of the missing dark matter. The model presented here suggests that this type of MACHO is likely equivalent to black holes above an unknown critical mass, which is less than ~1 $M_{\odot}$, and that they ought to be quark stars below this mass. If quark stars are a transition state between neutron stars and black holes, then black holes ought to be equivalent to boson stars, after all the residual quark material has formed a Bose-Einstein condensate of strange mesons.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2502.15300v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Machine learning (ML) has become a key tool in astronomy, driving advancements in the analysis and interpretation of complex datasets from observations. This article reviews the application of ML techniques in the identification and classification of stellar objects, alongside the inference of their key astrophysical properties. We highlight the role of both supervised and unsupervised ML algorithms, particularly deep learning models, in classifying stars and enhancing our understanding of essential stellar parameters, such as mass, age, and chemical composition. We discuss ML applications in the study of various stellar objects, including binaries, supernovae, dwarfs, young stellar objects, variables, metal-poor, and chemically peculiar stars. Additionally, we examine the role of ML in investigating star-related interstellar medium objects, such as protoplanetary disks, planetary nebulae, cold neutral medium, feedback bubbles, and molecular clouds.</description>

      <title>The Galactic Magnetic Field and UHECR Deflections</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.15876</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.15876v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Ultrahigh-energy cosmic rays (UHECRs) experience deflections as they traverse the Galactic magnetic field (GMF), which must be accounted for when tracing them back to their sources. After briefly summarizing our results on uncertainties in cosmic-ray deflections from the UF23 ensemble of GMF models (Unger &amp; Farrar, 2024), we report a new preliminary fit of the GMF including foreground emission from the Local Bubble. This fit uses the analytic model of Pelgrims et al. (2024) for the magnetic field in the thick shell of Galactic bubbles. We also discuss how variations in toroidal halo field modeling account for the key differences between the Jansson &amp; Farrar (2012) GMF model and the UF23 ensemble.
  Furthermore, we extend our previous analysis of the origin of the highest-energy "Amaterasu" event observed by the Telescope Array to include the four highest-energy events detected by the Pierre Auger Observatory. Amaterasu and PAO070114 are the UHECR events with the smallest localization uncertainties of 4.7% and 2.4%, respectively. Neither of their back-tracked directions aligns with any compelling candidate for a continuous UHECR accelerator. This strengthens the evidence that at least a fraction of the highest energy events originate from transient sources.</description>

      <title>Playing with lepton asymmetry at the resonant production of sterile neutrino dark matter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.17374</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.17374v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We examine the sterile neutrino dark matter production in the primordial plasma with lepton asymmetry unequally distributed over different neutrino flavors. We argue that with the specific flavor fractions, one can mitigate limits from the Big Bang Nucleosynthesis on the sterile-active neutrino mixing angle and sterile neutrino mass. It happens due to cancellation of the neutrino flavor asymmetries in active neutrino oscillations, which is more efficient in the case of inverse hierarchy of active neutrino masses and does not depend on the value of CP-phase. This finding opens a window of lower sterile-active mixing angles. Likewise, we show that, with lepton asymmetry disappearing from the plasma at certain intermediate stages of the sterile neutrino production, the spectrum of produced neutrinos becomes much colder, which weakens the limits on the model parameter space from observations of cosmic small-scale structures (Ly-$\alpha$ forest, galaxy counts, etc.). This finding reopens the region of lighter sterile neutrinos. The new region may be explored with the next generation of X-ray telescopes searching for the inherent peak signature provided by the dark matter sterile neutrino radiative decays in the Galaxy.</description>

      <title>Variability of Central Stars of Planetary Nebulae with the Zwicky Transient Facility. II. Long-Timescale Variables including Wide Binary and Late Thermal Pulse Candidates</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.18651</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.18651v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this second paper on the variability survey of central stars of planetary nebulae (CSPNe) using ZTF, we focus on the 11 long-timescale variables with variability timescales ranging from months to years. We also present preliminary analyses based on spectroscopic and/or photometric follow-up observations for six of them. Among them is NGC 6833, which shows a 980 day periodic variability with strange characteristics: 'triangle-shaped' brightening in $r$, $i$, and WISE bands but almost coincidental shallow dips in the $g$-band. We speculate this to be a wide but eccentric binary with the same orbital period. Long-period near-sinusoidal variability was detected in two other systems, NGC 6905 and Kn 26, with periods of 700 days and 230 days, respectively, making them additional wide-binary candidates. The latter also shows a short period at 1.18 hours which can either be from a close inner binary or pulsational origin. We present CTSS 2 and PN K 3-5 which show brightening and significant reddening over the whole ZTF baseline. A stellar model fit to the optical spectrum of CTSS 2 reveals it to be one of the youngest post-AGB CSPN known. Both show high-density emission-line cores. These appear to be late thermal pulse candidates, currently evolving towards the AGB phase, though alternative explanations are possible. We then present recent HST/COS ultraviolet spectroscopy of the known wide-binary candidate LoTr 1 showing that the hot star is a spectroscopic twin of the extremely hot white dwarf in UCAC2 46706450. We think that the long photometric period of 11 years is the binary orbital period. Finally, we briefly discuss the ZTF light curves of the remaining variables, namely Tan 2, K 3-20, WHTZ 3, Kn J1857+3931, and IPHAS J1927+0814. With these examples, we present the effectiveness of the von Neumann statistics and Pearson Skew-based metric space in searching for long-timescale variables.</description>
