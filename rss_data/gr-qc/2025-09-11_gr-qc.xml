      <title>Scalar quasinormal modes of magnetically charged black holes in a quintessence field</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.08845</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.08845v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the quasinormal mode (QNM) spectrum for scalar perturbations of static, magnetically charged black holes in the presence of a quintessence field. The background geometry is obtained from the Einstein-Power-Maxwell action with a Kiselev-type contribution for quintessence. The associated master wave equation is solved using complementary numerical approaches, including high-order WKB expansions, the asymptotic iteration method, and time-domain integration, with cross-validation to ensure accuracy. The results show that magnetic charge generally lowers the oscillation frequency of fundamental modes, while the quintessence parameter modifies damping timescales. A dedicated analysis of the metric's derivation confirms the correct form of the magnetic charge term. We explore a theoretical parameter space to understand the mathematical behavior of the solution, including extreme regimes not intended to represent astrophysical realities. The computed scalar field spectra provide a foundational study for future work on gravitational perturbations. All numerical data and codes are provided to ensure reproducibility.</description>

      <title>Systematic errors in fast relativistic waveforms for Extreme Mass Ratio Inspirals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.08875</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.08875v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Accurate modeling of Extreme Mass-Ratio Inspirals (EMRIs) is essential for extracting reliable information from future space-based gravitational wave observatories. Fast waveform generation frameworks adopt an offline/online architecture, where expensive relativistic computations (e.g. self-force and black hole perturbation theory) are performed offline, and waveforms are generated rapidly online via interpolation across a multidimensional parameter space. In this work, we investigate potential sources of error that result in systematic bias in these relativistic waveform models, focusing on radiation-reaction fluxes. Two key sources of systematics are identified: (i) the intrinsic inaccuracy of the flux data, for which we focus on the truncation of the multipolar mode sum, and (ii) interpolation errors from transitioning to the online stage. We quantify the impact of mode-sum truncation and analyze interpolation errors by using various grid structures and interpolation schemes. For circular orbits in Kerr spacetime with spins larger than $a \geq 0.9$, we find that $\ell_{\text{max}} \geq 30$ is required for the necessary accuracy. We also develop an efficient Chebyshev interpolation scheme, achieving the desired accuracy level with significantly fewer grid points compared to spline-based methods. For circular orbits in Kerr spacetimes, we demonstrate via Bayesian studies that interpolating the flux to a maximum global relative error that is equal to the small mass ratio is sufficient for parameter estimation purposes. For 4-year long quasi-circular EMRI signals with SNRs$= \mathcal{O}(100)$ and mass-ratios $10^{-4}-10^{-6}$, a global relative error of $10^{-6}$ yields mismatches $&lt;10^{-3}$ and negligible parameter estimation biases.</description>

      <title>Probing Direct Waves in Black Hole Ringdowns</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.09165</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.09165v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Merger gravitational waves from binary black hole coalescence carry rich information about the underlying spacetime dynamics. We analyze merger waves from comparable-mass and extreme-mass-ratio binaries, obtained from numerical relativity and black-hole perturbation theory, respectively, and argue that they are dominated by the prompt wave emissions as the black holes collide. This signal, which we refer to as the direct wave, is modulated by the plunging motion and selectively screened by the gravitational potential of the remnant black hole. The direct wave typically exhibits a time-dependent frequency and decay rate, but for high-spin remnants $(\gtrsim0.7)$ the ergosphere renders it mode-like, with a quasi-stable instantaneous oscillation frequency close to the superradiant frequency. We further estimate its detectability in a GW150914-like system and find that the signal-to-noise ratio can exceed $\sim 10$ with the current ground-based detector network. Our results therefore identify the direct wave as a robust observable for analyzing black hole ringdowns in current and future gravitational wave events.</description>

      <title>Higher-order gravity models: corrections up to cubic curvature invariants and inflation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.09167</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.09167v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We construct a higher-order gravity model including all corrections up to mass dimension six. Starting from the Jordan frame, we derive the field equations and specialize to the FLRW background, where the dynamics take the form of a four-dimensional autonomous system. Focusing on the $R+R^{2}+RR_{\mu\nu}R^{\mu\nu}$ case, we obtain linearized equations in the parameter $\gamma_{0}$ and analyze the resulting phase space. The model exhibits the main desirable features of an inflationary regime, with a slow-roll attractor and a stable critical point corresponding to the end of inflation. Analytical expressions for the scalar spectral index $n_{s}$ and the tensor-to-scalar ratio $r$ show that the model is consistent with Planck, BICEP/Keck, and BAO data if $|\gamma_{0}|\lesssim 10^{-3}$. Moreover, negative values of $\gamma_{0}$ restore compatibility with recent ACT, Planck and DESI results, suggesting that higher-order corrections may play a relevant role in refining inflationary cosmology.</description>

      <title>Cosmology in warped massive gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.09270</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.09270v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the cosmological dynamics and predictions in the theory of warped massive gravity. This set-up postulates a five-dimensional ghost-free massive graviton with a brane-localized four-dimensional massive gravity potential, and has the virtue of raising the strong-coupling scale of the 4D theory. We identify two classes of models that lead to decoupled equations for the scale factor on the brane: one characterized by a particular choice of boundary conditions for the St\"uckelberg fields and one characterized by a special tuning between the coefficients of the 5D and 4D potentials. In the first case, we find interesting solutions including a cosmological bounce without the need of exotic matter. The second case leads to a modified Friedmann equation, and comparison with data shows the potential of the model to alleviate the Hubble tension.</description>

      <title>Frozen Neutron Stars</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.09338</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.09338v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate neutron stars with nonlinear magnetic monopoles in the framework of the Einstein-nonlinear electrodynamics model, specifically within the Bardeen and Hayward models. Solving the modified Tolman-Oppenheimer-Volkoff equations for three different equations of state, we find that upon reaching the critical magnetic charge $q_{c}$, neutron stars enter frozen states characterized by the critical horizon. This extends the concept of frozen states to compact objects composed of ordinary matter (non-field matter), thereby offering a new perspective for related research.</description>

      <title>Thermodynamics of Einstein-Geometric Proca AdS compact objects</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.09389</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.09389v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this study we explore metric-Palatini gravity extended by the antisymmetric component of the affine curvature. This gravitational theory results in general relativity plus a geometric Proca field. Building on our previous work, where we constructed its static spherically symmetric solutions in the Anti-de Sitter (AdS) background (Eur. Phys. J. C 83(4):318, 2023), we conduct a comprehensive analysis of the system's thermodynamics. We examine the thermodynamic properties of the Einstein-Geometric Proca AdS compact objects, focusing on the Hawking temperature, enthalpy, heat capacity, entropy, and Gibbs free energy. Particular attention is given to the dependence of the Hawking temperature, enthalpy, and heat capacity on the uniform potential $q_{1}$ and the electromagnetic-type charge $q_{2}$. Through numerical analysis we compute the entropy and Gibbs free energy and investigate how these quantities vary with the model parameters.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2509.09403v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: As in the gravitational context, one of the most challenging open question in analogue black holes formed in Bose-Einstein condensates concerns the backreaction of Hawking-like radiation on the condensate and its subsequent evolution. In this work we derive the basic equations describing this backreaction within the density-phase formalism, which avoids infrared divergences and is particularly well suited to one-dimensional configurations.</description>

      <title>Exploring Coupled Quintessence in light of CMB and DESI DR2 measurements</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.09624v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We perform a detailed analysis of a theoretically motivated dark energy quintessence model which interacts with the dark matter sector of the universe. Utilising the current observational datasets from the Cosmic Microwave Background, Baryon Acoustic Oscillations and Type Ia Supernovae, we constrain the parameters that characterise the strength of the time dependent interaction. We also look at the effect of a warm dark matter component in the context of coupled quintessence. Analysis using Deviance Information Criterion indicates strong preference for the quintessence model coupled with warm dark matter. However, Bayesian evidence analysis shows favor in the direction of $\Lambda$CDM model.</description>

      <title>Ultralight Boson Ionization from Comparable-Mass Binary Black Holes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.09643</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.09643v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Ultralight bosons around comparable-mass binaries can form gravitationally bound states analogous to molecules once the binary separation decreases below the boson's Bohr radius, with the inner region co-moving with the binary. We simulate the formation of these gravitational molecules, determine their co-moving regions, and compute ionization fluxes induced by orbital motion for various binary eccentricities. We develop semi-analytic formalisms to describe the ionization dynamics of both the co-moving and non-co-moving regions, demonstrating consistency with numerical simulation results. From ionization fluxes, we estimate their backreaction on binary orbital evolution. At early stages, molecule ionization can dominate over gravitational wave emission, producing a spectral turnover in the gravitational wave background. Additionally, ionization of the co-moving component occurs solely due to binary eccentricity, causing orbital circularization.</description>

      <title>Theoretical and experimental basis for excluding Einstein-Cartan theory within the USMEG-EFT framework</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.08848</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.08848v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The USMEG-EFT framework~\cite{ChishtieEFT2025,ChishtieBreakdown2023} provides systematic quantum gravity through with 4D General Relativity (GR) achieving Standard Model-gravity unification. This work examines Einstein-Cartan theory against McKeon et al.'s claims~\cite{BrandtFrenkelMcKeon2024,McKeonBrandtFrenkel2025} regarding its viability for unification. McKeon et al.'s 2024 analysis omitted key interaction terms, missing Einstein-Cartan's central content. Their 2025 claim that unification requires Einstein-Cartan is incorrect. When fermions are included, Einstein-Cartan generates non-renormalizable four-fermion interactions producing catastrophic quartic divergences $\sim \kappa^4\Lambda^4$. Precision experiments exclude the theory: MICROSCOPE constrains equivalence principle violations at $10^{-15}$ while Einstein-Cartan predicts $10^{-12}$ effects. In contrast to these claims, the USMEG-EFT framework achieves unification using standard 4D GR through constraints, producing finite results with calculable coefficients while remaining experimentally compatible.</description>

      <title>Massive Spinning Fields During Inflation: Feynman rules and correlator comparison</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.08888</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.08888v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider the dynamics of massive spinning fields during inflation and the resulting signatures in the cosmological correlators of inflaton perturbations computed in the Poincar\'{e} patch of de Sitter space. There are (at least) two ways to describe the fluctuations of such new spinning degrees of freedom and these are distinguished by the symmetries of the de Sitter group that they linearly realise. The primary question we ask is: do these two set-ups yield distinct signatures in cosmological observables? After systematically deriving the Feynman rules for exchange diagrams consisting of massive spinning fields, where we discover the necessity of \textit{effective propagators} that augment the naive Schwinger-Keldysh ones by delta functions corresponding to instantaneous propagation, we show that the two set-ups are indistinguishable at the level of the inflaton bispectrum but distinguishable at the level of the trispectrum and other higher-point correlation functions. The bispectrum is special since in the corresponding tree-level Feynman diagrams, only the helicity-zero modes of the spinning fields can propagate. The bispectrum correspondence holds up to the addition of contact diagrams arising from the self-interactions of the inflaton, and is consistent with the symmetries of the effective field theory inflation. Our results suggest that the cosmological collider signals in the bispectrum are universal and do not depend on the detailed description of the massive spinning field.</description>

      <title>Reionization optical depth and CMB-BAO tension in punctuated inflation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.09086</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.09086v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Within the standard six-parameter Lambda cold dark matter ($\Lambda$CDM) model, a $2$-$3\sigma$ tension persists between baryon acoustic oscillation (BAO) measurements from the Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument (DESI) and observations of the cosmic microwave background (CMB). Although this tension has often been interpreted as evidence for dynamical dark energy or a sum of neutrino masses below the established minimum, recent studies suggest it may instead originate from an underestimation of the reionization optical depth, particularly when inferred from large-scale CMB polarization. Jhaveri et al. propose that a suppression of large-scale primordial curvature power could partially cancel the contribution of $\tau$ to the CMB low-$\ell$ polarization power spectrum, leading to a biased low $\tau$ measurement in standard analyses. In this work, we investigate whether punctuated inflation - which generates a suppression of primordial power on large scales through a transient fast-roll phase - can raise the inferred $\tau$ value and thereby reconcile the consistency between CMB and BAO. For simple models with step-like features in the inflaton potential, we find that the constraint on $\tau$ and the CMB-BAO tension remain nearly identical to those in the standard six-parameter $\Lambda$CDM model. We provide a physical explanation for this negative result.</description>

      <title>Machine Learning Confirms GW231123 is a "Lite" Intermediate Mass Black Hole Merger</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.09161</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.09161v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The LIGO-Virgo-KAGRA Collaboration recently reported GW231123, a black hole merger with total mass of around 190-265 solar mass. This event adds to the growing evidence of "lite" intermediate mass black hole (IMBH) discoveries of post-merger black holes &gt;100 solar mass. GW231123 posed several data analysis challenges owing to waveform-model systematics and presence of noise artifacts called glitches. We present the first comprehensive machine learning analysis to further validate this event, strengthen its astrophysical inference, and characterize instrumental noise in its vicinity. Our approach uses a combination of tools tailored for specific analyses: GW-Whisper, an adaptation of OpenAI's audio transformer, ArchGEM, a Gaussian mixture model-based soft clustering and density approximation software and AWaRe, a convolutional autoencoder. We identify the data segment containing the merger with &gt;70% confidence in both detectors and verify its astrophysical origin. We then characterize the scattered light glitch around the event, providing the first physically interpretable parameters for the glitch. We also reconstruct the real waveforms from the data with slightly better agreement to model-agnostic reconstructions than to quasi-circular models, hinting at possible astrophysics beyond current waveform families (such as non-circular orbits or environmental imprints). Finally, by demonstrating high-fidelity waveform reconstructions for simulated mergers with total masses between 100-1000 solar mass, we show that our method can confidently probe the IMBH regime. Our integrated framework offers a powerful complementary tool to traditional pipelines for rapid, robust analysis of massive, glitch-contaminated events.</description>

      <title>Interacting k-essence field with non-pressureless Dark Matter: Cosmological Dynamics and Observational Constraints</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.09202</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.09202v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate a class of interacting dark energy and dark matter (DM) models, where dark energy is modeled as a $k$-essence scalar field with an inverse-square potential. Two general forms of interaction are considered: one proportional to the Hubble parameter, and another independent of the Hubble parameter, depending instead on combinations of the energy densities and pressures of the dark sectors. The dynamics are analyzed using a dynamical system stability framework by constructing an autonomous system of equations. The models are tested against a wide range of observational datasets, including cosmic chronometers (CC), BAO measurements from DESI DR2, compressed Planck data (PLA), Pantheon+ (PP), DES supernovae, Big Bang Nucleosynthesis (BBN), and strong lensing data from H0LiCOW (HCW). The analysis shows that the models consistently reproduce all major cosmological epochs and yield statistically competitive results compared to the flat $\Lambda$CDM model. The models exhibit stable late-time de-Sitter solutions, ensuring ghost-free evolution, with the Hubble constant in the range $H_0 \sim 67$--$70$ km/s/Mpc.</description>

      <title>Brans-Dicke-like field for co-varying $G$ and $c$: observational constraints</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.09211</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.09211v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Ref. [Symmetry 15 (2023) 709] introduced a Brans-Dicke-like framework wherein the scalar field $\phi$ is composed of both $G$ and $c$ which, for this reason, co-vary according to $c^{3}/G=\text{constant}$. In this paper, we use observational data to constrain the supposed co-varying $G$ and $c$. The datasets include SN Ia, BAO and the value of $\theta$ extracted from CMB data. A proxy function is demanded for the varying $c$ since the framework does not provide a closed set of equations for computing the functional form of either $G$ or $c$ uniquely. Accordingly, we choose three separate parameterizations for $c\left(z\right)$ inspired both by desirable properties of the varying speed of light (VSL) and by successful phenomenological models from the literature -- including the one by Gupta (CCC framework in e.g. Ref. [Mon. Not. R. Astron. Soc., 498 (2020) 4481-4491]. When combined with DESI, Pantheon+ data strongly favor a variable speed of light with more than $3\sigma$ confidence level for all parameterizations considered in this paper, whereas Union2.1 suggests no variation of the speed of light. As we shall demonstrate, this apparent discrepancy is due to a strong correlation that emerges between $H_0$ and VSL.</description>

      <title>Investigating the cosmic distance duality relation with gamma-ray bursts</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.09247v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Deviations from the so-called {\it cosmic distance duality relation} may result from systematic errors in distance measurements or, more interestingly, hint at new physics. Further, it can also be related to the Hubble constant tension between early and local measurements of $H_0$. Based on this, we test validity of this relation through a model-independent parameterization of the Hubble rate via the well-estabilished B\'ezier polynomials approach. We seek for possible departures from the relation considering three parametrizations, i) a power-law correction, ii) a logarithmic correction and iii) a Pad\'e series $P_{n,m}(z)$ of order (1;2) with $n=1$ being the order of the numerator while $m=2$ is the order of the denominator. Then, assuming a flat scenario, we test them through Monte Carlo -- Markov chain analyses that combine low- and intermediate/high-$z$ data sets, such as observational Hubble data, the Pantheon catalog of type Ia supernovae, galaxy clusters, the second data release from the DESI Collaboration and gamma-ray bursts. In particular, we distinguish between \emph{Analysis A} and \emph{Analysis C}, depending whether the prompt emission $E_{iso}-E_p$ or the prompt-afterglow $L_0-E_p-T$ gamma-ray burst correlations, respectively, is fit together with the other probes previously described. Our results seem to point towards a \emph{no violation} of the cosmic distance duality relation and a preference towards Planck's value of $H_0$.</description>

      <title>Fixed points of classical gravity coupled with a Standard-Model-like theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.09346</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.09346v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Coupling quantum field theory (QFT) \!-\! even free QFT \!-\! to gravity leads to well-known problems. In particular, the stress tensor $T_{\mu\nu}$ (gravity's source) and its correlators typically diverge in the UV, creating a conflict between the wildly inhomogeneous spacetime we expect quantum mechanically and the weakly-curved, macroscopic spacetime we observe. Are there QFTs for which these divergences cancel? Here, for simplicity, we consider free quantum fields on a classical curved background. The aforementioned divergences are related to the running of the gravitational couplings. We calculate the corresponding beta functions, identifying a special class of QFTs with UV fixed points at which $\langle T_{\mu\nu}\rangle$ and all its correlators $\langle T\ldots T\rangle$ are UV finite. An intriguing example is a theory like the Standard Model (including right-handed neutrinos) with $12$ gauge fields, $3$ generations of $16$ Weyl fermions and $36$ four-derivative (Fradkin-Tseytlin) scalars. In the infrared, this theory has a positive Newton's constant $G$ and an arbitrarily small cosmological constant $\Lambda$.</description>

      <title>Towards systematic search for white dwarf binaries with multiband photometry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.09348</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.09348v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Ultra-compact double white dwarfs (DWDs) represent key targets for multi-messenger astrophysics, as they may be observed both through gravitational waves and the electromagnetic (EM) spectrum. The future Laser Interferometer Space Antenna (LISA) will detect thousands of these systems, and they are predicted to be the most numerous science targets of the mission. We develop a strategy to identify LISA source candidates in multiband photometric surveys. We constructed a synthetic EM catalogue of white dwarf (WD) detections based on a population synthesis code combined with a semi-analytical model of the Milky Way and a consistent cooling model for the evolution. We compared sources in the LISA band with other WD observations in magnitude-colour and colour-colour plots. From a full sky survey with $u \le$24.5, we find that 57$\%$ of the sources in the LISA band occupy a specific region in colour-colour diagrams. Inside this area, we find that $\sim 63\%$ (6.5 $\times 10^4$) of EM observations are LISA candidates, $\sim 31\%$ ($ 3.2 \times 10^4$) are DWDs slightly outside the LISA frequency range, and only a small contamination comes from single WDs and wider binaries. We find that the colour distributions of close DWDs represent a powerful tool to distinguish potential LISA sources from the broader WD population. This is an avenue to select candidates for further follow-up and identification.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2509.09573v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Optical clocks based on atoms and ions probe relativistic effects with unprecedented sensitivity by resolving time dilation due to atom motion or different positions in the gravitational potential through frequency shifts. However, all measurements of time dilation so far can be explained effectively as the result of dynamics with respect to a classical proper time parameter. Here we show that atomic clocks can probe effects where a classical description of the proper time dynamics is insufficient. We apply a Hamiltonian formalism to derive time dilation effects in harmonically trapped clock atoms and show how second-order Doppler shifts (SODS) due to the vacuum energy (vSODS), squeezing (sqSODS) and quantum corrections to the dynamics (qSODS) arise. We also demonstrate that the entanglement between motion and clock evolution can become observable in state-of-the-art clocks when the motion of the atoms is strongly squeezed, realizing proper time interferometry. Our results show that experiments with trapped ion clocks are within reach to probe relativistic evolution of clocks for which a quantum description of proper time becomes necessary.</description>

      <title>Trispectrum in Extended USR Model with Transition to SR</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.09608</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.09608v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the trispectrum in a two-phase USR-SR setup of inflation in which the USR stage is extended in the initial phase of inflation while the second stage of inflation proceeds via a slow-roll phase. A key role is played by the sharpness parameter which controls how quickly the system reaches the final attractor phase after the USR stage. We employ both $\delta N$ and in-in formalisms and calculate trispectrum and the corresponding dimensionless parameters $g_{NL}$ and $\tau_{NL}$. We show that both approaches yield the same results and study the shapes of trispectrum in various configurations. It is shown that the maximum value of trispectrum occurs in the setup with an infinitely sharp transition to the attractor phase while much of trispectrum is washed out in the opposite limit of a mild transition.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2509.09632v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Noise subtraction is a crucial process in gravitational wave (GW) data analysis to improve the sensitivity of interferometric detectors. While linear noise coupling has been extensively studied and successfully mitigated using methods such as Wiener filtering, subtraction of non-linearly coupled and non-stationary noise remains a significant challenge. In this work, we propose a novel independent component analysis (ICA)-based framework designed to address non-linear coupling in noise subtraction. Building upon previous developments, we derive a method to estimate general quadratic noise coupling while maintaining computational transparency compared to machine learning approaches. The proposed method is tested with simulated data and real GW strain data from KAGRA. Our results demonstrate the potential of this framework to effectively mitigate complex noise structures, providing a promising avenue for improving the sensitivity of GW detectors.</description>

      <title>Reconstructing the origin of black hole mergers using sparse astrophysical models</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.09647v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The astrophysical origin of binary black hole mergers discovered by LIGO and Virgo remains uncertain. Efforts to reconstruct the processes that lead to mergers typically rely on either astrophysical models with fixed parameters, or continuous analytical models that can be fit to observations. Given the complexity of astrophysical formation mechanisms, these methods typically cannot fully take into account model uncertainties, nor can they fully capture the underlying processes. Here, we present a merger population analysis that can take a discrete set of simulated model distributions as its input to interpret observations. The analysis can take into account multiple formation scenarios as fractional contributors to the total set of observations, and can naturally account for model uncertainties. We apply this technique to investigate the origin of black hole mergers observed by LIGO Virgo. Specifically, we consider a model of AGN assisted black hole merger distributions, exploring a range of AGN parameters along with several {{SEVN}} population synthesis models that vary in common envelope efficiency parameter ($\alpha$) and metallicity ($Z$). We estimate the posterior distributions for AGN+SEVN models using $87$ BBH detections from the $O1--O3$ observation runs. The inferred total merger rate is $46.2 {Gpc}^{-3} {yr}^{-1}$, with the AGN sub-population contributing $21.2{Gpc}^{-3}{yr}^{-1}$ and the SEVN sub-population contributing $25.0 {Gpc}^{-3} {yr}^{-1}$.</description>

Abstract: In this work, we explore the intriguing phenomenon of acceleration radiation exhibited by an atom falling into a black hole, as previously studied in Phys. Rev. Lett. 121, 071301 (2018) . Our investigation focuses on examining the impact of Lorentz violation within the framework of the bumblebee gravity model on this phenomenon. We observe that the excitation probability although acquires Planck-like factor the exponential part of it acquires the Lorentz violation factor dependent frequency. However, equivalence principle is not violated. Then we calculate the horizon brightened acceleration radiation (HBAR) entropy for this black hole geometry. We observed that the HBAR entropy has the form similar to that of Bekenstein-Hawking black hole entropy however it has been observed that it is also influenced by Lorentz violation associated to the Bumblebee theory. Additionally, we note that the Lorentz violation effect and conformal symmetry both affect the transition probabilities of a two-level atomic detector.</description>

      <title>From Geometry to Observation: Gravitational Waves and the Raychaudhuri Equation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.09562</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.09562v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Gravitational waves (GWs) are independent of any particular theory of gravity. The universality of this notion is highlighted by the Raychaudhuri equation (RE), which is independent of any theory of gravity and contains the Ricci tensor $R_{\mu\nu}$ as a key ingredient, thereby connecting spacetime geometry with matter-energy content. Under small metric perturbations, $R_{\mu\nu} \propto \Box h_{\mu\nu}$, where $h_{\mu\nu}$ is the perturbation, indicating that various gravity theories, via their corresponding $R_{\mu\nu}$, produce different gravitational wave equations. In the framework of Einstein's gravity, this leads to the standard wave equation. This study analyzes a modified form, {\it GW-inspired RE}, within the homogeneous and isotropic FLRW background to investigate late-time cosmic acceleration and structure formation. We employ {\it Pantheon+ SNe Ia, Hubble, and BAO} datasets to constrain model parameters through Bayesian inference utilizing NUTS in {\it NumPyro}. A nuisance parameter $\mu_0$ is introduced to address residual systematics. This facilitates a robust estimation of $H_0$, $\Omega_{DE,0}$, and $r_d$, which addresses the resolution of the Hubble tension. We analyze the redshift evolution of the deceleration parameter, $q(z)$, both with and without $\mu_0$, emphasizing its influence on cosmic dynamics. The GW-inspired RE is reformulated as a harmonic oscillator, providing insight into expansion and geodesic focusing. A graphical comparison demonstrates the relationship $d^{GW}_L(z) = d^{EM}_L(z)$ utilizing GWOSC data. Thus, the RE in the context of small perturbation of the metric opens up whole new vistas of {\it observational astronomy.}</description>

      <description>arXiv:2505.06103v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we present an innovative approach to resolving type IV singularities in fermionic quantum cosmology. The Eisenhart-Duval lift procedure is employed to construct an extended minisuperspace metric, which allows for the formulation of the Dirac equation in minisuperspace. Through this approach, fermionic degrees of freedom are effectively incorporated into a homogeneous and isotropic cosmological model with a scalar field. By applying a kind of the Born-Oppenheimer approximation, solutions to the Dirac equation for an approximate potential characteristic of type IV singularities are obtained, expressed in terms of Tricomi confluent hypergeometric functions and associated Laguerre polynomials. The elimination of non-physical, divergent solutions results in a quantum regularization of the classical singularity. These results indicate the potential of fermionic models in quantum cosmology for mitigating the singularity problem.</description>

Abstract: The event horizon is a source of irreversibility, analogous to statistical irreversibility. This is why for systems with an event horizon there is no difference between quantum and thermal fluctuations. Quantum processes of quantum tunneling determine the thermodynamics of these systems, their temperatures, entropies and fluctuations. We considered three examples of entropy variance that support this point of view: (i) the variance of the area of the black hole horizon, obtained by consideration of quantum fluctuations; (ii) the variance of the entropy of the Hubble volume in the de Sitter state, obtained by consideration of thermal fluctuations; and (iii) the variance of entropy in integers in the Planckon model, determined by the Poisson distribution.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.15830v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this work, we approach certain black hole issues, including remnants, by providing a statistical description based on the weak gravity conjecture in the swampland program. Inspired by the Pauli exclusion principle in the context of the Fermi sphere, we derive an inequality which can be exploited to verify the instability manifestation of non-supersymmetric four dimensional black holes via a characteristic function. For several species, we show that this function is in agreement with the weak gravity swampland conjecture. Then, we deal with the cutoff issue as an interval estimation problem by putting an upper bound on the black hole mass scale matching with certain results reported in the literature. Using the developed formalism for the proposed instability scenarios, we provide a suppression mechanism to the remnant production rate. Furthermore, we reconsider the stability study of the Reissner-Nordstrom black holes. Among others, we show that the proposed instabilities prohibit naked singularity behaviors</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.06356v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The cosmic curvature $\Omega_{K}$ is an important parameter related to the inflationary cosmology and the ultimate fate of the universe. In this work, we adopt the non-CMB observations to constrain $\Omega_{K}$ in the $\Lambda$CDM model and its extensions. The DESI baryon acoustic oscillation, DES type Ia supernova, cosmic chronometer, and strong gravitational lensing time delay data are considered. We find that the data combination favors an open universe in the $\Lambda$CDM model, specifically $\Omega_{K}=0.108\pm0.056$ at the $1\sigma$ confidence level, which is in $2.6\sigma$ tension with the Planck CMB result supporting our universe being slightly closed. In the $\Lambda$CDM extensions, the data combination is consistent with a spatially flat universe. However, the central value of $\Omega_{K}$ is positive and has a significant deviation from zero. We adopt the Akaike information criterion to compare different cosmological models. The result shows that non-flat models fit the observational data better than the flat $\Lambda$CDM model, which adds evidence to the argument that flat $\Lambda$CDM is not the ultimate model of cosmology.</description>

      <title>Primordial Black Hole Formation from the Upward Step Model: Avoiding Overproduction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.19631</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.19631v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate the formation of primordial black holes (PBHs) in an upward step inflationary model, where nonlinearities between curvature perturbations and field fluctuations introduce a cutoff, deviating from the Gaussian case. This necessitates a reevaluation of PBH formation, as $\mathcal{R}$ is not the optimal variable for estimating abundance. Using the extended Press-Schechter formalism, we show that non-Gaussianity modifies both the curvature perturbation profile $\mathcal{R}(r)$ and the integration path in probability space, significantly impacting PBH abundance. Our results reveal that the abundance initially increases with the parameter $h$, which characterizes the relaxation stage after the step. However, beyond a critical value ($h \simeq 5.9$), it sharply declines before rising again. Furthermore, we demonstrate that non-Gaussianity introduces uncertainties in indirect PBH observations via gravitational waves. Notably, we present an example where a positive $f_{\rm NL}$ does not necessarily enhance PBH production, contrary to conventional expectations. Finally, by accounting for non-perturbative effects, we resolve the overproduction of PBHs suggested by pulsar timing array (PTA) data, underscoring the critical importance of incorporating non-Gaussianity in future studies.</description>

      <title>Probing new light scalars with the lepton anomalous magnetic moment and the weak equivalence principle violation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.13384</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.13384v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A new scalar particle with generic couplings to the standard-model particles is a possible source for the lepton anomalous magnetic moment and the violation of the weak equivalence principle. Here, one-loop contributions to the lepton anomalous magnetic moment, involving the scalar-photon and scalar-lepton couplings, are calculated. Then, employing the recent experimental results of the electron anomalous magnetic moment, the muon anomalous magnetic moment, and the MICROSCOPE mission, we find the improved constraints on scalar-lepton and scalar-photon couplings: $|\lambda_e|\leq 6.0 \times 10^{-6}$, $|\lambda_\mu|\leq 3.5\times 10^{-4}$, and $|\lambda_\gamma|\leq 4.5 \times 10^{-13}$ ${\rm eV^{-1}}$ for scalar mass below $10^4$ eV. We find that the naive scaling relationship between the scalar-muon coupling and the scalar-electron coupling is favored by three experimental results. Furthermore, the minimal standard-model extension by one scalar is also favored by all three experiments, and the model parameter is constrained best to $|\mathcal{A}|\leq 1.7 \times 10^{-11}$ eV for $m_{\phi}&lt; 10^{-13}$ eV.</description>

      <title>Isotropy, anisotropies and non-Gaussianity in the scalar-induced gravitational-wave background: diagrammatic approach for primordial non-Gaussianity up to arbitrary order</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.16820</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.16820v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Produced nonlinearly by the enhanced linear cosmological curvature perturbations, the scalar-induced gravitational waves (SIGWs) can serve as a potentially powerful probe of primordial non-Gaussianity (PNG) in the early Universe. In this work, we comprehensively investigate the imprints of local-type PNG on the SIGW background beyond the widely used quadratic and cubic approximations. We develop a diagrammatic approach capable of analyzing SIGWs for PNG up to arbitrary order. Following this approach, we derive semi-analytic formulas for the energy-density fraction spectrum, the angular power spectrum, and the angular bispectrum and trispectrum to describe the isotropic component, anisotropies, and non-Gaussianity of the SIGW background, respectively. Particularly, focusing on PNG up to quartic approximation (parameterized by $f_\mathrm{NL}$, $g_\mathrm{NL}$, and $h_\mathrm{NL}$), we numerically compute all contributions to these SIGW spectra. We find that PNG can significantly alter the magnitude of the SIGW energy-density spectrum, and can generate substantial anisotropies through the initial inhomogeneities in the SIGW distribution. Furthermore, we observe that the SIGW angular bispectrum and trispectrum always vanish when the primordial curvature perturbations are Gaussian; otherwise, they do not, indicating their potential utility as probes of PNG. Therefore, we anticipate that the SIGW background will provide essential information about the early Universe.</description>

      <title>Null Distance and Temporal Functions</title>

Abstract: The notion of null distance was introduced by Sormani and Vega as part of a broader program to develop a theory of metric convergence adapted to Lorentzian geometry. Given a time function $\tau$ on a spacetime $(M,g)$, the associated null distance $\hat{d}_\tau$ is constructed from and closely related to the causal structure of $M$. While generally only a semi-metric, $\hat{d}_\tau$ becomes a metric when $\tau$ satisfies the local anti-Lipschitz condition.
  In this work, we focus on temporal functions, that is, differentiable functions whose gradient is everywhere past-directed timelike. Sormani and Vega showed that the class of $C^1$ temporal functions coincides with that of $C^1$ locally anti-Lipschitz time functions. When a temporal function $f$ is smooth, its level sets $M_t = f^{-1}(t)$ are spacelike hypersurfaces and thus Riemannian manifolds endowed with the induced metric $h_t$. Our main result establishes that, on any level set $M_t$ where the gradient $\nabla f$ has constant norm, the null distance $\hat{d}_f$ is bounded above by a constant multiple of the Riemannian distance $d_{h_t}$.
  Applying this result to a smooth regular cosmological time function $\tau_g$ -- as introduced by Andersson, Galloway, and Howard -- we prove a theorem confirming a conjecture of Sakovich and Sormani (arXiv:2410.16800, 2025): if the diameters of the level sets $M_t = \tau_g^{-1}(t)$ shrink to zero as $t \to 0$, then the spacetime exhibits a Big Bang singularity, as defined in their work.</description>

      <title>Unification of Gravity and Standard Model: Weyl-Dirac-Born-Infeld action</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.10959</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.10959v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We construct a unified (quantum) description, by the gauge principle, of gravity and Standard Model (SM), that generalises the Dirac-Born-Infeld action to the SM and Weyl geometry, hereafter called Weyl-Dirac-Born-Infeld action (WDBI). The theory is formulated in $d =4-2\epsilon$ dimensions. The WDBI action is a general gauge theory of SM and Weyl group (of dilatations and Poincar\'e symmetry), in the Weyl gauge covariant (metric!) formulation of Weyl geometry. The theory is SM and Weyl gauge invariant in $d=4-2\epsilon$ dimensions and there is no Weyl anomaly. The WDBI action has the unique elegant feature, not present in other gauge theories or even in string theory, that it is mathematically well-defined in $d=4-2\epsilon$ dimensions with no need to introduce in the action a UV regulator scale or field. This action actually {\it predicts} that gravity, through (Weyl covariant) space-time curvature $\hat R$, acts as UV regulator of both SM and gravity in $d=4$. A series expansion of the WDBI action (in dimensionless couplings) recovers in the leading order a Weyl gauge invariant version of SM and the Weyl (gauge theory of) quadratic gravity. The SM and Einstein-Hilbert gravity are recovered in the Stueckelberg broken phase of Weyl gauge symmetry, which restores Riemannian geometry below Planck scale. Sub-leading orders are suppressed by powers of (dimensionless) gravitational coupling ($\xi$) of Weyl quadratic gravity.</description>

      <title>Towards high-precision inspiral gravitational waveforms from binary neutron star mergers in numerical relativity</title>

      <description>arXiv:2508.10981v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We report the performance of a newly implemented fourth-order accurate finite-volume HLLC Riemann solver in the adaptive-mesh-refinement numerical relativity code {\tt SACRA-MPI}. First, we validate our implementation in one-dimensional special relativistic hydrodynamics tests, i.e., a simple wave and shock tube test, which have analytic solutions. We demonstrate that the fourth-order convergence is achieved for the smooth flow, which cannot be achieved in our original second-order accurate finite-volume Riemann solver. We also show that our new solver is robust for the strong shock wave emergence problem. Second, we validate the implementation in a dynamical spacetime by demonstrating that {\tt SACRA-MPI} perfectly preserves the $\pi$-symmetry without imposing the $\pi$-symmetry in a short-term ($\sim 20~{\rm ms}$ in the inspiral and subsequent post-merger phase) non-spinning equal-mass binary neutron star merger simulations. Finally, we quantify the accuracy of $\approx 28$ cycles inspiral gravitational waveforms from binary neutron star mergers by conducting a resolution study with $\approx 78, 94$, $118$, and $135$ m. We find that the fourth-order accurate Riemann solver achieves the convergence order $\approx 2.1\pm{0.05}$--$2.4\pm{0.27}$, i.e., slightly evolving with time, in the inspiral gravitational wave phase, while the second-order accurate Riemann solver achieves the convergence order $\approx 2.0\pm{0.5}$. The residual phase error towards the continuum limit at the merger is $0.27\pm 0.07$ rad and $0.58\pm 0.22$ rad out of a total phase of $\approx 176$ rad, respectively, for the fourth- and second-order accurate Riemann solver.</description>

      <title>Analytic and Numerical Constraints on QPOs in EHT and XRB Sources Using Quantum-Corrected Black Holes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.08674</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.08674v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This investigation examines QPOs in two quantum-corrected BH spacetimes that preserve general covariance while incorporating quantum gravitational effects through a dimensionless parameter \zeta. We combine analytical derivations of epicyclic frequencies with comprehensive numerical simulations of BHL accretion to explore how quantum corrections manifest in observable astrophysical phenomena. Using a fiducial BH mass of M=10M_\odot representative of stellar-mass X-ray binaries, we demonstrate that the two models exhibit fundamentally different behaviors: Model-I modifies both temporal and radial metric components, leading to innermost stable circular orbit migration proportional to \zeta^4 and dramatic stagnation point evolution from 27M to 5M as quantum corrections strengthen. Model-II preserves the classical temporal component while altering only spatial geometry, maintaining constant stagnation points and stable cavity structures throughout the parameter range. Our numerical simulations reveal distinct QPO generation mechanisms, with Model-I showing systematic frequency evolution and cavity shrinkage that suppresses oscillations for \zeta \geq 3M, while Model-II maintains stable low-frequency modes up to \zeta \geq 5M. Power spectral density analyzes demonstrate characteristic frequency ratios (3:2, 2:1, 5:3) consistent with observations from X-ray binaries, providing specific targets for discriminating between quantum correction scenarios. The hydrodynamically derived constraints (\zeta \lesssim 4M) show remarkable agreement with independent EHT limits for M87* and Sgr A*, validating our theoretical framework through multiple observational channels. These results establish QPO frequency analysis as a probe for detecting quantum gravitational effects in astrophysical BHs and demonstrate the complementary nature of timing and imaging observations in constraining fundamental physics.</description>
