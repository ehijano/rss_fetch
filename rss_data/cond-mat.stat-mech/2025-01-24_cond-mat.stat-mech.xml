      <title>Imaging Topological Defect Dynamics Mediating 2D Skyrmion Lattice Melting</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.13151</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.13151v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Topological defects are the key feature mediating 2D phase transitions. However, both resolution and tunability have been lacking to access the dynamics of the transitions. With dynamic Kerr microscopy, we directly capture the melting of a confined 2D magnetic skyrmion lattice with high resolution in real-time and -space. Skyrmions in magnetic thin films are two-dimensional, topologically non-trivial quasi-particles that provide rich dynamics as well as unique tunability as an essential ingredient for controlling phase behavior: We tune the skyrmion size and effective temperature on the fly to drive the two-step melting through an intermediate hexatic regime between the solid lattice and the isotropic liquid. We quantify the characteristic occurrence of topological defects mediating the transitions and reveal the so-far inaccessible dynamics of the lattice dislocations. The full real-time and -space imaging reveals the diffusion coefficient of the dislocations, which we find to be orders of magnitudes higher than that of the skyrmions.</description>

      <title>Random Quantum Circuits with Time-Reversal Symmetry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.13161</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.13161v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Time-reversal (TR) symmetry is crucial for understanding a wide range of physical phenomena, and plays a key role in constraining fundamental particle interactions and in classifying phases of quantum matter. In this work, we introduce an ensemble of random quantum circuits that are representative of the dynamics of generic TR-invariant many-body quantum systems. We derive a general statistical mechanics model describing entanglement, many-body quantum chaos and quantum information dynamics in such TR-invariant circuits. As an example of application of our formalism, we study the universal properties of measurement-induced phase transitions (MIPT) in monitored TR-invariant systems, with measurements performed in a TR-invariant basis. We find that TR-invariance of the unitary part of the dynamics does not affect the universality class, unless measurement outcomes are post-selected to satisfy the global TR-invariance of each quantum trajectory. We confirm these predictions numerically, and find, for both generic and Clifford-based evolutions, novel critical exponents in the case of ``strong'', i.e. global TR-invariance where each quantum trajectory is TR-invariant.</description>

      <title>Quantum chaos at finite temperature in local spin Hamiltonians</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.13164</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.13164v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Understanding the emergence of chaos in many-body quantum systems away from semi-classical limits, particularly in spatially local interacting spin Hamiltonians, has been a long-standing problem. In these intrinsically quantum regimes, quantum chaos has been primarily understood through the correspondence between the eigensystem statistics of midspectrum eigenstates and the universal statistics described by random matrix theory (RMT). However, this correspondence no longer holds for finite-temperature eigenstates. Here we show that the statistical properties of finite-temperature eigenstates of quantum chaotic Hamiltonians can be accurately described by pure random states constrained by a local charge, with the average charge density of the constrained random state ensemble playing the same role as the average energy density of the eigenstates. By properly normalizing the energy density using a single Hamiltonian-dependent parameter that quantifies the typical energy per degree of freedom, we find excellent agreement between the entanglement entropy statistics of eigenstates and that of constrained random states. Interestingly, in small pockets of Hamiltonian parameter phase space which we previously identified as `maximally chaotic' [PRX 14, 031014 (2024)], we find excellent agreement not only at the level of the first moment, including O(1) corrections, but also at the level of statistical fluctuations. These results show that notions of maximal chaos -- in terms of how much randomness eigenstates contain -- can still be defined at finite temperature in physical Hamiltonian models away from semi-classical and large-$N$ limits.</description>

      <title>Topological constraints on self-organisation in locally interacting systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.13188</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.13188v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: All intelligence is collective intelligence, in the sense that it is made of parts which must align with respect to system-level goals. Understanding the dynamics which facilitate or limit navigation of problem spaces by aligned parts thus impacts many fields ranging across life sciences and engineering. To that end, consider a system on the vertices of a planar graph, with pairwise interactions prescribed by the edges of the graph. Such systems can sometimes exhibit long-range order, distinguishing one phase of macroscopic behaviour from another. In networks of interacting systems we may view spontaneous ordering as a form of self-organisation, modelling neural and basal forms of cognition. Here, we discuss necessary conditions on the topology of the graph for an ordered phase to exist, with an eye towards finding constraints on the ability of a system with local interactions to maintain an ordered target state. By studying the scaling of free energy under the formation of domain walls in three model systems -- the Potts model, autoregressive models, and hierarchical networks -- we show how the combinatorics of interactions on a graph prevent or allow spontaneous ordering. As an application we are able to analyse why multiscale systems like those prevalent in biology are capable of organising into complex patterns, whereas rudimentary language models are challenged by long sequences of outputs.</description>

      <title>Experimental Realizations of Information Engines: Beyond Proof of Concept</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.13593</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.13593v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Gathering information about a system enables greater control over it. This principle lies at the core of information engines, which use measurement-based feedback to rectify thermal noise and convert information into work. Originating from Maxwell's and Szil\'ard's thought experiments, the thermodynamics of information engines has steadily advanced, with recent experimental realizations both confirming established results and pushing the field forward. Coupled with technological advances and developments in nonequilibrium thermodynamics, novel implementations of information engines continue to challenge theoretical understanding. In this perspective, we discuss recent progress and highlight new opportunities, such as applying information engines to active, many-body, and inertial systems, and leveraging tools like optimal control to design their driving protocols.</description>

      <title>Large Deviations in Switching Diffusion: from Free Cumulants to Dynamical Transitions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.13754</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.13754v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the diffusion of a particle with a time-dependent diffusion constant $D(t)$ that switches between random values drawn from a distribution $W(D)$ at a fixed rate $r$. Using a renewal approach, we compute exactly the moments of the position of the particle $\langle x^{2n}(t) \rangle$ at any finite time $t$, and for any $W(D)$ with finite moments $\langle D^n \rangle$. For $t \gg 1$, we demonstrate that the cumulants $\langle x^{2n}(t) \rangle_c$ grow linearly with $t$ and are proportional to the free cumulants of a random variable distributed according to $W(D)$. For specific forms of $W(D)$, we compute the large deviations of the position of the particle, uncovering rich behaviors and dynamical transitions of the rate function $I(y=x/t)$. Our analytical predictions are validated numerically with high precision, achieving accuracy up to $10^{-2000}$.</description>

      <title>Approach to nonequilibrium: from anomalous to Brownian diffusion via non-Gaussianity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.13875</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.13875v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent progress in experimental techniques such as single particle tracking allows to analyze both nonequilibrium properties and approach to equilibrium. There are examples showing that processes occurring at finite timescales are distinctly different than their equilibrium counterparts. In this work we analyze a similar problem of approach to nonequilibrium. We consider an archetypal model of nonequilibrium system consisting of a Brownian particle dwelling in a spatially periodic potential and driven by an external time-periodic force. We focus on a diffusion process and monitor its development in time. In the presented parameter regime the excess kurtosis measuring the Gaussianity of the particle displacement distribution evolves in a non-monotonic way: first it is negative (platykurtic form), next it becomes positive (leptokurtic form) and then decays to zero (mesokurtic form). Despite the latter fact diffusion in the long time limit is Brownian, yet non-Gaussian. Moreover, we discover a correlation between non-Gaussianity of the particle displacement distribution and transient anomalous diffusion behavior emerging for finite timescales.</description>

      <title>Using Principal Component Analysis to Distinguish Different Dynamic Phases in Superconducting Vortex Matter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.13269</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.13269v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Vortices in type-II superconductors driven over random disorder are known to exhibit a remarkable variety of distinct nonequilibrium dynamical phases that arise due to the competition between vortex-vortex interactions, the quenched disorder, and the drive. These include pinned states, elastic flows, plastic or disordered flows, and dynamically reordered moving crystal or moving smectic states. The plastic flow phases can be particularly difficult to characterize since the flows are strongly disordered. Here we perform principal component analysis (PCA) on the positions and velocities of vortex matter moving over random disorder for different disorder strengths and drives. We find that PCA can distinguish the known dynamic phases as well as or better than previous measures based on transport signatures or topological defect densities. In addition, PCA recognizes distinct plastic flow regimes, a slowly changing channel flow and a moving amorphous fluid flow, that do not produce distinct signatures in the standard measurements. Our results suggest that this position and velocity based PCA approach could be used to characterize dynamic phases in a broader class of systems that exhibit depinning and nonequilibrium phase transitions.</description>

      <title>Critical evaluations of different implementations of Edwards volume ensemble</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.13455</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.13455v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Granular systems can display reproducible microscopic distributions governed by a few macroscopic parameters, parallel to equilibrium statistical mechanics. Building on this analogy, Edwards' s pioneering framework proposes a volume ensemble of equiprobable jammed states, introducing compactivity chi as an effective temperature. Despite its promise, debates persist regarding the framework' s formulation and validity, with practical implementation often exposing inconsistencies. This study systematically examines different implementations using experimental data from spherical particle packings with varying friction coefficients, subjected to tapping and shearing. Our findings show that the heat capacity and overlapping histogram methods yield consistent Chi values. Discrepancies in other approaches, such as the free volume model, primarily stem from differing reference-state compactivities and microstate definitions, whereas the mean-field theory, which effectively accounts for mechanical stability within a geometric coordination-number phase space, is constrained by its isostatic assumption and inherent approximations. Additionally, an effective temperature Chi_f defined on Delaunay tetrahedra better describes topological excitations, but represents a quasi-equilibrium state, with true equilibrium achieved only under Chi. This study refines and expands our understanding of the Edwards volume ensemble in line with Edwards' s original ideas, highlighting the combined contributions of friction and inherently disordered packing structures.</description>

      <title>Symmetry Breaking Dynamics in Quantum Many-Body Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.13459</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.13459v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Entanglement asymmetry has emerged as a novel tool for characterizing symmetry breaking in quantum many-body systems. In this Letter, we investigate how symmetry is dynamically broken through the lens of entanglement asymmetry in two distinct scenarios: a non-symmetric random quantum circuit and a non-symmetric Hamiltonian quench, with a particular focus on U(1) symmetry. In the former case, the symmetry is first broken and then restored while in the latter case, symmetry remains broken in the subsystem at late times, aligning with the concept of quantum thermalization. Entanglement asymmetry growth exhibits unexpected overshooting behavior at early times in both contexts. We also consider dynamics of non-symmetric initial states under the symmetry-breaking evolution. Due to the competition of symmetry-breaking in both the initial state and Hamiltonian, the early-time entanglement asymmetry displays two qualitatively different behaviors. Furthermore, quantum Mpemba effects remain evident despite the presence of weak symmetry-breaking in both settings.</description>

      <title>Transfer matrix approach to quantum systems subject to certain Lindblad evolution</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.13560</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.13560v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Solving for time evolution of a many particle system whose dynamics is governed by Lindblad equation is hard. We extend the use of transfer matrix approach to a class of Linblad equations that admit a closed hierarchy of two point correlators. An example that we treat is the XX spin chain, i.e., free fermions, subject to the local on-site dephasing, but can be extended to other Hermitian dissipators, e.g., non-local dephasing. We find a simple expression of the Green's function in the Laplace domain. The method can be used to get analytical results in the thermodynamic limit, for instance, to get the evolution of magnetization density and to explicitly see the cross over between the ballistic and diffusive behavior, or to show that the correlations between operators at distance $l$ decay with time as $1/t^{\lceil l/2 \rceil+1/2}$. It also provides a fast numerical method to determine the evolution of the density with a complexity scaling with the system size more favorably than in previous methods, easily allowing one to study systems with $\sim 10^6$ spins.</description>

      <title>Physics of droplet regulation in biological cells</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.13639</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.13639v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Droplet formation has emerged as an essential concept for the spatiotemporal organisation of biomolecules in cells. However, classical descriptions of droplet dynamics based on passive liquid-liquid phase separation cannot capture the complex situations inside cells. This review discusses three general aspects that are crucial in cells: (i) biomolecules are diverse and individually complex, implying that cellular droplets posses complex internal behaviour, e.g., in terms of their material properties; (ii) the cellular environment contains many solid-like structures that droplets can wet; (iii) cells are alive and use fuel to drive processes out of equilibrium. We illustrate how these principles control droplet nucleation, growth, position, and count to unveil possible regulatory mechanisms in biological cells and other applications of phase separation.</description>

      <title>Characterizing phase transitions and criticality in non-Hermitian extensions of the XY model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.13654</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.13654v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this work we study non-Hermitian extensions of the paradigmatic spin-1/2 XY chain in a magnetic field. Using the mapping of the model to free fermion form, we provide analytical insights into the energy spectrum of the non-Hermitian model and establish an intrinsic connection between the quasienergies and topological invariants. We also use exact diagonalization as a supplementary method to examine the performance of biorthogonal-based expectation values. Our results confirm that the theoretical analysis is consistent with the numerical results, with the extended phase diagram determined via the analytical solution and the critical behavior of the fidelity and entanglement. The entanglement transition goes hand in hand with the non-Hermitian topological phase transition. Like the Hermitian case, we analyze the critical behavior using finite-size scaling. Our results show that non-Hermiticity can induce the system into a new universality class with unusual critical exponent. We also emphasize the ability of the Loschmidt echo to characterize potential phase transitions and introduce the average of the Loschmidt echo to describe phase transitions in non-Hermitian systems.</description>

      <title>Exploring the interplay between small and large scales movements in a neotropical small mammal</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.13688</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.13688v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We record and analyze the movement patterns of the marsupial {\it Didelphis aurita} at different temporal scales. Animals trajectories are collected at a daily scale by using spool-and-line techniques, and with the help of radio-tracking devices animals traveled distances are estimated at intervals of weeks. Small-scale movements are well described by truncated L\'evy flight, while large-scale movements produce a distribution of distances which is compatible with a Brownian motion. A model of the movement behavior of these animals, based on a truncated L\'evy flight calibrated on the small scale data, converges towards a Brownian behavior after a short time interval of the order of one week. These results show that whether L\'evy flight or Brownian motion behaviors apply, will depend on the scale of aggregation of the animals paths. In this specific case, as the effect of the rude truncation present in the daily data generates a fast convergence towards Brownian behaviors, L\'evy flights become of scarce interest for describing the local dispersion properties of these animals, which result well approximated by a normal diffusion process and not a fast, anomalous one. Interestingly, we are able to describe two movement phases as the consequence of a statistical effect generated by aggregation, without the necessity of introducing ecological constraints or mechanisms operating at different spatio-temporal scales. This result is of general interest, as it can be a key element for describing movement phenomenology at distinct spatio-temporal scales across different taxa and in a variety of systems.</description>

      <title>Gauge-invariant electromagnetic responses in superconductors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.13722</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.13722v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Gauge invariance is of fundamental importance to make physically meaningful predictions. In superconductors, the use of mean-field Hamiltonians that lack $U(1)$ symmetry often leads to gauge-dependent results. While solutions to this problem for the linear response of conventional superconductors have been well-known, a unified understanding for unconventional superconductors or nonlinear responses has not been established. This study provides the full detail of the general theoretical framework that allows us to compute responses at arbitrary orders in external fields in a gauge-invariant manner for both conventional and unconventional superconductors. Our construction generalizes the consistent fluctuations of order parameters method for full photon vertices and has a pictorial illustration using Feynman diagrams of the response kernel.</description>

      <title>Exponentially slow thermalization in 1D fragmented dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.13930</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.13930v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the thermalization dynamics of 1D systems with local constraints coupled to an infinite temperature bath at one boundary. The coupling to the bath eventually erases the effects of the constraints, causing the system to tend towards a maximally mixed state at long times. We show that for a large class of local constraints, the time at which thermalization occurs can be extremely long. In particular, we present evidence for the following conjecture: when the constrained dynamics displays strong Hilbert space fragmentation, the thermalization time diverges exponentially with system size. We show that this conjecture holds for a wide range of dynamical constraints, including dipole-conserving dynamics, the $tJ_z$ model, and a large class of group-based dynamics, and relate a general proof of our conjecture to a different conjecture about the existence of certain expander graphs.</description>

      <title>The boundary disorder correlation for the Ising model on a cylinder</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.03100</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.03100v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: I give an expression for the correlation function of disorder insertions on the edges of the critical Ising model on a cylinder as a function of the aspect ratio (rescaled in the case of anisotropic couplings). This is obtained from an expression for the finite size scaling term in the free energy on a cylinder in periodic and antiperiodic boundary conditions in terms of Jacobi theta functions.</description>

      <title>Thermal lifetime of breathers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.06044</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.06044v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this article, we explore the lifetime of localized excitations in nonlinear lattices, called breathers, when a thermalized lattice is perturbed with localized energy delivered to a single site. We develop a method to measure the time it takes for the system to approach equilibrium based on a single scalar quantity, the participation number, and deduce the value corresponding to thermal equilibrium. We observe the time to achieve thermalization as a function of the energy of the excited site. We explore a variety of different physical system models. The result is that the lifetime of breathers increases exponentially with the breather energy for all the systems. This increase becomes observable when this energy is larger than approximately ten times the local average thermal energy. These results may provide a method to detect the existence of breathers in real systems.</description>

      <title>Quantum thermoelectric transmission functions with minimal current fluctuations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2106.10205</link>
      <description>arXiv:2106.10205v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Thermodynamic uncertainty relations (TURs) represent a benchmark result in nonequilibrium physics that allows to place fundamental lower bounds on the noise-to-signal ratio (precision) of currents in nanoscale devices. Originally formulated for classical time-homogeneous Markov processes, these relations, were shown to be violated in thermoelectric engines and photovoltaic devices supporting quantum-coherent transport. However, the extent to which these violations may occur still represents a missing piece of the puzzle. In this work, we provide such answer in a definitive way within the general Landauer-B\"uttiker formalism for noninteracting systems, beyond any perturbative regime, e.g., linear response. In particular, using analytical constrained-optimization techniques, we rigorously demonstrate that the transmission function which maximizes the reliability of thermoelectric devices (i.e., which minimizes the fluctuations of its steady-state currents) for fixed average power and efficiency is a collection of boxcar functions. This allows us to show that TURs can be violated by arbitrarily large amounts, depending on the temperature and chemical potential gradients, thus providing guidelines to the design of optimal devices.</description>

      <title>Stochastic dynamics of granular hopper flows: a configurational mode controls the stability of clogs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.01194</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.01194v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Granular flows in small-outlet hoppers exhibit several characteristic but poorly understood behaviors: temporary clogs (pauses) where flow stops before later spontaneously restarting, permanent clogs that last indefinitely, and non-Gaussian, non-monotonic flow-rate statistics. These aspects have been studied independently, but a model of hopper flow that includes all three has not been formulated. Here, we introduce a phenomenological model that provides a unifying dynamical explanation of all three behaviors: coupling between the flow rate and a hidden mode that controls the stability of clogs. In the theory, flow rate evolves according to Langevin dynamics with multiplicative noise and an absorbing state at zero flow, conditional on the hidden mode. The model fully reproduces the statistics of pause and clog events of a large ($&gt;40,000$ flows) experimental dataset, including non-exponentially distributed clogging times and non-Gaussian flow rate distribution, and explains the stretched-exponential growth of the average clogging time with outlet size. Further, we identify the physical nature of the hidden mode in microscopic configurational features, including size and smoothness of the static arch structure formed during pauses and clogs. Our work provides a unifying framework for several poorly understood clogging phenomena, and suggests numerous new paths toward further understanding of this complex system.</description>

      <title>Multifractality of many-body non-Hermitian skin effect</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.08304</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.08304v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The non-Hermitian skin effect, anomalous localization of an extensive number of eigenstates induced by nonreciprocal dissipation, plays a pivotal role in non-Hermitian topology and significantly influences the open quantum dynamics. However, its genuinely quantum characterization in many-body systems has yet to be developed. Here, we elucidate that the skin effect manifests itself as multifractality in the many-body Hilbert space. This multifractality does not accompany the single-particle skin effect and hence is intrinsic to the many-body skin effect. Furthermore, we demonstrate that the many-body skin effect coexists with spectral statistics of random matrices, in contrast to multifractality associated with the many-body localization, which necessitates the absence of ergodicity. We also illustrate multifractality caused by the Liouvillian skin effect in Markovian open quantum systems. Our work establishes a defining characterization of the non-Hermitian skin effect and uncovers a fundamental relationship between multifractality and ergodicity in open quantum many-body systems.</description>

      <title>Forecasting long-time dynamics in quantum many-body systems by dynamic mode decomposition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.19947</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.19947v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Reliable numerical computation of quantum dynamics is a fundamental challenge when the long-ranged quantum entanglement plays essential roles as in the cases governed by quantum criticality in strongly correlated systems. Here we apply a method that utilizes reliable short-time data of physical quantities to accurately forecast long-time behavior of the strongly entangled systems. We straightforwardly employ the simple dynamic mode decomposition (DMD), which is commonly used in fluid dynamics. Despite the simplicity of the method, the effectiveness and applicability of the DMD in quantum many-body systems such as the Ising model in the transverse field at the critical point are demonstrated, even when the time evolution at long time exhibits complicated features such as a volume-law entanglement entropy and consequential power-law decays of correlations characteristic of systems with long-ranged quantum entanglements unlike fluid dynamics. The present method, though simple, enables accurate forecasts amazingly at time as long as nearly an order of magnitude longer than that of the short-time training data. Effects of noise on the accuracy of the forecast are also investigated, because they are important especially when dealing with the experimental data. We find that a few percentages of noise do not affect the prediction accuracy destructively.</description>

      <title>Krylov Subspace Methods for Quantum Dynamics with Time-Dependent Generators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.08383</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.08383v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Krylov subspace methods in quantum dynamics identify the minimal subspace in which a process unfolds. To date, their use is restricted to time evolutions governed by time-independent generators. We introduce a generalization valid for driven quantum systems governed by a time-dependent Hamiltonian that maps the evolution to a diffusion problem in a one-dimensional lattice with nearest-neighbor hopping probabilities that are inhomogeneous and time dependent. This representation is used to establish a novel class of fundamental limits to the quantum speed of evolution and operator growth. We also discuss generalizations of the algorithm, adapted to discretized time evolutions and periodic Hamiltonians, with applications to many-body systems.</description>
