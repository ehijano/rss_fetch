      <title>Molecular HDD Logic for Encrypted Massive Data Storage</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.04314</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.04314v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Organic memories, with small dimension, fast speed and long retention features, are considered as promising candidates for massive data archiving. In order to satisfy the re-quirements for ultra-low power and high-security information storage, we design a concep-tual molecular hard-disk (HDD) logic scheme that is capable to execute in-situ encryption of massive data in pW/bit power-consumption range. Beneficial from the coupled mechanism of counter-balanced redox reaction and local ion drifting, the basic HDD unit consisting of ~ 200 self-assembled RuXLPH molecules in a monolayer (SAM) configuration undergoes unique conductance modulation with continuous, symmetric and low-power switching char-acteristics. 96-state memory performance, which allows 6-bit data storage and single-unit one-step XOR operation, is realized in the RuXLPH SAM sample. Through single-unit XOR manipulation of the pixel information, in-situ bitwise encryption of the Mogao Grottoes mural images stored in the molecular HDD is demonstrated.</description>

      <title>VerifBFL: Leveraging zk-SNARKs for A Verifiable Blockchained Federated Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.04319</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.04319v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Blockchain-based Federated Learning (FL) is an emerging decentralized machine learning paradigm that enables model training without relying on a central server. Although some BFL frameworks are considered privacy-preserving, they are still vulnerable to various attacks, including inference and model poisoning. Additionally, most of these solutions employ strong trust assumptions among all participating entities or introduce incentive mechanisms to encourage collaboration, making them susceptible to multiple security flaws. This work presents VerifBFL, a trustless, privacy-preserving, and verifiable federated learning framework that integrates blockchain technology and cryptographic protocols. By employing zero-knowledge Succinct Non-Interactive Argument of Knowledge (zk-SNARKs) and incrementally verifiable computation (IVC), VerifBFL ensures the verifiability of both local training and aggregation processes. The proofs of training and aggregation are verified on-chain, guaranteeing the integrity and auditability of each participant's contributions. To protect training data from inference attacks, VerifBFL leverages differential privacy. Finally, to demonstrate the efficiency of the proposed protocols, we built a proof of concept using emerging tools. The results show that generating proofs for local training and aggregation in VerifBFL takes less than 81s and 2s, respectively, while verifying them on-chain takes less than 0.6s.</description>

      <title>AutoDFL: A Scalable and Automated Reputation-Aware Decentralized Federated Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.04331</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.04331v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Blockchained federated learning (BFL) combines the concepts of federated learning and blockchain technology to enhance privacy, security, and transparency in collaborative machine learning models. However, implementing BFL frameworks poses challenges in terms of scalability and cost-effectiveness. Reputation-aware BFL poses even more challenges, as blockchain validators are tasked with processing federated learning transactions along with the transactions that evaluate FL tasks and aggregate reputations. This leads to faster blockchain congestion and performance degradation. To improve BFL efficiency while increasing scalability and reducing on-chain reputation management costs, this paper proposes AutoDFL, a scalable and automated reputation-aware decentralized federated learning framework. AutoDFL leverages zk-Rollups as a Layer-2 scaling solution to boost the performance while maintaining the same level of security as the underlying Layer-1 blockchain. Moreover, AutoDFL introduces an automated and fair reputation model designed to incentivize federated learning actors. We develop a proof of concept for our framework for an accurate evaluation. Tested with various custom workloads, AutoDFL reaches an average throughput of over 3000 TPS with a gas reduction of up to 20X.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.04437</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.04437v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITS) are crucial for the development and operation of smart cities, addressing key challenges in efficiency, productivity, and environmental sustainability. This paper comprehensively reviews the transformative potential of Large Language Models (LLMs) in optimizing ITS. Initially, we provide an extensive overview of ITS, highlighting its components, operational principles, and overall effectiveness. We then delve into the theoretical background of various LLM techniques, such as GPT, T5, CTRL, and BERT, elucidating their relevance to ITS applications. Following this, we examine the wide-ranging applications of LLMs within ITS, including traffic flow prediction, vehicle detection and classification, autonomous driving, traffic sign recognition, and pedestrian detection. Our analysis reveals how these advanced models can significantly enhance traffic management and safety. Finally, we explore the challenges and limitations LLMs face in ITS, such as data availability, computational constraints, and ethical considerations. We also present several future research directions and potential innovations to address these challenges. This paper aims to guide researchers and practitioners through the complexities and opportunities of integrating LLMs in ITS, offering a roadmap to create more efficient, sustainable, and responsive next-generation transportation systems.</description>

      <title>Demystification and Near-perfect Estimation of Minimum Gas Limit and Gas Used for Ethereum Smart Contracts</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.04483</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.04483v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Ethereum blockchain has a \emph{gas system} that associates operations with a cost in gas units. Two central concepts of this system are the \emph{gas limit} assigned by the issuer of a transaction and the \emph{gas used} by a transaction. The former is a budget that must not be exhausted before the completion of the transaction execution; otherwise, the execution fails. Therefore, it seems rather essential to determine the \emph{minimum gas limit} that ensures the execution of a transaction will not abort due to the lack of gas. Despite its practical relevance, this concept has not been properly addressed. In the literature, gas used and minimum gas limit are conflated. This paper proposes a precise notion of minimum gas limit and how it can differ from gas used by a transaction; this is also demonstrated with a quantitative study on real transactions of the Ethereum blockchain. Another significant contribution is the proposition of a fairly precise estimator for each of the two metrics. Again, the confusion between these concepts has led to the creation of estimators only for the gas used by a transaction. We demonstrate that the minimum gas limit for the state of the Ethereum blockchain (after the block) $t$ can serve as a near-perfect estimation for the execution of the transaction at block $t + \Delta$, where $\Delta \leq 11$; the same holds for estimating gas used. These precise estimators can be very valuable in helping the users predict the gas budget of transactions and developers in optimising their smart contracts; over and underestimating gas used and minimum gas limit can lead to a number of practical issues. Overall, this paper serves as an important reference for blockchain developers and users as to how the gas system really works.</description>

      <title>LENS-XAI: Redefining Lightweight and Explainable Network Security through Knowledge Distillation and Variational Autoencoders for Scalable Intrusion Detection in Cybersecurity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.00790</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.00790v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The rapid proliferation of Industrial Internet of Things (IIoT) systems necessitates advanced, interpretable, and scalable intrusion detection systems (IDS) to combat emerging cyber threats. Traditional IDS face challenges such as high computational demands, limited explainability, and inflexibility against evolving attack patterns. To address these limitations, this study introduces the Lightweight Explainable Network Security framework (LENS-XAI), which combines robust intrusion detection with enhanced interpretability and scalability. LENS-XAI integrates knowledge distillation, variational autoencoder models, and attribution-based explainability techniques to achieve high detection accuracy and transparency in decision-making. By leveraging a training set comprising 10% of the available data, the framework optimizes computational efficiency without sacrificing performance. Experimental evaluation on four benchmark datasets: Edge-IIoTset, UKM-IDS20, CTU-13, and NSL-KDD, demonstrates the framework's superior performance, achieving detection accuracies of 95.34%, 99.92%, 98.42%, and 99.34%, respectively. Additionally, the framework excels in reducing false positives and adapting to complex attack scenarios, outperforming existing state-of-the-art methods. Key strengths of LENS-XAI include its lightweight design, suitable for resource-constrained environments, and its scalability across diverse IIoT and cybersecurity contexts. Moreover, the explainability module enhances trust and transparency, critical for practical deployment in dynamic and sensitive applications. This research contributes significantly to advancing IDS by addressing computational efficiency, feature interpretability, and real-world applicability. Future work could focus on extending the framework to ensemble AI systems for distributed environments, further enhancing its robustness and adaptability.</description>

      <title>Bridging Simplicity and Sophistication using GLinear: A Novel Architecture for Enhanced Time Series Prediction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.01087</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.01087v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Time Series Forecasting (TSF) is an important application across many fields. There is a debate about whether Transformers, despite being good at understanding long sequences, struggle with preserving temporal relationships in time series data. Recent research suggests that simpler linear models might outperform or at least provide competitive performance compared to complex Transformer-based models for TSF tasks. In this paper, we propose a novel data-efficient architecture, GLinear, for multivariate TSF that exploits periodic patterns to provide better accuracy. It also provides better prediction accuracy by using a smaller amount of historical data compared to other state-of-the-art linear predictors. Four different datasets (ETTh1, Electricity, Traffic, and Weather) are used to evaluate the performance of the proposed predictor. A performance comparison with state-of-the-art linear architectures (such as NLinear, DLinear, and RLinear) and transformer-based time series predictor (Autoformer) shows that the GLinear, despite being parametrically efficient, significantly outperforms the existing architectures in most cases of multivariate TSF. We hope that the proposed GLinear opens new fronts of research and development of simpler and more sophisticated architectures for data and computationally efficient time-series analysis.</description>
