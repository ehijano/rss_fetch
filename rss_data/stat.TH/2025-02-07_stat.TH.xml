      <title>On the limits of some Bayesian model evaluation statistics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.03846</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.03846v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Model selection and order selection problems frequently arise in statistical practice. A popular approach to addressing these problems in the frequentist setting involves information criteria based on penalized maxima of log-likelihoods for competing models. In the Bayesian context, similar criteria are employed, replacing the maxima of log-likelihoods with their posterior expectations. Despite their popularity in applications, the large-sample behavior of these criteria -- such as the deviance information criterion (DIC), Bayesian predictive information criterion (BPIC), and widely-applicable Bayesian information criterion (WBIC) -- has received relatively little attention. In this work, we investigate the almost sure limits of these criteria and establish novel results on posterior and generalized posterior consistency, which are of independent interest. The utility of our theoretical findings is demonstrated via illustrative technical and numerical examples.</description>

      <title>Consistent model selection in a collection of stochastic block models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.03848</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.03848v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce the penalized Krichevsky-Trofimov (KT) estimator as a convergent method for estimating the number of nodes clusters when observing multiple networks within both multi-layer and dynamic Stochastic Block Models. We establish the consistency of the KT estimator, showing that it converges to the correct number of clusters in both types of models when the number of nodes in the networks increases. Our estimator does not require a known upper bound on this number to be consistent. Furthermore, we show that these consistency results hold in both dense and sparse regimes, making the penalized KT estimator robust across various network configurations. We illustrate its performance on synthetic datasets.</description>

      <title>A fast algorithm to compute a curve of confidence upper bounds for the False Discovery Proportion using a reference family with a forest structure</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.03849</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.03849v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper presents a new algorithm (and an additional trick) that allows to compute fastly an entire curve of post hoc bounds for the False Discovery Proportion when the underlying bound $V^*_{\mathfrak{R}}$ construction is based on a reference family $\mathfrak{R}$ with a forest structure {\`a} la Durand et al. (2020). By an entire curve, we mean the values $V^*_{\mathfrak{R}}(S_1),\dotsc,V^*_{\mathfrak{R}}(S_m)$ computed on a path of increasing selection sets $S_1\subsetneq\dotsb\subsetneq S_m$, $|S_t|=t$. The new algorithm leverages the fact that going from $S_t$ to $S_{t+1}$ is done by adding only one hypothesis.</description>

      <title>Maximum Likelihood Estimation of the Parameters of Matrix Variate Symmetric Laplace Distribution</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.04118</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.04118v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper considers an extension of the multivariate symmetric Laplace distribution to matrix variate case. The symmetric Laplace distribution is a scale mixture of normal distribution. The maximum likelihood estimators (MLE) of the parameters of multivariate and matrix variate symmetric Laplace distribution are proposed, which are not explicitly obtainable, as the density function involves the modified Bessel function of the third kind. Thus, the EM algorithm is applied to find the maximum likelihood estimators. The parameters and their maximum likelihood estimators of matrix variate symmetric Laplace distribution are defined up to a positive multiplicative constant with their Kronecker product uniquely defined. The condition for the existence of the MLE is given, and the stability of the estimators is discussed. The empirical bias and the dispersion of the Kronecker product of the estimators for different sample sizes are discussed using simulated data.</description>

      <title>Cyclic functional causal models beyond unique solvability with a graph separation theorem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.04171</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.04171v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Functional causal models (fCMs) specify functional dependencies between random variables associated to the vertices of a graph. In directed acyclic graphs (DAGs), fCMs are well-understood: a unique probability distribution on the random variables can be easily specified, and a crucial graph-separation result called the d-separation theorem allows one to characterize conditional independences between the variables. However, fCMs on cyclic graphs pose challenges due to the absence of a systematic way to assign a unique probability distribution to the fCM's variables, the failure of the d-separation theorem, and lack of a generalization of this theorem that is applicable to all consistent cyclic fCMs. In this work, we develop a causal modeling framework applicable to all cyclic fCMs involving finite-cardinality variables, except inconsistent ones admitting no solutions. Our probability rule assigns a unique distribution even to non-uniquely solvable cyclic fCMs and reduces to the known rule for uniquely solvable fCMs. We identify a class of fCMs, called averagely uniquely solvable, that we show to be the largest class where the probabilities admit a Markov factorization. Furthermore, we introduce a new graph-separation property, p-separation, and prove this to be sound and complete for all consistent finite-cardinality cyclic fCMs while recovering the d-separation theorem for DAGs. These results are obtained by considering classical post-selected teleportation protocols inspired by analogous protocols in quantum information theory. We discuss further avenues for exploration, linking in particular problems in cyclic fCMs and in quantum causality.</description>

      <title>Supermartingales for One-Sided Tests: Sufficient Monotone Likelihood Ratios are Sufficient</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.04208</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.04208v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The t-statistic is a widely-used scale-invariant statistic for testing the null hypothesis that the mean is zero. Martingale methods enable sequential testing with the t-statistic at every sample size, while controlling the probability of falsely rejecting the null. For one-sided sequential tests, which reject when the t-statistic is too positive, a natural question is whether they also control false rejection when the true mean is negative. We prove that this is the case using monotone likelihood ratios and sufficient statistics. We develop applications to the scale-invariant t-test, the location-invariant $\chi^2$-test and sequential linear regression with nuisance covariates.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2502.04220v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose a modified, high-dimensional version of a recent dimension estimation procedure that determines the dimension via the introduction of augmented noise variables into the data. Our asymptotic results show that the proposal is consistent in wide high-dimensional scenarios, and further shed light on why the original method breaks down when the dimension of either the data or the augmentation becomes too large. Simulations are used to demonstrate the superiority of the proposal to competitors both under and outside of the theoretical model.</description>

      <title>A method for sparse and robust independent component analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.04046</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.04046v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This work presents sparse invariant coordinate analysis, SICS, a new method for sparse and robust independent component analysis. SICS is based on classical invariant coordinate analysis, which is presented in such a form that a LASSO-type penalty can be applied to promote sparsity. Robustness is achieved by using robust scatter matrices. In the first part of the paper, the background and building blocks: scatter matrices, measures of robustness, ICS and independent component analysis, are carefully introduced. Then the proposed new method and its algorithm are derived and presented. This part also includes a consistency result for a general case of sparse ICS-like methods. The performance of SICS in identifying sparse independent component loadings is investigated with simulations. The method is also illustrated with example in constructing sparse causal graphs.</description>

      <title>Generalised Bayesian distance-based phylogenetics for the genomics era</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.04067</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.04067v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: As whole genomes become widely available, maximum likelihood and Bayesian phylogenetic methods are demonstrating their limits in meeting the escalating computational demands. Conversely, distance-based phylogenetic methods are efficient, but are rarely favoured due to their inferior performance. Here, we extend distance-based phylogenetics using an entropy-based likelihood of the evolution among pairs of taxa, allowing for fast Bayesian inference in genome-scale datasets. We provide evidence of a close link between the inference criteria used in distance methods and Felsenstein's likelihood, such that the methods are expected to have comparable performance in practice. Using the entropic likelihood, we perform Bayesian inference on three phylogenetic benchmark datasets and find that estimates closely correspond with previous inferences. We also apply this rapid inference approach to a 60-million-site alignment from 363 avian taxa, covering most avian families. The method has outstanding performance and reveals substantial uncertainty in the avian diversification events immediately after the K-Pg transition event. The entropic likelihood allows for efficient Bayesian phylogenetic inference, accommodating the analysis demands of the genomic era.</description>

      <title>Cyclic quantum causal modelling with a graph separation theorem</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.04168v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Causal modelling frameworks link observable correlations to causal explanations, which is a crucial aspect of science. These models represent causal relationships through directed graphs, with vertices and edges denoting systems and transformations within a theory. Most studies focus on acyclic causal graphs, where well-defined probability rules and powerful graph-theoretic properties like the d-separation theorem apply. However, understanding complex feedback processes and exotic fundamental scenarios with causal loops requires cyclic causal models, where such results do not generally hold. While progress has been made in classical cyclic causal models, challenges remain in uniquely fixing probability distributions and identifying graph-separation properties applicable in general cyclic models. In cyclic quantum scenarios, existing frameworks have focussed on a subset of possible cyclic causal scenarios, with graph-separation properties yet unexplored. This work proposes a framework applicable to all consistent quantum and classical cyclic causal models on finite-dimensional systems. We address these challenges by introducing a robust probability rule and a novel graph-separation property, p-separation, which we prove to be sound and complete for all such models. Our approach maps cyclic causal models to acyclic ones with post-selection, leveraging the post-selected quantum teleportation protocol. We characterize these protocols and their success probabilities along the way. We also establish connections between this formalism and other classical and quantum frameworks to inform a more unified perspective on causality. This provides a foundation for more general cyclic causal discovery algorithms and to systematically extend open problems and techniques from acyclic informational networks (e.g., certification of non-classicality) to cyclic causal structures and networks.</description>

      <title>Statistical guarantees for continuous-time policy evaluation: blessing of ellipticity and new tradeoffs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.04297</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.04297v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the estimation of the value function for continuous-time Markov diffusion processes using a single, discretely observed ergodic trajectory. Our work provides non-asymptotic statistical guarantees for the least-squares temporal-difference (LSTD) method, with performance measured in the first-order Sobolev norm. Specifically, the estimator attains an $O(1 / \sqrt{T})$ convergence rate when using a trajectory of length $T$; notably, this rate is achieved as long as $T$ scales nearly linearly with both the mixing time of the diffusion and the number of basis functions employed.
  A key insight of our approach is that the ellipticity inherent in the diffusion process ensures robust performance even as the effective horizon diverges to infinity. Moreover, we demonstrate that the Markovian component of the statistical error can be controlled by the approximation error, while the martingale component grows at a slower rate relative to the number of basis functions. By carefully balancing these two sources of error, our analysis reveals novel trade-offs between approximation and statistical errors.</description>

      <title>Negative Moment Bounds for Sample Autocovariance Matrices of Stationary Processes Driven by Conditional Heteroscedastic Errors and Their Applications</title>

      <description>arXiv:2301.07476v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We establish a negative moment bound for the sample autocovariance matrix of a stationary process driven by conditional heteroscedastic errors. This moment bound enables us to asymptotically express the mean squared prediction error (MSPE) of the least squares predictor as the sum of three terms related to model complexity, model misspecification, and conditional heteroscedasticity. A direct application of this expression is the development of a model selection criterion that can asymptotically identify the best (in the sense of MSPE) subset AR model in the presence of misspecification and conditional heteroscedasticity. Finally, numerical simulations are conducted to confirm our theoretical results.</description>

      <title>Early Stopping for Ensemble Kalman-Bucy Inversion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.18353</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.18353v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Bayesian linear inverse problems aim to recover an unknown signal from noisy observations, incorporating prior knowledge. This paper analyses a data dependent method to choose the scale parameter of a Gaussian prior. The method we study arises from early stopping methods, which have been successfully applied to a range of problems for statistical inverse problems in the frequentist setting. These results are extended to the Bayesian setting. We study the use of a discrepancy based stopping rule in the setting of random noise. Our proposed stopping rule results in optimal rates under certain conditions on the prior covariance operator. We furthermore derive for which class of signals this method is adaptive. It is also shown that the associated posterior contracts at the optimal rate and provides a conservative measure of uncertainty. We implement the proposed stopping rule using the continuous-time ensemble Kalman--Bucy filter (EnKBF). The fictitious time parameter replaces the scale parameter, and the ensemble size is appropriately adjusted in order to not lose statistical optimality of the computed estimator. The EnKBF, then, gives a continuous process from the prior distribution to the posterior which is terminated using the proposed stopping rule.</description>

      <title>Observable asymptotics of regularized Cox regression models with standard Gaussian designs: a statistical mechanics approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.13690</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.13690v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the asymptotic behaviour of the Regularized Maximum Partial Likelihood Estimator (RMPLE) in the proportional limit, considering an arbitrary convex regularizer and assuming that the covariates $\mathbf{X}_i\in\mathbb{R}^{p}$ follow a multivariate Gaussian law with covariance $\mathbf{I}_p/p$ for each $i=1, \dots, n$. In order to efficiently compute the estimator under investigation, we propose a modified Approximate Message Passing (AMP) algorithm, that we name COX-AMP, and compare its performance with the Coordinate-wise Descent (CD) algorithm, which is taken as reference. By means of the Replica method, we derive a set of six Replica Symmetric (RS) equations that we show to correctly describe the average behaviour of the estimators when the sample size and the number of covariates is large and commensurate. These equations cannot be solved in practice, as the data generating process (that we are trying to estimate) is not known. However, the update equations of COX-AMP suggest the construction of a local field that can in turn be used to accurately estimate all the RS order parameters of the theory \emph{solely from the data}, \emph{without} actually solving the RS equations. We emphasize that this approach can be applied when the estimator is computed via any method and is not restricted to COX-AMP. Once the RS order parameters are estimated, we have access to the amount of signal and noise in the RMPLE, but also its generalization error, directly from the data. Although we focus on the Partial Likelihood objective, we envisage broader application of the methodology proposed here, for instance to GLMs with nuisance parameters, which include some non-proportional hazards models, e.g. Accelerated Failure Time models.</description>

Abstract: The aim of this paper is to extend worst risk minimization, also called worst average loss minimization, to the functional realm. This means finding a functional regression representation that will be robust to future distribution shifts on the basis of data from two environments. In the classical non-functional realm, structural equations are based on a transfer matrix $B$. In section~\ref{sec:sfr}, we generalize this to consider a linear operator $\mathcal{T}$ on square integrable processes that plays the the part of $B$. By requiring that $(I-\mathcal{T})^{-1}$ is bounded -- as opposed to $\mathcal{T}$ -- this will allow for a large class of unbounded operators to be considered. Section~\ref{sec:worstrisk} considers two separate cases that both lead to the same worst-risk decomposition. Remarkably, this decomposition has the same structure as in the non-functional case. We consider any operator $\mathcal{T}$ that makes $(I-\mathcal{T})^{-1}$ bounded and define the future shift set in terms of the covariance functions of the shifts. In section~\ref{sec:minimizer}, we prove a necessary and sufficient condition for existence of a minimizer to this worst risk in the space of square integrable kernels. Previously, such minimizers were expressed in terms of the unknown eigenfunctions of the target and covariate integral operators (see for instance \cite{HeMullerWang} and \cite{YaoAOS}). This means that in order to estimate the minimizer, one must first estimate these unknown eigenfunctions. In contrast, the solution provided here will be expressed in any arbitrary ON-basis. This completely removes any necessity of estimating eigenfunctions. This pays dividends in section~\ref{sec:estimation}, where we provide a family of estimators, that are consistent with a large sample bound. Proofs of all the results are provided in the appendix.</description>

      <title>On robust recovery of signals from indirect observations</title>

Abstract: We consider an uncertain linear inverse problem as follows. Given observation $\omega=Ax_*+\zeta$ where $A\in {\bf R}^{m\times p}$ and $\zeta\in {\bf R}^{m}$ is observation noise, we want to recover unknown signal $x_*$, known to belong to a convex set ${\cal X}\subset{\bf R}^{n}$. As opposed to the "standard" setting of such problem, we suppose that the model noise $\zeta$ is "corrupted" -- contains an uncertain (deterministic dense or singular) component. Specifically, we assume that $\zeta$ decomposes into $\zeta=N\nu_*+\xi$ where $\xi$ is the random noise and $N\nu_*$ is the "adversarial contamination" with known $\cal N\subset {\bf R}^n$ such that $\nu_*\in \cal N$ and $N\in {\bf R}^{m\times n}$. We consider two "uncertainty setups" in which $\cal N$ is either a convex bounded set or is the set of sparse vectors (with at most $s$ nonvanishing entries). We analyse the performance of "uncertainty-immunized" polyhedral estimates -- a particular class of nonlinear estimates as introduced in [15, 16] -- and show how "presumably good" estimates of the sort may be constructed in the situation where the signal set is an ellitope (essentially, a symmetric convex set delimited by quadratic surfaces) by means of efficient convex optimization routines.</description>
