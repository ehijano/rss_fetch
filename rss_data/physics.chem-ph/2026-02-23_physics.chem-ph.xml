      <title>Spectral Homogenization of the Radiative Transfer Equation via Low-Rank Tensor Train Decomposition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.17708</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.17708v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Radiative transfer in absorbing-scattering media requires solving a transport equation across a spectral domain with 10^5 - 10^6 molecular absorption lines. Line-by-line (LBL) computation is prohibitively expensive, while existing approximations sacrifice spectral fidelity. We show that the Young-measure homogenization framework produces solution tensors I that admit low-rank tensor-train (TT) decompositions whose bond dimensions remain bounded as the spectral resolution Ns increases. Using molecular line parameters from the HITRAN database for H2O and CO2, we demonstrate that: (i) the TT rank saturates at r = 8 (at tolerance e = 10^-6) from Ns = 16 to 4096, independent of single-scattering albedo, Henyey-Greenstein asymmetry, temperature, and pressure; (ii) quantized tensor-train (QTT) representations achieve sub-linear storage scaling; (iii) in a controlled comparison using identical opacity data and transport solver, the homogenized approach achieves over an order of magnitude lower L2 error than the correlated-k distribution at equal cost; and (iv) for atomic plasma opacity (aluminum at 60 eV, TOPS database), the TT rank saturates at r = 15 with fundamentally different spectral structure (bound-bound and bound-free transitions spanning 12 decades of dynamic range), confirming that rank boundedness is a property of the transport equation rather than any particular opacity source. These results establish that the spectral complexity of radiative transfer has a finite effective rank exploitable by tensor decomposition, complementing the spatial-angular compression achieved by existing TT and dynamical low-rank approaches.</description>

      <title>UBio-MolFM: A Universal Molecular Foundation Model for Bio-Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.17709</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.17709v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: All-atom molecular simulation serves as a quintessential ``computational microscope'' for understanding the machinery of life, yet it remains fundamentally limited by the trade-off between quantum-mechanical (QM) accuracy and biological scale. We present UBio-MolFM, a universal foundation model framework specifically engineered to bridge this gap. UBio-MolFM introduces three synergistic innovations: (1) UBio-Mol26, a large bio-specific dataset constructed via a multi-fidelity ``Two-Pronged Strategy'' that combines systematic bottom-up enumeration with top-down sampling of native protein environments (up to 1,200 atoms); (2) E2Former-V2, a linear-scaling equivariant transformer that integrates Equivariant Axis-Aligned Sparsification (EAAS) and Long-Short Range (LSR) modeling to capture non-local physics with up to ~4x higher inference throughput in our large-system benchmarks; and (3) a Three-Stage Curriculum Learning protocol that transitions from energy initialization to energy-force consistency, with force-focused supervision to mitigate energy offsets. Rigorous benchmarking across microscopic forces and macroscopic observables -- including liquid water structure, ionic solvation, and peptide folding -- demonstrates that UBio-MolFM achieves ab initio-level fidelity on large, out-of-distribution biomolecular systems (up to ~1,500 atoms) and realistic MD observables. By reconciling scalability with quantum precision, UBio-MolFM provides a robust, ready-to-use tool for the next generation of computational biology.</description>

      <title>HBAT 2: A Python Package to Analyse Hydrogen Bonds and Other Non-covalent Interactions in Macromolecular Structures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.17712</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.17712v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Hydrogen bonds and other non-covalent interactions play a crucial role in maintaining the structural integrity and functionality of biological macromolecules such as proteins and nucleic acids. Accurate identification and analysis of these interactions are essential for understanding molecular recognition, protein folding, and drug design. HBAT (Hydrogen Bond Analysis Tool) is software for analysing hydrogen bonds and other weak interactions in macromolecular structures. This paper presents HBAT 2, an updated Python reimplementation of the original HBAT tool published in 2007. HBAT 2 is a Python package for automated analysis of hydrogen bonds and other non-covalent interactions in macromolecular structures available in Protein Data Bank (PDB) file format. The software identifies and analyses traditional hydrogen bonds, weak hydrogen bonds, halogen bonds, X-H$\cdots$$\pi$, $\pi$-$\pi$ stacking, and n$\rightarrow$$\pi$* interactions using geometric criteria. It also detects cooperativity and anticooperativity chains and renders them as 2D visualisations. The latest version offers improved cross-platform tkinter-based graphical user interface (GUI), a web-based interface, a simple command-line interface (CLI), and a developer-friendly API, making it accessible to users with different computational backgrounds.</description>

      <title>Identification of Solid-Electrolyte Interphase Species by Joint Characterization of Li-ion Battery Chemistry by Mass Spectrometry and Electro-Chemical Reaction Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.17722</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.17722v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The formation and stability of the solid electrolyte interphase (SEI) play a central role in determining the long-term performance and safety of modern electrochemical energy storage systems. Despite decades of research, the SEI's heterogeneous, dynamic, and multi-phase nature has defied comprehensive molecular-level characterization, creating a critical knowledge gap that limits rational battery design. In this work, we introduce a computational-experimental framework that integrates high-throughput quantum chemistry calculations, data-driven electro-chemical reaction networks (eCRNs), stochastic algorithms, and Laser Desorption/Ionization Fourier Transform Ion Cyclotron Resonance Mass Spectrometry (LDI-FTICR-MS) to unravel SEI formation in carbonate-based electrolytes without imposing predefined mechanisms. We constructed the most comprehensive eCRN to date, spanning over 10,000 species and 209 million reactions. Through stochastic network analysis, we successfully recovered 27 species that were previously reported in literature and predicted 28 novel SEI species, nearly doubling our scientific knowledge in this area. Each new species was rigorously confirmed through advanced mass spectra analysis of its distinct molecular and isotopic signatures. We kinetically refined the formation pathways for a select set of both previously reported and novel SEI products, revealing kinetically feasible elementary reaction mechanisms with activation barriers below 1 eV. This computational-experimental approach deepens our molecular-level understanding of SEI chemistry and supports the rational design of advanced electrolytes and engineered interphases for next-generation lithium-based batteries.</description>

      <title>Clever Materials: When Models Identify Good Materials for the Wrong Reasons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.17730</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.17730v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Machine learning can accelerate materials discovery. Models perform impressively on many benchmarks. However, strong benchmark performance does not imply that a model learned chemistry. I test a concrete alternative hypothesis: that property prediction can be driven by bibliographic confounding. Across five tasks spanning MOFs (thermal and solvent stability), perovskite solar cells (efficiency), batteries (capacity), and TADF emitters (emission wavelength), models trained on standard chemical descriptors predict author, journal, and publication year well above chance. When these predicted metadata ("bibliographic fingerprints") are used as the sole input to a second model, performance is sometimes competitive with conventional descriptor-based predictors. These results show that many datasets do not rule out non-chemical explanations of success. Progress requires routine falsification tests (e.g., group/time splits and metadata ablations), datasets designed to resist spurious correlations, and explicit separation of two goals: predictive utility versus evidence of chemical understanding.</description>

      <title>F\"orster resonance energy transfer with transient coherent effects</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.17789</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.17789v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We formulate the weak intramolecular coupling F\"orster resonance energy transfer theory in a form suitable for calculating ultrafast non-linear response of molecular systems. We introduce a formally exact time-dependent factorization of the molecular statistical operator into the system and bath components. Combining this factorization with unperturbed environment evolution, we generalize the traditional F\"orster master equation for the state population probabilities into a complete master equation for the system's reduced statistical operator. The traditional F\"orster theory applies in the limit where the intermolecular coupling is weak and the system-bath coupling is strong. Our technique of derivation explicitly leads to a time non-local F\"orster type master equation which remains valid also in the limit of vanishing system-bath coupling. The theory predicts a rapid initial coherent evolution of populations arising from a transient initial coherence-dependent term, which induces a slippage of the initial condition that persists during subsequent rate-controlled transfer. Comparison with exact numerical results confirms the clear improvement of the present generalization over earlier formulations of the F\"orster theory and delineates its range of validity.</description>

      <title>Efficient Calculation of Absorption Spectra of Platinum Complexes Used as Luminescent Probes for Cancer Detection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.18284</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.18284v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Despite major advances in oncology, many chemotherapeutic agents still cause severe side effects that reduce quality of life, motivating new approaches for early detection and targeted elimination of cancer cells. Luminescent transition metal complexes are promising biomolecular probes, since intercalation between DNA base pairs significantly changes their luminescence. However, reliable computational protocols to predict optical properties of transition metal intercalators are limited, making accurate absorption spectra calculations essential for screening candidates. Here, we benchmark methods for computing UV-Vis spectra of a Pt(II) pincer complex. The complex is studied both in isolation and intercalated in a small DNA model, representing probes designed to target DNA-associated molecular abnormalities. We find that the largest source of uncertainty stems from the exchange-correlation functional and recommend range-separated hybrids for robust spectral predictions. The Tamm-Dancoff approximation (TDA) and the resolution of identity (RI) approximations provide significant speedups for TD-DFT with only a modest loss of accuracy. Since geometry optimization is often the dominant cost, PBEh-3c emerges as an efficient alternative to conventional DFT, introducing errors comparable to those from TDA. Tight-binding methods (GFN-xTB) offer further acceleration, but yield larger deviations in structures and UV-Vis spectra; thus, unless extensive optimization is required, PBEh-3c provides the best balance between accuracy and efficiency.</description>

      <title>Clapeyron Neural Networks for Single-Species Vapor-Liquid Equilibria</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.18313</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.18313v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Machine learning (ML) approaches have shown promising results for predicting molecular properties relevant for chemical process design. However, they are often limited by scarce experimental property data and lack thermodynamic consistency. As such, thermodynamics-informed ML, i.e., incorporating thermodynamic relations into the loss function as regularization term for training, has been proposed. We herein transfer the concept of thermodynamics-informed graph neural networks (GNNs) from the Gibbs-Duhem to the Clapeyron equation, predicting several pure component properties in a multi-task manner, namely: vapor pressure, liquid molar volume, vapor molar volume and enthalpy of vaporization. We find improved prediction accuracy of the Clapeyron-GNN compared to the single-task learning setting, and improved approximation of the Clapeyron equation compared to the purely data-driven multi-task learning setting. In fact, we observe the largest improvement in prediction accuracy for the properties with the lowest availability of data, making our model promising for practical application in data scarce scenarios of chemical engineering practice.</description>

      <title>The coherent-state transformation in quantum electrodynamics coupled cluster theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.18391</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.18391v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We analyse the coherent-state (CS) transformation in quantum electrodynamics coupled cluster (QED-CC) theory from the perspective of its non-vanishing commutator with the polaritonic cluster operator. Specifically, we show that a QED Hartree-Fock (QED-HF) reference state parametrized by the CS-transformation leads to a QED-CC Lagrangian formally determined by CS-representations of polaritonic Hamiltonian, polaritonic cluster and polaritonic deexcitation operators. This observation augments the original formulation of QED-CC theory where the CS-representation is restricted to the polaritonic Hamiltonian. We consequently find a renormalization of both QED-CC correlation energy and QED-CC ground state induced by the CS-transformation, which depends on the mean-field expectation value of the molecular dipole operator and therefore breaks origin invariance for charged systems. Electronic contributions to correlation energy and QED-CC ground state are renormalized by CS-transformed mixed excitation and deexcitation operators. In contrast, the CS-transformed single-photon excitation affects only the QED-CC ground state but not directly the correlation energy. The fully CS-transformed QED-CC ansatz is well approximated by the original QED-CC formulation for large cavity frequencies leading to small renormalization corrections. However, it exhibits a divergent zero-frequency limit absent in the original QED-CC ansatz for molecules with a non-vanishing molecular dipole moment in agreement with the asymptotic behaviour of the CS-parametrized QED-HF reference state.</description>

      <title>El Agente S\'olido: A New Age(nt) for Solid State Simulations</title>

      <description>arXiv:2602.17886v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Quantum chemistry calculations are a key component of the materials discovery process. The results from first-principles explorations enable the prediction of material properties prior to experimental validation. Despite their impact, the practical use of first-principles methods remains limited by the expertise required to design, execute, and troubleshoot complex computational workflows. Even when workflows are successfully built, they are sometimes rigid and not adaptable to different use cases. Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) and agentic systems offer a pathway to flexibly automate these processes and lower barriers to entry. Here, we introduce El Agente S\'olido, a hierarchical multi-agent framework for automating solid-state quantum chemistry workflows using the open-source Quantum ESPRESSO simulation package. The framework translates high-level scientific objectives expressed in natural language into end-to-end computational pipelines that include structure generation, input file construction, workflow execution, and post-processing analysis. El Agente S\'olido integrates density functional theory with phonon calculations and machine-learning interatomic potentials to enable efficient and physically consistent simulations. Extensive benchmarking and case studies demonstrate that El Agente S\'olido reliably executes a wide range of solid-state calculations, highlighting its potential to improve reproducibility and accelerate computational materials discovery</description>

      <title>El Agente Gr\'afico: Structured Execution Graphs for Scientific Agents</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.17902</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.17902v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly used to automate scientific workflows, yet their integration with heterogeneous computational tools remains ad hoc and fragile. Current agentic approaches often rely on unstructured text to manage context and coordinate execution, generating often overwhelming volumes of information that may obscure decision provenance and hinder auditability. In this work, we present El Agente Gr\'afico, a single-agent framework that embeds LLM-driven decision-making within a type-safe execution environment and dynamic knowledge graphs for external persistence. Central to our approach is a structured abstraction of scientific concepts and an object-graph mapper that represents computational state as typed Python objects, stored either in memory or persisted in an external knowledge graph. This design enables context management through typed symbolic identifiers rather than raw text, thereby ensuring consistency, supporting provenance tracking, and enabling efficient tool orchestration. We evaluate the system by developing an automated benchmarking framework across a suite of university-level quantum chemistry tasks previously evaluated on a multi-agent system, demonstrating that a single agent, when coupled to a reliable execution engine, can robustly perform complex, multi-step, and parallel computations. We further extend this paradigm to two other large classes of applications: conformer ensemble generation and metal-organic framework design, where knowledge graphs serve as both memory and reasoning substrates. Together, these results illustrate how abstraction and type safety can provide a scalable foundation for agentic scientific automation beyond prompt-centric designs.</description>

      <title>A Computational Study of Organic Molecular Crystals for Photocatalytic Water Splitting</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.18200</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.18200v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Organic crystalline materials are potential candidates for photocatalytic overall water splitting (OWS). Although organic crystals have been heavily investigated for application in organic electronics, such as organic light-emitting diodes (OLEDs) and solar cells, there have been comparatively fewer studies into OWS in these materials. A major challenge is the large number of electronic and structural criteria that must be met for a material to make a viable OWS photocatalyst. Optical absorption, reduction and oxidation potentials and charge-transport properties are among the key considerations, and these are influenced both by molecular properties and the solid-state packing arrangement, making computational modelling challenging. Here, we investigate a series of known organic electronic materials that have published crystal structures using periodic density functional theory (DFT) and compare their calculated electronic properties of optical absorption and reduction and oxidation potentials with literature experimental data. Furthermore we perform a series of gas-phase molecular calculations which show a good agreement with literature data and periodic DFT for the optoelectronic properties of the organic molecular crystals studied, showing that gas-phase molecular calculations could be used to screen organic crystals for OWS at a reduced computational cost.</description>

      <title>Determining Molecular Ground State with Quantum Imaginary Time Evolution using Broken-Symmetry Wave Function</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.18156</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.18156v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The Hartree-Fock (HF) wave function, commonly used for approximating molecular ground states, becomes nonideal in open shell systems due to the inherent multi-configurational nature of the wave function, limiting accuracy in Quantum Imaginary Time Evolution (QITE). We propose replacing the HF wave function with a spin- and spatial-symmetry broken wave function, enhancing convergence by adding a spin operator, $S^2$ as a penalty term to the original molecular Hamiltonian. We verify that this approach provides good convergence behavior towards the lowest energy eigenstate using direct matrix exponentiation for Imaginary Time Evolution (ITE). Numerical simulations were performed on the hydrogen molecule and a square tetrahydrogen cluster using measurement-assisted unitary approximation in QITE. QITE demonstrates faster convergence to the ground state with broken symmetry (BS) compared to HF, particularly after the molecule exhibits a diradical character of 0.56 for hydrogen. Prior to this point, HF remains more effective, suggesting a transition threshold of diradical character for wave function selection. Additionally, the overlap analysis with Complete Active Space Configuration Interaction (CAS-CI) wave function shows that BS has a larger initial overlap than HF in higher-spin, multi-configurational systems like triple bond dissociation in nitrogen molecule. This method provides a pathway for improved energy simulations in open shell systems, where wave function accuracy significantly impacts downstream quantum algorithms and practical applications in quantum chemistry.</description>

      <title>Theoretical investigations of tetrameric magnetic molecules for sub-kelvin cooling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.22105</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.22105v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Magnetic molecules are a class of compounds that is also investigated in view of their magnetocaloric properties. The isothermal entropy change and the adiabatic temperature change are key figures of merit for magnetocaloric performance. Here, we investigate spin systems of realistic molecular structures comprising four spins. In view of potentially large spin quantum numbers as for gadolinium we model these spin systems by a combination of Heisenberg and dipolar spin-spin interactions. It turns out that a tetrahedral structure with ferromagnetic exchange interactions yields the best figures of merit.</description>

      <title>A Vibronic Coupling Model to Study the Nonadiabatic Dynamics of Polyenes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.20433</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.20433v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We develop a linear vibronic coupling (LVC) model for polyenes described by the extended Hubbard-Peierls Hamiltonian. This model is applied to trans-hexatriene to benchmark quantum-classical dynamics methods against fully quantum simulations. We find that surface-hopping methods describe short times more accurately than multi-trajectory Ehrenfest. None of the quantum-classical methods studied obtain the long-time population oscillations found in fully quantum simulations. Varying the parameters of the LVC Hamiltonian, we find that surface hopping reproduces the correct trends in the long-time dynamics across a wide range of parameters, but generally overestimates the degree of internal conversion. On the other hand, multi-trajectory Ehrenfest gives more accurate long-time populations in proximity to the hexatriene parameter set.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2602.07861v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Entropy is critically examined as a fundamental concept in contemporary science and informatics. Although the typical Shannon entropy provides a proper framework for describing the canonical ensemble, it fails to represent adequately the microcanonical ensemble. This discrepancy manifests additionally in its inability to support a theoretical derivation of the Second Law of thermodynamics.</description>
