      <title>Dynamically emergent correlations in bosons via quantum resetting</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.20342</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.20342v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the nonequilibrium stationary state (NESS) induced by quantum resetting of a system of $N$ noninteracting bosons in a harmonic trap. Our protocol consists of preparing initially the system in the ground state of a harmonic oscillator centered at $+a$, followed by a rapid quench where the center is shifted to $-a$ and the system is allowed to evolve unitarily up to a random Poissonian time $\tau$ distributed via $r\, e^{-r\, \tau}$. Then the trap center is reset to $+a$ again and the system is assumed to cool instantaneously to the initial ground state. The system is again allowed to evolve unitarily in the trap centered at $-a$ up to a random time, and the procedure is repeated. Under repeated resetting, the system reaches a NESS where the positions of bosons get $\rm{\textit{strongly correlated}}$ due to simultaneous resetting induced by the trap. We fully characterize the steady state by analytically computing several physical observables such as the average density, extreme value statistics, order and gap statistics, and also the distribution of the number of particles in a region $[-L,L]$, known as the full counting statistics (FCS). In particular, we show that in the large $N$ limit, the scaling function describing the FCS exhibits a striking feature: it is supported over a nontrivial finite interval, and moreover is discontinuous at an interior point of the support. Our results are supported by numerical simulations. This is a rare example of a strongly correlated quantum many-body NESS where various observables can be exactly computed.</description>

      <title>Quantum protocols in demixed dipolar BEC mixtures in 1D</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.20467</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.20467v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Long range dipolar effects in 1D systems either in free or inhomogeneous space are the basis of the state preparation protocol here proposed. Under the presence of an external time-dependent magnetic field, dipole-dipole interactions in the binary ultracold $^{166}$Er -$^{164}$Dy system were tuned from repulsive to attractive to access either, the droplet regime, or the extended one where individual species can be found in mixed or demixed phases. A thorough exploration of weak contact and dipole-dipole effective interactions parameters leads us to determine the phase diagrams of the 1D Bose clouds affected by three different external fields; free homogeneous, harmonic, and optical lattice confining potentials. These results were used to propose long-life states composed of alternate assemblies of individual species confined in optical lattices that mimics magnetic domains, whose size can be adjusted. Our analysis based on numerical experiments within a mean field scheme considered large enough systems as those commonly used in experimental platforms.</description>

      <title>Multifractality and excited-state quantum phase transition in ferromagnetic spin-$1$ Bose-Einstein condensates</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.20612</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.20612v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Multifractality of quantum states plays an important role for understanding numerous complex phenomena observed in different branches of physics. The multifractal properties of the eigenstates allow for charactering various phase transitions. In this work, we perform a thoroughly analysis of the impacts of an excited-state quantum phase transition (ESQPT) on the fractal behavior of both static and dynamical wavefunctions in a ferromagentic spin-$1$ Bose-Einstein condensate (BEC).By studying the features of the fractal dimensions, we show how the multifractality of eigenstates and time evolved state are affected by the presence of ESQPT. Specifically, the underlying ESQPT leads to a strong localization effect, which in turn enables us to use it as an indicator of ESQPT. We verify the ability of the fractal dimensions to probe the occurrence of ESQPT through a detailed scaling analysis. We also discuss how the ESQPT manifests itself in the fractal dimensions of the long-time averaged state. Our findings further confirm that the multifractal analysis is a powerful tool for studying of phase transitions in quantum many-body systems and also hint an potential application of ESQPTs in burgeoning field of state preparation engineering.</description>

      <title>2D Skyrmion topological charge of spin textures with arbitrary boundary conditions: a two-component spinorial BEC as a case study</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.20977</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.20977v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We derive the most general expression for the Skyrmion topological charge for a two-dimensional spin texture, valid for any type of boundary conditions or for any arbitrary spatial region within the texture. It reduces to the usual one $Q = 1/4\pi \iint \vec f \cdot \left(\partial_x \vec f \times \partial_y \vec f\right)$ for the appropriate boundary conditions, with $\vec f$ the spin texture. The general expression resembles the Gauss-Bonet theorem for the Euler-Poincar\'e characteristic of a 2D surface, but it has definite differences, responsible for the assignment of the proper signs of the Skyrmion charges. Additionally, we show that the charge of a single Skyrmion is the product of the value of the normal component of the spin texture at the singularity times the Index or winding number of the transverse texture, a generalization of a Poincar\'e theorem. We illustrate our general results analyzing in detail a two-component spinor Bose-Einstein condensate in 2D in the presence of an external magnetic field, via the Gross-Pitaevskii equation. The condensate spin textures present Skyrmions singularities at the spatial locations where the transverse magnetic field vanishes. We show that the ensuing superfluid vortices and Skyrmions have the same value for their corresponding topological charges, in turn due to the structure of the magnetic field.</description>

      <title>Emergent dipole field theory in atomic ladders</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.21019</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.21019v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the dynamics of hard-core bosons on ladders, in the presence of strong kinetic constrains akin to those of the Bariev model. We use a combination of analytical methods and numerical simulations to establish the phase diagram of the model. The model displays a paired Tomonaga-Luttinger liquid phase featuring an emergent dipole symmetry, which encodes the local pairing constraint into a global, non-local quantity. We scrutinize the effect of such emergent low-energy symmetry during quench dynamics including single particle defects. We observe that, despite being approximate, the dipole symmetry still leads to very slow relaxation dynamics, which we model via an effective field theory. The model we discuss is amenable to realization in both cold atoms in optical lattices and Rydberg atom arrays with dynamics taking place solely in the Rydberg manifold. We present a blueprint protocol to observe the effect of emergent dipole symmetry in such experimental platforms, combining adiabatic state preparation with quench dynamics.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.20317</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.20317v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The lecture notes on "Many-body Quantum Dynamics with MCTDH-X," adapted from the 2023 Heidelberg MCTDH Summer School, provide an in-depth exploration of the Multiconfigurational Time-Dependent Hartree approach for indistinguishable particles. They serve as a comprehensive guide for understanding and utilizing the MCTDH-X software for both bosonic and fermionic systems. The tutorial begins with an introduction to the MCTDH-X software, highlighting its capability to handle various quantum systems, including those with internal degrees of freedom and long-range interactions. The theoretical foundation is then laid out on how to solve the time-dependent and time-independent Schr\"odinger equations for many-body systems. The workflow section provides practical instructions on setting up and executing simulations using MCTDH-X. Detailed benchmarks against exact solutions are presented, showcasing the accuracy and reliability of the software in ground-state and dynamic simulations. The notes then delve into the dynamics of quantum systems, covering relaxation processes, time evolution, and the analysis of propagation for both bosonic and fermionic particles. The discussion includes the interpretation of various physical quantities such as energy, density distributions, and orbital occupations. Advanced features of MCTDH-X are also explored in the last section, including the calculation of correlation functions and the creation of visualizations through video tutorials. The notes conclude with a Linux/UNIX command cheat sheet, facilitating ease of use for users operating the software on different systems. Overall, these lecture notes provide a valuable resource for researchers and students in the field of quantum dynamics, offering both theoretical insights and practical guidance on the use of MCTDH-X for studying complex many-body systems.</description>

      <title>Improved models for ideal Fermi gas and ideal Bose gas using quantum phase space</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.09998</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.09998v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The current models of ideal Fermi gas and ideal Bose gas are often considered as compatible with quantum theory. In this work, however, it is shown that improvements should be introduced into these models to take into account the quantum nature of phase space related to the uncertainty principle. The construction of the improved models is based on the use of the concepts of phase space representation of quantum mechanics and quantum phase space that were introduced and developed recently. Hamiltonian operator of a gas particle and its eigenstates are firstly determined and the use of quantum statistical mechanics leads to the deduction of the thermodynamics properties of the ideal gas itself. The explicit expressions of thermodynamic quantities such as the grand canonical potential, the thermodynamic particles number, the internal energy and the pressure as well as the state equations, corresponding to the improved models, are established for both bosons and fermions. The corrections introduced by these expressions are expected to be particularly significant at low temperature and for confined volume. They permit in particular to highlight the existence of quantum shape and size effects. It is also shown that the thermodynamics functions and variables are directly related to the momenta quantum statistical variances. Well-known relations corresponding to classic al ideal gas model can be retrieved from the improved models as asymptotic limits at high temperature and for large volume.</description>

      <title>Achieving quantum advantage in a search for a minimal Goldbach partition with driven atoms in tailored potentials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.00517</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.00517v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The famous Goldbach conjecture states that any even natural number $N$ greater than $2$ can be written as the sum of two prime numbers $p$ and $p'$, with $p \, , p'$ referred to as a Goldbach pair. In this article we present a quantum analogue protocol for detecting -- given a even number $N$ -- the existence of a so-called minimal Goldbach partition $N=p+p'$ with $p\equiv p_{\rm min}(N)$ being the so-called minimal Goldbach prime, i.e. the least possible value for $p$ among all the Goldbach pairs of $N$. The proposed protocol is effectively a quantum Grover algorithm with a modified final stage. Assuming that an approximate smooth upper bound $\mathcal{N}(N)$ for the number of primes less than or equal to $ p_{\rm min}(N)$ is known, our protocol will identify if the set of $\mathcal{N}(N)$ lowest primes contains the minimal Goldbach prime in approximately $\sqrt{\mathcal{N}(N)}$ steps, against the corresponding classical value $\mathcal{N}(N)$. In the larger context of a search for violations of Goldbach's conjecture, the quantum advantage provided by our scheme appears to be potentially convenient. E.g., referring to the current state-of-art numerical search for violations of the Goldbach conjecture among all even numbers up to $N_{\text{max}} = 4\times 10^{18}$ [T. O. e Silva, S. Herzog, and S. Pardi, Mathematics of Computation 83, 2033 (2013)], a quantum realization of the search would deliver a quantum advantage factor of $\sqrt{\mathcal{N}(N_{\text{max}})} \approx 37$ and it will require a Hilbert space spanning $\mathcal{N}(N_{\text{max}}) \approx 1376$ basis states.</description>
