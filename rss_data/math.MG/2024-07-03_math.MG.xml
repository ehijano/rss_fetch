      <title>A New Construction of Forests with Low Visibility</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.01633</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.01633v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A set of points with finite density is constructed in $\mathbb{R}^d$, with $d\geq2$, by adding points to a Poisson process such that any line segment of length $O\left(\varepsilon^{-(d-1)}\ln\varepsilon^{-1}\right)$ in $\mathbb{R}^d$ will contain one of the points of the set within distance $\varepsilon$ of it. The constant implied by the big-$O$ notation depends on dimension only.</description>

      <title>On the Gromov-Hausdorff Limits of Compact Surfaces with Boundary</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.01642</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.01642v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work we investigate Gromov-Hausdorff limits of compact surfaces carrying length metrics. More precisely, we consider the case where all surfaces have the same Euler characteristic. We give a complete description of the limit spaces and study their topological properties. Our investigation builds on the results of a previous work which treats the case of closed surfaces.</description>

      <title>Optimal codes in the Stiefel manifold</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.01813</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.01813v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider the coding problem in the Stiefel manifold with chordal distance. After considering various low-dimensional instances of this problem, we use Rankin's bounds on spherical codes to prove upper bounds on the minimum distance of a Stiefel code, and then we construct several examples of codes that achieve equality in these bounds.</description>

      <title>Disintegrated optimal transport for metric fiber bundles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.01879</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.01879v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We define a new two-parameter family of metrics on a subspace of Borel probability measures on a metric fiber bundle, called the disintegrated Monge--Kantorovich metrics. We then prove the disintegrated Monge--Kantorovich metrics are complete, separable (except an endpoint case), geodesic spaces, with a dual representation. Additionally, we prove existence and duality for an associated barycenter problem, and provide conditions for uniqueness of a barycenter. These results on barycenter problems for the disintegrated Monge--Kantorovich metrics also yield the corresponding existence, duality, and uniqueness results for classical Monge--Kantorovich barycenters in a wide variety of spaces, including a uniqueness result on any connected, complete Riemannian manifold, with or without boundary, with no restriction on the geometry of any kind.</description>

      <title>Sard properties for polynomial maps in infinite dimension</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.02296</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.02296v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Motivated by the Sard conjecture in sub-Riemannian geometry, and more specifically on Carnot groups, we consider the set of maps defined on a Hilbert space $H$: \[\mathscr{P}_{d}^m(H)=\bigg\{f:H\to \mathbb{R}^m\,\bigg|\, \forall\, E\subset H, \,\dim(E)&lt;\infty \implies f|_{E} \textrm{ is a polynomial map of degree $d$}\bigg\}.
  \] Example of maps belonging to this class are: the map $f:\ell^2\to \mathbb{R}$ constructed by Kukpa as a counterexample for the Sard theorem in infinite dimension; the Endpoint maps of Carnot groups.
  We prove that, for infinite-dimensional subspaces $V \subset H$ satisfying quantitative assumptions on their Kolmogorov $n$-width, the restriction of $f$ on $V$ has the Sard property, i.e. the set of critical values of $f|_{V}$ has measure zero in $\mathbb{R}^m$. We prove various quantitative versions of this result, allowing to study the Sard property also for the case $V=H$. By constructing suitable examples, we prove the sharpness of our $n$-width assumptions.
  We apply these results to sub-Riemannian geometry, proving that on Carnot groups the Sard property holds true for the restriction of the Endpoint map on the set of real-analytic controls with large enough radius of convergence. This is a more functional-analytic approach to the Sard conjecture that, unlike previous ones, does not resort to reduction to finite-dimensions.</description>

      <title>Diffusion Geometry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.10858</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.10858v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We introduce diffusion geometry as a new framework for geometric and topological data analysis. Diffusion geometry uses the Bakry-Emery $\Gamma$-calculus of Markov diffusion operators to define objects from Riemannian geometry on a wide range of probability spaces. We construct statistical estimators for these objects from a sample of data, and so introduce a whole family of new methods for geometric data analysis and computational geometry. This includes vector fields and differential forms on the data, and many of the important operators in exterior calculus. Unlike existing methods like persistent homology and local principal component analysis, diffusion geometry is explicitly related to Riemannian geometry, and is significantly more robust to noise, significantly faster to compute, provides a richer topological description (like the cup product on cohomology), and is naturally vectorised for statistics and machine learning. We find that diffusion geometry outperforms multiparameter persistent homology as a biomarker for real and simulated tumour histology data and can robustly measure the manifold hypothesis by detecting singularities in manifold-like data.</description>

      <title>Time functions on Lorentzian length spaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2108.02693</link>
      <description>arXiv:2108.02693v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In general relativity, time functions are crucial objects whose existence and properties are intimately tied to the causal structure of a spacetime and also to the initial value formulation of the Einstein equations. In this work we establish all fundamental classical existence results on time functions in the setting of Lorentzian (pre-)length spaces (including causally plain continuous spacetimes, closed cone fields and even more singular spaces). More precisely, we characterize the existence of time functions by $K$-causality, show that a modified notion of Geroch's volume functions are time functions if and only if the space is causally continuous, and lastly, characterize global hyperbolicity by the existence of Cauchy time functions, and Cauchy sets. Our results thus inevitably show that no manifold structure is needed in order to obtain suitable time functions.</description>

      <title>Coarse geometry of quasi-transitive graphs beyond planarity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.08902</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.08902v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study geometric and topological properties of infinite graphs that are quasi-isometric to a planar graph of bounded degree. We prove that every locally finite quasi-transitive graph excluding a minor is quasi-isometric to a planar graph of bounded degree. We use the result to give a simple proof of the result that finitely generated minor-excluded groups have Assouad-Nagata dimension at most 2 (this is known to hold in greater generality, but all known proofs use significantly deeper tools). We also prove that every locally finite quasi-transitive graph that is quasi-isometric to a planar graph is $k$-planar for some $k$ (i.e. it has a planar drawing with at most $k$ crossings per edge), and discuss a possible approach to prove the converse statement.</description>
