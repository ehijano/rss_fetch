      <title>Risk-Sensitive Online Algorithms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.09859</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.09859v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We initiate the study of risk-sensitive online algorithms, in which risk measures are used in the competitive analysis of randomized online algorithms. We introduce the CVaR$_\delta$-competitive ratio ($\delta$-CR) using the conditional value-at-risk of an algorithm's cost, which measures the expectation of the $(1-\delta)$-fraction of worst outcomes against the offline optimal cost, and use this measure to study three online optimization problems: continuous-time ski rental, discrete-time ski rental, and one-max search. The structure of the optimal $\delta$-CR and algorithm varies significantly between problems: we prove that the optimal $\delta$-CR for continuous-time ski rental is $2-2^{-\Theta(\frac{1}{1-\delta})}$, obtained by an algorithm described by a delay differential equation. In contrast, in discrete-time ski rental with buying cost $B$, there is an abrupt phase transition at $\delta = 1 - \Theta(\frac{1}{\log B})$, after which the classic deterministic strategy is optimal. Similarly, one-max search exhibits a phase transition at $\delta = \frac{1}{2}$, after which the classic deterministic strategy is optimal; we also obtain an algorithm that is asymptotically optimal as $\delta \downarrow 0$ that arises as the solution to a delay differential equation.</description>

      <title>Dynamic online matching with budget refills</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.09920</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.09920v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Inspired by sequential budgeted allocation problems, we study the online matching problem with budget refills. In this context, we consider an online bipartite graph G=(U,V,E), where the nodes in $V$ are discovered sequentially and nodes in $U$ are known beforehand. Each $u\in U$  is endowed with a budget $b_{u,t}\in \mathbb{N}$ that dynamically evolves over time. Unlike the canonical setting, in many applications, the budget can be refilled from time to time, which leads to a much richer dynamic that we consider here. Intuitively, adding extra budgets in $U$ seems to ease the matching task, and our results support this intuition. In fact, for the stochastic framework considered where we studied the matching size built by Greedy algorithm on an Erd\H{o}s-R\'eyni random graph, we showed that the matching size generated by Greedy converges with high probability to a solution of an explicit system of ODE. Moreover, under specific conditions, the competitive ratio (performance measure of the algorithm) can even tend to 1. For the adversarial part,  where the graph considered is deterministic and the algorithm used is Balance, the $b$-matching bound holds when the refills are scarce. However, when refills are regular, our results suggest a potential improvement in algorithm performance. In both cases, Balance algorithm manages to reach the performance of the upper bound on the adversarial graphs considered.</description>

      <title>Distributed Delta-Coloring under Bandwidth Limitations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.09975</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.09975v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider the problem of coloring graphs of maximum degree $\Delta$ with $\Delta$ colors in the distributed setting with limited bandwidth. Specifically, we give a $\mathsf{poly}\log\log n$-round randomized algorithm in the CONGEST model. This is close to the lower bound of $\Omega(\log \log n)$ rounds from [Brandt et al., STOC '16], which holds also in the more powerful LOCAL model. The core of our algorithm is a reduction to several special instances of the constructive Lov\'asz local lemma (LLL) and the $deg+1$-list coloring problem.</description>

      <title>Near Uniform Triangle Sampling Over Adjacency List Graph Streams</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.10167</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.10167v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Triangle counting and sampling are two fundamental problems for streaming algorithms. Arguably, designing sampling algorithms is more challenging than their counting variants. It may be noted that triangle counting has received far greater attention in the literature than the sampling variant. In this work, we consider the problem of approximately sampling triangles in different models of streaming with the focus being on the adjacency list model.
  In this problem, the edges of a graph $G$ will arrive over a data stream. The goal is to design efficient streaming algorithms that can sample and output a triangle from a distribution, over the triangles in $G$, that is close to the uniform distribution over the triangles in $G$. The distance between distributions is measured in terms of $\ell_1$-distance. The main technical contribution of this paper is to design algorithms for this triangle sampling problem in the adjacency list model with the space complexities matching their counting variants. For the sake of completeness, we also show results on the vertex and edge arrival models.</description>

      <title>Rounding Large Independent Sets on Expanders</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.10238</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.10238v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We develop a new approach for approximating large independent sets when the input graph is a one-sided spectral expander - that is, the uniform random walk matrix of the graph has the second eigenvalue bounded away from 1. Consequently, we obtain a polynomial time algorithm to find linear-sized independent sets in one-sided expanders that are almost $3$-colorable or are promised to contain an independent set of size $(1/2-\epsilon)n$. Our second result above can be refined to require only a weaker vertex expansion property with an efficient certificate. Somewhat surprisingly, we observe that the analogous task of finding a linear-sized independent set in almost $4$-colorable one-sided expanders (even when the second eigenvalue is $o_n(1)$) is NP-hard, assuming the Unique Games Conjecture.
  All prior algorithms that beat the worst-case guarantees for this problem rely on bottom eigenspace enumeration techniques (following the classical spectral methods of Alon and Kahale) and require two-sided expansion, meaning a bounded number of negative eigenvalues of magnitude $\Omega(1)$. Such techniques naturally extend to almost $k$-colorable graphs for any constant $k$, in contrast to analogous guarantees on one-sided expanders, which are Unique Games-hard to achieve for $k \geq 4$.
  Our rounding builds on the method of simulating multiple samples from a pseudodistribution introduced by Barak et. al. for rounding Unique Games instances. The key to our analysis is a new clustering property of large independent sets in expanding graphs - every large independent set has a larger-than-expected intersection with some member of a small list - and its formalization in the low-degree sum-of-squares proof system.</description>

      <title>Adaptive Quotient Filters</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.10253</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.10253v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Adaptive filters, such as telescoping and adaptive cuckoo filters, update their representation upon detecting a false positive to avoid repeating the same error in the future. Adaptive filters require an auxiliary structure, typically much larger than the main filter and often residing on slow storage, to facilitate adaptation. However, existing adaptive filters are not practical and have seen no adoption in real-world systems due to two main reasons. Firstly, they offer weak adaptivity guarantees, meaning that fixing a new false positive can cause a previously fixed false positive to come back. Secondly, the sub-optimal design of the auxiliary structure results in adaptivity overheads so substantial that they can actually diminish the overall system performance compared to a traditional filter.
  In this paper, we design and implement AdaptiveQF, the first practical adaptive filter with minimal adaptivity overhead and strong adaptivity guarantees, which means that the performance and false-positive guarantees continue to hold even for adversarial workloads. The AdaptiveQF is based on the state-of-the-art quotient filter design and preserves all the critical features of the quotient filter such as cache efficiency and mergeability. Furthermore, we employ a new auxiliary structure design which results in considerably low adaptivity overhead and makes the AdaptiveQF practical in real systems.</description>

      <title>Online bipartite matching with imperfect advice</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.09784</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.09784v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the problem of online unweighted bipartite matching with $n$ offline vertices and $n$ online vertices where one wishes to be competitive against the optimal offline algorithm. While the classic RANKING algorithm of Karp et al. [1990] provably attains competitive ratio of $1-1/e &gt; 1/2$, we show that no learning-augmented method can be both 1-consistent and strictly better than $1/2$-robust under the adversarial arrival model. Meanwhile, under the random arrival model, we show how one can utilize methods from distribution testing to design an algorithm that takes in external advice about the online vertices and provably achieves competitive ratio interpolating between any ratio attainable by advice-free methods and the optimal ratio of 1, depending on the advice quality.</description>

      <title>PackIt! Gamified Rectangle Packing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.12195</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.12195v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present and analyze PackIt!, a turn-based game consisting of packing rectangles on an $n \times n$ grid. PackIt! can be easily played on paper, either as a competitive two-player game or in \emph{solitaire} fashion. On the $t$-th turn, a rectangle of area $t$ or $t+1$ must be placed in the grid. In the two-player format of PackIt! whichever player places a rectangle last wins, whereas the goal in the solitaire variant is to perfectly pack the $n \times n$ grid. We analyze conditions for the existence of a perfect packing over $n \times n$, then present an automated reasoning approach that allows finding perfect games of PackIt! up to $n = 50$ which includes a novel SAT-encoding technique of independent interest, and conclude by proving an NP-hardness result.</description>
