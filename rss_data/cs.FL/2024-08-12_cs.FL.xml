      <title>Parameterized Verification of Timed Networks with Clock Invariants</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.05190</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.05190v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider parameterized verification problems for networks of timed automata (TAs) that communicate via disjunctive guards or lossy broadcast. To this end, we first consider disjunctive timed networks (DTNs), i.e., networks of TAs that communicate via location guards that enable a transition only if there is another process in a certain location. We solve for the first time the general case with clock invariants, and establish the decidability of the parameterized verification problem for local trace properties and for reachability of global configurations; Moreover, we prove that, surprisingly and unlike in other settings, this model is equivalent to lossy broadcast networks.</description>

      <title>Axiomatizing NFAs Generated by Regular Grammars</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.00502</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.00502v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A subclass of nondeterministic Finite Automata generated by means of regular Grammars (GFAs, for short) is introduced. A process algebra is proposed, whose semantics maps a term to a GFA. We prove a representability theorem: for each GFA $N$, there exists a process algebraic term $p$ such that its semantics is a GFA isomorphic to $N$. Moreover, we provide a concise axiomatization of language equivalence: two GFAs $N_1$ and $N_2$ recognize the same regular language if and only if the associated terms $p_1$ and $p_2$, respectively, can be equated by means of a set of axioms, comprising 7 axioms plus 2 conditional axioms, only.</description>

      <title>Refl-Spanners: A Purely Regular Approach to Non-Regular Core Spanners</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2010.13442</link>
      <description>arXiv:2010.13442v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The regular spanners (characterised by vset-automata) are closed under the algebraic operations of union, join and projection, and have desirable algorithmic properties. The core spanners (introduced by Fagin, Kimelfeld, Reiss, and Vansummeren (PODS 2013, JACM 2015) as a formalisation of the core functionality of the query language AQL used in IBM's SystemT) additionally need string-equality selections and it has been shown by Freydenberger and Holldack (ICDT 2016, Theory of Computing Systems 2018) that this leads to high complexity and even undecidability of the typical problems in static analysis and query evaluation. We propose an alternative approach to core spanners: by incorporating the string-equality selections directly into the regular language that represents the underlying regular spanner (instead of treating it as an algebraic operation on the table extracted by the regular spanner), we obtain a fragment of core spanners that, while having slightly weaker expressive power than the full class of core spanners, arguably still covers the intuitive applications of string-equality selections for information extraction and has much better upper complexity bounds of the typical problems in static analysis and query evaluation.</description>
