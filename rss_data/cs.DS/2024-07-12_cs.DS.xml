      <title>Revisiting the Folklore Algorithm for Random Access to Grammar-Compressed Strings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.08190</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.08190v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Grammar-based compression is a widely-accepted model of string compression that allows for efficient and direct manipulations on the compressed data. Most, if not all, such manipulations rely on the primitive \emph{random access} queries, a task of quickly returning the character at a specified position of the original uncompressed string without explicit decompression. While there are advanced data structures for random access to grammar-compressed strings that guarantee theoretical query time and space bounds, little has been done for the \emph{practical} perspective of this important problem. In this paper, we revisit a well-known folklore random access algorithm for grammars in the Chomsky normal form, modify it to work directly on general grammars, and show that this modified version is fast and memory efficient in practice.</description>

      <title>Hybrid k-Clustering: Blending k-Median and k-Center</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.08295</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.08295v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose a novel clustering model encompassing two well-known clustering models: k-center clustering and k-median clustering. In the Hybrid k-Clusetring problem, given a set P of points in R^d, an integer k, and a non-negative real r, our objective is to position k closed balls of radius r to minimize the sum of distances from points not covered by the balls to their closest balls. Equivalently, we seek an optimal L_1-fitting of a union of k balls of radius r to a set of points in the Euclidean space. When r=0, this corresponds to k-median; when the minimum sum is zero, indicating complete coverage of all points, it is k-center.
  Our primary result is a bicriteria approximation algorithm that, for a given \epsilon&gt;0, produces a hybrid k-clustering with balls of radius (1+\epsilon)r. This algorithm achieves a cost at most 1+\epsilon of the optimum, and it operates in time 2^{(kd/\epsilon)^{O(1)}} n^{O(1)}. Notably, considering the established lower bounds on k-center and k-median, our bicriteria approximation stands as the best possible result for Hybrid k-Clusetring.</description>

      <title>Improved online load balancing with known makespan</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.08376</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.08376v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We break the barrier of $3/2$ for the problem of online load balancing with known makespan, also known as bin stretching. In this problem, $m$ identical machines and the optimal makespan are given. The load of a machine is the total size of all the jobs assigned to it and the makespan is the maximum load of all the machines. Jobs arrive online and the goal is to assign each job to a machine while staying within a small factor (the competitive ratio) of the optimal makespan. We present an algorithm that maintains a competitive ratio of $139/93&lt;1.495$ for sufficiently large values of $m$, improving the previous bound of $3/2$. The value 3/2 represents a natural bound for this problem: as long as the online bins are of size at least $3/2$ of the offline bin, all items that fit at least two times in an offline bin have two nice properties. They fit three times in an online bin and a single such item can be packed together with an item of any size in an online bin. These properties are now both lost, which means that putting even one job on a wrong machine can leave some job unassigned at the end. It also makes it harder to determine good thresholds for the item types. This was one of the main technical issues in getting below $3/2$. The analysis consists of an intricate mixture of size and weight arguments.</description>

      <title>Improved FPT Approximation for Non-metric TSP</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.08392</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.08392v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the Traveling Salesperson Problem (TSP) we are given a list of locations and the distances between each pair of them. The goal is to find the shortest possible tour that visits each location exactly once and returns to the starting location. Inspired by the fact that general TSP cannot be approximated in polynomial time within any constant factor, while metric TSP admits a (slightly better than) $1.5$-approximation in polynomial time, Zhou, Li and Guo [Zhou et al., ISAAC '22] introduced a parameter that measures the distance of a given TSP instance from the metric case. They gave an FPT $3$-approximation algorithm parameterized by $k$, where $k$ is the number of triangles in which the edge costs violate the triangle inequality. In this paper, we design a $2.5$-approximation algorithm that runs in FPT time, improving the result of [Zhou et al., ISAAC '22].</description>

      <title>A Note on the Conditional Optimality of Chiba and Nishizeki's Algorithms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.08562</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.08562v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In a seminal work, Chiba and Nishizeki [SIAM J. Comput. `85] developed subgraph listing algorithms for triangles, 4-cycle and $k$-cliques, where $k \geq 3.$ The runtimes of their algorithms are parameterized by the number of edges $m$ and the arboricity $\alpha$ of a graph. The arboricity $\alpha$ of a graph is the minimum number of spanning forests required to cover it. Their work introduces: * A triangle listing algorithm that runs in $O(m\alpha)$ time. * An output-sensitive 4-Cycle-Listing algorithm that lists all 4-cycles in $O(m\alpha + t)$ time, where $t$ is the number of 4-cycles in the graph. * A k-Clique-Listing algorithm that runs in $O(m\alpha^{k-2})$ time, for $k \geq 4.$
  Despite the widespread use of these algorithms in practice, no improvements have been made over them in the past few decades. Therefore, recent work has gone into studying lower bounds for subgraph listing problems. The works of Kopelowitz, Pettie and Porat [SODA `16] and Vassilevska W. and Xu [FOCS `20] showed that the triangle-listing algorithm of Chiba and Nishizeki is optimal under the $\mathsf{3SUM}$ and $\mathsf{APSP}$ hypotheses respectively. However, it remained open whether the remaining algorithms were optimal.
  In this note, we show that in fact all the above algorithms are optimal under popular hardness conjectures. First, we show that the $\mathsf{4}\text{-}\mathsf{Cycle}\text{-}\mathsf{Listing}$ algorithm is tight under the $\mathsf{3SUM}$ hypothesis following the techniques of Jin and Xu [STOC `23], and Abboud, Bringmann and Fishcher [STOC `23] . Additionally, we show that the $k\text{-}\mathsf{Clique}\text{-}\mathsf{Listing}$ algorithm is essentially tight under the exact $k$-clique hypothesis by following the techniques of Dalirooyfard, Mathialagan, Vassilevska W. and Xu [STOC `24]. These hardness results hold even when the number of 4-cycles or $k$-cliques in the graph is small.</description>

      <title>Spectral Independence via Stability and Applications to Holant-Type Problems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2106.03366</link>
      <description>arXiv:2106.03366v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper formalizes connections between stability of polynomials and convergence rates of Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) algorithms. We prove that if a (multivariate) partition function is nonzero in a region around a real point $\lambda$ then spectral independence holds at $\lambda$. As a consequence, for Holant-type problems (e.g., spin systems) on bounded-degree graphs, we obtain optimal $O(n\log n)$ mixing time bounds for the single-site update Markov chain known as the Glauber dynamics. Our result significantly improves the running time guarantees obtained via the polynomial interpolation method of Barvinok (2017), refined by Patel and Regts (2017).
  There are a variety of applications of our results. In this paper, we focus on Holant-type (i.e., edge-coloring) problems, including weighted edge covers and weighted even subgraphs. For the weighted edge cover problem (and several natural generalizations) we obtain an $O(n\log{n})$ sampling algorithm on bounded-degree graphs. The even subgraphs problem corresponds to the high-temperature expansion of the ferromagnetic Ising model. We obtain an $O(n\log{n})$ sampling algorithm for the ferromagnetic Ising model with a nonzero external field on bounded-degree graphs, which improves upon the classical result of Jerrum and Sinclair (1993) for this class of graphs. We obtain further applications to antiferromagnetic two-spin models on line graphs, weighted graph homomorphisms, tensor networks, and more.</description>

      <title>Counting Distinct Elements in the Turnstile Model with Differential Privacy under Continual Observation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.06723</link>
      <description>arXiv:2306.06723v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Privacy is a central challenge for systems that learn from sensitive data sets, especially when a system's outputs must be continuously updated to reflect changing data. We consider the achievable error for differentially private continual release of a basic statistic - the number of distinct items - in a stream where items may be both inserted and deleted (the turnstile model). With only insertions, existing algorithms have additive error just polylogarithmic in the length of the stream $T$. We uncover a much richer landscape in the turnstile model, even without considering memory restrictions. We show that every differentially private mechanism that handles insertions and deletions has worst-case additive error at least $T^{1/4}$ even under a relatively weak, event-level privacy definition. Then, we identify a parameter of the input stream, its maximum flippancy, that is low for natural data streams and for which we give tight parameterized error guarantees. Specifically, the maximum flippancy is the largest number of times that the contribution of a single item to the distinct elements count changes over the course of the stream. We present an item-level differentially private mechanism that, for all turnstile streams with maximum flippancy $w$, continually outputs the number of distinct elements with an $O(\sqrt{w} \cdot poly\log T)$ additive error, without requiring prior knowledge of $w$. We prove that this is the best achievable error bound that depends only on $w$, for a large range of values of $w$. When $w$ is small, the error of our mechanism is similar to the polylogarithmic in $T$ error in the insertion-only setting, bypassing the hardness in the turnstile model.</description>

      <title>A Global Analysis of the Primal-Dual Method for Pliable Families</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.15714</link>
      <description>arXiv:2308.15714v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study a core algorithmic problem in network design called $\mathcal{F}$-augmentation that involves increasing the connectivity of a given family of cuts $\mathcal{F}$. Over 30 years ago, Williamson et al. (STOC `93) provided a 2-approximation primal-dual algorithm when $\mathcal{F}$ is a so-called uncrossable family but extending their results to families that are non-uncrossable has remained a challenging question.
  In this paper, we introduce the concept of the crossing density of a set family and show how this opens up a completely new approach to analyzing primal-dual algorithms. We study pliable families, a strict generalization of uncrossable families introduced by Bansal et al. (ICALP `23), and provide the first approximation algorithm for $\mathcal{F}$-augmentation of such families based on the crossing density.
  We also improve on the results in Bansal et al. (ICALP `23) by providing a 5-approximation algorithm for the $\mathcal{F}$-augmentation problem when $\mathcal{F}$ is a family of near min-cuts using the concept of crossing densities. This immediately improves approximation factors for the Capacitated Network Design Problem.
  Finally, we study the $(p,3)$-flexible graph connectivity problem. By carefully analyzing the structure of feasible solutions and using the techniques developed in this paper, we provide the first constant factor approximation algorithm for this problem exhibiting a 12-approximation algorithm.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2310.09638v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This article introduces a quick and simple combinatorial approximation algorithm for the Weighted correlation clustering problem. In this problem, we have a set of vertices and two difference and similarity weight values for each pair of vertices, and the goal is to cluster the vertices with minimum total intra-cluster difference weights plus inter-cluster similarity weights. Our algorithm's approximation factor is 3 when an instance of this problem satisfies probability constraints (the best-known was 5). If the instance satisfies triangle inequality in addition to probability constraints, the approximation factor is 1.6 (the best-known was 2).</description>

      <title>Approximation and FPT Algorithms for Finding DM-Irreducible Spanning Subgraphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.17927</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.17927v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Finding a minimum-weight strongly connected spanning subgraph of an edge-weighted directed graph is equivalent to the weighted version of the well-known strong connectivity augmentation problem, and it is NP-hard. For this problem, a simple $2$-approximation algorithm was proposed by Frederickson and J{\'a}j{\'a} (1981); surprisingly, it still achieves the best-known approximation ratio in general. Also, the unweighted problem was shown to be FPT (fixed-parameter tractable) by Bang-Jensen and Yeo (2008), if it is parameterized by the difference from the trivial upper bound of the optimal value. In this paper, we consider a generalized problem related to the Dulmage--Mendelsohn decompositions of bipartite graphs instead of the strong connectivity of directed graphs, and extend these approximation and FPT results to the generalized setting.</description>

      <title>Finding Spanning Trees with Perfect Matchings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.02958</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.02958v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate the tractability of a simple fusion of two fundamental structures on graphs, a spanning tree and a perfect matching. Specifically, we consider the following problem: given an edge-weighted graph, find a minimum-weight spanning tree among those containing a perfect matching. On the positive side, we design a simple greedy algorithm for the case when the graph is complete (or complete bipartite) and the edge weights take at most two values. On the negative side, the problem is NP-hard even when the graph is complete (or complete bipartite) and the edge weights take at most three values, or when the graph is cubic, planar, and bipartite and the edge weights take at most two values.
  We also consider an interesting variant. We call a tree strongly balanced if on one side of the bipartition of the vertex set with respect to the tree, all but one of the vertices have degree $2$ and the remaining one is a leaf. This property is a sufficient condition for a tree to have a perfect matching, which enjoys an additional property. When the underlying graph is bipartite, strongly balanced spanning trees can be written as matroid intersection, and this fact was recently utilized to design an approximation algorithm for some kind of connectivity augmentation problem. The natural question is its tractability in nonbipartite graphs. As a negative answer, it turns out NP-hard to test whether a given graph has a strongly balanced spanning tree or not even when the graph is subcubic and planar.</description>

      <title>Polynomial Time Algorithms for Integer Programming and Unbounded Subset Sum in the Total Regime</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.05435</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.05435v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The Unbounded Subset Sum (USS) problem is an NP-hard computational problem where the goal is to decide whether there exist non-negative integers $x_1, \ldots, x_n$ such that $x_1 a_1 + \ldots + x_n a_n = b$, where $a_1 &lt; \cdots &lt; a_n &lt; b$ are distinct positive integers with $\text{gcd}(a_1, \ldots, a_n)$ dividing $b$. The problem can be solved in pseudopolynomial time, while specialized cases, such as when $b$ exceeds the Frobenius number of $a_1, \ldots, a_n$ simplify to a total problem where a solution always exists.
  This paper explores the concept of totality in USS. The challenge in this setting is to actually find a solution, even though we know its existence is guaranteed. We focus on the instances of USS where solutions are guaranteed for large $b$. We show that when $b$ is slightly greater than the Frobenius number, we can find the solution to USS in polynomial time.
  We then show how our results extend to Integer Programming with Equalities (ILPE), highlighting conditions under which ILPE becomes total. We investigate the diagonal Frobenius number, which is the appropriate generalization of the Frobenius number to this context. In this setting, we give a polynomial-time algorithm to find a solution of ILPE. The bound obtained from our algorithmic procedure for finding a solution almost matches the recent existential bound of Bach, Eisenbrand, Rothvoss, and Weismantel (2024).</description>

      <title>Reductive Quantum Phase Estimation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.04471</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.04471v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Estimating a quantum phase is a necessary task in a wide range of fields of quantum science. To accomplish this task, two well-known methods have been developed in distinct contexts, namely, Ramsey interferometry (RI) in atomic and molecular physics and quantum phase estimation (QPE) in quantum computing. We demonstrate that these canonical examples are instances of a larger class of phase estimation protocols, which we call reductive quantum phase estimation (RQPE) circuits. Here we present an explicit algorithm that allows one to create an RQPE circuit. This circuit distinguishes an arbitrary set of phases with a fewer number of qubits and unitary applications, thereby solving a general class of quantum hypothesis testing to which RI and QPE belong. We further demonstrate a trade-off between measurement precision and phase distinguishability, which allows one to tune the circuit to be optimal for a specific application.</description>

      <title>Differentially Private Multiway and $k$-Cut</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.06911</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.06911v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we address the challenge of differential privacy in the context of graph cuts, specifically focusing on the minimum $k$-cut and multiway cut problems. We introduce edge-differentially private algorithms that achieve nearly optimal performance for these problems.
  For the multiway cut problem, we first provide a private algorithm with a multiplicative approximation ratio that matches the state-of-the-art non-private algorithm. We then present a tight information-theoretic lower bound on the additive error, demonstrating that our algorithm on weighted graphs is near-optimal for constant $k$. For the minimum $k$-cut problem, our algorithms leverage a known bound on the number of approximate $k$-cuts, resulting in a private algorithm with optimal additive error $O(k\log n)$ for fixed privacy parameter. We also establish a information-theoretic lower bound that matches this additive error. Additionally, we give an efficient private algorithm for $k$-cut even for non-constant $k$, including a polynomial-time 2-approximation with an additive error of $\widetilde{O}(k^{1.5})$.</description>
