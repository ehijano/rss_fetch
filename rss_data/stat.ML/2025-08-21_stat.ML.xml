      <title>Comparing Model-agnostic Feature Selection Methods through Relative Efficiency</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.14268</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.14268v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Feature selection and importance estimation in a model-agnostic setting is an ongoing challenge of significant interest. Wrapper methods are commonly used because they are typically model-agnostic, even though they are computationally intensive. In this paper, we focus on feature selection methods related to the Generalized Covariance Measure (GCM) and Leave-One-Covariate-Out (LOCO) estimation, and provide a comparison based on relative efficiency. In particular, we present a theoretical comparison under three model settings: linear models, non-linear additive models, and single index models that mimic a single-layer neural network. We complement this with extensive simulations and real data examples. Our theoretical results, along with empirical findings, demonstrate that GCM-related methods generally outperform LOCO under suitable regularity conditions. Furthermore, we quantify the asymptotic relative efficiency of these approaches. Our simulations and real data analysis include widely used machine learning methods such as neural networks and gradient boosting trees.</description>

      <title>Evaluation and Optimization of Leave-one-out Cross-validation for the Lasso</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.14368</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.14368v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: I develop an algorithm to produce the piecewise quadratic that computes leave-one-out cross-validation for the lasso as a function of its hyperparameter. The algorithm can be used to find exact hyperparameters that optimize leave-one-out cross-validation either globally or locally, and its practicality is demonstrated on real-world data sets.</description>

      <title>The C-index Multiverse</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.14821</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.14821v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantifying out-of-sample discrimination performance for time-to-event outcomes is a fundamental step for model evaluation and selection in the context of predictive modelling. The concordance index, or C-index, is a widely used metric for this purpose, particularly with the growing development of machine learning methods. Beyond differences between proposed C-index estimators (e.g. Harrell's, Uno's and Antolini's), we demonstrate the existence of a C-index multiverse among available R and python software, where seemingly equal implementations can yield different results. This can undermine reproducibility and complicate fair comparisons across models and studies. Key variation sources include tie handling and adjustment to censoring. Additionally, the absence of a standardised approach to summarise risk from survival distributions, result in another source of variation dependent on input types. We demonstrate the consequences of the C-index multiverse when quantifying predictive performance for several survival models (from Cox proportional hazards to recent deep learning approaches) on publicly available breast cancer data, and semi-synthetic examples. Our work emphasises the need for better reporting to improve transparency and reproducibility. This article aims to be a useful guideline, helping analysts when navigating the multiverse, providing unified documentation and highlighting potential pitfalls of existing software.

      <title>Noise Robust One-Class Intrusion Detection on Dynamic Graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.14192</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.14192v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In the domain of network intrusion detection, robustness against contaminated and noisy data inputs remains a critical challenge. This study introduces a probabilistic version of the Temporal Graph Network Support Vector Data Description (TGN-SVDD) model, designed to enhance detection accuracy in the presence of input noise. By predicting parameters of a Gaussian distribution for each network event, our model is able to naturally address noisy adversarials and improve robustness compared to a baseline model. Our experiments on a modified CIC-IDS2017 data set with synthetic noise demonstrate significant improvements in detection performance compared to the baseline TGN-SVDD model, especially as noise levels increase.</description>

      <title>Optimal Subspace Embeddings: Resolving Nelson-Nguyen Conjecture Up to Sub-Polylogarithmic Factors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.14234</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.14234v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We give a proof of the conjecture of Nelson and Nguyen [FOCS 2013] on the optimal dimension and sparsity of oblivious subspace embeddings, up to sub-polylogarithmic factors: For any $n\geq d$ and $\epsilon\geq d^{-O(1)}$, there is a random $\tilde O(d/\epsilon^2)\times n$ matrix $\Pi$ with $\tilde O(\log(d)/\epsilon)$ non-zeros per column such that for any $A\in\mathbb{R}^{n\times d}$, with high probability, $(1-\epsilon)\|Ax\|\leq\|\Pi Ax\|\leq(1+\epsilon)\|Ax\|$ for all $x\in\mathbb{R}^d$, where $\tilde O(\cdot)$ hides only sub-polylogarithmic factors in $d$. Our result in particular implies a new fastest sub-current matrix multiplication time reduction of size $\tilde O(d/\epsilon^2)$ for a broad class of $n\times d$ linear regression tasks.
  A key novelty in our analysis is a matrix concentration technique we call iterative decoupling, which we use to fine-tune the higher-order trace moment bounds attainable via existing random matrix universality tools [Brailovskaya and van Handel, GAFA 2024].</description>

      <title>Amortized Bayesian Meta-Learning for Low-Rank Adaptation of Large Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.14285</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.14285v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Fine-tuning large language models (LLMs) with low-rank adaptaion (LoRA) is a cost-effective way to incorporate information from a specific dataset. However, it is often unclear how well the fine-tuned LLM will generalize, i.e., how well it will perform on unseen datasets. Methods have been proposed to improve generalization by optimizing with in-context prompts, or by using meta-learning to fine-tune LLMs. However, these methods are expensive in memory and computation, requiring either long-context prompts or saving copies of parameters and using second-order gradient updates. To address these challenges, we propose Amortized Bayesian Meta-Learning for LoRA (ABMLL). This method builds on amortized Bayesian meta-learning for smaller models, adapting this approach to LLMs while maintaining its computational efficiency. We reframe task-specific and global parameters in the context of LoRA and use a set of new hyperparameters to balance reconstruction accuracy and the fidelity of task-specific parameters to the global ones. ABMLL provides effective generalization and scales to large models such as Llama3-8B. Furthermore, as a result of using a Bayesian framework, ABMLL provides improved uncertainty quantification. We test ABMLL on Unified-QA and CrossFit datasets and find that it outperforms existing methods on these benchmarks in terms of both accuracy and expected calibration error.</description>

      <title>A Non-Asymptotic Convergent Analysis for Scored-Based Graph Generative Model via a System of Stochastic Differential Equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.14351</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.14351v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Score-based graph generative models (SGGMs) have proven effective in critical applications such as drug discovery and protein synthesis. However, their theoretical behavior, particularly regarding convergence, remains underexplored. Unlike common score-based generative models (SGMs), which are governed by a single stochastic differential equation (SDE), SGGMs involve a system of coupled SDEs. In SGGMs, the graph structure and node features are governed by separate but interdependent SDEs. This distinction makes existing convergence analyses from SGMs inapplicable for SGGMs. In this work, we present the first non-asymptotic convergence analysis for SGGMs, focusing on the convergence bound (the risk of generative error) across three key graph generation paradigms: (1) feature generation with a fixed graph structure, (2) graph structure generation with fixed node features, and (3) joint generation of both graph structure and node features. Our analysis reveals several unique factors specific to SGGMs (e.g., the topological properties of the graph structure) which affect the convergence bound. Additionally, we offer theoretical insights into the selection of hyperparameters (e.g., sampling steps and diffusion length) and advocate for techniques like normalization to improve convergence. To validate our theoretical findings, we conduct a controlled empirical study using synthetic graph models, and the results align with our theoretical predictions. This work deepens the theoretical understanding of SGGMs, demonstrates their applicability in critical domains, and provides practical guidance for designing effective models.</description>

      <title>Measuring IIA Violations in Similarity Choices with Bayesian Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.14615</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.14615v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Similarity choice data occur when humans make choices among alternatives based on their similarity to a target, e.g., in the context of information retrieval and in embedding learning settings. Classical metric-based models of similarity choice assume independence of irrelevant alternatives (IIA), a property that allows for a simpler formulation. While IIA violations have been detected in many discrete choice settings, the similarity choice setting has received scant attention. This is because the target-dependent nature of the choice complicates IIA testing. We propose two statistical methods to test for IIA: a classical goodness-of-fit test and a Bayesian counterpart based on the framework of Posterior Predictive Checks (PPC). This Bayesian approach, our main technical contribution, quantifies the degree of IIA violation beyond its mere significance. We curate two datasets: one with choice sets designed to elicit IIA violations, and another with randomly generated choice sets from the same item universe. Our tests confirmed significant IIA violations on both datasets, and notably, we find a comparable degree of violation between them. Further, we devise a new PPC test for population homogeneity. Results show that the population is indeed homogenous, suggesting that the IIA violations are driven by context effects -- specifically, interactions within the choice sets. These results highlight the need for new similarity choice models that account for such context effects.</description>

      <title>Data Fusion for High-Resolution Estimation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.14858</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.14858v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: High-resolution estimates of population health indicators are critical for precision public health. We propose a method for high-resolution estimation that fuses distinct data sources: an unbiased, low-resolution data source (e.g. aggregated administrative data) and a potentially biased, high-resolution data source (e.g. individual-level online survey responses). We assume that the potentially biased, high-resolution data source is generated from the population under a model of sampling bias where observables can have arbitrary impact on the probability of response but the difference in the log probabilities of response between units with the same observables is linear in the difference between sufficient statistics of their observables and outcomes. Our data fusion method learns a distribution that is closest (in the sense of KL divergence) to the online survey distribution and consistent with the aggregated administrative data and our model of sampling bias. This method outperforms baselines that rely on either data source alone on a testbed that includes repeated measurements of three indicators measured by both the (online) Household Pulse Survey and ground-truth data sources at two geographic resolutions over the same time period.</description>

      <title>Comparison of parallel SMC and MCMC for Bayesian deep learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.06173</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.06173v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This work systematically compares parallel implementations of consistent (asymptotically unbiased) Bayesian deep learning algorithms: sequential Monte Carlo sampler (SMC$_\parallel$) or Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC$_\parallel$). We provide a proof of convergence for SMC$_\parallel$ showing that it theoretically achieves the same level of convergence as a single monolithic SMC sampler, while the reduced communication lowers wall-clock time. It is well-known that the first samples from MCMC need to be discarded to eliminate initialization bias, and that the number of discarded samples must grow like the logarithm of the number of parallel chains to control that bias for MCMC$_\parallel$. A systematic empirical numerical study on MNIST, CIFAR, and IMDb, reveals that parallel implementations of both methods perform comparably to non-parallel implementations in terms of performance and total cost, and also comparably to each other. However, both methods still require a large wall-clock time, and suffer from catastrophic non-convergence if they aren't run for long enough.</description>

      <title>Sharp Generalization for Nonparametric Regression in Interpolation Space by Over-Parameterized Neural Networks Trained with Preconditioned Gradient Descent and Early-Stopping</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.11353</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.11353v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study nonparametric regression using an over-parameterized two-layer neural networks trained with algorithmic guarantees in this paper. We consider the setting where the training features are drawn uniformly from the unit sphere in $\mathbb{R}^d$, and the target function lies in an interpolation space commonly studied in statistical learning theory. We demonstrate that training the neural network with a novel Preconditioned Gradient Descent (PGD) algorithm, equipped with early stopping, achieves a sharp regression rate of $\mathcal O(n^{-\frac{2\alpha s'}{2\alpha s'+1}})$ when the target function is in the interpolation space $[\mathcal H_K]^{s'}$ with $s' \ge 3$. This rate is even sharper than the currently known nearly-optimal rate of $\mathcal O(n^{-\frac{2\alpha s'}{2\alpha s'+1}})\log^2(1/\delta)$~\citep{Li2024-edr-general-domain}, where $n$ is the size of the training data and $\delta \in (0,1)$ is a small probability. This rate is also sharper than the standard kernel regression rate of $\mathcal O(n^{-\frac{2\alpha}{2\alpha+1}})$ obtained under the regular Neural Tangent Kernel (NTK) regime when training the neural network with the vanilla gradient descent (GD), where $2\alpha = d/(d-1)$. Our analysis is based on two key technical contributions. First, we present a principled decomposition of the network output at each PGD step into a function in the reproducing kernel Hilbert space (RKHS) of a newly induced integral kernel, and a residual function with small $L^{\infty}$-norm. Second, leveraging this decomposition, we apply local Rademacher complexity theory to tightly control the complexity of the function class comprising all the neural network functions obtained in the PGD iterates. Our results further suggest that PGD enables the neural network to escape the linear NTK regime and achieve improved generalization by inducing a new integral kernel of lower kernel complexity.</description>

      <title>Parallelly Tempered Generative Adversarial Nets: Toward Stabilized Gradients</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.11786</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.11786v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A generative adversarial network (GAN) has been a representative backbone model in generative artificial intelligence (AI) because of its powerful performance in capturing intricate data-generating processes. However, the GAN training is well-known for its notorious training instability, usually characterized by the occurrence of mode collapse. Through the lens of gradients' variance, this work particularly analyzes the training instability and inefficiency in the presence of mode collapse by linking it to multimodality in the target distribution. To ease the raised training issues from severe multimodality, we introduce a novel GAN training framework that leverages a series of tempered distributions produced via convex interpolation. With our newly developed GAN objective function, the generator can learn all the tempered distributions simultaneously, conceptually resonating with the parallel tempering in statistics. Our simulation studies demonstrate the superiority of our approach over existing popular training strategies in both image and tabular data synthesis. We theoretically analyze that such significant improvement can arise from reducing the variance of gradient estimates by using the tempered distributions. Finally, we further develop a variant of the proposed framework aimed at generating fair synthetic data which is one of the growing interests in the field of trustworthy AI.</description>

      <title>Towards Understanding Gradient Dynamics of the Sliced-Wasserstein Distance via Critical Point Analysis</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.06525v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we investigate the properties of the Sliced Wasserstein Distance (SW) when employed as an objective functional. The SW metric has gained significant interest in the optimal transport and machine learning literature, due to its ability to capture intricate geometric properties of probability distributions while remaining computationally tractable, making it a valuable tool for various applications, including generative modeling and domain adaptation. Our study aims to provide a rigorous analysis of the critical points arising from the optimization of the SW objective. By computing explicit perturbations, we establish that stable critical points of SW cannot concentrate on segments. This stability analysis is crucial for understanding the behaviour of optimization algorithms for models trained using the SW objective. Furthermore, we investigate the properties of the SW objective, shedding light on the existence and convergence behavior of critical points. We illustrate our theoretical results through numerical experiments.</description>

      <title>Learning to Solve Related Linear Systems</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.17265v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Solving multiple parametrised related systems is an essential component of many numerical tasks, and learning from the already solved systems will make this process faster. In this work, we propose a novel probabilistic linear solver over the parameter space. This leverages information from the solved linear systems in a regression setting to provide an efficient posterior mean and covariance. We advocate using this as companion regression model for the preconditioned conjugate gradient method, and discuss the favourable properties of the posterior mean and covariance as the initial guess and preconditioner. We also provide several design choices for this companion solver. Numerical experiments showcase the benefits of using our novel solver in a hyperparameter optimisation problem.</description>

      <title>The Kikuchi Hierarchy and Tensor PCA</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/1904.03858</link>
      <description>arXiv:1904.03858v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: For the tensor PCA (principal component analysis) problem, we propose a new hierarchy of increasingly powerful algorithms with increasing runtime. Our hierarchy is analogous to the sum-of-squares (SOS) hierarchy but is instead inspired by statistical physics and related algorithms such as belief propagation and AMP (approximate message passing). Our level-$\ell$ algorithm can be thought of as a linearized message-passing algorithm that keeps track of $\ell$-wise dependencies among the hidden variables. Specifically, our algorithms are spectral methods based on the Kikuchi Hessian, which generalizes the well-studied Bethe Hessian to the higher-order Kikuchi free energies.
  It is known that AMP, the flagship algorithm of statistical physics, has substantially worse performance than SOS for tensor PCA. In this work we 'redeem' the statistical physics approach by showing that our hierarchy gives a polynomial-time algorithm matching the performance of SOS. Our hierarchy also yields a continuum of subexponential-time algorithms, and we prove that these achieve the same (conjecturally optimal) tradeoff between runtime and statistical power as SOS. Our proofs are much simpler than prior work, and also apply to the related problem of refuting random $k$-XOR formulas. The results we present here apply to tensor PCA for tensors of all orders, and to $k$-XOR when $k$ is even.
  Our methods suggest a new avenue for systematically obtaining optimal algorithms for Bayesian inference problems, and our results constitute a step toward unifying the statistical physics and sum-of-squares approaches to algorithm design.</description>

      <title>Behind the Myth of Exploration in Policy Gradients</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.00162</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.00162v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In order to compute near-optimal policies with policy-gradient algorithms, it is common in practice to include intrinsic exploration terms in the learning objective. Although the effectiveness of these terms is usually justified by an intrinsic need to explore environments, we propose a novel analysis with the lens of numerical optimization. Two criteria are introduced on the learning objective and two others on its stochastic gradient estimates, and are afterwards used to discuss the quality of the policy after optimization. The analysis sheds light on two separate effects of exploration techniques. First, they make it possible to smooth the learning objective and to eliminate local optima while preserving the global maximum. Second, they modify the gradient estimates, increasing the probability that the stochastic parameter updates eventually provide an optimal policy. We empirically illustrate these effects with exploration strategies based on entropy bonuses, identifying limitations and suggesting directions for future work.</description>

      <title>Improving Actor-Critic Training with Steerable Action-Value Approximation Errors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.03890</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.03890v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Off-policy actor-critic algorithms have shown strong potential in deep reinforcement learning for continuous control tasks. Their success primarily comes from leveraging pessimistic state-action value function updates, which reduce function approximation errors and stabilize learning. However, excessive pessimism can limit exploration, preventing the agent from effectively refining its policies. Conversely, optimism can encourage exploration but may lead to high-risk behaviors and unstable learning if not carefully managed. To address this trade-off, we propose Utility Soft Actor-Critic (USAC), a novel framework that allows independent, interpretable control of pessimism and optimism for both the actor and the critic. USAC dynamically adapts its exploration strategy based on the uncertainty of critics using a utility function, enabling a task-specific balance between optimism and pessimism. This approach goes beyond binary choices of pessimism or optimism, making the method both theoretically meaningful and practically feasible. Experiments across a variety of continuous control tasks show that adjusting the degree of pessimism or optimism significantly impacts performance. When configured appropriately, USAC consistently outperforms state-of-the-art algorithms, demonstrating its practical utility and feasibility.</description>

      <title>Ranking by Lifts: A Cost-Benefit Approach to Large-Scale A/B Tests</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.01036</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.01036v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A/B testing is a core tool for decision-making in business experimentation, particularly in digital platforms and marketplaces. Practitioners often prioritize lift in performance metrics while seeking to control the costs of false discoveries. This paper develops a decision-theoretic framework for maximizing expected profit subject to a constraint on the cost-weighted false discovery rate (FDR). We propose an empirical Bayes approach that uses a greedy knapsack algorithm to rank experiments based on the ratio of expected lift to cost, incorporating the local false discovery rate (lfdr) as a key statistic. The resulting oracle rule is valid and rank-optimal. In large-scale settings, we establish the asymptotic validity of a data-driven implementation and demonstrate superior finite-sample performance over existing FDR-controlling methods. An application to A/B tests run on the Optimizely platform highlights the business value of the approach.</description>

      <title>Simplifying Random Forests' Probabilistic Forecasts</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.12332</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.12332v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Since their introduction by Breiman, Random Forests (RFs) have proven to be useful for both classification and regression tasks. The RF prediction of a previously unseen observation can be represented as a weighted sum of all training sample observations. This nearest-neighbor-type representation is useful, among other things, for constructing forecast distributions (Meinshausen, 2006). In this paper, we consider simplifying RF-based forecast distributions by sparsifying them. That is, we focus on a small subset of $k$ nearest neighbors while setting the remaining weights to zero. This simplification, which we refer to as `Top$k$', greatly improves the interpretability of RF predictions. It can be applied to any forecasting task without re-training existing RF models. In empirical experiments, we document that the simplified predictions can be similar to or exceed the original ones in terms of forecasting performance. We explore the statistical sources of this finding via a stylized analytical model of RFs. The model suggests that simplification is particularly promising if the unknown true forecast distribution contains many small weights that are estimated imprecisely.</description>

      <title>Non-asymptotic bounds for forward processes in denoising diffusions: Ornstein-Uhlenbeck is hard to beat</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.13799</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.13799v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Denoising diffusion probabilistic models (DDPMs) represent a recent advance in generative modelling that has delivered state-of-the-art results across many domains of applications. Despite their success, a rigorous theoretical understanding of the error within DDPMs, particularly the non-asymptotic bounds required for the comparison of their efficiency, remain scarce. Making minimal assumptions on the initial data distribution, allowing for example the manifold hypothesis, this paper presents explicit non-asymptotic bounds on the forward diffusion error in total variation (TV), expressed as a function of the terminal time $T$.
  We parametrise multi-modal data distributions in terms of the distance $R$ to their furthest modes and consider forward diffusions with additive and multiplicative noise. Our analysis rigorously proves that, under mild assumptions, the canonical choice of the Ornstein-Uhlenbeck (OU) process cannot be significantly improved in terms of reducing the terminal time $T$ as a function of $R$ and error tolerance $\varepsilon&gt;0$. Motivated by data distributions arising in generative modelling, we also establish a cut-off like phenomenon (as $R\to\infty$) for the convergence to its invariant measure in TV of an OU process, initialized at a multi-modal distribution with maximal mode distance $R$.</description>

      <title>SLED: Self Logits Evolution Decoding for Improving Factuality in Large Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.02433</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.02433v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities, but their outputs can sometimes be unreliable or factually incorrect. To address this, we introduce Self Logits Evolution Decoding (SLED), a novel decoding framework that enhances the truthfulness of LLMs without relying on external knowledge bases or requiring further fine-tuning. From an optimization perspective, our SLED framework leverages the latent knowledge embedded within the LLM by contrasting the output logits from the final layer with those from early layers. It then utilizes an approximate gradient approach to enable latent knowledge to guide the self-refinement of outputs, thereby effectively improving factual accuracy. Extensive experiments have been conducted on established benchmarks across a diverse range of model families (Gemma, Qwen, Mixtral, gpt-oss) and scales (from 1B to 45B), including more advanced architectural configurations such as the mixture of experts (MoE). Our evaluation spans a wide variety of tasks and the results demonstrate that SLED consistently improves factual accuracy compared to existing decoding methods while maintaining natural language fluency and negligible latency overhead. Furthermore, it can be flexibly combined with other decoding methods to further enhance their performance.</description>

      <title>Adaptive Experiments Under Data Sparse Settings: Applications for Educational Platforms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.03999</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.03999v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Adaptive experimentation is increasingly used in educational platforms to personalize learning through dynamic content and feedback. However, standard adaptive strategies such as Thompson Sampling often underperform in real-world educational settings where content variations are numerous and student participation is limited, resulting in sparse data. In particular, Thompson Sampling can lead to imbalanced content allocation and delayed convergence on which aspects of content are most effective for student learning. To address these challenges, we introduce Weighted Allocation Probability Adjusted Thompson Sampling (WAPTS), an algorithm that refines the sampling strategy to improve content-related decision-making in data-sparse environments. WAPTS is guided by the principle of lenient regret, allowing near-optimal allocations to accelerate learning while still exploring promising content. We evaluate WAPTS in a learnersourcing scenario where students rate peer-generated learning materials, and demonstrate that it enables earlier and more reliable identification of promising treatments.</description>

      <title>Generalizable Spectral Embedding with an Application to UMAP</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.11305</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.11305v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Spectral Embedding (SE) is a popular method for dimensionality reduction, applicable across diverse domains. Nevertheless, its current implementations face three prominent drawbacks which curtail its broader applicability: generalizability (i.e., out-of-sample extension), scalability, and eigenvectors separation. Existing SE implementations often address two of these drawbacks; however, they fall short in addressing the remaining one. In this paper, we introduce Sep-SpectralNet (eigenvector-separated SpectralNet), a SE implementation designed to address all three limitations. Sep-SpectralNet extends SpectralNet with an efficient post-processing step to achieve eigenvectors separation, while ensuring both generalizability and scalability. This method expands the applicability of SE to a wider range of tasks and can enhance its performance in existing applications. We empirically demonstrate Sep-SpectralNet's ability to consistently approximate and generalize SE, while maintaining SpectralNet's scalability. Additionally, we show how Sep-SpectralNet can be leveraged to enable generalizable UMAP visualization. Our codes are publicly available.</description>

      <title>The Spectral Barycentre of a Set of Graphs with Community Structure</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.00038</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.00038v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The notion of barycentre graph is of crucial importance for machine learning algorithms that process graph-valued data. The barycentre graph is a "summary graph" that captures the mean topology and connectivity structure of a training dataset of graphs. The construction of a barycentre requires the definition of a metric to quantify distances between pairs of graphs. In this work, we use a multiscale spectral distance that is defined using the eigenvalues of the normalized graph Laplacian. The eigenvalues -- but not the eigenvectors -- of the normalized Laplacian of the barycentre graph can be determined from the optimization problem that defines the barycentre. In this work, we propose a structural constraint on the eigenvectors of the normalized graph Laplacian of the barycentre graph that guarantees that the barycentre inherits the topological structure of the graphs in the sample dataset. The eigenvectors can be computed using an algorithm that explores the large library of Soules bases. When the graphs are random realizations of a balanced stochastic block model, then our algorithm returns a barycentre that converges asymptotically (in the limit of large graph size) almost-surely to the population mean of the graphs. We perform Monte Carlo simulations to validate the theoretical properties of the estimator; we conduct experiments on real-life graphs that suggest that our approach works beyond the controlled environment of stochastic block models.</description>

      <title>No Metric to Rule Them All: Toward Principled Evaluations of Graph-Learning Datasets</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.02379v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Benchmark datasets have proved pivotal to the success of graph learning, and good benchmark datasets are crucial to guide the development of the field. Recent research has highlighted problems with graph-learning datasets and benchmarking practices -- revealing, for example, that methods which ignore the graph structure can outperform graph-based approaches. Such findings raise two questions: (1) What makes a good graph-learning dataset, and (2) how can we evaluate dataset quality in graph learning? Our work addresses these questions. As the classic evaluation setup uses datasets to evaluate models, it does not apply to dataset evaluation. Hence, we start from first principles. Observing that graph-learning datasets uniquely combine two modes -- graph structure and node features --, we introduce Rings, a flexible and extensible mode-perturbation framework to assess the quality of graph-learning datasets based on dataset ablations -- i.e., quantifying differences between the original dataset and its perturbed representations. Within this framework, we propose two measures -- performance separability and mode complementarity -- as evaluation tools, each assessing the capacity of a graph dataset to benchmark the power and efficacy of graph-learning methods from a distinct angle. We demonstrate the utility of our framework for dataset evaluation via extensive experiments on graph-level tasks and derive actionable recommendations for improving the evaluation of graph-learning methods. Our work opens new research directions in data-centric graph learning, and it constitutes a step toward the systematic evaluation of evaluations.</description>

      <title>Learnable Kernel Density Estimation for Graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.21285</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.21285v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This work proposes a framework LGKDE that learns kernel density estimation for graphs. The key challenge in graph density estimation lies in effectively capturing both structural patterns and semantic variations while maintaining theoretical guarantees. Combining graph kernels and kernel density estimation (KDE) is a standard approach to graph density estimation, but has unsatisfactory performance due to the handcrafted and fixed features of kernels. Our method LGKDE leverages graph neural networks to represent each graph as a discrete distribution and utilizes maximum mean discrepancy to learn the graph metric for multi-scale KDE, where all parameters are learned by maximizing the density of graphs relative to the density of their well-designed perturbed counterparts. The perturbations are conducted on both node features and graph spectra, which helps better characterize the boundary of normal density regions. Theoretically, we establish consistency and convergence guarantees for LGKDE, including bounds on the mean integrated squared error, robustness, and complexity. We validate LGKDE by demonstrating its effectiveness in recovering the underlying density of synthetic graph distributions and applying it to graph anomaly detection across diverse benchmark datasets. Extensive empirical evaluation shows that LGKDE demonstrates superior performance compared to state-of-the-art baselines on most benchmark datasets.</description>

      <title>Near Optimal Non-asymptotic Sample Complexity of 1-Identification</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.06978</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.06978v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Motivated by an open direction in existing literature, we study the 1-identification problem, a fundamental multi-armed bandit formulation on pure exploration. The goal is to determine whether there exists an arm whose mean reward is at least a known threshold $\mu_0$, or to output None if it believes such an arm does not exist. The agent needs to guarantee its output is correct with probability at least $1-\delta$. Degenne &amp; Koolen 2019 has established the asymptotically tight sample complexity for the 1-identification problem, but they commented that the non-asymptotic analysis remains unclear. We design a new algorithm Sequential-Exploration-Exploitation (SEE), and conduct theoretical analysis from the non-asymptotic perspective. Novel to the literature, we achieve near optimality, in the sense of matching upper and lower bounds on the pulling complexity. The gap between the upper and lower bounds is up to a polynomial logarithmic factor. The numerical result also indicates the effectiveness of our algorithm, compared to existing benchmarks.</description>

      <title>Causal Mechanism Estimation in Multi-Sensor Systems Across Multiple Domains</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.17792</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.17792v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: To gain deeper insights into a complex sensor system through the lens of causality, we present common and individual causal mechanism estimation (CICME), a novel three-step approach to inferring causal mechanisms from heterogeneous data collected across multiple domains. By leveraging the principle of Causal Transfer Learning (CTL), CICME is able to reliably detect domain-invariant causal mechanisms when provided with sufficient samples. The identified common causal mechanisms are further used to guide the estimation of the remaining causal mechanisms in each domain individually. The performance of CICME is evaluated on linear Gaussian models under scenarios inspired from a manufacturing process. Building upon existing continuous optimization-based causal discovery methods, we show that CICME leverages the benefits of applying causal discovery on the pooled data and repeatedly on data from individual domains, and it even outperforms both baseline methods under certain scenarios.</description>

      <title>Topolow: Force-Directed Euclidean Embedding of Dissimilarity Data with Robustness Against Non-Metricity and Sparsity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.01733</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.01733v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The problem of embedding a set of objects into a low-dimensional Euclidean space based on a matrix of pairwise dissimilarities is fundamental in data analysis, machine learning, and statistics. However, the assumptions of many standard analytical methods are violated when the input dissimilarities fail to satisfy metric or Euclidean axioms. We present the mathematical and statistical foundations of Topolow, a physics-inspired, gradient-free optimization framework for such embedding problems. Topolow is conceptually related to force-directed graph drawing algorithms but is fundamentally distinguished by its goal of quantitative metric reconstruction. It models objects as particles in a physical system, and its novel optimization scheme proceeds through sequential, stochastic pairwise interactions, which circumvents the need to compute a global gradient and provides robustness against convergence to local optima, especially for sparse data. Topolow maximizes the likelihood under a Laplace error model, robust to outliers and heterogeneous errors, and properly handles censored data. Crucially, Topolow does not require the input dissimilarities to be metric, making it a robust solution for embedding non-metric measurements into a valid Euclidean space, thereby enabling the use of standard analytical tools. We demonstrate the superior performance of Topolow compared to standard Multidimensional Scaling (MDS) methods in reconstructing the geometry of sparse and non-Euclidean data. This paper formalizes the algorithm, first introduced as Topolow in the context of antigenic mapping in (Arhami and Rohani, 2025) (open access), with emphasis on its metric embedding and mathematical properties for a broader audience. The general-purpose function Euclidify is available in the R package topolow.</description>

Abstract: We propose a novel kernel-based two-sample test that leverages the spectral decomposition of the maximum mean discrepancy (MMD) statistic to identify and utilize well-estimated directional components in reproducing kernel Hilbert space (RKHS). Our approach is motivated by the observation that the estimation quality of these components varies significantly, with leading eigen-directions being more reliably estimated in finite samples. By focusing on these directions and aggregating information across multiple kernels, the proposed test achieves higher power and improved robustness, especially in high-dimensional and unbalanced sample settings. We further develop a computationally efficient multiplier bootstrap procedure for approximating critical values, which is theoretically justified and significantly faster than permutation-based alternatives. Extensive simulations and empirical studies on microarray datasets demonstrate that our method maintains the nominal Type I error rate and delivers superior power compared to other existing MMD-based tests.</description>
