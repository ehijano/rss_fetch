      <title>Position-building in competition with real-world constraints</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.15459</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.15459v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper extends the optimal-trading framework developed in arXiv:2409.03586v1 to compute optimal strategies with {\em real-world constraints}. The aim of the current paper, as with the previous, is to study trading in the context of {\em multi-player non-cooperative games}. While the former paper relies on methods from the calculus of variations and optimal strategies arise as the solution of partial differential equations, the current paper demonstrates that the entire framework may be re-framed as a quadratic programming problem and cast in this light constraints are readily incorporated into the calculation of optimal strategies. An added benefit is that two-trader equilibria may be calculated as the end-points of a dynamic process of traders forming repeated adjustments to each other's strategy.</description>

      <title>Hardness of Approximate Sperner and Applications to Envy-Free Cake Cutting</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.15713</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.15713v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Given a so called ''Sperner coloring'' of a triangulation of the $D$-dimensional simplex, Sperner's lemma guarantees the existence of a rainbow simplex, i.e. a simplex colored by all $D+1$ colors. However, finding a rainbow simplex was the first problem to be proven $\mathsf{PPAD}$-complete in Papadimitriou's classical paper introducing the class $\mathsf{PPAD}$ (1994). In this paper, we prove that the problem does not become easier if we relax ''all $D+1$ colors'' to allow some fraction of missing colors: in fact, for any constant $D$, finding even a simplex with just three colors remains $\mathsf{PPAD}$-complete!
  Our result has an interesting application for the envy-free cake cutting from fair division. It is known that if agents value pieces of cake using general continuous functions satisfying a simple boundary condition (''a non-empty piece is better than an empty piece of cake''), there exists an envy-free allocation with connected pieces. We show that for any constant number of agents it is $\mathsf{PPAD}$-complete to find an allocation --even using any constant number of possibly disconnected pieces-- that makes just three agents envy-free.
  Our results extend to super-constant dimension, number of agents, and number of pieces, as long as they are asymptotically bounded by any $\log^{1-\Omega(1)}(\epsilon)$, where $\epsilon$ is the precision parameter (side length for Sperner and approximate envy-free for cake cutting).</description>

      <title>Extending Stable and Popular Matching Algorithms from Bipartite to Arbitrary Instances</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.16173</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.16173v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider stable and popular matching problems in arbitrary graphs, which are referred to as stable roommates instances. We extend the 3/2-approximation algorithm for the maximum size weakly stable matching problem to the roommates case, which solves a more than 20 year old open question of Irving and Manlove about the approximability of maximum size weakly stable matchings in roommates instances with ties [Irving and Manlove 2002] and has nice applications for the problem of matching residents to hospitals in the presence of couples. We also extend the algorithm that finds a maximum size popular matching in bipartite graphs in the case of strict preferences and the algorithm to find a popular matching among maximum weight matchings. While previous attempts to extend the idea of promoting the agents or duplicating the edges from bipartite instances to arbitrary ones failed, these results show that with the help of a simple observation, we can indeed bridge the gap and extend these algorithms</description>

      <title>Almost-Bayesian Quadratic Persuasion (Extended Version)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2212.13619</link>
      <description>arXiv:2212.13619v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this article, we relax the Bayesianity assumption in the now-traditional model of Bayesian Persuasion introduced by Kamenica &amp; Gentzkow. Unlike preexisting approaches -- which have tackled the possibility of the receiver (Bob) being non-Bayesian by considering that his thought process is not Bayesian yet known to the sender (Alice), possibly up to a parameter -- we let Alice merely assume that Bob behaves 'almost like' a Bayesian agent, in some sense, without resorting to any specific model.
  Under this assumption, we study Alice's strategy when both utilities are quadratic and the prior is isotropic. We show that, contrary to the Bayesian case, Alice's optimal response may not be linear anymore. This fact is unfortunate as linear policies remain the only ones for which the induced belief distribution is known. What is more, evaluating linear policies proves difficult except in particular cases, let alone finding an optimal one. Nonetheless, we derive bounds that prove linear policies are near-optimal and allow Alice to compute a near-optimal linear policy numerically. With this solution in hand, we show that Alice shares less information with Bob as he departs more from Bayesianity, much to his detriment.</description>

      <title>Incentivizing Exploration with Linear Contexts and Combinatorial Actions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.01990</link>
      <description>arXiv:2306.01990v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We advance the study of incentivized bandit exploration, in which arm choices are viewed as recommendations and are required to be Bayesian incentive compatible. Recent work has shown under certain independence assumptions that after collecting enough initial samples, the popular Thompson sampling algorithm becomes incentive compatible. We give an analog of this result for linear bandits, where the independence of the prior is replaced by a natural convexity condition. This opens up the possibility of efficient and regret-optimal incentivized exploration in high-dimensional action spaces. In the semibandit model, we also improve the sample complexity for the pre-Thompson sampling phase of initial data collection.</description>

      <title>Multi-Stage Generalized Deferred Acceptance Mechanism: Strategyproof Mechanism for Handling General Hereditary Constraints</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.10968</link>
      <description>arXiv:2309.10968v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The theory of two-sided matching has been extensively developed and applied to many real-life application domains. As the theory has been applied to increasingly diverse types of environments, researchers and practitioners have encountered various forms of distributional constraints. Arguably, the most general class of distributional constraints would be hereditary constraints; if a matching is feasible, then any matching that assigns weakly fewer students at each college is also feasible. However, under general hereditary constraints, it is shown that no strategyproof mechanism exists that simultaneously satisfies fairness and weak nonwastefulness, which is an efficiency (students' welfare) requirement weaker than nonwastefulness. We propose a new strategyproof mechanism that works for hereditary constraints called the Multi-Stage Generalized Deferred Acceptance mechanism (MS-GDA). It uses the Generalized Deferred Acceptance mechanism (GDA) as a subroutine, which works when distributional constraints belong to a well-behaved class called hereditary M$^\natural$-convex set. We show that GDA satisfies several desirable properties, most of which are also preserved in MS-GDA. We experimentally show that MS-GDA strikes a good balance between fairness and efficiency (students' welfare) compared to existing strategyproof mechanisms when distributional constraints are close to an M$^\natural$-convex set.</description>

      <title>Opponent Shaping for Antibody Development</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.10588</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.10588v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Anti-viral therapies are typically designed to target the current strains of a virus. Game theoretically, this corresponds to a short-sighted, or myopic, response. However, therapy-induced selective pressures act on viral antigens to drive the emergence of mutated strains, against which initial therapies have reduced efficacy. Building on a computational model of binding between antibodies and viral antigens (the Absolut! framework), we design and implement a genetic simulation of such viral evolutionary escape. Crucially, this allows our antibody optimisation algorithm to consider and influence the entire escape curve of the virus, i.e. to guide (or ''shape'') the viral evolution. This is inspired by opponent shaping which, in general-sum learning, accounts for the adaptation of the co-player rather than playing a myopic best response. Hence we call the optimised antibodies shapers. Within our simulations, we demonstrate that our shapers target both current and simulated future viral variants, outperforming the antibodies chosen in a myopic way. Furthermore, we show that shapers exert specific evolutionary pressure on the virus compared to myopic antibodies. Altogether, shapers modify the evolutionary trajectories of viral strains and minimise the viral escape compared to their myopic counterparts. While this is a simplified model, we hope that our proposed paradigm will enable the discovery of better long-lived vaccines and antibody therapies in the future, enabled by rapid advancements in the capabilities of simulation tools. Our code is available at https://github.com/olakalisz/antibody-shapers.</description>
