      <title>Fixed-Term Decompositions Using Even-Indexed Fibonacci Numbers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.03231</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.03231v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: As a variant of Zeckendorf's theorem, Chung and Graham proved that every positive integer can be uniquely decomposed into a sum of even-indexed Fibonacci numbers, whose coefficients are either $0, 1$, or $2$ so that between two coefficients $2$, there must be a coefficient $0$. This paper characterizes all positive integers that do not have $F_{2k}$ ($k\ge 1$) in their decompositions. This continues the work of Kimberling, Carlitz et al., Dekking, and Griffiths, to name a few, who studied such a characterization for Zeckendorf decomposition.</description>

      <title>Exposition: Enumerative Geometry and Tree-Level Gromov-Witten Invariants</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.03232</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.03232v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Here we review background in differential topology related to the calculation of an euler characteristic, and background on localization in equivariant cohomology. We then outline Gromov-Witten invariants in algebraic geometry and give examples of the genus 0 Gromov-Witten potential for $\PP^1, \PP^2$, and a genus $g&gt;0$ Riemann surface. Kontsevich-Manin's recursive formula for $N_d$, the number of degree $d$ rational curves through $3d-1$ points in general position on $\PP^2$ is recovered.</description>

      <title>Spin and Representations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.03233</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.03233v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We derive the representation theory of $SU(2)$ from the expository theory of Lie groups and Lie algebras. Based on this, the mathematics of non-relativistic quantum mechanics of a spin $\frac{1}{2}$ particle are described from a representation-theoretic perspective, and are extended to many particle systems.</description>

      <title>Chlodowsky variant of Bernstein-type operators on the domain</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.03239</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.03239v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the present paper, we deal with Bernstein-Chlodowsky type operators for approximating functions on the domain. We first present Bernstein-Chlodowsky type operators in two variables and then we discuss some examples of these operators under a domain transformation. Finally, we give bivarite shifted mth Bernstein-Chlodowsky-Stancu operators and we present some figures for approximation properties of our operator.</description>

      <title>Logical connectives of fuzzy soft set theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.03240</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.03240v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Soft set theory, introduced by Molodtsov [Molodtsov, D. (1999). Soft set theory-first results. Comput. Math. Appl., 37(4-5), 19-31], provides a flexible framework for managing uncertainty and vagueness, addressing limitations in traditional approaches such as fuzzy set theory, rough set theory, and probability theory. Over time, fuzzy soft set theory has emerged as a significant extension, blending the principles of fuzzy set theory and soft set theory to support applications in various decision-making processes. This study revisits fuzzy soft set theory, addressing conceptual errors and inaccuracies in the definitions of t-norm, t-conorm, strong negation, and implication that deviated from Molodtsov's foundational principles. Corrected definitions-fuzzy soft t-norm, fuzzy soft t-conorm, fuzzy soft negation, and fuzzy soft implication-are proposed to ensure theoretical rigor. The paper rectifies conceptual errors in prior work by Ali and Shabir [Ali, M. I., Shabir, M. (2013). Logic connectives for soft sets and fuzzy soft sets. IEEE Transactions on Fuzzy Systems, 22(6), 1431-1442] and introduces refined results to strengthen the logical framework, providing a consistent foundation for future research and hybrid model development in this domain.</description>

      <title>The global existence of small-amplitude solutions to nonlinear Klein-Gordon equations: A study based on S. Klainerman's approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.03243</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.03243v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this thesis we explore S. Klainerman's proof on the global existence of small amplitude solutions to nonlinear Klein-Gordon equations in four space-time dimensions, as established in his paper from 1985. We consider initial data with small amplitude and compact support and aim prove the global existence and uniform decay of smooth solutions. We establish that solutions exist globally if the initial data satisfy a suitable smallness condition. Key analytical tools include generalized Sobolev norms and uniform decay estimates for the associated linear problem. The solutions exhibit a decay rate of $t^{-5/4}$, uniform in time and space. This result is achieved by combining the energy method, perturbed Klein-Gordon techniques, and Sobolev inequalities.</description>

      <title>A novel STAP algorithm via volume cross-correlation function on the Grassmann manifold</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.03255</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.03255v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The performance of space-time adaptive processing (STAP) is often degraded by factors such as limited sample size and moving targets. Traditional clutter covariance matrix (CCM) estimation relies on Euclidean metrics, which fail to capture the intrinsic geometric and structural properties of the covariance matrix, thus limiting the utilization of structural information in the data. To address these issues, the proposed algorithm begins by constructing Toeplitz Hermitian positive definite (THPD) matrices from the training samples. The Brauer disc (BD) theorem is then employed to filter out THPD matrices containing target signals, retaining only clutter-related matrices. These clutter matrices undergo eigendecomposition to construct the Grassmann manifold, enabling CCM estimation through the volume cross-correlation function (VCF) and gradient descent method. Finally, the filter weight vector is computed for filtering. By fully leveraging the structural information in radar data, this approach significantly enhances both accuracy and robustness of clutter suppression. Experimental results on simulated and measured data demonstrate superior performance of the proposed algorithm in heterogeneous environments.</description>

      <title>Notes on the Golden Ratio: The Golden Rule of Vector Similarities in Space</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2302.02494</link>
      <description>arXiv:2302.02494v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this work, we have abstractly generalized the similarity law for multidimensional vectors. Initially, the law of similarity was derived for one-dimensional vectors. Although it operated with such values of the ratio of parts of the whole, it meant linear dimensions (a line is one-dimensionality). The concept of the general golden ratio (GGR) for the vectors in the multidimensional space is presented and described in detail with equations and solutions. It shown that the GGR depends on the angles. Main properties of the GGR are given with illustrative examples. We introduce and discuss the concept of the similar vectors and the set of similarities for a given vector. Also, we present our vision on the theory of the golden ratio for triangles and describe the similar triangles with examples.</description>
