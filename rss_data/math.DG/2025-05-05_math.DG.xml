      <title>On asymptotic behavior of the second Chern forms on degenerating K\"ahler-Einstein surfaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.01773</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.01773v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study an asymptotic behavior of the second Chern forms of canonical metrics on a degenerating family of K\"ahler surfaces with the central fibre having ADE-singularities. We investigate a function on the unit disc defined by fiber integrals of the forms with a smooth test function on the family. We show a lower bound of the H\"older exponent of the function at the origin. Our main results consists of two cases: one is a bound of H\"older exponent along a line for cscK-metrics, using Biquard-Rollin's a priori estimates for cscK-metrics, and the other is a bound of H\"older exponent at the origin for Ricci-flat metrics.</description>

      <title>Special non-K\"ahler metrics -- old and new</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.01795</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.01795v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We give an account of old and new results concerning many types of non-K\"ahler metrics, with focus on the problem of their coexistence on compact complex manifolds, and their behaviour at deformations and blow-up. We also describe a mechanism that several authors have used to construct examples of nilmanifolds admitting metrics with certain properties.</description>

      <title>On the geometry of Riemannian warped product maps</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.01865</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.01865v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we begin by introducing Clairaut Riemannian warped product maps and establish the condition under which a regular curve becomes a geodesic. We obtain the conditions for a Riemannian warped product map to be Clairaut Riemannian warped product map followed by Ricci curvature. Further, we study the Ricci soliton structure on a Riemannian warped product manifold using curvature tensor. We examine the Bochner type formulae for Clairaut Riemannian warped product map and construct a supporting example. Furthermore, we extend the study to introduce and examine some geometric aspects of conformal Riemannian warped product maps. We derive the integral formula for scalar curvature of conformal Riemannian warped product map. Finally, we construct an example for conformal Riemannian warped product map.</description>

      <title>Lorentzian manifolds equipped with a concircularly semi-symmetric metric connection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.01897</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.01897v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Building upon previous works characterizing GRW space-times using concircular and torse-forming vectors, this paper investigates a Lorentzian manifold equipped with a concircularly semi-symmetric metric connection. We demonstrate that such a manifold reduces to a GRW space-time under specific conditions: when the generator of the observed connection is a unit timelike vector. Also, in that case, the mentioned connection becomes a semi-symmetric metric $P$-connection. The non-zero nature of the three curvature tensors and their corresponding Ricci tensors motivates an exploration of manifold symmetries. In this way, we derive necessary and sufficient conditions for the manifold to be Einstein and we prove that a perfect fluid space-time with a semi-symmetric metric $P$-connection is Ricci pseudo-symmetric manifold of constant type. Furthermore, we show that if this space-time satisfies the Einstein's field equations without the cosmological constant, the strong energy condition is violated.</description>

      <title>Remarks on Singular K\"ahler-Einstein Metrics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.01943</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.01943v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study two different natural notions of singular K\"ahler-Einstein metrics on normal complex varieties. In the setting of singular Ricci flat K\"ahler cone metrics that arise as non-collapsed limits of sequences of K\"ahler-Einstein metrics or K\"ahler-Ricci flows, we show that an a priori weaker notion is equivalent to the stronger one introduced by Eyssidieux-Guedj-Zeriahi, and in particular the underlying variety has log terminal singularities in this case. Our method applies to more general singular K\"ahler-Einstein spaces as well, assuming that they define RCD spaces.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2505.01991v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we consider a homogeneous manifold $G/H$ in which $G$ is a compact connected simply connected simple Lie group and $H$ is a closed connected subgroup of $G$. We define standard and very standard homogeneous Finsler metrics on $G/H$, which generalize the standard homogeneous $(\alpha_1,\alpha_2)$ metric in literature. We classify all these $G/H$ which admit positively curved very standard homogeneous Finsler metrics.</description>

Abstract: In this paper, we characterize the Ricci soliton equations on the Poincare upper half plane. First we classify all Ricci soliton and Ricci-Bourguignon soliton in the half plane of Poincar\'e
  and after we generalize those equations in $\mathbb{H}^n$. We obtain some nice properties of the soliton about their geodesic flows.</description>

      <title>Integral formulas in $h$-Almost Ricci-Bourguignon solitons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.02193</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.02193v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The aim of this paper is to investigate some integral formulas for compact gradient $h$-almost Ricci-Bourguignon solitons. Consequently, we generalize the results previously ob tained for Ricci almost solitons. Moreover, we prove that a compact, non-trivial $h$-almost Ricci-Bourguignon soliton with dimension greater than or equal to 3 is isometric to a Euclidean
  sphere, provided either the potential vector field is conformal or its scalar curvature is constant.
  Finally, we generalize the integral formula for compact h-almost Ricci-Bourguignon.</description>

Abstract: We explore the geometric properties of biharmonic curves in warped product manifolds of the form $I\times _{f}M^{n}(c)$, where $I$ is an open interval and $M^{n}(c)$ is a space of constant curvature. By establishing a main theorem, we analyze four distinct cases to reveal deeper curvature-related characteristics of these curves, including situations where they are slant. Finally, we construct two examples in $I\times _{f}S^{2}(1)$.</description>

      <title>Four-dimensional shrinkers with nonnegative Ricci curvature</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.02315</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.02315v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we investigate classifications of $4$-dimensional simply connected complete noncompact nonflat shrinkers satisfying $Ric+\mathrm{Hess}\,f=\tfrac 12g$ with nonnegative Ricci curvature. One one hand, we show that if the sectional curvature $K\le 1/4$ or the sum of smallest two eigenvalues of Ricci curvature has a suitable lower bound, then the shrinker is isometric to $\mathbb{R}\times\mathbb{S}^3$. We also show that if the scalar curvature $R\le 3$ and the shrinker is asymptotic to $\mathbb{R}\times\mathbb{S}^3$, then the Euler characteristic $\chi(M)\geq 0$ and equality holds if and only if the shrinker is isometric to $\mathbb{R}\times\mathbb{S}^3$. On the other hand, we prove that if $K\le 1/2$ (or the bi-Ricci curvature is nonnegative) and $R\le\tfrac{3}{2}-\delta$ for some $\delta\in (0,\tfrac{1}{2}]$, then the shrinker is isometric to $\mathbb{R}^2\times\mathbb{S}^2$. The proof of these classifications mainly depends on the asymptotic analysis by the evolution of eigenvalues of Ricci curvature, the Gauss-Bonnet-Chern formula with boundary and the integration by parts.</description>

Abstract: In this paper, we consider the boundary regularity of harmonic maps on non-smooth domains. We first establish a version of the Gauss-Green formula on a bounded domain in $RCD(K, N)$ metric measure space, and then, we apply it to obtain the optimal boundary regularity of harmonic maps from $RCD(K, N)$ metric measure spaces into $CAT(0)$ metric spaces.</description>

      <title>Rigidity via Modular Properties of Theta Functions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.02792</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.02792v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper we use methods of Liu to show that the twisted Dirac operators $D$ on certain bundles $\Phi$ considered by Guan and Wang are rigid. To do so, we use a Lefschetz formula and Atiyah-Bott localization to obtain formulas for the Lefschetz numbers $L$ of these operators $D$ in terms of Jacobi theta functions; then, using the translational and modular transformation properties of theta functions and the properties of their zeros, we prove $L$ is constant provided certain conditions on characteristic classes hold, thus showing the rigidity of $D$ on $\Phi$ under these conditions.</description>

      <title>On the sharpness of Wasserstein contraction along heat flows, and a rigidity of Euclidean spaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.02280</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.02280v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We show that if a smooth metric measure space with non-negative weighted Ricci curvature admits two distinct points such that the $2$-Wasserstein distance is preserved along the associated heat flows i.e.
  \begin{equation}
  W_2(p_t(x,\cdot),p_t(y,\cdot))=d(x,y)
  \end{equation} for some $x,y$ and $t&gt;0$, then the space splits off a line. In particular, Euclidean spaces are the only spaces where the above sharpness condition holds for all pairs of points.
  Moreover, we show for positive $K$ that, the equality for the analogous $K$-contraction estimate for Wasserstein distances cannot be attained for all smooth metric measure spaces with Ricci curvature bounded below by $K$.</description>

      <title>A higher index and rapidly decaying kernels</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.02498</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.02498v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We construct an index of first-order, self-adjoint, elliptic differential operators in the $K$-theory of a Fr\'echet algebra of smooth kernels with faster than exponential off-diagonal decay. We show that this index can be represented by an idempotent involving heat operators. The rapid decay of the kernels in the algebra used is helpful in proving convergence of pairings with cyclic cocycles. Representing the index in terms of heat operators allows one to use heat kernel asymptotics to compute such pairings. We give a link to von Neumann algebras and $L^2$-index theorems as an immediate application, and work out further applications in other papers.</description>

      <title>On the Palais-Smale condition in geometric knot theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.02719</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.02719v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We prove that various families of energies relevant in
  geometric knot theory satisfy the Palais-Smale condition (PS)
  on submanifolds of arclength para\-metrized knots.
  These energies
  include linear combinations of the Euler-Bernoulli
  bending energy with a wide variety of non-local
  knot energies, such as
  O'Hara's self-repulsive potentials $E^{\alpha,p}$, generalized
  tangent-point energies $\TP^{(p,q)}$, and generalized integral
  Menger curvature functionals $\intM^{(p,q)}$. Even the
  tangent-point energies $\TP^{(p,2)}$ for $p\in (4,5)$ alone
  are shown to fulfill the (PS)-condition. For all energies mentioned
  we can therefore prove existence of minimizing knots in any prescribed
  ambient isotopy class, and we
  provide long-time existence of their Hilbert-gradient flows,
  and subconvergence to critical knots as time goes to infinity.
  In addition, we prove $C^\infty$-smoothness of all arclength constrained
  critical knots, which shows in particular that these critical knots
  are also critical for the energies on the larger open set of
  regular knots under a fixed-length constraint.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2505.02790v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We observe that the diameter of small (in a locally uniform sense) balls in $C^{1,1}$ sub-Riemannian manifolds equals twice the radius. We also prove that, when the regularity of the structure is further lowered to $C^0$, the diameter is arbitrarily close to twice the radius. Both results hold independently of the bracket-generating condition.</description>

      <title>Complete complex Finsler metrics and uniform equivalence of the Kobayashi metric</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.08456</link>
      <description>arXiv:2309.08456v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, first of all, according to Lu's and Zhang's works about the curvature of the Bergman metric on a bounded domain and the properties of the squeezing functions, we obtain that Bergman curvature of the Bergman metric on a bounded strictly pseudoconvex domain with $C^2$-boundary or bounded convex domain is bounded. Secondly, by the property of curvature symmetry on a K\"ahler manifold, we have the property: if holomorphic sectional curvature of a K\"ahler manifold is bounded, we can deduce that its sectional curvature is bounded. After that, applying to the Schwarz lemma from a complete K\"ahler manifold into a complex Finsler manifold, we get that a bounded strictly pseudoconvex domain with $C^2$-boundary or bounded convex domain admit complete strongly pseudoconvex complex Finsler metrics such that their holomorphic sectional curvature is bounded from above by a negative constant. Finally, by the Schwarz lemma from a complete K\"ahler manifold into a complex Finsler manifold, we prove the uniform equivalences of the Kobayashi metric and Carath\'eodory metric on a bounded strongly convex domain with smooth boundary.</description>

      <title>Manin pairs and moment maps revisited</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.17518</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.17518v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The notion of quasi-Poisson $G$-spaces with $D/G$-valued moment maps was introduced by Alekseev and Kosmann-Schwarzbach in 1999. Our main result is a \emph{Lifting Theorem}, establishing a bijective correspondence between the categories of quasi-Poisson $G$-spaces with $D/G$-valued moment maps and of quasi-Poisson $G\times G$-spaces with $D$-valued moment maps. Using this result, we give simple constructions of fusion and conjugation for these spaces, and new examples coming from moduli spaces.</description>

      <title>Hypersurfaces of constant scalar curvature in hyperbolic space with prescribed asymptotic boundary at infinity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.07656</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.07656v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This article concerns a natural generalization of the classical asymptotic Plateau problem in hyperbolic space. We prove the existence of a smooth complete hypersurface of constant scalar curvature with a prescribed asymptotic boundary at infinity. The hypersurface is constructed as the graph of some smooth function and the problem is thus reduced to solving a Dirichlet problem for a fully nonlinear elliptic partial differential equation which is degenerate along the boundary. Previously, the result was known only for a restricted range of curvature values. Now, in this article, we are able to solve the Dirichlet problem for all possible curvature values by establishing the crucial second order a priori estimates for admissible solutions. This resolves a longstanding problem, and for the proof, since the currently available techniques in the literature do not apply, we have introduced a new reduction technique which we hope could be inspiring for future study in the field.</description>

      <title>Curvature-Dimension for Autonomous Lagrangians</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.08001</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.08001v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We introduce a curvature-dimension condition for autonomous Lagrangians on weighted manifolds, which depends on the Euler-Lagrange dynamics on a single energy level. By generalizing Klartag's needle decomposition technique to the Lagrangian setting, we prove that this curvature-dimension condition is equivalent to displacement convexity of entropy along cost-minimizing interpolations in an $L^1$ sense, and that it implies various consequences of lower Ricci curvature bounds, as in the metric setting. As examples we consider classical and isotropic Lagrangians on Riemannian manifolds. In particular, we generalize the horocyclic Brunn-Minkowski inequality to complex hyperbolic space of arbitrary dimension, and present a new Brunn-Minkowski inequality for contact magnetic geodesics on odd-dimensional spheres.</description>

Abstract: In this paper, we are interested in proving the existence and uniqueness of the local, local maximal, and global solutions of the equation projected on the Hilbert manifold. Furthermore, we show that, for any given initial data in the Hilbert manifold $\mathcal{M}$, the solution to this equation is also in the Hilbert manifold $\mathcal{M}$. Finally, we demonstrate that the solution to the equation is a gradient flow.</description>

      <title>On dual-projectively equivalent connections associated to second order superintegrable systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.19739</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.19739v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Pre-geodesics of an affine connection are the curves that are geodesics after a reparametrization (the analogous concept in K\"ahler geometry is known as J-planar curves). Similarly, dual-geodesics on a Riemannian manifold are curves along which the 1-forms associated to the velocity are preserved after a reparametrization. Superintegrable systems are Hamiltonian systems with a large number of independent constants of the motion. They are said to be second order if the constants of the motion can be chosen to be quadratic polynomials in the momenta. Famous examples include the Kepler-Coulomb system and the isotropic harmonic oscillator. We show that certain torsion-free affine connections which are naturally associated to certain second order superintegrable systems share the same dual-geodesics.</description>

      <title>Infinitely Many Surfaces with Prescribed Mean Curvature in the Presence of a Strictly Stable Minimal Surface</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.07098</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.07098v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We construct infinitely many distinct hypersurfaces with prescribed mean curvature (PMC) for a large class of prescribing functions when $(M^{n+1}, g)$ is a closed smooth manifold containing a minimal surface that is strictly stable (or more generally, admits a contracting neighborhood). In particular, we construct infinitely many distinct PMCs when $H_n(M, \mathbb{Z}_2) \neq 0$, or if $(M, g)$ does not satisfy the Frankel property. Our construction synthesizes ideas from Song's construction of infinitely many minimal surfaces in the non-generic setting, Dey's construction of multiple constant mean curvature surfaces, and Sun--Wang--Zhou's min-max construction of free boundary PMCs.</description>

      <title>Asymptotics for resolutions and smoothings of Calabi-Yau conifolds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.16702</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.16702v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We show that the Calabi-Yau metrics with isolated conical singularities of Hein-Sun admit polyhomogeneous expansions near their singularities. Moreover, we show that, under certain generic assumptions, natural families of smooth Calabi-Yau metrics on crepant resolutions and on polarized smoothings of conical Calabi-Yau manifolds degenerating to the initial conical Calabi-Yau metric admit polyhomogeneous expansions where the singularities are forming. The construction proceeds by performing weighted Melrose-type blow-ups and then gluing conical and scaled asymptotically conical Calabi-Yau metrics on the fibers, close to the blow-up's front face without compromising polyhomogeneity. This yields a polyhomogeneous family of K\"ahler metrics that are approximately Calabi-Yau. Solving formally a complex Monge-Amp\`ere equation, we obtain a polyhomogeneous family of K\"ahler metrics with Ricci potential converging rapidly to zero as the family is degenerating. We can then conclude that the corresponding family of degenerating Calabi-Yau metrics is polyhomogeneous by using a fixed point argument.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2309.16156v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Steinerberger proposed a notion of curvature on graphs involving the graph distance matrix (J. Graph Theory, 2023). We show that nonnegative curvature is almost preserved under three graph operations. We characterize the distance matrix and its null space after adding an edge between two graphs. Let $D$ be the graph distance matrix and $\mathbf{1}$ be the all-one vector. We provide a way to construct graphs so that the linear system $Dx = \mathbf{1}$ does not have a solution.</description>

      <title>K-contact manifolds with minimal closed Reeb orbits</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.10866v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We use the Boothby-Wang fibration to construct certain simply connected K-contact manifolds and we give sufficient and necessary conditions on when such K-contact manifolds are homeomorphic to the odd dimensional spheres. If the symplectic base manifold of the fibration admits a Hamiltonian torus action, we show that on the total space of the fibration, other than the regular K-contact structures which have infinitely many closed Reeb orbits, there are K-contact structures whose closed Reeb orbits correspond exactly to the fixed points of the Hamiltonian torus action on the base manifold. Then we give a collection of examples of compact simply connected K-contact manifolds with minimal number of closed Reeb orbits which are not homeomorphic to the odd dimensional spheres, while having the real cohomology ring of the spheres. Finally, we give a family of examples of simply connected K-contact manifolds which have one more than the minimal number of closed Reeb orbits and which do not have the real cohomology ring of the spheres.</description>

      <title>A higher index on finite-volume locally symmetric spaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.16275</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.16275v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Let $G$ be a connected, real semisimple Lie group. Let $K&lt;G$ be maximal compact, and let $\Gamma &lt; G$ be discrete and such that $\Gamma \backslash G$ has finite volume. If the real rank of $G$ is $1$ and $\Gamma$ is torsion-free, then Barbasch and Moscovici obtained an index theorem for Dirac operators on the locally symmetric space $\Gamma \backslash G/K$. We obtain a higher version of this, using an index of Dirac operators on $G/K$ in the $K$-theory of an algebra on which the conjugation-invariant terms in Barbasch and Moscovici's index theorem define continuous traces. The resulting index theorems also apply when $\Gamma$ has torsion. The cases of these index theorems for traces defined by semisimple orbital integrals extend to Song and Tang's higher orbital integrals, and yield nonzero and computable results even when $\operatorname{rank}(G)&gt; \operatorname{rank}(K)$, or the real rank of $G$ is larger than $1$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2505.00203v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We establish conditions for nonexistence of global solutions for a class of quasilinear parabolic problems with a potential on complete, non-compact Riemannian manifolds, including the Porous Medium Equation and the p-Laplacian with a potential term. Our results reveal the interplay between the manifold's geometry, the power nonlinearity, and the potential's behavior at infinity. Using a test function argument, we identify explicit parameter ranges where nonexistence holds.</description>
