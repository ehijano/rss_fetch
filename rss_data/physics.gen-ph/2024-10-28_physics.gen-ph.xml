      <title>MOND as a transformation between non-inertial reference frames via Sciama's interpretation of Mach's Principle</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.19007</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.19007v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Milgrom's Modified Newtonian Dynamics (MOND) correction to Newtonian gravity is shown to be equivalent to a more fundamental transformation between a non-inertial local reference frame and the fixed background of the observable universe, complying with Mach's principle. Both Newton's gravitational constant and Milgrom's MOND acceleration parameter or scale constant are substituted for the speed of light and two varying and measurable cosmological parameters under the justification of Schr\"odinger's and Sciama's interpretation of Mach's principle: causally connected mass and size of the universe. This Machian interpretation, free from fundamental constants and free parameters with the exception of the speed of light as the speed of causality and gravity, is based on relative field intensities of the small and large scale of the universe. The Machian MOND approximation is a necessary feature of a phenomenological theory of modified inertia which incorporates Mach's principle in agreement with galaxy rotation curves.</description>

      <title>A heuristic sketch how it could fit all together with time</title>

Abstract: On a scientific meta-level, it is discussed how an overall understanding of the physical universe can be built on the basis of well-proven theories and recent experiments and observations. In the light of almost a century of struggle to make (common) sense of Quantum Mechanics and to reconcile it with General Relativity, it is proposed to (for some time) forget about quantizing gravity or striving for one Theory of Everything or 'Weltformel', which would describe the whole of reality seamlessly without any joints or suture marks. Instead of one single monolithic formalism, a three-legged compound approach is argued for. Quantum Mechanics, Relativity and Thermodynamics are proposed as the main pillars of reality, each with its well-defined realm, specific features, and clearly marked interfaces between the three of them. Not only classical reality, which is rather directly accessible to us, is then comprehensively modelled by their encompassing combination. Quantum phenomena are understood as undoubtedly lying at the bottom of classical physics and at the same time, they become 'fully real' only when embedded in classical frames between preparation and measurement in time. It is then where thermodynamics steps in and provides the mediating glue as it does at interfaces towards gravity. The aim of this short contribution is not to deliver novel quantitative results but rather to propose a comprehensive research program and to coarsely lay out a very roughly coherent self-referential sketch starting from the beginning of the one universe, which we inhabit.</description>

      <title>The significance of measuring cosmological time dilation in the Dark Energy Survey Supernova Program</title>

Abstract: In the context of the dispersion relation $c = \lambda \nu$ and considering an expanding universe where the observed wavelength today is redshifted from the emitted wavelength by $\lambda_{0} = \lambda_{\text{emit}} (1+z)$, to keep $c$ constant, it must be that $\nu_{0} = \nu_{\text{emit}} /(1+z)$. However, although the theory for wavelength in the RW metric includes the cosmological redshift, the same is not simply deduced for frequency (the inverse of time). Instead, cosmological time dilation $T_{0} = T_{\text{emit}} (1+z)$ is an additional assumption made to uphold the hypothesis of constant speed of light rather than a relation directly derived from the RW metric. Therefore, verifying cosmological time dilation observationally is crucial. The most recent data on supernovae for this purpose was released recently by the Dark Energy Survey. Results from the i-band specifically support variations in the speed of light within 1-$\sigma$. We used these observations to investigate variations in various physical quantities, including $c$ and $G$, using the minimally extended varying speed of light model. The speed of light was $0.4$\% to $2.2$\% slower, and Newton's constant may have decreased by $1.7$\% to $8.4$\% compared to their current values at redshift $2$. These findings, consistent with previous studies, hint at resolving tensions between different $\Lambda$CDM cosmological backgrounds but are not yet conclusive evidence of a varying speed of light, as the full-band data aligns with standard model cosmology. However, the data remains valuable for testing variations in fundamental constants over cosmic time. Future analyses, particularly with more refined redshift data, may provide clearer insights into these potential changes.</description>
