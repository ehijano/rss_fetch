      <title>Ratchet Effects in Cyclic Pattern Formation Systems with Competing Interactions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.10824</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.10824v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Ratchet effects can appear for particles interacting with an asymmetric potential under ac driving or for a thermal system in which a substrate is periodically flashed. Here, we show that a new type of collective ratchet effect can arise for a pattern-forming system coupled to an asymmetric substrate when the interaction potential between the particles is periodically oscillated in order to cycle the system through different patterns. We consider particles with competing short-range attraction and long-range repulsion subjected to time-dependent oscillations of the ratio between the attractive and repulsive interaction terms, which causes the system to cycle periodically between crystal and bubble states. In the presence of the substrate, this system exhibits both a positive and a reversed ratchet effect, and we show that there is a maximum in the ratchet efficiency as a function of interaction strength, ac drive frequency, and particle density. Our results could be realized for a variety of pattern-forming systems on asymmetric substrates where the pattern type or particle interactions can be oscillated.</description>

      <title>Rate-independent hysteretic energy dissipation in collagen fibrils</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.10841</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.10841v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Nanoindentation cycles measured with an atomic force microscope on hydrated collagen fibrils exhibit a rate-independent hysteresis with return point memory. This previously unknown energy dissipation mechanism describes in unified form elastoplastic indentation, capillary adhesion, and surface leveling at indentation velocities smaller than 1 $\mu$m s$^{-1}$, where viscous friction is negligible. A generic hysteresis model, based on force-distance data measured during one large approach-retract cycle, predicts the force (output) and the dissipated energy for arbitrary indentation trajectories (input). While both quantities are rate independent, they do depend nonlinearly on indentation history and on indentation amplitude.</description>

      <title>Quorum sensing of light-activated colloids in nematic liquid crystals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.10866</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.10866v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Motile living organisms routinely probe their surroundings to adapt in ever-evolving environments. Although synthetic microswimmers offer surrogates for self-propelled living entities, they often lack the complex feedback mechanisms that enable organisms to adapt. In this work, we present an experimental platform in which light-activated colloids dispersed in a nematic liquid crystal can (i) switch from directed to active Brownian motion depending on the nematic anchoring and (ii) mechanically adjust their motility in response to crowding, effectively enforcing quorum-sensing interactions. Both features are caused by a distinctive self-propulsion mechanism as unveiled through experiments, simulations, and theory. We characterize the dynamics of a single colloid and demonstrate that its motion is captured by an active Brownian particle model if the nematic anchoring is homeotropic, and by directed self-propulsion along the nematic director if the anchoring is planar. Next, we investigate the many-body dynamics, showing that it undergoes a clustering phase separation through effective quorum-sensing interactions. Our work suggests how to create adaptive materials with life-like capabilities using readily accessible properties of liquid crystals and colloids without explicitly engineering any of the needed mechano-chemical feedbacks.</description>

      <title>On the statistical physics and thermodynamics of polymer networks: a Eulerian theory for entropic elasticity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.10974</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.10974v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study presents a Eulerian theory to elucidate the molecular kinematics in polymer networks and their connection to continuum deformation, grounded in fundamental statistical physics and thermodynamics. Three key innovations are incorporated: 1. The network behavior is described through a global thermodynamic equilibrium condition that maximizes the number of accessible microstates for all segments, instead of directly dealing with the well-established single-chain models commonly adopted in traditional approaches. A variational problem is then posed in the Eulerian framework to identify this equilibrium state under geometric fluctuation constraints. Its solution recaptures the classical single-chain model and reveals the dependence of chain kinematics upon continuum deformation. 2. The chain stretch and orientation probability are found to be explicitly specified through the Eulerian logarithmic strain and spatial direction. The resulting hyperelastic model, with only two physical parameters, outperforms the extant models with same number of parameters. It further provides a physical justification for prior models exhibiting superior predictive capabilities: the model becomes equivalent to the Biot-chain model at moderate deformations, while converging to the classical Hencky strain energy in the small strain limit. 3.A novel biaxial instability emerges as a phase transition in chain orientation. At sufficiently large deformation, chains increasingly align with the primary stretched direction, depleting their density in other directions. Consequently, the stresses in non-primary stretched directions would decrease as the loss in chain density outweighs the gain in chain force. For equal biaxial tension, instability is therefore triggered because perfect equality of the two principal stretches without any perturbation is practically unachievable.</description>

      <title>Wallpaper Group-Based Mechanical Metamaterials: Dataset Including Mechanical Responses</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.11195</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.11195v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Mechanical metamaterials often exhibit pattern transformations through instabilities, enabling applications in, e.g., soft robotics, sound reduction, and biomedicine. These transformations and their resulting mechanical properties are closely tied to the symmetries in these metamaterials' microstructures, which remain under-explored. Designing such materials is challenging due to the unbounded design space, and while machine learning offers promising tools, they require extensive training data. Here, we present a large dataset of 2D microstructures and their macroscopic mechanical responses in the hyperelastic, finite-strain regime, including buckling. The microstructures are generated using a novel method, which covers all 17 wallpaper symmetry groups and employs B\'ezier curves for a rich parametric space. Mechanical responses are obtained through finite element-based computational homogenization. The dataset includes 1,020 distinct geometries, each subjected to 12 loading trajectories, totaling 12,240 trajectories. Our dataset supports the development and benchmarking of surrogate models, facilitates the study of symmetry-property relationships, and enables investigations into symmetry-breaking during pattern transformations, potentially revealing emergent behavior in mechanical metamaterials.</description>

      <title>Sub-microsecond electric switching of large birefringence in the isotropic phase of ferroelectric nematics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.11290</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.11290v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Conventional nonpolar nematic liquid crystals, widely known for their successful display applications, are not well-suited for fast electro-optical switching because of the slow (milliseconds) field-off relaxation of the director. In this work, we demonstrate sub-microsecond field-on and field-off switching of a large (~0.1) birefringence by applying a moderate electric field (30-100) V/{\mu}m, to an isotropic film of a ferroelectric nematic material. This highly efficient electro-optical switching is rooted in the recently discovered field-induced isotropic to ferroelectric nematic phase transition [J. Szydlowska et al., Phys. Rev. Lett. 130, 216802 (2023)]. The demonstrated sub-microsecond switching of ferroelectric birefringence induced by field (FBIF) has the potential for applications in fast-switching electro-optic devices, such as phase modulators, light shutters, beam steerers, switchable optical compensators.</description>

      <title>Channel Formation Enhances Target Consumption by Chemotactic Active Brownian Particles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.11328</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.11328v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In many situations, simply finding a target during a search is not enough. It is equally important to be able to return to that target repeatedly or to enable a larger community to locate and utilize it. While first passage time is commonly used to measure search success, relatively little is known about increasing the average rate of target encounters over time. Here, using an active Brownian particle model with chemotaxis, we demonstrate that when a searcher has no memory and there is no communication among multiple searchers, encoding information about the target's location in the environment outperforms purely memoryless strategies by boosting the overall hit rate. We further show that this approach reduces the impact of target size on a successful search and increases the total utilization time of the target.</description>

      <title>Effects of Epoxy Composition on the Thermal and Network Properties of Crosslinked Thermosets: A Molecular-Dynamics Study</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.11453</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.11453v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this study, we investigate the influence of resin composition on the thermal and structural properties of crosslinked epoxy networks using molecular-dynamics simulations. The systems studied are based on mixtures of diglycidyl ether of bisphenol A (DGEBA) and butylated epoxy resin (BER), cured with diethyltoluenediamine (DETDA). A multi-step crosslinking algorithm was used to generate highly crosslinked networks. We systematically explored how the addition of BER affects the network topology and thermophysical behavior of the resulting thermosets.
  Our results show that increasing BER content leads to a progressive loosening of the network, evidenced by longer inter-nitrogen path lengths and larger Voronoi atomic volumes. This structural loosening results in a higher coefficient of thermal expansion (CTE) and higher atomic mobility as well as a reduction in the glass-transition temperature. To quantify local steric and topological effects, we introduce a confinement index that captures atomic-level crowding and connectivity. The index shows a strong correlation with the observed trend in glass-transition temperature, suggesting its potential as a predictive descriptor for polymer network behavior. Our findings provide molecular-level insights into how epoxy resin composition modulates network structure and thermomechanical properties.</description>

      <title>Subharmonic Shapiro steps in depinning dynamics of a 2D solid dusty plasma modulated by 1D nonlinear deformed periodic substrates</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.11389</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.11389v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Langevin dynamical simulations are performed to investigate the depinning dynamics of a two-dimensional solid dusty plasma, which is modulated by one-dimensional nonlinear deformed periodic substrates, and also driven by the combination of the DC and AC forces. As the DC driving force increases gradually, pronounced subharmonic and harmonic Shapiro steps are discovered under the combined modulation of the deformed substrate and the external AC drive. These observed subharmonic and harmonic Shapiro steps are attributed to the dynamic mode locking. The data analysis results indicate that the nonlinear deformed substrate strongly influences these subharmonic Shapiro steps, which can be accurately diagnosed using the fraction of sixfold coordinated particles. Furthermore, the diagnostic of the kinetic temperature clearly indicates the difference between harmonic and subharmonic Shapiro steps, i.e., the particle motion is slightly less synchronized at subharmonic Shapiro steps, caused by the unstable locations of the deformed substrate.</description>

      <title>New Adaptive Material: Levitating Droplet via Plasma-Kelvin Force Coupling within Single Electrode Pair</title>

      <description>arXiv:2307.00826v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Fascinating in art and science, the ability to float is also captivating and relevant in practical applications, such as Penning and ion traps that are fundamental to quantum computing. In this work, we first reproduce the classic water bridge by glycerol and, as it breaks down due to thermal agitation, observe that a lump of glycerol with mass~2.5 g can float and exhibit near-periodic oscillations. Through experiments, finite element analysis, and simulations, we discover that the stability of the floating droplet is made possible by the interaction between three mechanisms: Deformation, Plasma, and Kelvin force. Note that GC falls in the class of adaptive materials that can change their properties or behavior in response to varying environmental conditions, i.e., stimuli-responsive. Furthermore, the stimuli, modified by the deformation of GC, collaborate with it to create this unique simple, yet stable, floating system.Backed up by simulations, this process, operated by only a single pair of electrodes, holds the potential to develop a simple yet powerful railgun.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.21115v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Fluid flow has a major effect on the aggregation and fragmentation of bacterial colonies. Yet, a generic framework to understand and predict how hydrodynamics affects colony size remains elusive. This study investigates how fluid flow affects the formation and maintenance of large colonial structures in cyanobacteria, using an experimental technique that precisely controls hydrodynamic conditions. We performed experiments on laboratory cultures and lake samples of the cyanobacterium Microcystis, while their colony size distribution was measured simultaneously by direct microscopic imaging. We demonstrate that EPS-embedded cells formed by cell division exhibit significant mechanical resistance to shear forces. However, at elevated hydrodynamic stress levels (exceeding those typically generated by surface wind mixing) these colonies experience fragmentation through an erosion process. We also show that single cells can aggregate into small colonies due to fluid flow. However, the structural integrity of these flow-induced colonies is weaker than that of colonies formed by cell division. We provide a mathematical analysis to support the experiments and demonstrate that a population model with two categories of colonies describes the measured size distributions. Our results shed light on the specific conditions wherein flow-induced fragmentation and aggregation of cyanobacteria are decisive and indicate that colony formation under natural conditions is mainly driven by cell division, although flow-induced aggregation could play a role in dense bloom events. These findings can be used to improve prediction models and mitigation strategies for toxic cyanobacterial blooms and also offer potential applications in other areas such as algal biotechnology or medical settings where the dynamics of biological aggregates play a significant role.</description>

      <title>Self-organized dynamics and emergent shape spaces of active isotropic fluid surfaces</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.17849v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Theories of self-organized active fluid surfaces have emerged as an important class of minimal models for the shape dynamics of biological membranes, cells and tissues. However, due to their inherent geometric nonlinearities and the absence of general minimization principles in active systems, it remains a major challenge to systematically study the emergent shape spaces such theories give rise to. Here, we introduce a novel variational approach that allows for a direct computation of stationary surface geometries and flows, which enables the classification of non-equilibrium phase transitions in shape spaces described by active surface theories. To achieve this, we construct a dissipation functional systematically from the entropy production in active surfaces and show how generic symmetries imposed by Onsager relations can be exploited to also account for reactive non-dissipative terms in constitutive laws. This functional is supplemented by Lagrange multipliers that relax nonlinear geometric constraints, which leads to a tractable variational problem suitable for implicit dynamic simulations and explicit calculations of non-trivial steady state geometries and flows. We apply this framework to study the dynamics of open fluid membranes and closed active fluid surfaces, and characterize the space of stationary solutions that corresponding surfaces and flows occupy. These analyses rationalize the interplay of first-order shape transitions of internally and externally forced fluid membranes, reveal degenerate regions in stationary shape spaces of mechanochemically active surfaces and identify a mechanism by which hydrodynamic screening controls the geometry of active surfaces undergoing cell division-like shape transformations.</description>

      <title>Crushing, Comminution and Fracture: Extreme Particle Deformation in Three-Dimensional Granular Aggregates</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.05362v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present a high-fidelity three dimensional computational framework for simulating the bulk mechanical behavior of granular aggregates composed of deformable brittle grains. Departing from classical discrete element methods (DEM), our approach captures both inter-particle and intra-particle deformation using a nonlocal continuum formulation based on peridynamics. Each grain is individually meshed from level-set representations, enabling accurate modeling of elastic response and autonomous fracture evolution without requiring explicit crack tracking or fragment reconstruction. We validate the method through benchmark simulations, including the Kalthoff-Winkler fracture test, crushing of hollow spheres, and compound impact-crushing scenarios. The framework is further applied to large aggregates of up to 1000 sand grains of irregular shapes reconstructed from three dimensional X-ray computed tomography. Simulations reveal convergence of bulk stress response under compression, suggesting the feasibility of constructing representative volume elements (RVEs) for multiscale modeling. Finally, we investigate the role of grain geometry and topology on the macroscopic strength of the aggregate, providing insight into microstructure-driven failure mechanisms. The framework exhibits excellent strong and weak scaling behavior, with simulations executed on up to 1600 cores, demonstrating its suitability for high-performance computing environments and large-scale modeling.</description>

      <title>A unifying approach to self-organizing systems interacting via conservation laws</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.02575v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present a unified framework for embedding and analyzing dynamical systems using generalized projection operators rooted in local conservation laws. By representing physical, biological, and engineered systems as graphs with incidence and cycle matrices, we derive dual projection operators that decompose network fluxes and potentials. This formalism aligns with principles of non-equilibrium thermodynamics and captures a broad class of systems governed by flux-forcing relationships and local constraints. We extend this approach to collective dynamics through the PRojective Embedding of Dynamical Systems (PrEDS), which lifts low-dimensional dynamics into a high-dimensional space, enabling both replication and recovery of the original dynamics. When systems fall within the PrEDS class, their collective behavior can be effectively approximated through projection onto a mean-field space. We demonstrate the versatility of PrEDS across diverse domains, including resistive and memristive circuits, adaptive flow networks (e.g., slime molds), elastic string networks, and particle swarms. Notably, we establish a direct correspondence between PrEDS and swarm dynamics, revealing new insights into optimization and self-organization. Our results offer a general theoretical foundation for analyzing complex networked systems and for designing systems that self-organize through local interactions.</description>
