      <title>Governance, Risk, and Regulation: A Framework for Improving Efficiency in Kenyan Pension Funds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.10999</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.10999v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: As life expectancy in Kenya increases, so does the need for efficient pension schemes that can secure a dignified retirement and protect members from old age poverty. Limited research, however, has explored the efficiency of these schemes under existing governance structures. This study addresses that gap by examining the combined effects of corporate governance, risk management, and industry regulation on pension scheme efficiency in Kenya. Using a quantitative design, we conducted a panel regression analysis on a seven-year secondary dataset of 128 Kenyan pension schemes, totaling 896 observations. Our results reveal significant insights That the presence of employee representatives on the board and effective risk management have a significant positive effect on efficiency. Conversely, independent board members exhibit a significant negative effect. Other factors, including top management representation, female board members, and industry regulation, showed no significant effect on efficiency in the joint model. These findings suggest that the impact of governance and risk management on efficiency is nuanced, with specific factors like employee representation playing a more prominent role. We propose that the electoral process for employee board members may introduce a Self Cleaning Mechanism that progressively enhances scheme efficiency. This mechanism offers a novel theoretical extension of Agency Theory, explaining the convergence of interests between elected trustees and scheme members.</description>

      <title>Loss given default after default</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.11364</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.11364v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The proposed work shows how to determine the Loss Given Default (LGD) after default without preparing a separate model. This requires the following: LGD model before default, the calculation of the average repayment time after default, the values of the volumes and moments of repayments after default, along with the lending rate for each loan, and the recovery rate recorded in the default volume. The LGD(t) variant is proposed, which predicts recovery based on the estimation of the average posterior distribution. An analysis is conducted on recovery portfolios, demonstrating the approximate statistics of the desired quantity. The solution allows you to build an LGD model after default for any default loans, provided that you know the volumes, repayment dates, and interest rates.</description>

      <title>Enhancing Efficiency of Pension Schemes through Effective Risk Governance: A Kenyan Perspective</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.11416</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.11416v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The efficiency of pension schemes in Kenya invites elevated interest owing to the increasing pension contribution amounts and the expectation that benefits paid out of these schemes would protect members from old age poverty. The study investigates the intervening effect of risk management on the relationship between corporate governance and the efficiency of pension schemes in Kenya. The study employs panel data consisting of 896 observations from 128 schemes in a sample period from 2015 to 2021. The study finds that risk management significantly mediates the relationship between employee representatives on the board of trustees, as a component of corporate governance, and the efficiency of pension schemes. Consequently, the mediation effect of risk management indicates that when employee representatives are involved in governance, the presence of strong risk management practices ensures that their contributions lead to improved efficiency. Risk management, therefore, serves as a critical safeguard that enables governance structures to function more effectively and contribute to the overall performance of the scheme.</description>

      <title>HSBC until 1950: From its colonial cradle past the World Wars</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.10715</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.10715v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Europe's largest bank by assets as of 2025 started out in the 1860s in one of Europe's colonies: The Hongkong and Shanghai Banking Co (HSBC). Multiple wars forced Qing China and later the young Republic of China into a series of unequal treaties, one of which was the forced legalisation of the opium trade from parts of the British Empire into China, another was opening several cities, including Shanghai, for trade and granting extensive civil, property and business rights to non-residents and yet another was the annexation of Hong Kong by the United Kingdom. These are the conditions that created HSBC and in which it thrived, including from opium-related profits. During periods of relative calm, the bank grew geographically and made profits -- whether in moral or unethical, whether in legal or unlawful ways -- which helped HSBC weather the storms of civil and world wars. Other aspects contributed to HSBC's survival and success, such as its global nature, which allowed it to diversify and shift away from regions when danger emerges there and find shelter in safer havens. Yet the resilient survival abilities and the financial success of HSBC until 1950 should not distract from the fact that in addition to its tainted cradle and early profits from facilitating the poisoning of a whole society, its human resource system was also discrimination based, attempting to divide the one human race into different groups -- in spite of such practises being opposed to medical and biological facts. What is particularly interesting to see is that not only has HSBC yet to apologise for the early drug-related blood money it made: it even fails to mention its colonial, drug profits tainted past on any of its many history-themed pages sighted. Later sections contain possible reasons for HSBC's resilience and success, particularly interesting for entrepreneurs.</description>

      <title>Optimal Dividend, Reinsurance and Capital Injection Strategies for Collaborating Business Lines: The Case of Excess-of-Loss Reinsurance</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.11383</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.11383v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper considers an insurer with two collaborating business lines that must make three critical decisions: (1) dividend payout, (2) a combination of proportional and excess-of-loss reinsurance coverage, and (3) capital injection between the lines. The reserve level of each line is modeled using a diffusion approximation, with the insurer's objective being to maximize the weighted total discounted dividends paid until the first ruin time. We obtain the value function and the optimal strategies in closed form. We then prove that the optimal dividend payout strategy for bounded dividend rates is of threshold type, while for unbounded dividend rates it is of barrier type. The optimal combination of proportional and excess-of-loss reinsurance is shown to be pure excess-of-loss reinsurance. We also show that the optimal level of risk ceded to the reinsurer decreases as the aggregate reserve level increases. The optimal capital injection strategy involves transferring reserves to prevent the ruin of one line. Finally, numerical examples are presented to illustrate these optimal strategies.</description>
