      <title>Two-level overlapping Schwarz preconditioners with universal coarse spaces for $2m$th-order elliptic problems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.18970</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.18970v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose a novel universal construction of two-level overlapping Schwarz preconditioners for $2m$th-order elliptic boundary value problems, where $m$ is a positive integer. The word "universal" here signifies that the coarse space construction can be applied to any finite element discretization for any $m$ that satisfies some common assumptions. We present numerical results for conforming, nonconforming, and discontinuous Galerkin-type finite element discretizations for high-order problems to demonstrate the scalability of the proposed two-level overlapping Schwarz preconditioners.</description>

      <title>Concurrent level set and fiber orientation optimization of composite structures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.18971</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.18971v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: By adjusting both the structural shape and fiber orientation, this research aims to optimize the design of Fiber Reinforced Composite structures. The structural geometry is represented by a level set function, which is approximated by quadratic B-spline functions. The fiber orientation field is parameterized with quadratic/cubic B-splines on hierarchically refined meshes. Different levels for B-spline mesh refinement for the level set and fiber orientation fields are studied to obtain a smooth fiber layout. To facilitate FRC manufacturing, the parallel alignment, and smoothness of fiber paths are enforced by introducing penalty terms referred to as "misalignment penalty and curvature penalty", which are incorporated into the optimization process. A geometric interpretation of the penalties is provided. The material behavior of the FRCs is modeled by the Mori-Tanaka homogenization scheme and the macroscopic structure response is modeled by linear elasticity under static mutiloading conditions. The Governing equations are discretized by a Heaviside-enriched eXtended IsoGeometric Analysis to avoid the need to generate conformal meshes. Instabilities in XIGA are mitigated by the facet-oriented ghost stabilization technique. This work considers mass and strain energy in the formulation of the optimization objective, along with misalignment and curvature penalties and additional regularization terms. Constraints are imposed on the volume of the structure. The resulting optimization problems are solved by a gradient-based algorithm. The design sensitivities are computed by the adjoint method. Numerical examples demonstrate with two-dimensional and three-dimensional configurations that the proposed method is efficient in simultaneously optimizing the macroscopic shape and the fiber layout while improving manufacturability by promoting parallel and smooth fiber paths.</description>

      <title>Discrete Poincar\'e inequality and Discrete Trace inequality in Piece-wise Polynomial Hybridizable Spaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.19004</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.19004v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we establish discrete versions of the Poincar\'e and trace inequalities for hybridizable finite element spaces. These spaces are made of piecewise polynomial functions defined both within the interiors of elements and across all faces in a mesh's skeleton, serving as the basis for both the hybridizable discontinuous Galerkin (HDG) and hybrid high-order (HHO) methods. Additionally, we present a specific adaptation of these inequalities for the HDG method and apply them to demonstrate the stability of the related numerical schemes for second-order elliptic equations under the minimal regularity assumptions for the source term and boundary data.</description>

      <title>A Stabilized Physics Informed Neural Networks Method for Wave Equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.19090</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.19090v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this article, we propose a novel Stabilized Physics Informed Neural Networks method (SPINNs) for solving wave equations. In general, this method not only demonstrates theoretical convergence but also exhibits higher efficiency compared to the original PINNs. By replacing the $L^2$ norm with $H^1$ norm in the learning of initial condition and boundary condition, we theoretically proved that the error of solution can be upper bounded by the risk in SPINNs. Based on this, we decompose the error of SPINNs into approximation error, statistical error and optimization error. Furthermore, by applying the approximating theory of $ReLU^3$ networks and the learning theory on Rademacher complexity, covering number and pseudo-dimension of neural networks, we present a systematical non-asymptotic convergence analysis on our method, which shows that the error of SPINNs can be well controlled if the number of training samples, depth and width of the deep neural networks have been appropriately chosen. Two illustrative numerical examples on 1-dimensional and 2-dimensional wave equations demonstrate that SPINNs can achieve a faster and better convergence than classical PINNs method.</description>

      <title>Schr\"odingerisation based computationally stable algorithms for ill-posed problems in partial differential equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.19123</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.19123v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce a simple and stable computational method for ill-posed partial differential equation (PDE) problems. The method is based on Schr\"odingerisation, introduced in [S. Jin, N. Liu and Y. Yu, Phys. Rev. A, 108 (2023), 032603], which maps all linear PDEs into Schr\"odinger-type equations in one higher dimension, for quantum simulations of these PDEs. Although the original problem is ill-posed, the Schr\"odingerized equations are Hamiltonian systems and time-reversible, allowing stable computation both forward and backward in time. The original variable can be recovered by data from suitably chosen domain in the extended dimension. We will use the backward heat equation and the linear convection equation with imaginary wave speed as examples. Error analysis of these algorithms are conducted and verified numerically. The methods apply to both classical and quantum computers, and we also layout the quantum algorithms for these methods.</description>

      <title>A piecewise neural network method for solving large interval solution to initial value problem of ordinary differential equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.19218</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.19218v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Various traditional numerical methods for solving initial value problems of differential equations often produce local solutions near the initial value point, despite the problems having larger interval solutions. Even current popular neural network algorithms or deep learning methods cannot guarantee yielding large interval solutions for these problems. In this paper, we propose a piecewise neural network approach to obtain a large interval numerical solution for initial value problems of differential equations. In this method, we first divide the solution interval, on which the initial problem is to be solved, into several smaller intervals. Neural networks with a unified structure are then employed on each sub-interval to solve the related sub-problems. By assembling these neural network solutions, a piecewise expression of the large interval solution to the problem is constructed, referred to as the piecewise neural network solution. The continuous differentiability of the solution over the entire interval, except for finite points, is proven through theoretical analysis and employing a parameter transfer technique. Additionally, a parameter transfer and multiple rounds of pre-training technique are utilized to enhance the accuracy of the approximation solution. Compared with existing neural network algorithms, this method does not increase the network size and training data scale for training the network on each sub-domain. Finally, several numerical experiments are presented to demonstrate the efficiency of the proposed algorithm.</description>

      <title>Computing large deviation rate functions of entropy production for diffusion processes in the vanishing-noise limit and high dimensions by an interacting particle method</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.19223</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.19223v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study an interacting particle method (IPM) for computing the large deviation rate function of entropy production for diffusion processes, with emphasis on the vanishing-noise limit and high dimensions. The crucial ingredient to obtain the rate function is the computation of the principal eigenvalue $\lambda$ of elliptic, non-self-adjoint operators. We show that this principal eigenvalue can be approximated in terms of the spectral radius of a discretized evolution operator obtained from an operator splitting scheme and an Euler--Maruyama scheme with a small time step size, and we show that this spectral radius can be accessed through a large number of iterations of this discretized semigroup, suitable for the IPM. The IPM applies naturally to problems in unbounded domains, scales easily to high dimensions, and adapts to singular behaviors in the vanishing-noise limit. We show numerical examples in dimensions up to 16. The numerical results show that our numerical approximation of $\lambda$ converges to the analytical vanishing-noise limit with a fixed number of particles and a fixed time step size. Our paper appears to be the first one to obtain numerical results of principal eigenvalue problems for non-self-adjoint operators in such high dimensions.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.19231v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Is it possible to consider a lattice Boltzmann scheme as an approximation of a partial differential equation? For a nonhomogeneous advection problem in one spatial dimension, we propose equivalent partial differential equations at various orders. We compare the lattice Boltzmann results and a spectral approximation of the differential equations. No simple correlation is obtained for a stationary problem. For an unsteady situation, we show that the initialization scheme of the microscopic moments plays a crucial role.</description>

      <title>Regularized dynamical parametric approximation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.19234</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.19234v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper studies the numerical approximation of evolution equations by nonlinear parametrizations $u(t)=\Phi(q(t))$ with time-dependent parameters $q(t)$, which are to be determined in the computation. The motivation comes from approximations in quantum dynamics by multiple Gaussians and approximations of various dynamical problems by tensor networks and neural networks. In all these cases, the parametrization is typically irregular: the derivative $\Phi'(q)$ can have arbitrarily small singular values and may have varying rank. We derive approximation results for a regularized approach in the time-continuous case as well as in time-discretized cases. With a suitable choice of the regularization parameter and the time stepsize, the approach can be successfully applied in irregular situations, even though it runs counter to the basic principle in numerical analysis to avoid solving ill-posed subproblems when aiming for a stable algorithm. Numerical experiments with sums of Gaussians for approximating quantum dynamics and with neural networks for approximating the flow map of a system of ordinary differential equations illustrate and complement the theoretical results.</description>

      <title>Adaptive optimization of isogeometric multi-patch discretizations using artificial neural networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.19286</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.19286v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In isogeometric analysis, isogeometric function spaces are employed for accurately representing the solution to a partial differential equation (PDE) on a parameterized domain. They are generated from a tensor-product spline space by composing the basis functions with the inverse of the parameterization. Depending on the geometry of the domain and on the data of the PDE, the solution might not have maximum Sobolev regularity, leading to a reduced convergence rate. In this case it is necessary to reduce the local mesh size close to the singularities. The classical approach is to perform adaptive h-refinement, which either leads to an unnecessarily large number of degrees of freedom or to a spline space that does not possess a tensor-product structure. Based on the concept of r-adaptivity we present a novel approach for finding a suitable isogeometric function space for a given PDE without sacrificing the tensor-product structure of the underlying spline space. In particular, we use the fact that different reparameterizations of the same computational domain lead to different isogeometric function spaces while preserving the geometry. Starting from a multi-patch domain consisting of bilinearly parameterized patches, we aim to find the biquadratic multi-patch parameterization that leads to the isogeometric function space with the smallest best approximation error of the solution. In order to estimate the location of the optimal control points, we employ a trained residual neural network that is applied to the graph surfaces of the approximated solution and its derivatives. In our experimental results, we observe that our new method results in a vast improvement of the approximation error for different PDE problems on multi-patch domains.</description>

      <title>A unified SHTC multiphase model of continuum mechanics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.19298</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.19298v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we present a unified nonequilibrium model of continuum mechanics for compressible multiphase flows. The model, which is formulated within the framework of Symmetric Hyperbolic Thermodynamically Compatible (SHTC) equations, can describe the arbitrary number of phases that can be heat-conducting inviscid and viscous fluids}, as well as elastoplastic solids. The phases are allowed to have different velocities, pressures, temperatures, and shear stresses, while the material interfaces are treated as diffuse interfaces with the volume fraction playing the role of the interface field. To relate our model to other multiphase approaches, we reformulate the SHTC governing equations in terms of the phase state parameters and put them in the form of Baer-Nunziato-type models. It is the Baer-Nunziato form of the SHTC equations which is then solved numerically using a robust second-order path-conservative MUSCL-Hancock finite volume method on Cartesian meshes. Due to the fact that the obtained governing equations are very challenging, we restrict our numerical examples to a simplified version of the model, focusing on the isentropic limit for three-phase mixtures. To address the stiffness properties of the relaxation source terms present in the model, the implemented scheme incorporates a semi-analytical time integration method specifically designed for the non-linear stiff source terms governing the strain relaxation. The validation process involves a wide range of benchmarks and several applications for compressible multiphase problems. Notably, results are presented for multiphase flows in all the relaxation limit cases of the model, including inviscid and viscous Newtonian fluids, as well as non-linear hyperelastic and elastoplastic solids.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.19309v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, the infinite GMRES algorithm, recently proposed by Correnty et al., is employed in contour integral-based nonlinear eigensolvers, avoiding the computation of costly factorizations at each quadrature node to solve the linear systems efficiently. Several techniques are applied to make the infinite GMRES memory-friendly, computationally efficient, and numerically stable in practice. More specifically, we analyze the relationship between polynomial eigenvalue problems and their scaled linearizations, and provide a novel weighting strategy which can significantly accelerate the convergence of infinite GMRES in this particular context. We also adopt the technique of TOAR to infinite GMRES to reduce the memory footprint. Theoretical analysis and numerical experiments are provided to illustrate the efficiency of the proposed algorithm.</description>

      <title>Complex generalized Gauss-Radau quadrature rules for Hankel transforms of integer order</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.19328</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.19328v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Complex Gaussian quadrature rules for oscillatory integral transforms have the advantage that they can achieve optimal asymptotic order. However, their existence for Hankel transform can only be guaranteed when the order of the transform belongs to $[0,1/2]$. In this paper we consider the construction of generalized Gauss-Radau quadrature rules for Hankel transform. We show that, if adding certain value and derivative information at the left endpoint, then complex generalized Gauss-Radau quadrature rules for Hankel transform of integer order can be constructed with theoretical guarantees. Orthogonal polynomials that are closely related to such quadrature rules are investigated and their existence for even degrees is proved. Numerical experiments are presented to confirm our findings.</description>

      <title>An efficient multiscale multigrid preconditioner for Darcy flow in high-contrast media</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.19342</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.19342v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we develop a multigrid preconditioner to solve Darcy flow in highly heterogeneous porous media. The key component of the preconditioner is to construct a sequence of nested subspaces $W_{\mathcal{L}}\subset W_{\mathcal{L}-1}\subset\cdots\subset W_1=W_h$. An appropriate spectral problem is defined in the space of $W_{i-1}$, then the eigenfunctions of the spectral problems are utilized to form $W_i$. The preconditioner is applied to solve a positive semidefinite linear system which results from discretizing the Darcy flow equation with the lowest order Raviart-Thomas spaces and adopting a trapezoidal quadrature rule. Theoretical analysis and numerical investigations of this preconditioner will be presented. In particular, we will consider several typical highly heterogeneous permeability fields whose resolutions are up to $1024^3$ and examine the computational performance of the preconditioner in several aspects, such as strong scalability, weak scalability, and robustness against the contrast of the media. We also demonstrate an application of this preconditioner for solving a two-phase flow benchmark problem.</description>

      <title>A robust two-level overlapping preconditioner for Darcy flow in high-contrast media</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.19356</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.19356v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this article, a two-level overlapping domain decomposition preconditioner is developed for solving linear algebraic systems obtained from simulating Darcy flow in high-contrast media. Our preconditioner starts at a mixed finite element method for discretizing the partial differential equation by Darcy's law with the no-flux boundary condition and is then followed by a velocity elimination technique to yield a linear algebraic system with only unknowns of pressure. Then, our main objective is to design a robust and efficient domain decomposition preconditioner for this system, which is accomplished by engineering a multiscale coarse space that is capable of characterizing high-contrast features of the permeability field. A generalized eigenvalue problem is solved in each non-overlapping coarse element in a communication-free manner to form the global solver, which is accompanied by local solvers originated from additive Schwarz methods but with a non-Galerkin discretization to derive the two-level preconditioner. We provide a rigorous analysis that indicates that the condition number of the preconditioned system could be bounded above with several assumptions. Extensive numerical experiments with various types of three-dimensional high-contrast models are exhibited. In particular, we study the robustness against the contrast of the media as well as the influences of numbers of eigenfunctions, oversampling sizes, and subdomain partitions on the efficiency of the proposed preconditioner. Besides, strong and weak scalability performances are also examined.</description>

      <title>Puzzle game: Prediction and Classification of Wordle Solution Words</title>

Abstract: With the popularity of the Wordle game launched by the New York Times, more and more players are getting involved in this challenging game. Submitting the correct answer not only requires your luck, but is also influenced by various attributes of the word.
  For question 1, we preprocessed the original data by removing and replacing the abnormal data firstly. Then, we established an ARIMA-based prediction model for the number of reported results, with the parameters p=0, d=1, q=1 of the model determined. And it gave [20337, 21673] as the prediction interval for the number of reported results on March 1, 2023. Then we selected the frequency of word usage (FREQ), the information entropy of the word (WIE) and the number of repeated letters contained in the word (NRE) as attributes of the word and we made correlation analysis between these three attributes and seven percentages of tries. The results showed that FREQ was positively correlated with the number of tries, while WIE and NRE were negatively correlated with the number of tries.
  For problem 2, we established a regression model based on XGBoost algorithm for predicting the distribution of the reported results, and the three attributes selected for problem 1 were used to establish seven regression models for seven different tries, named XGB1 - XGB7. Since the percentage of 1 try was small and XGB1's prediction effect was poor, so we use the mean value of 1 try data - 0.5 as the prediction value of XGB1, and XGB2 - XGB7 model predicted 85.67%, 83.23%, 80.34%, 78.77%, 79.89%, and 84.63% respectively, with an overall accuracy of 82.1%. The associated percentages of (1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, X) of "EERIE" was predicted to be 0.5, 2.3, 13.8, 21.7, 29.4, 22.3 and 10.

      <title>Deep decomposition method for the limited aperture inverse obstacle scattering problem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.19470</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.19470v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we consider a deep learning approach to the limited aperture inverse obstacle scattering problem. It is well known that traditional deep learning relies solely on data, which may limit its performance for the inverse problem when only indirect observation data and a physical model are available. A fundamental question arises in light of these limitations: is it possible to enable deep learning to work on inverse problems without labeled data and to be aware of what it is learning? This work proposes a deep decomposition method (DDM) for such purposes, which does not require ground truth labels. It accomplishes this by providing physical operators associated with the scattering model to the neural network architecture. Additionally, a deep learning based data completion scheme is implemented in DDM to prevent distorting the solution of the inverse problem for limited aperture data. Furthermore, apart from addressing the ill-posedness imposed by the inverse problem itself, DDM is a physics-aware machine learning technique that can have interpretability property. The convergence result of DDM is theoretically proven. Numerical experiments are presented to demonstrate the validity of the proposed DDM even when the incident and observation apertures are extremely limited.</description>

      <title>The linear sampling method for data generated by small random scatterers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.19482</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.19482v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present an extension of the linear sampling method for solving the sound-soft inverse scattering problem in two dimensions with data generated by randomly distributed small scatterers. The theoretical justification of our novel sampling method is based on a rigorous asymptotic model, a modified Helmholtz--Kirchhoff identity, and our previous work on the linear sampling method for random sources. Our numerical implementation incorporates boundary elements, Singular Value Decomposition, Tikhonov regularization, and Morozov's discrepancy principle. We showcase the robustness and accuracy of our algorithms with a series of numerical experiments.</description>

      <title>Adaptive resolution of fine scales in modes of microstructured optical fibers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.19485</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.19485v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: An adaptive algorithm for computing eigenmodes and propagation constants of optical fibers is proposed. The algorithm is built using a dual-weighted residual error estimator. The residuals are based on the eigensystem for leaky hybrid modes obtained from Maxwell equations truncated to a finite domain after a transformation by a perfectly matched layer. The adaptive algorithm is then applied to compute practically interesting modes for multiple fiber microstructures. Emerging microstructured optical fibers are characterized by complex geometrical features in their transverse cross-section. Their leaky modes, useful for confining and propagating light in their cores, often exhibit fine scale features. The adaptive algorithm automatically captures these features without any expert input. The results also show that confinement losses of these modes are captured accurately on the adaptively found meshes.</description>

      <title>A third-order low-regularity trigonometric integrator for the semilinear Klein-Gordon equation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.19540</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.19540v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we propose and analyze a novel third-order low-regularity trigonometric integrator for the semilinear Klein-Gordon equation in the $d$-dimensional space with $d=1,2,3$. The integrator is constructed based on the full use of Duhamel's formula and the technique of twisted function to the trigonometric integrals. Rigorous error estimates are presented and the proposed method is shown to have third-order accuracy in the energy space under a weak regularity requirement in $H^{2}\times H^{1}$. A numerical experiment shows that the proposed third-order low-regularity integrator is much more accurate than the well-known exponential integrators of order three for approximating the Klein-Gordon equation with nonsmooth solutions.</description>

      <title>Stabilization of linear Port-Hamiltonian Descriptor Systems via Output Feedback</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.18967</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.18967v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The structure preserving stabilization of (possibly non-regular) linear port-Hamiltonian descriptor (pHDAE) systems by output feedback is discussed. While for general descriptor systems the characterization when there exist output feedbacks that lead to an asymptotically stable closed loop system is a very hard and partially open problem, for systems in pHDAE representation this problem can be completely solved. Necessary and sufficient conditions are presented that guarantee that there exist a proportional output feedback such that the resulting closed-loop port-Hamiltonian descriptor system is (robustly) asymptotically stable. For this it is also necessary that the output feedback also makes the problem regular and of index at most one. A complete characterization when this is possible is presented as well.</description>

      <title>Finding Birkhoff Averages via Adaptive Filtering</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.19003</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.19003v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In many applications, one is interested in classifying trajectories of Hamiltonian systems as invariant tori, islands, or chaos. The convergence rate of ergodic Birkhoff averages can be used to categorize these regions, but many iterations of the return map are needed to implement this directly. Recently, it has been shown that a weighted Birkhoff average can be used to accelerate the convergence, resulting in a useful method for categorizing trajectories.
  In this paper, we show how a modified version the reduced rank extrapolation method (named Birkhoff RRE) can also be used to find optimal weights for the weighted average with a single linear least-squares solve.Using these, we classify trajectories with fewer iterations of the map than the standard weighted Birkhoff average. Furthermore, for the islands and invariant circles, a subsequent eigenvalue problem gives the number of islands and the rotation number. Using these numbers, we find Fourier parameterizations of invariant circles and islands. We show examples of Birkhoff RRE on the standard map and on magnetic field line dynamics.</description>

      <title>Computing the spectrum and pseudospectrum of infinite-volume operators from local patches</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.19055</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.19055v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We show how the spectrum of normal discrete short-range infinite-volume operators can be approximated with two-sided error control using only data from finite-sized local patches. As a corollary, we prove the computability of the spectrum of such infinite-volume operators with the additional property of finite local complexity and provide an explicit algorithm. Such operators appear in many applications, e.g. as discretizations of differential operators on unbounded domains or as so-called tight-binding Hamiltonians in solid state physics. For a large class of such operators, our result allows for the first time to establish computationally also the absence of spectrum, i.e. the existence and the size of spectral gaps. We extend our results to the $\varepsilon$-pseudospectrum of non-normal operators, proving that also the pseudospectrum of such operators is computable.</description>

      <title>Stability of solutions of the porous medium equation with growth with respect to the diffusion exponent</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.19070v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider a macroscopic model for the growth of living tissues incorporating pressure-driven dispersal and pressure-modulated proliferation. Assuming a power-law relation between the mechanical pressure and the cell density, the model can be expressed as the porous medium equation with a growth term. We prove H\"older continuous dependence of the solutions of the model on the diffusion exponent. The main difficulty lies in the degeneracy of the porous medium equations at vacuum. To deal with this issue, we first regularise the equation by shifting the initial data away from zero and then optimise the stability estimate derived in the regular setting.</description>

      <title>Extracting coherent sets in aperiodically driven flows from generators of Mather semigroups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.19274</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.19274v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Coherent sets are time-dependent regions in the physical space of nonautonomous flows that exhibit little mixing with their neighborhoods, robustly under small random perturbations of the flow. They thus characterize the global long-term transport behavior of the system. We propose a framework to extract such time-dependent families of coherent sets for nonautonomous systems with an ergodic driving dynamics and (small) Brownian noise in physical space. Our construction involves the assembly and analysis of an operator on functions over the augmented space of the associated skew product that, for each fixed state of the driving, propagates distributions on the corresponding physical-space fibre according to the dynamics. This time-dependent operator has the structure of a semigroup (it is called the Mather semigroup), and we show that a spectral analysis of its generator allows for a trajectory-free computation of coherent families, simultaneously for all states of the driving. Additionally, for quasi-periodically driven torus flows, we propose a tailored Fourier discretization scheme for this generator and demonstrate our method by means of three examples of two-dimensional flows.</description>

      <title>A multi-step calibration strategy for reliable parameter determination of salt rock mechanics constitutive models</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.19426v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Renewable hydrogen storage in salt caverns requires fast injection and production rates to cope with the imbalance between energy production and consumption. Such operational conditions raise concerns about the mechanical stability of salt caverns. Choosing an appropriate constitutive model for salt mechanics is an important step in investigating this issue, and many constitutive models with several parameters have been presented in the literature. However, a robust calibration strategy to reliably determine which model and which parameter set represent the given rock, based on stress-strain data, remains an unsolved challenge. For the first time in the community, we present a multi-step strategy to determine a single parameter set based on many deformation datasets for salt rocks. Towards this end, we first develop a comprehensive constitutive model able to capture all relevant nonlinear deformation physics of transient, reverse, and steady-state creep. The determination of the single set of representative material parameters is achieved by framing the calibration process as an optimization problem, for which the global PSO algorithm is employed. Dynamic data integration is achieved by a multi-step calibration strategy for a situation where experiments are included one at a time, as they become available. Additionally, our calibration strategy is made flexible to account for mild heterogeneity between rock samples, resulting in a single set of parameters that is representative of the deformation datasets. As a rigorous mathematical analysis and the lack of relevant experimental datasets, we consider a wide range of synthetic experimental data, inspired by the existing sparse relevant data in the literature. The results of our performance analyses show that the proposed calibration strategy is robust and accuracy is improved as more experiments are included for calibration.</description>

      <title>Fisher-Rao Gradient Flows of Linear Programs and State-Action Natural Policy Gradients</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.19448v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Kakade's natural policy gradient method has been studied extensively in the last years showing linear convergence with and without regularization. We study another natural gradient method which is based on the Fisher information matrix of the state-action distributions and has received little attention from the theoretical side. Here, the state-action distributions follow the Fisher-Rao gradient flow inside the state-action polytope with respect to a linear potential. Therefore, we study Fisher-Rao gradient flows of linear programs more generally and show linear convergence with a rate that depends on the geometry of the linear program. Equivalently, this yields an estimate on the error induced by entropic regularization of the linear program which improves existing results. We extend these results and show sublinear convergence for perturbed Fisher-Rao gradient flows and natural gradient flows up to an approximation error. In particular, these general results cover the case of state-action natural policy gradients.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.19512v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper presents a quantum algorithm for the solution of prototypical second-order linear elliptic partial differential equations discretized by $d$-linear finite elements on Cartesian grids of a bounded $d$-dimensional domain. An essential step in the construction is a BPX preconditioner, which transforms the linear system into a sufficiently well-conditioned one, making it amenable to quantum computation. We provide a constructive proof demonstrating that our quantum algorithm can compute suitable functionals of the solution to a given tolerance $\texttt{tol}$ with a complexity linear in $\texttt{tol}^{-1}$ for a fixed dimension $d$, neglecting logarithmic terms. This complexity is proportional to that of its one-dimensional counterpart and improves previous quantum algorithms by a factor of order $\texttt{tol}^{-2}$. We also detail the design and implementation of a quantum circuit capable of executing our algorithm, and present simulator results that support the quantum feasibility of the finite element method in the near future, paving the way for quantum computing approaches to a wide range of PDE-related challenges.</description>

      <title>A combination technique for optimal control problems constrained by random PDEs</title>

      <description>arXiv:2211.00499v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present a combination technique based on mixed differences of both spatial approximations and quadrature formulae for the stochastic variables to solve efficiently a class of Optimal Control Problems (OCPs) constrained by random partial differential equations. The method requires to solve the OCP for several low-fidelity spatial grids and quadrature formulae for the objective functional. All the computed solutions are then linearly combined to get a final approximation which, under suitable regularity assumptions, preserves the same accuracy of fine tensor product approximations, while drastically reducing the computational cost. The combination technique involves only tensor product quadrature formulae, thus the discretized OCPs preserve the (possible) convexity of the continuous OCP. Hence, the combination technique avoids the inconveniences of Multilevel Monte Carlo and/or sparse grids approaches, but remains suitable for high dimensional problems. The manuscript presents an a-priori procedure to choose the most important mixed differences and an asymptotic complexity analysis, which states that the asymptotic complexity is exclusively determined by the spatial solver. Numerical experiments validate the results.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2306.15867v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider the singularly perturbed fourth-order boundary value problem $\varepsilon ^{2}\Delta ^{2}u-\Delta u=f $ on the unit square $\Omega \subset \mathbb{R}^2$, with boundary conditions $u = \partial u / \partial n = 0$ on $\partial \Omega$, where $\varepsilon \in (0, 1)$ is a small parameter. The problem is solved numerically by means of a weak Galerkin(WG) finite element method, which is highly robust and flexible in the element construction by using discontinuous piecewise polynomials on finite element partitions consisting of polygons of arbitrary shape. The resulting WG finite element formulation is symmetric, positive definite, and parameter-free. Under reasonable assumptions on the structure of the boundary layers that appear in the solution, a family of suitable Shishkin meshes with $N^2$ elements is constructed ,convergence of the method is proved in a discrete $H^2$ norm for the corresponding WG finite element solutions and numerical results are presented.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2309.02156v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present an acceleration method for sequences of large-scale linear systems, such as the ones arising from the numerical solution of time-dependent partial differential equations coupled with algebraic constraints. We discuss different approaches to leverage the subspace containing the history of solutions computed at previous time steps in order to generate a good initial guess for the iterative solver. In particular, we propose a novel combination of reduced-order projection with randomized linear algebra techniques, which drastically reduces the number of iterations needed for convergence. We analyze the accuracy of the initial guess produced by the reduced-order projection when the coefficients of the linear system depend analytically on time. Extending extrapolation results by Demanet and Townsend to a vector-valued setting, we show that the accuracy improves rapidly as the size of the history increases, a theoretical result confirmed by our numerical observations. In particular, we apply the developed method to the simulation of plasma turbulence in the boundary of a fusion device, showing that the time needed for solving the linear systems is significantly reduced.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2312.08280v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we develop new high-order numerical methods for hyperbolic systems of nonlinear partial differential equations (PDEs) with uncertainties. The new approach is realized in the semi-discrete finite-volume framework and is based on fifth-order weighted essentially non-oscillatory (WENO) interpolations in (multidimensional) random space combined with second-order piecewise linear reconstruction in physical space. Compared with spectral approximations in the random space, the presented methods are essentially non-oscillatory as they do not suffer from the Gibbs phenomenon while still achieving high-order accuracy. The new methods are tested on a number of numerical examples for both the Euler equations of gas dynamics and the Saint-Venant system of shallow-water equations. In the latter case, the methods are also proven to be well-balanced and positivity-preserving.</description>

      <title>Mixed finite element methods for linear Cosserat equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.15136</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.15136v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider the equilibrium equations for a linearized Cosserat material. We identify their structure in terms of a differential complex, which is isomorphic to six copies of the de Rham complex through an algebraic isomorphism. Moreover, we show how the Cosserat materials can be analyzed by inheriting results from linearized elasticity. Both perspectives give rise to mixed finite element methods, which we refer to as strongly and weakly coupled, respectively. We prove convergence of both classes of methods, with particular attention to improved convergence rate estimates, and stability in the limit of vanishing Cosserat material parameters. The theoretical results are fully reflected in the actual performance of the methods, as shown by the numerical verifications.</description>

      <title>Sparse additive function decompositions facing basis transforms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.15563</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.15563v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: High-dimensional real-world systems can often be well characterized by a small number of simultaneous low-complexity interactions. The analysis of variance (ANOVA) decomposition and the anchored decomposition are typical techniques to find sparse additive decompositions of functions. In this paper, we are interested in a setting, where these decompositions are not directly spare, but become so after an appropriate basis transform. Noting that the sparsity of those additive function decompositions is equivalent to the fact that most of its mixed partial derivatives vanish, we can exploit a connection to the underlying function graphs to determine an orthogonal transform that realizes the appropriate basis change. This is done in three steps: we apply singular value decomposition to minimize the number of vertices of the function graph, and joint block diagonalization techniques of families of matrices followed by sparse minimization based on relaxations of the zero ''norm'' for minimizing the number of edges. For the latter one, we propose and analyze minimization techniques over the manifold of special orthogonal matrices. Various numerical examples illustrate the reliability of our approach for functions having, after a basis transform, a sparse additive decomposition into summands with at most two variables.</description>

      <title>Optimal error bounds in the absence of constraint qualifications with applications to the $p$-cones and beyond</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2109.11729</link>
      <description>arXiv:2109.11729v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We prove tight H\"olderian error bounds for all $p$-cones. Surprisingly, the exponents differ in several ways from those that have been previously conjectured; moreover, they illuminate $p$-cones as a curious example of a class of objects that possess properties in 3 dimensions that they do not in 4 or more. Using our error bounds, we analyse least squares problems with $p$-norm regularization, where our results enable us to compute the corresponding KL exponents for previously inaccessible values of $p$. Another application is a (relatively) simple proof that most $p$-cones are neither self-dual nor homogeneous. Our error bounds are obtained under the framework of facial residual functions, and we expand it by establishing for general cones an optimality criterion under which the resulting error bound must be tight.</description>

      <title>Elastic Analysis of Augmented Curves and Constrained Surfaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.04944</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.04944v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The square root velocity transformation provides a convenient and numerically efficient approach to functional and shape data analysis of curves. We study fundamental geometric properties of curves under this transformation. Moreover, utilizing natural geometric constructions, we employ the approach for intrinsic comparison within several classes of surfaces and augmented curves, which arise in the real world applications such as tubes, ruled surfaces, spherical strips, protein molecules and hurricane tracks.</description>
