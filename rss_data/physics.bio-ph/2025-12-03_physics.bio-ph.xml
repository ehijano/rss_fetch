      <title>MoRSAIK: Sequence Motif Reactor Simulation, Analysis and Inference Kit in Python</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.02204</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.02204v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Origins of life research investigates how life could emerge from prebiotic chemistry only. One possible explanation provides the RNA world hypothesis. It states that life could emerge from RNA strands only, storing and transferring biological information, as well as catalyzing reactions as ribozymes. Before this state could have emerged, however, the prebiotic world was probably a purely chemical pool of short RNA strands with random sequences and without biological function performing hybridization and dehybridization, as well as ligation and cleavage. In this context relevant questions are what are the conditions that allow longer RNA strands to be built and how can information carrying in RNA sequence emerge?
  In order to investigate such RNA reactors, efficient simulations are needed because the space of possible RNA sequences increases exponentially with the length of the strands, as well as the number of reactions between two strands. In addition, simulations have to be compared to experimental data for validation and parameter calibration. Here, we present the MoRSAIK python package for sequence motif (or k-mer) reactor simulation, analysis and inference. It enables users to simulate RNA sequence motif dynamics in the mean field approximation as well as to infer the reaction parameters from data with Bayesian methods and to analyze results by computing observables and plotting. MoRSAIK simulates an RNA reactor by following the reactions and the concentrations of all strands inside up to a certain length (of four nucleotides by default). Longer strands are followed indirectly, by tracking the concentrations of their containing sequence motifs of that maximum length.</description>

      <title>Invariance under Structure Translation as the Origin of Host Immune Capacity Conservation from Noether's Theorem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.02730</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.02730v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The capacity to resist pathogens is recognized as a fundamental property of the immune system, yet it remains a phenomenological concept and lacks a defined physical basis, leaving its fundamental entity, definition, and quantification unresolved. Here, we address these questions by introducing a theoretical framework based on Lagrangian analytical mechanics, which recasts immune recognition as a dynamical system in an immunological state space. Generalized coordinates are used to describe the conformational states of immune receptors, and their evolution is governed by Euler-Lagrange equations constructed from the antigen-receptor interaction. Central to our theory is the identification of a continuous symmetry: the action remains invariant under specific translations within the antigenic structure space. From this symmetry, Noether's theorem dictates a conserved quantity, I. We identify this conserved quantity as the physical embodiment of host immunity, a measurable quantity that encapsulates the system's protective capacity, encompassing both its breadth and intensity. This prediction is testable through statistically indistinguishable responses to antigen pairs related by the symmetry transformation. Furthermore, This theoretical model provides a unified framework for understanding key immunological phenomena, including vaccination, immune memory, tolerance, original antigenic sin, and T cell exhaustion. The conserved quantity I comprises a component quantifying protective breadth (with the dimension of action) and a component governing response intensity (with the dimension of energy), is thus established as a fundamental physical entity. This work transforms immune capacity from a phenomenological concept into a quantifiable entity, thereby establishing a foundational framework for predictive immunology and immunological intervention.</description>

      <title>Size control guidelines for chemically active droplets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.02542</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.02542v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Biological cells and synthetic analogues use liquid-liquid phase separation to dynamically compartmentalize their environment for various applications. In many cases, multiple droplets need to coexist, and their size needs to be controlled, which is challenging because large droplets tend to grow at the expense of smaller ones. Chemical reactions can, in principle, control droplet sizes, but there are no clear guidelines on how to robustly achieve size control. To provide guidelines, we consider a binary fluid model driven out of equilibrium by chemical reactions. We reveal two different classes of size-controlled droplets, depending on the ratio of droplet radius to the reaction-diffusion length. Moreover, we determine parameter regimes in which droplets become small. Taken together, our theory allows us to separately predict the chemical reactions necessary for maintaining droplets of a given class or size.</description>

      <title>Modulation of DNA rheology by a transcription factor that forms aging microgels</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.02864</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.02864v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Proteins and nucleic acids form non-Newtonian liquids with complex rheological properties that contribute to their function in vivo. Here we investigate the rheology of the transcription factor NANOG, a key protein in sustaining embryonic stem cell self-renewal. We discover that at high concentrations NANOG forms macroscopic aging gels through its intrinsically disordered tryptophan-rich domain. By combining molecular dynamics simulations, mass photometry and Cryo-EM, we also discover that NANOG forms self-limiting micelle-like clusters which expose their DNA-binding domains. In dense solutions of DNA, NANOG micelle-like structures stabilize intermolecular entanglements and crosslinks, forming microgel-like structures. Our findings suggest that NANOG may contribute to regulate gene expression in a unconventional way: by restricting and stabilizing genome dynamics at key transcriptional sites through the formation of an aging microgel-like structure, potentially enabling mechanical memory in the gene network.</description>

      <title>Mechanistic Modeling of Continuous Lyophilization for Biopharmaceutical Manufacturing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.06251</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.06251v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Lyophilization (aka freeze drying) is a typical process in pharmaceutical manufacturing used for improving the stability of various drug products, including its recent applications to mRNA vaccines. While extensive efforts have been dedicated to shifting the pharmaceutical industry toward continuous manufacturing, the majority of industrial-scale lyophilization is still being operated in a batch mode. This article presents the first mechanistic model for a complete continuous lyophilization process, which comprehensively incorporates and describes key transport phenomena in all three steps of lyophilization, namely freezing, primary drying, and secondary drying. The proposed model considers the state-of-the-art lyophilization technology, in which vials are suspended and move continuously through the process. The validated model can accurately predict the evolution of critical process parameters, including the product temperature, ice/water fraction, sublimation front position, and concentration of bound water, for the entire process. Several applications related to model-based process design and optimization of continuous lyophilization are also demonstrated. The final model is made available in MATLAB and Julia as an open-source software package called ContLyo, which can ultimately be leveraged for guiding the design and development of future continuous lyophilization processes.</description>

      <title>Multi-wavelength transparent microfluidics for UV-visible spectroscopy and X-ray scattering studies of photoactive systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.11441</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.11441v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Microfluidic devices are increasingly used in synchrotron-based experiments to deliver and probe liquid samples, offering advantages such as minimal sample consumption and reduced radiation damage. Despite their growing use, few devices have been specifically designed for monitoring liquids under photoexcitation, a promising approach for fast structural transitions. Here, a microfluidic device that is transparent to X-rays in one direction, and simulaneously transmits UV and visible light in the perpendicular direction is presented. The device is fabricated using lamination and UV lithography on a dry-film resist, eliminating the need for cleanroom facilities and simplifying production. Its multi-wavelength transparency was validated through UV-visible spectroscopy, where photoexcitation at different wavelengths induced reversible trans-to-cis isomerization of azobenzene and fluoro-azobenzene. X-ray transparency was validated through Small Angle X-ray Scattering (SAXS) measurements on hemoglobin and CO-ligated hemoglobin sensitive to quaternary structural changes. These resusts confirm the suitability of the device for resolving protein structures and photoinduced conformational dynamics. The design further supports, as some proof of concept results show, temperature-jump and time resolved pump-probe experiments, providing a versatile platform for studying structural evolution in liquid samples using synchrotron SAXS.</description>
