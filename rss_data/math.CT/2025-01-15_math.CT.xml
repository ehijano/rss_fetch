      <title>Enriched $\infty$-categories as marked module categories</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.07697</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.07697v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We prove that an enriched $\infty$-category is completely determined by its enriched presheaf category together with a `marking' by the representable presheaves. More precisely, for any presentably monoidal $\infty$-category $\mathcal{V}$ we construct an equivalence between the category of $\mathcal{V}$-enriched $\infty$-categories and a certain full sub-category of the category of presentable $\mathcal{V}$-module categories equipped with a functor from an $\infty$-groupoid. This effectively allows us to reduce many aspects of enriched $\infty$-category theory to the theory of presentable $\infty$-categories.
  As applications, we use Lurie's tensor product of presentable $\infty$-categories to construct a tensor product of enriched $\infty$-categories with many desirable properties -- including compatibility with colimits and appropriate monoidality of presheaf functors -- and compare it to existing tensor products in the literature. We also re-examine and provide a model-independent reformulation of the notion of univalence (or Rezk-completeness) for enriched $\infty$-categories.
  Our comparison result relies on a monadicity theorem for presentable module categories which may be of independent interest.</description>

      <title>Categorical quantum symmetries and ribbon tensor 2-categories</title>

Abstract: In a companion work on the combinatorial quantization of 4d 2-Chern-Simons theory, the author has constructed the Hopf category of quantum 2-gauge transformations $\tilde{\mathcal{C}}=\mathbb{U}_q\frak G$ acting on the discrete 2-holonomy configurations on a lattice. Guided by the 2-tangle hypothesis of Baez-Langford, we prove in this article that the 2-$\mathsf{Hilb}$-enriched 2-representation 2-category $\operatorname{2Rep}(\mathbb{U}_q\mathfrak{G};\tilde R)$ of finite semisimple $\mathbb{C}$-linear $\mathbb{U}_q\frak G$-module categories is braided, planar-pivotal, rigid and dagger, hence $\operatorname{2Rep}(\mathbb{U}_q\mathfrak{G};\tilde R)$ provides an example of a {\it ribbon tensor 2-category}. We explicitly construct the ribbon balancing functors, and show that it is compatible with the rigid dagger structures. This allows one to refine the various notions of {\it framing} in a 2-category with duals that have been previously studied in the literature. Framed 2-tangles can then be decorated by 2-representations of categorical quantum groups with a ribbon 2-functor into $\operatorname{2Rep}(\mathbb{U}_q\mathfrak{G};\tilde R)$, completely analogous to the construction of decorated ribbon graphs in the Reshetikhin-Turaev construction. We will also prove that, in the classical limit $q=(q_\mathrm{h},q_\mathrm{v})\rightarrow 1$, the 2-category $\operatorname{2Rep}(\mathbb{U}_{q=1}\mathfrak{G};\text{id}\otimes\text{\id})$ become pivotal in the sense of Douglas-Reutter.</description>

      <title>Barr-coexactness for metric compact Hausdorff spaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.07039</link>

Abstract: Compact metric spaces form an important class of metric spaces, but the category that they define lacks many important properties such as completeness and cocompleteness. In recent studies of "metric domain theory" and Stone-type dualities, the more general notion of a (separated) metric compact Hausdorff space emerged as a metric counterpart of Nachbin's compact ordered spaces. Roughly speaking, a metric compact Hausdorff space is a metric space equipped with a \emph{compatible} compact Hausdorff topology (which does not need to be the induced topology). These spaces maintain many important features of compact metric spaces, and, notably, the resulting category is much better behaved. Moreover, one can use inspiration from the theory of Nachbin's compact ordered spaces to solve problems for metric structures.
  In this paper we continue this line of research: in the category of separated metric compact Hausdorff spaces we characterise the regular monomorphisms as the embeddings and the epimorphisms as the surjective morphisms. Moreover, we show that epimorphisms out of an object $X$ can be encoded internally on $X$ by their kernel metrics, which are characterised as the continuous metrics below the metric on $X$; this gives a convenient way to represent quotient objects. Finally, as the main result, we prove that its dual category has an algebraic flavour: it is Barr-exact. While we show that it cannot be a variety of finitary algebras, it remains open whether it is an infinitary variety.</description>

      <title>Higher condensation theory</title>

Abstract: We develop a unified mathematical theory of defect condensations for topological orders in all dimensions based on higher categories, higher algebras and higher representations. A k-codimensional topological defect $A$ in an n+1D (potentially anomalous) topological order $C^{n+1}$ is condensable if it is equipped with the structure of a condensable $E_k$-algebra. Condensing such a defect $A$ amounts to a k-step process. In the first step, we condense the defect $A$ along one of its transversal directions, thus obtaining a (k-1)-codimensional defect $\Sigma A$, which is naturally equipped with the structure of a condensable $E_{k-1}$-algebra. In the second step, we condense the defect $\Sigma A$ in one of the remaining transversal directions, thus obtaining a (k-2)-codimensional defect $\Sigma^2 A$, so on and so forth. In the k-th step, we condense the 1-codimensional defect $\Sigma^{k-1}A$ along the only transversal direction, thus defining a phase transition from $C^{n+1}$ to a new n+1D topological order $D^{n+1}$. We give precise mathematical descriptions of each step in above process, including the precise mathematical characterization of the condensed phase $D^{n+1}$. When $C^{n+1}$ is anomaly-free, the same phase transition can be alternatively defined by replacing the last two steps by a single step of condensing the $E_2$-algebra $\Sigma^{k-2}A$ directly along the remaining two transversal directions. When n=2, this modified last step is precisely a usual anyon condensation in a 2+1D topological order. We derive many new mathematical results physically along the way. Some of them will be proved in a mathematical companion of this paper. We also briefly discuss questions, generalizations and applications that naturally arise from our theory, including higher Morita theory, a theory of integrals and the condensations of liquid-like gapless defects in topological orders.</description>
