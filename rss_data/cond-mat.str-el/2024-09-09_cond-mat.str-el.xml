      <title>Quantum loops in the 1T-transition metal dichalcogenides</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.03819</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.03819v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Loop arrangements and their quantum superpositions describe several interesting many-particle states. We propose that they also describe bonding in a class of transition metal dichalcogenides. We present an effective quantum loop model for monolayers with 1T structure and a d$^2$ valence electron configuration: materials of the form MX$_2$ (M = Mo, W and X=S, Se, Te) and AM$'$Y$_2$ (A = Li, Na; M$'$ = V, Nb and Y = O, S, Se). Their t$_{2g}$ orbitals exhibit strongly directional overlaps between neighbouring atoms, favouring the formation of valence bonds. A transition metal atom forms two valence bonds, each with one of its neighbours. When connected, these bonds form loops that cover the triangular lattice. We construct a minimal Rokhsar-Kivelson-like model with resonance processes that cut and reconnect loops that run in proximity. The resulting dynamics is more constrained than in traditional quantum dimer models, with a `bending' constraint that arises from orbital structure. In the resulting phase diagram, we find phases that resemble distorted phases seen in materials, viz., the 1T$'$ and trimerized phases. As a testable prediction, we propose that a single d$^1$ or d$^3$ impurity will terminate a loop and give rise to a long-ranged texture. For example, a Ti/Cr defect in LiVO$_2$ will produce one or more domain walls that propagate outward from the impurity. We discuss the possibility of a loop liquid phase that can emerge in these materials.</description>

      <title>Higher-Rank Spin Liquids and Spin Nematics from Competing Orders in Pyrochlore Magnets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.03825</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.03825v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Pyrochlore magnets have proven to provide an excellent arena for the realization of a variety of many-body phenomena such as classical and quantum order-by-disorder, as well as spin liquid phases described by emergent gauge field theories. These phenomena arise from the competition between different symmetry-breaking magnetic orders. In this work, we consider a subspace of the most general bilinear nearest-neighbor Hamiltonian on the pyrochlore lattice, parameterized by the local interaction parameter $J_{z\pm}$, where three symmetry-breaking phases converge. We demonstrate that for small values of $|J_{z\pm}|$, a conventional $\mathbf q=0$ ordered phase is selected by a thermal order-by-disorder mechanism. For $|J_{z\pm}|$ above a certain finite threshold, a novel spin-nematic phase is stabilized at low temperatures. Instead of the usual Bragg peaks, the spin-nematic phase features lines of high intensity in the spin structure factor. At intermediate temperatures above the low-temperature orders, a rank-2 U(1) classical spin liquid is realized for all $J_{z\pm} \neq 0$. We fully characterize all phases using classical Monte-Carlo simulations and a self-consistent Gaussian approximation.</description>

      <title>Weyl Fermion with various chiralities in a f-electron ferromagnetic system: PrB4</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.03958</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.03958v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Rare-earth tetraborides ($R$B$_{4}$) have attracted a lot of recent attention due to their intriguing electronic, magnetic, and topological properties. We have theoretically investigated topological properties of PrB$_{4}$, which is unique among $R$B$_{4}$ family due to its ferromagnetic ground state. We have discovered that PrB$_{4}$ is an intrinsic magnetic Weyl system possessing multiple topological band crossings with various chiral charges. Density-functional-theory band calculations combined with tight-binding band analysis reveal large Fermi-arc surface states, which are characteristic fingerprints of Weyl fermions. Anomalous Hall conductivity is estimated to be very large, ranging from 500 to 1000 ($\Omega \cdot$cm)$^{-1}$ near the Fermi level, which also demonstrates the topological Weyl character of ferromagnetic PrB$_{4}$. These findings suggest that PrB$_{4}$, being a potential candidate of magnetic Weyl system, would be a promising rare-earth topological system for applications to next-generation spintronic and photonic devices.</description>

      <title>Theory of Spin-Acoustic Resonance for Spin-3/2 Si Vacancy with $C_{3v}$ Site Symmetry in Silicon Carbide</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.03988</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.03988v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Motivated by the recent acoustically driven spin resonance studies applied to silicon vacancy centers in silicon carbide, we theoretically investigate the spin--strain interaction characterized by the defect spin-$3/2$ quadrupole components coupled to strain fields. Considering the $C_{3v}$ symmetry of the vacancy site beyond the spherical approximation, we clarify the effect of a deviation from the spherical symmetry on spin resonance transition rate, which can be changed by rotating a static magnetic field. The ratios of spin--strain coupling parameters can be evaluated from the anisotropic field-direction dependence of the transition rate using a standing or traveling surface acoustic wave. We also discuss the effect of the propagation direction of the acoustic wave tilted from the crystallographic mirror plane reflecting the $C_{3v}$ symmetry. The results presented here reveal the quadrupole properties inherent in spin-3/2 states and will promote the realization of the acoustically driven strain control of spin.</description>

      <title>Classical $\mathbb{Z}_2$ spin liquid on the generalized four-color Kitaev model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.04061</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.04061v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: While $U$(1) spin liquids have been extensively studied in both quantum and classical regimes, exact classical $\mathbb{Z}_2$ spin liquids arising from models with nearest-neighbor, bilinear spin interactions are still rare. In this Letter, we explore the four-color Kitaev model as a minimal model for stabilizing classical $\mathbb{Z}_2$ spin liquids across a broad family of tricoordinated lattices. By formulating a $\mathbb{Z}_2$ lattice gauge theory, we identify this spin liquid as being described by an emergent Gauss's law with effective charge-2 condensation, and deconfined fractionalized bond-charge excitations. We complement our findings with Monte Carlo simulations, revealing a crossover from a high-temperature paramagnet to a low-temperature liquid phase characterized by residual entropy, classical $\mathbb{Z}_2$ flux order, and diffuse spin structure factors.</description>

      <title>Correlated Ligand Electrons in the Transition-Metal Oxide SrRuO$_3$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.04062</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.04062v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In transition-metal compounds, the transition-metal d electrons play an important role in their physical properties; however, the effects of the electron correlation between the ligand p electrons have not been clear yet. In this Letter, the Ru 4d and O 2p partial density of states (PDOS) in transition-metal oxide SrRuO$_3$ involving Weyl fermions are investigated by resonant photoemission spectroscopy. The observations demonstrate that the O 2p PDOS is distorted from that predicted by first-principles calculations than the Ru 4d PDOS. The results indicate that the electron correlation in the ligand orbitals will be important to understand the electronic structure of the p-d hybridized state in strongly correlated electron systems, even with topological states.</description>

      <title>Large spontaneous Hall effect with flexible domain control in an antiferromagnetic material TaMnP</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.04064</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.04064v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Antiferromagnets without parity-time ($\mathcal{PT}$) symmetry offer novel perspectives in the field of functional magnetic materials. Among them, those with ferromagnetic-like responses are promising candidates for future applications such as antiferromagnetic (AF) memory; however, examples showing large effects are extremely limited. In this study, we show that the orthorhombic system TaMnP exhibits a large anomalous Hall conductivity (AHC) $\sim360-370$ $\Omega^{-1}$cm$^{-1}$ in spite of the small net magnetization $\sim10^{-2}$ $\mu_B$/Mn. Our neutron scattering experiment and the observation of the AH effect indicated that a magnetic structure of TaMnP was dominated by an AF component represented by $B_{3g}$ with the propagation vector $q=0$. Furthermore, we confirmed that the obtained AHC is among the largest observed in AF materials at zero fields. Additionally, our first-principles calculations revealed that the spin-orbit interaction originating in the nonmagnetic Ta-$5d$ electrons significantly contributes to enhancing Berry curvatures in the momentum space. We found that the magnetic fields along all the crystal axes triggered the AF domain switching, indicating the possibility of controlling the AF domain using the small net magnetization, which is symmetrically different.</description>

      <title>Large Anomalous Hall Conductivity Derived from an $f$-Electron Collinear Antiferromagnetic Structure</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.04071</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.04071v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Appropriate symmetry breaking generates an anomalous Hall (AH) effect, even in antiferromagnetic (AFM) materials. Itinerant magnets with $d$ electrons are typical examples that show a significant response. By contrast, the process by which a response emerges from $f$-electron AFM structures remains unclear. In this study, we show that an AFM material, Ce$_2$CuGe$_6$, yields a large AH conductivity (AHC) of $550$ $\Omega^{-1}$cm$^{-1}$, which exceeds the values previously reported in $d$-electron AFM materials. Observed features, including the scaling relation against electrical conductivity, suggest that this AH transport is induced cooperatively by both intrinsic and extrinsic mechanisms derived from the AFM structure.</description>

      <title>An Explicit Wavefunction of the Interacting Non-Hermitian Spin-1/2 1D System</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.04112</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.04112v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present an explicit Bethe-ansatz wavefunction to a 1D spin-$\frac{1}{2}$ interacting fermion system, manifesting a many-body resonance resulting from the interplay between interaction and non-Hermitian spin-orbit coupling. In the dilute limit, the wavefunction is greatly simplified and then factorized into Slater determinants and a Jastrow factor. An effective thermodynamic distribution is constructed with an effective Hamiltonian including a repulsion resulting from Pauli's exclusion principle and a distinctive zigzag potential arising from the resonance. The competition between these effects leads to a transition from a uniformly distributed configuration to a phase separation. The connection to the recent cold atom experimental efforts of realizing on-site atom-loss is discussed.</description>

      <title>Evidence for spin droplets (ferrons) formation in the heavy fermion metal CeB$_6$ with dynamic charge stripes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.04139</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.04139v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The presented studies of resistivity (R), thermal conductivity (k) and specific heat (C) at low temperature 1.8-7 K in magnetic field up to 90 kOe made it possible to detect for the first time the exponential field dependences R(H), 1/k(H), $C(H) \sim \exp(-{\mu}_{\rm eff}H/kBT)$ of the charge transport and thermal characteristics in the so-called antiferroquadrupole (AFQ) phase of the archetypal heavy-fermion CeB$_6$ hexaboride. From magnetoresistance measurements it is shown that in the AFQ state the effective magnetic moment varies in the range ${\mu}_{\rm eff}(T) = 1.4$-1.9$\mu$B, and its value is very close to ${\mu}_{\rm eff}(\tau)(T) = 2{\mu}$B, derived from the field dependence of the relaxation time $|tau(H)$ observed in the heat capacity and thermal conductivity experiments. The phenomenological model proposed here allowed us to attribute the magnetic moments to spin droplets (ferrons), that appear in the bulk AFQ phase of CeB$_6$ crystals. The relevant electron phase separation at the nanoscale, manifested by dynamic charge stripes, that leads to the formation of ferrons, was revealed from the analysis of low-temperature X-ray diffraction experiments using the maximum entropy method. We argue that the Jahn-Teller collective mode of B$_6$ clusters is responsible for the charge stripe formation, which subsequently induces transverse quasi-local vibrations of Ce ions in the form of pairs and triples. These lead to 4f-5d spin fluctuations providing spin-polarons (ferrons) in the CeB$_6$ matrix.</description>

      <title>Spin freezing induced giant exchange bias in a doped Hund's metal</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.04149</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.04149v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Exchange bias (EB) is a fundamental phenomenon in widespread information technologies. However, a comprehensive understanding of its microscopic origin remains a great challenge. One key issue in the debate is the role of frustration and disorder in the EB mechanism, which motivates the exploration of the EB effect in spin glass (SG) systems. Here,in the SG state of Cr-doped Hund's metal CsFe2As2, we discover a giant EB effect with a maximum bias field of ~ 2 Tesla, which is almost two orders of magnitude larger than that of traditional alloy SGs. Our results indicate that the giant EB effect should originate from the exchange interactions at the natural boundaries between the tunable ferromagnetic-like (FM) regions around Cr dopants and the SG matrix, via which the FM spins are strongly pinned by the frozen spins in the SG matrix. In addition, the temperature-dependent and cooling-field-dependent EB behaviors could be interpreted well by the SG model with frustrated FM/SG boundaries, which provides an intuitive and explicit understanding of the impact of glassy parameters on the EB effect. All these results suggest that the correlated metals are promising directions for exploring the EB effect in the SG state.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.04154v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Achieving the full understanding and control of the insulator-to-metal transition in Mott materials is key for the next generation of electronics devices, with applications ranging from ultrafast transistors, volatile and non-volatile memories and artificial neurons for neuromorphic computing. In this work, we will review the state-of-the-art knowledge of the Mott transition, with specific focus on materials of relevance for actual devices, such as vanadium and other transition metal oxides and chalcogenides. We will emphasize the current attempts in controlling the Mott switching dynamics via the application of external voltage and electromagnetic pulses and we will discuss how the recent advances in time- and space-resolved techniques are boosting the comprehension of the firing process. The nature of the voltage/light-induced Mott switching is inherently different from what is attainable by the slower variation of thermodynamic parameters, thus offering promising routes to achieving the reversible and ultrafast control of conductivity and magnetism in Mott nanodevices.</description>

      <title>Magnetic properties of LiCu$_3$O$_3$ -- quasi-two-dimensional antiferromagnet on depleted square lattice</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.04213</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.04213v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: LiCu$_3$O$_3$ is a novel 2D S=1/2 antiferromagnet with randomly depleted square lattice. The crystal structure contains two types of square planes with different Cu$^{2+}\rightarrow$ Li$^{+}$ substitution rates (20% and 40%). $^7$Li NMR and magnetization measurements performed on single crystals of LiCu$_3$O$_3$ revealed the occurrence of magnetic order at $T_{c1}=123$ K and the change of the magnetic state at $T_{c2}\approx30$ K. The high temperature transition can be attributed to establishment of magnetic order in planes with higher concentration of magnetic ions and the low temperature transition -- to the magnetic ordering in planes with lower concentration of magnetic ions. Broad continuous NMR spectra below $T_{c1}$ reflect a continuous distribution of values or directions of magnetic moments in LiCu$_3$O$_3$ typical for spiral, spin-modulated magnetic structures or structures with frozen disorder. Magnetization measurements revealed a spin-flop transition which indicates weak uniaxial anisotropy of the spin structure. Relatively small value of magnetic susceptibility at all orientations of applied magnetic field shows that magnetic structure is rigid, since the estimated value of saturation field derived from differential susceptibility measured at $\mu_0 H=5$ T is $\mu_0H_{sat} \approx$200 T.</description>

      <title>High harmonic spectroscopy reveals anisotropy of the Mott to Charge-Density-Wave phase transition in TiSe$_2$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.04216</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.04216v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This work explores the use of polarization-resolved high harmonic generation (HHG) spectroscopy to investigate the quantum phases and transitions in the correlated charge density wave (CDW) phase of TiSe$_2$. Unlike previous studies focusing on crystallographic changes, the research examines the reordering that occurs within the CDW phase as the material is cooled from room temperature to 14 K. By linking ultrafast field-driven dynamics to the material's potential landscape, the study demonstrates how HHG is sensitive to quantum phase transitions. The findings reveal an anisotropic component below the CDW transition temperature, providing new insights into the nature of this phase. The investigation highlights the interplay between linear and nonlinear optical responses and their departure from simple perturbative dynamics, offering a fresh perspective on correlated quantum phases in condensed matter systems.</description>

      <title>High-field magnetic phase diagrams of the $\textit{R}$Mn$_6$Sn$_6$ kagome metals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.04273</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.04273v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: $\textit{R}$Mn$_6$Sn$_6$ ($R=$~Y,~Gd$-$Lu) kagome metals are promising materials hosting flat electronic bands and Dirac points that interact with magnetism. The coupling between the two magnetic $R$ and Mn sublattices can drive complex magnetic states with potential consequences for spin and charge transport and other topological properties. Here, we use a detailed magnetic Hamiltonian to calculate and predict the magnetic phase diagrams for $\textit{R}$Mn$_6$Sn$_6$ kagome metals within the mean-field approximation. These calculations reveal a variety of collinear, non-collinear, and non-coplanar phases that arise from competition between various interlayer magnetic exchange interactions and magnetic anisotropies of the $R$ and Mn ions. We enumerate these phases and their magnetic space groups for future analysis of their impact on topological and trivial bands near the Fermi surface.</description>

      <title>Quantum Critical Behavior in Ce-Au-Al Quasicrystal Approximants</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.04279</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.04279v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Rare-earth element containing aperiodic quasicrystals and their related periodic approximant crystals can exhibit non-trivial physical properties at low temperatures. Here, we investigate the 1/1 and 2/1 approximant crystal phases of the Ce-Au-Al system by studying the ac-susceptibility and specific heat at low temperatures and in magnetic fields up to 12 T. We find that these systems display signs of quantum critical fluctuations similar to the observations in other claimed quantum critical systems, including the related Yb-Au-Al quasicrystal. In particular, the ac-susceptibility at low temperatures shows a diverging behavior $\chi \propto 1/T$ as the temperature decreases. The high-temperature Curie-Weiss fit yields an effective magnetic moment of approximately 2.54$\mu_{\mathrm{B}}$ per Ce for both approximant systems, which is reduced to $\sim$2.0$\mu_{\mathrm{B}}$ at temperatures below 10 K. The low-temperature specific heat is dominated by a Schottky anomaly originating from a splitting of the Ce$^{3+}$ ground state Kramers doublet.</description>

      <title>Magnetic quantum criticality: dynamical mean-field perspective</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.04308</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.04308v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the magnetic quantum phase-transitions in bulk correlated metals at the level of dynamical mean-field theory. To this end, we focus on the Hubbard model on a simple cubic lattice as a function of temperature and electronic density, determining the different regimes of its magnetic transition - classical, quantum critical, and quantum disordered - as well as the corresponding critical exponents. Our numerical results, together with supporting mean-field derivations, demonstrate how the presence of Kohn-anomalies on the underlying Fermi surface does not only drive the quantum critical behavior above the quantum critical point, but shapes the whole phase diagram around it. Finally, after outlining the impact of different Fermi surface geometries on quantum criticality, we discuss to what extent spatial correlations beyond dynamical mean-field might modify our findings.</description>

      <title>Many-body tunneling in a double-well potential</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.04311</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.04311v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a novel approach for evaluating Wannier functions, offering a new perspective on their role in many-body systems. Unlike traditional methods, such as the maximally localized Wannier functions approach, which focuses on minimizing the function tails, our approach emphasizes these tails. Using perturbative analytical approximations and extensive numerical simulations on an exactly solvable model, we address nonstandard Hubbard terms and demonstrate their critical influence on many-body dynamics. Specifically, we study tunneling dynamics in arbitrary double-well potentials, moving beyond the standard Hubbard model to include nonstandard terms such as density-induced tunneling and pair tunneling. Our results reveal that these terms significantly modify the dynamics predicted by the standard Hubbard model: density-induced tunneling modifies the single-particle tunneling parameter $\Omega_0$, while pair tunneling enables coherent propagation not captured by the standard model. We show that the discrepancies between the standard and nonstandard Hubbard models grow with increasing interaction strength, potentially leading to novel transport behaviors. However, at lower interaction strengths, both models converge, as nonstandard terms become negligible. These findings have important implications for phenomena like superconductivity in twisted bilayer graphene and metal-insulator transitions. Our model aligns well with numerical simulations of lowest-band parameters and is strongly supported by experimental observations of second-order atom tunneling in optical double-well potentials. This strong agreement with experimental data highlights the accuracy and potential of our approach in providing a more comprehensive framework for describing complex many-body systems than the standard Hubbard model.</description>

      <title>Pressure induced quasi-long-range $\sqrt{3} \times \sqrt{3}$ charge density wave and competing orders in the kagome metal FeGe</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.04325</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.04325v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Electronic ordering is prevalent in correlated systems, which commonly exhibit competing interactions. Here, we use x-ray diffraction to show that the charge density wave transition temperature of FeGe increases with pressure and evolves towards a $\sqrt{3}\times\sqrt{3}$ periodic lattice modulation, $\mathbf{q}$$^*$=$\left(\frac{1}{3}\ \frac{1}{3}\ \frac{1}{2}\right)$. In the pressure interval between 4$&lt;$$p$$&lt;$12 GPa both orders coexist and the spatial extent of the $\sqrt{3}\times\sqrt{3}$ order at high pressure becomes nearly long-range, $\sim$30 unit cells, while the correlation length of the 2$\times$2 phase remains shorter-ranged. The $\sqrt{3}\times\sqrt{3}$ phase is the ground state above 15 GPa, consistent with harmonic DFT calculations that predict a dimerization induced $\sqrt{3}\times\sqrt{3}$ order without phonon softening. The pressure dependence of the integrated intensities of $\mathbf{q}$$_\mathrm{CDW}=\left(\frac{1}{2}\ 0\ \frac{1}{2}\right)$ and $\mathbf{q}$$^*$ indicates a competition between the 2$\times$2 and $\sqrt{3}\times\sqrt{3}$ and demonstrates that the ground state of FeGe is characterized by a rich landscape of metastable/fragile phases. We discuss possible scenarios based on an order-disorder transformation and the formation of Friedel oscillations.</description>

      <title>Impurity-induced thermal crossover in fractional Chern insulators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.04349</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.04349v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The recent experimental observation of fractional quantum anomalous Hall (FQAH) states in rhombohedral multilayer graphene has attracted significant attention. One of the most intriguing observations is that the FQAH states at various fractional fillings give way to IQAH states as the temperature is lowered. In this work, we propose a mechanism for the appearance of FQAH states within a finite temperature range in a toy model. The model consists of a flat Chern band and impurities, and we analyze the effects of impurities on the system's behavior at finite temperatures. We believe that the crossover may arise from the competition between the energy penalty for thermal excitations and the increase in entropy. We support our theoretical argument with numerical calculations using exact diagonalization. Our results suggest that impurities may play a crucial role in the crossover from the FQAH to IQAH states in rhombohedral pentalayer graphene.</description>

      <title>Topological excitons in moir\'e MoTe$_2$/WSe$_2$ heterobilayers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.04371</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.04371v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Due to the presence of flat Chern bands, moir\'e transition metal dichalcogenide (TMD) bilayers are a platform to realize strongly correlated topological phases of fermions such as fractional Chern insulators. TMDs are also known to host long-lived excitons, which inherit the topology of the underlying Chern bands. For the particular example of MoTe$_2$/WSe$_2$ heterobilayers we perform a time-dependent Hartree-Fock calculation to identify a regime in the phase diagram where the excitons themselves form a topological flat band. This paves a way towards realizing strongly correlated states of bosons in moir\'e TMDs.</description>

      <title>Pairing tendencies in the doped Kitaev-Heisenberg model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.04389</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.04389v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the impact of hole-doping on the Kitaev-Heisenberg model on the honeycomb lattice. We investigate the pairing tendencies and correlation functions in the framework of a $t-J-K$ model using density matrix renormalization group calculations on three-leg cylinders. In the case of the pure Kitaev model, which realizes a quantum spin-liquid phase at half-filling, we find that binding of two holes only occurs at low values of the hopping, where the holes are slow. We have theoretically verified that pair formation occurs in the limit of immobile holes, where the pure Kitaev model remains exactly solvable. When we instead fix the hopping at an intermediate, more realistic, value, and vary the Heisenberg and Kitaev interaction strengths, we find pairing tendencies only in the N\'eel phase. This is in contrast to prior mean-field calculations, highlighting the importance of accounting for the kinetic energy of dopants in generalized Kitaev models. Interestingly, we also find signatures of pair-density wave formation over the studied range of model parameters, namely a periodic modulation of the charge density as well as the spin-spin and pair-pair correlations in real space. Moreover, we present a comparative study of the different correlations as a function of doping. We finally discuss the potential for experimentally observing the studied physics in quantum materials and heterostructures.</description>

      <title>Theory of Field-Angle-Resolved Magnetoacoustic Resonance in Spin-Triplet Systems for Application to Nitrogen-Vacancy Centers in Diamond</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.03971</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.03971v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Motivated by the recent studies of acoustically driven electron spin resonance applied to diamond nitrogen-vacancy (NV) centers, we investigate the interaction of an electronic spin-triplet state with periodically time-dependent oscillating strain fields. On the basis of a lowest-lying two-level system, we show the importance of two-phonon transition probabilities controlled by rotating an applied magnetic field using the Floquet theory. In particular, we demonstrate how to evaluate coupling-strength parameters in the spin--strain interaction for the $C_{3v}$ point group considering the NV spin states. The level splitting of spin states can be adjusted by changing the field directions relative to the NV axis to obtain lower phonon resonance frequencies suitable for practical applications. Focusing on a field-rotation angle for the vanishment of a longitudinal phonon-mediated transition, we show that the magnetoacoustic resonance presented here provides useful information as a new probe of unquantified spin--strain couplings possessed by NV defects.</description>

      <title>Resolving the Electronic Ground State of La3Ni2O7-{\delta} Films</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.04121</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.04121v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The recent discovery of a superconductivity signature in La3Ni2O7-{\delta} under a pressure of 14 GPa, with a superconducting transition temperature of around 80 K, has attracted considerable attention. An important aspect of investigating electronic structures is discerning the extent to which the electronic ground state of La3Ni2O7-{\delta} resembles the parent state of the cuprate superconductor, a charge transfer insulator with long-range antiferromagnetism. Through X-ray absorption spectroscopy, we have uncovered the crucial influence of oxygen ligands on the electronic ground states of the Ni ions, displaying a charge transfer nature akin to cuprate but with distinct orbital configurations. Both in-plane and out-of-plane Zhang-Rice singlets associated with Ni d_(x^2-y^2 ) and d_(z^2) orbitals are identified, together with a strong interlayer coupling through inner apical oxygen. Additionally, in La3Ni2O7-{\delta} films, we have detected a superlattice reflection (1/4, 1/4, L) at the Ni L absorption edge using resonant X-ray scattering measurements. Further examination of the resonance profile indicates that the reflection originates from the Ni d orbitals. By evaluating the reflection's azimuthal angle dependence, we have confirmed the presence of collinear antiferromagnetic spin ordering and charge-like anisotropy ordered with the same periodicity. Notably, our findings reveal a microscopic relationship between these two components in the temperature dependence of the scattering intensity of the reflection. This investigation enriches our understanding of high-temperature superconductivity in La3Ni2O7-{\delta} under high pressure.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.04211v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this account, we will give an overview of our research progress on novel quantum properties in topological quantum materials with kagome lattice. Here, there are mainly two categories of kagome materials: magnetic kagome materials and nonmagnetic ones. On one hand, magnetic kagome materials mainly focus on the 3d transition-metal-based kagome systems, including Fe$_3$Sn$_2$, Co$_3$Sn$_2$S$_2$, YMn6Sn6, FeSn, and CoSn. The interplay between magnetism and topological bands manifests vital influence on the electronic response. For example, the existence of massive Dirac or Weyl fermions near the Fermi level signicantly enhances the magnitude of Berry curvature in momentum space, leading to a large intrinsic anomalous Hall effect. In addition, the peculiar frustrated structure of kagome materials enables them to host a topologically protected skyrmion lattice or noncoplaner spin texture, yielding a topological Hall effect that arises from the realspace Berry phase. On the other hand, nonmagnetic kagome materials in the absence of longrange magnetic order include CsV3Sb5 with the coexistence of superconductivity, charge density wave state, and band topology and van der Waals semiconductor Pd$_3$P$_2$S$_8$. For these two kagome materials, the tunability of electric response in terms of high pressure or carrier doping helps to reveal the interplay between electronic correlation effects and band topology and discover the novel emergent quantum phenomena in kagome materials.</description>

      <title>Hidden chiral symmetry for kagome lattice and its analogs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.04239</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.04239v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Chiral symmetry plays an essential role in condensed matter physics. In tight-binding models, it is often attributed to bipartite lattice structures, and its typical consequence is the ``particle-hole symmetric" band structures, that is, the positive and negative eigenenergies appear in a pairwise manner. In this work, we address the chiral symmetry for non-bipartite lattice models with flat bands. Our argument relies on what we call the molecular-orbital representation, by which we can guarantee the existence of the flat band. We show that the chiral symmetry is preserved for the non-flat bands when the molecular orbitals are normalized and divided into two sets within which they are non-overlapping. The chiral operator is constructed by the same molecular orbitals as the Hamiltonian. This results in the characteristic relation between the chiral operator and the Hamiltonian, which we call the Pythagoras relation. We present the examples of such models, i.e., the kagome lattice and its one-dimensional analog, and address the characteristics originating from the chiral symmetry, such as the emergence of the topological edge modes. We also show an example where the numbers of molecular orbitals in each set are different from each other, resulting in multiple flat bands with different energies.</description>

      <title>Anomalous and Topological Hall Effects with Phase-Space Berry Curvatures: Electric, Thermal, and Thermoelectric Transport in Magnets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.04376</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.04376v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We develop a theory for the electrical and thermal transverse linear response functions such as the Hall, Nernst and thermal Hall effects in magnetic materials that harbor topological spin textures like skyrmions. In addition to the ordinary transverse response that arises from the Lorentz force due to the external magnetic field, there is an anomalous and a topological response. The intrinsic anomalous response derives from the momentum space Berry curvature arising from the spin-orbit coupling (SOC) in a system with a nonzero magnetization, while the topological response arises from real space Berry curvature related to the the topological charge density of the spin texture. To take into account all these effects on an equal footing, we develop a semiclassical theory that incorporates all phase-space Berry curvatures. We show within a controlled, semiclassical approach that all conductivities -- electrical, thermoelectric, and thermal Hall -- can be written as the sum of three contributions: ordinary, anomalous and topological, when the conduction electron SOC is weaker than the exchange coupling to the spin texture. All other contributions, including those arising from mixed real-momentum space Berry curvature, are negligible in the regime where our calculations are controlled. We derive various general relations that remain valid at low temperatures including the Weidemann-Franz relation between the electrical and thermal conductivities and the Mott relation between the thermoelectric and electrical conductivities. We also discuss how an in-plane Hall response arises in three-dimensional materials with sufficiently low symmetry. Finally, the Hall response is qualitatively different when the conduction electron SOC is stronger than the exchange coupling to the spin texture, where we find that the anomalous term dominates and the topological term vanishes.</description>

      <title>Solution of one-dimensional Kondo lattice model, ground state calculation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2309.08525v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The ground state of the Kondo chain is calculated taking into account the formation of local singlet states of electrons and moments. Singlets are entangled local states of electrons and moments arranged chaotically and varying in time. Two-particle scattering matrix of electrons forming singlets is calculated using the Bethe Ansatz. It is shown that electrons do not hybridize with local moments, and a lattice with a double cell is not formed. In the Kondo insulator a charge gap is calculated for an arbitrary value of the exchange integral. In the case of strong interaction the gap is determined by the single-particle energy of the singlet, for weak interaction - by correlations (the gap is proportional to the square of the exchange integral).</description>

      <title>Floquet engineering of many-body states by the ponderomotive potential</title>

      <description>arXiv:2312.04892v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The ponderomotive force is an effective static force that a particle feels in an oscillating field, whose static potential may be called the ponderomotive potential. We generalize this notion to periodically driven quantum many-body systems, and propose it as a convenient tool to engineer their non-equilibrium steady states beyond the single particle level. Applied to materials driven by light, the ponderomotive potential is intimately related to the equilibrium optical conductivity, which is enhanced close to resonances. We show that the ponderomotive potential from the incident light may be used to induce exciton condensates in semiconductors, to generate attractive interactions leading to superconductivity in certain electron-phonon systems, and to create additional free energy minima in systems with charge/spin/excitonic orders. These effects are presented with experimentally relevant parameters.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.08274v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Low-dimensional quantum magnets are a versatile materials platform for studying the emergent many-body physics and collective excitations that can arise even in systems with only short-range interactions. Understanding their low-temperature structure and spin Hamiltonian is key to explaining their magnetic properties, including unconventional quantum phases, phase transitions, and excited states. We study the metal-organic coordination compound (C$_5$H$_9$NH$_3$)$_2$CuBr$_4$ and its deuterated counterpart, which upon its discovery was identified as a candidate two-leg quantum ($S = 1/2$) spin ladder in the strong-leg coupling regime. By growing large single crystals and probing them with both bulk and microscopic techniques, we deduce that two previously unknown structural phase transitions take place between 136 K and 113 K. The low-temperature structure has a monoclinic unit cell giving rise to two inequivalent spin ladders. We further confirm the absence of long-range magnetic order down to 30 mK and discuss the implications of this two-ladder structure for the magnetic properties of (C$_5$H$_9$NH$_3$)$_2$CuBr$_4$.</description>

      <title>Reviving Majorana zero modes in the spin-1/2 Kitaev ladder model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.16099</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.16099v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The one-dimensional $p$-wave superconductor, characterized by boundary Majorana modes, has attracted significant interest owing to its potential application in topological quantum computation. Similarly, spin-1/2 Kitaev ladder systems with bond-dependent Ising interactions, featuring Majorana fermions coupled with $Z_2$ flux, exhibit boundary Majorana modes when in a topological phase. However, the ground state degeneracy, inherent in these systems, may result in the annihilation of Majorana modes due to the superposition of the degenerate states. To avoid this issue, here we introduce a projective measurement that selects one of the degenerate $Z_2$ sectors, enabling the revival of Majorana modes. Once the state is selected, we show that the application of the local spin operators on a bond flips the sign of the adjacent $Z_2$ flux. Repeating such operators enables the system to reach a desired $Z_2$ flux configuration. The Majorana zero modes can be manipulated and fused by tuning the flux sectors achievable through applying local spin operators. We also discuss the engineering of the Kitaev ladder and open questions for future studies.</description>

      <title>Determination of the N\'eel vector in rutile altermagnets through x-ray magnetic circular dichroism: the case of MnF$_2$</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.11833v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present a numerical simulation of the X-ray magnetic circular dichroism (XMCD) at the $L_{2,3}$ edge of Mn in altermagnetic MnF$_2$ using a combination of density functional + exact diagonlization of an atomic model. We explore how the dichroic spectra vary with the light propagation vector and the N\'eel vector. We show how XMCD in rutile structures can be employed to determine the orientation of the N\'eel vector. An exact relationship between the XMCD spectra for different orientation of the N\'eel vector valid in the absence on the valence spin-orbit coupling and core-valence multipole interaction is derived and its approximate validity demonstrated by numerical calculation for the full Hamiltonian.</description>

      <title>Entanglement in quenched extended Su-Schrieffer-Heeger model with anomalous dynamical quantum phase transitions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.15331v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Research on topological models unveils fascinating physics, especially in the realm of dynamical quantum phase transitions (DQPTs). However, the understanding of entanglement structures and properties near DQPT in models with longer-range hoppings is far from complete. In this work, we study DQPTs in the quenched extended Su-Schrieffer-Heeger (SSH) model. Anomalous DQPTs, where the number of critical momenta exceeds the winding number differences between the pre-quench and post-quench phases, are observed. We find that the entanglement exhibits local maximum (minimum) around the anomalous DQPTs, in line with the level crossings (separations) around the middle of the correlation matrix spectrum. We further categorize the phases in the equilibrium model into two classes and distinctive features in the time evolution of the entanglement involving quenches within and across the two classes are identified. The findings pave the way to a better understanding of topological models with longer-range hoppings in the out-of-equilibrium regime.</description>

      <title>Corner modes in non-Hermitian next-nearest-neighbor hopping model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.19765</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.19765v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We consider a non-Hermitian (NH) analog of a second-order topological insulator, protected by chiral symmetry, in the presence of next-nearest neighbor hopping elements to theoretically investigate the interplay beyond the first nearest neighbor hopping amplitudes and topological order away from Hermiticity. In addition to the four zero-energy corner modes present in the first nearest neighbor hopping model, we uncover that the second nearest neighbor hopping introduces another topological phase with sixteen zero-energy corner modes. Importantly, the NH effects are manifested in altering the Hermitian phase boundaries for both the models. While comparing the complex energy spectrum under open boundary conditions, and bi-orthogonalized quadrupolar winding number in real space, we resolve the apparent anomaly in the bulk boundary correspondence of the NH system as compared to the Hermitian counterpart by incorporating the effect of non-Bloch form of momentum into the mass term. The above invariant is also capable of capturing the phase boundaries between the two different topological phases where the degeneracy of the corner modes is evident, as exclusively observed for the second nearest neighbor model.</description>

      <title>Quantum-Enhanced Neural Exchange-Correlation Functionals</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.14258v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Kohn-Sham Density Functional Theory (KS-DFT) provides the exact ground state energy and electron density of a molecule, contingent on the as-yet-unknown universal exchange-correlation (XC) functional. Recent research has demonstrated that neural networks can efficiently learn to represent approximations to that functional, offering accurate generalizations to molecules not present during the training process. With the latest advancements in quantum-enhanced machine learning (ML), evidence is growing that Quantum Neural Network (QNN) models may offer advantages in ML applications. In this work, we explore the use of QNNs for representing XC functionals, enhancing and comparing them to classical ML techniques. We present QNNs based on differentiable quantum circuits (DQCs) as quantum (hybrid) models for XC in KS-DFT, implemented across various architectures. We assess their performance on 1D and 3D systems. To that end, we expand existing differentiable KS-DFT frameworks and propose strategies for efficient training of such functionals, highlighting the importance of fractional orbital occupation for accurate results. Our best QNN-based XC functional yields energy profiles of the H$_2$ and planar H$_4$ molecules that deviate by no more than 1 mHa from the reference DMRG and FCI/6-31G results, respectively. Moreover, they reach chemical precision on a system, H$_2$H$_2$, not present in the training dataset, using only a few variational parameters. This work lays the foundation for the integration of quantum models in KS-DFT, thereby opening new avenues for expressing XC functionals in a differentiable way and facilitating computations of various properties.</description>

      <title>How to accurately measure the mobility and viscosity of two-dimensional carriers?</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.07872v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recently, a hydrodynamic behavior of ultrahigh mobility viscous two-dimensional electron gas in GaAs/AlGaAs quantum well was intensively studied based on relevant negative magnetoresistance (NMR) data. The two-dimensional Gurzhi model with(without) simplification combined with extra assumptions on electron-electron collisions rate often lead to a certain agreement with experiment. We provide ab initio analysis of the NMR data[Q. Shi et al, Phys. Rev. B. 89, 201301(R) (2014)] and demonstrate exceptional agreement with the uncut Gurzhi model attracting a single fitting parameter of the effective stream width. Our approach allows one to identify the intrinsic carrier mobility higher than that deduced by conventional methods. The NMR data analysis is proposed for powerful tool for two-dimensional viscometry.</description>

      <title>Modelling the Kohn-Sham potential for molecular dissociation with orbital-independent functionals: a proof of principle</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.06038v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We model the Hartree-exchange-correlation potential of Kohn-Sham density-functional theory adopting a novel strategy inspired by the strictly-correlated-electrons limit and relying on the exact decomposition of the potential based on the exact factorization formalism. Starting with accurate density and conditional potential for a one-dimensional model of a stretched heteronuclear molecule, we provide a proof-of-principle example of an approximation that accurately reproduces the step of the exact Kohn-Sham potential without resorting to the Kohn-Sham orbitals, virtual or occupied. We also test our strategy using the approximate conditional potentials corresponding to the strictly-correlated-electron and the exact-exchange functionals. The results are encouraging in that the initial approximations are modified in the qualitatively correct way: decreasing correlation in the former and increasing it in the latter.</description>

Abstract: Trapped ions offer long coherence times and high fidelity, programmable quantum operations, making them a promising platform for quantum simulation of condensed matter systems, quantum dynamics, and problems related to high-energy physics. We review selected developments in trapped-ion qubits and architectures and discuss quantum simulation applications that utilize these emerging capabilities. This review emphasizes developments in digital (gate-based) quantum simulations that exploit trapped-ion hardware capabilities, such as flexible qubit connectivity, selective mid-circuit measurement, and classical feedback, to simulate models with long-range interactions, explore non-unitary dynamics, compress simulations of states with limited entanglement, and reduce the circuit depths required to prepare or simulate long-range entangled states.</description>
