      <title>Limit Regret in Binary Treatment Choice with Misspecified Plug-In Predictors and Decision Thresholds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.19824</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.19824v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the population limit maximum regret (MR) of plug-in prediction when the decision problem is to choose between two treatments for the members of a population with observed covariates x. In this setting, the optimal treatment for persons with covariate value x is B if the conditional probability P(y = 1|x) of a binary outcome y exceeds an x-specific known threshold and is A otherwise. This structure is common in medical decision making, as well as non-medical contexts. Plug-in prediction uses data to estimate P(y|x) and acts as if the estimate is accurate. We are concerned that the model used to estimate P(y|x) may be misspecified, with true conditional probabilities being outside the model space. In practice, plug-in prediction has been performed with a wide variety of prediction models that commonly are misspecified. Further, applications often use a conventional x-invariant threshold, whereas optimal treatment choice uses x-specific thresholds. The main contribution of this paper is to shed new light on limit MR when plug-in prediction is performed with misspecified models. We use a combination of algebraic and computational analysis to study limit MR, demonstrating how it depends on the limit estimate and on the thresholds used to choose treatments. We recommend that a planner who wants to use plug-in prediction to achieve satisfactory MR should jointly choose a predictive model, estimation method, and x-specific thresholds to accomplish this objective.</description>

      <title>Numerical Analysis of Test Optimality</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.19843</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.19843v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In nonstandard testing environments, researchers often derive ad hoc tests with correct (asymptotic) size, but their optimality properties are typically unknown a priori and difficult to assess. This paper develops a numerical framework for determining whether an ad hoc test is effectively optimal - approximately maximizing a weighted average power criterion for some weights over the alternative and attaining a power envelope generated by a single weighted average power-maximizing test. Our approach uses nested optimization algorithms to approximate the weight function that makes an ad hoc test's weighted average power as close as possible to that of a true weighted average power-maximizing test, and we show the surprising result that the rejection probabilities corresponding to the latter form an approximate power envelope for the former. We provide convergence guarantees, discuss practical implementation and apply the method to the weak instrument-robust conditional likelihood ratio test and a recently-proposed test for when a nuisance parameter may be on or near its boundary.</description>

      <title>Origins and Nature of Macroeconomic Instability in Vector Autoregressions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.20152</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.20152v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: For a general class of dynamic and stochastic structural models, we show that (i) non-linearity in economic dynamics is a necessary and sufficient condition for time-varying parameters (TVPs) in the reduced-form VARMA process followed by observables, and (ii) all parameters' time-variation is driven by the same, typically few sources of stochasticity: the structural shocks. Our results call into question the common interpretation that TVPs are due to "structural instabilities". Motivated by our theoretical analysis, we model a set of macroeconomic and financial variables as a TVP-VAR with a factor-structure in TVPs. This reveals that most instabilities are driven by a few factors, which comove strongly with measures of macroeconomic uncertainty and the contribution of finance to real economic activity, commonly emphasized as important sources of non-linearities in macroeconomics. Furthermore, our model yields improved forecasts relative to the standard TVP-VAR where TVPs evolve as independent random walks.</description>

      <title>ScoreMatchingRiesz: Auto-DML with Infinitesimal Classification</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.20523</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.20523v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study proposes Riesz representer estimation methods based on score matching. The Riesz representer is a key component in debiased machine learning for constructing $\sqrt{n}$-consistent and efficient estimators in causal inference and structural parameter estimation. To estimate the Riesz representer, direct approaches have garnered attention, such as Riesz regression and the covariate balancing propensity score. These approaches can also be interpreted as variants of direct density ratio estimation (DRE) in several applications such as average treatment effect estimation. In DRE, it is well known that flexible models can easily overfit the observed data due to the estimand and the form of the loss function. To address this issue, recent work has proposed modeling the density ratio as a product of multiple intermediate density ratios and estimating it using score-matching techniques, which are often used in the diffusion model literature. We extend score-matching-based DRE methods to Riesz representer estimation. Our proposed method not only mitigates overfitting but also provides insights for causal inference by bridging marginal effects and average policy effects through time score functions.</description>

      <title>Assumption-lean covariate adjustment under covariate adaptive randomization when $p = o (n)$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.20046</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.20046v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Adjusting for (baseline) covariates with working regression models becomes standard practice in the analysis of randomized clinical trials (RCT). When the dimension $p$ of the covariates is large relative to the sample size $n$, specifically $p = o (n)$, adjusting for covariates even in a linear working model by ordinary least squares can yield overly large bias, defeating the purpose of improving efficiency. This issue arises when no structural assumptions are imposed on the outcome model, a scenario that we refer to as the assumption-lean setting. Several new estimators have been proposed to address this issue. However, they focus mainly on simple randomization under the finite-population model, not covering covariate adaptive randomization (CAR) schemes under the superpopulation model. Due to improved covariate balance between treatment groups, CAR is more widely adopted in RCT; and the superpopulation model fits better when subjects are enrolled sequentially or when generalizing to a larger population is of interest. Thus, there is an urgent need to develop procedures in these settings, as the current regulatory guidance provides little concrete direction. In this paper, we fill this gap by demonstrating that an adjusted estimator based on second-order $U$-statistics can almost unbiasedly estimate the average treatment effect and enjoy a guaranteed efficiency gain if $p = o (n)$. In our analysis, we generalize the coupling technique commonly used in the CAR literature to $U$-statistics and also obtain several useful results for analyzing inverse sample Gram matrices by a delicate leave-$m$-out analysis, which may be of independent interest. Both synthetic and semi-synthetic experiments are conducted to demonstrate the superior finite-sample performance of our new estimator compared to popular benchmarks.</description>

      <title>The Aligned Economic Index &amp; The State Switching Model</title>

      <description>arXiv:2512.20460v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A growing empirical literature suggests that equity-premium predictability is state dependent, with much of the forecasting power concentrated around recessionary periods \parencite{Henkel2011,DanglHalling2012,Devpura2018}. I study U.S. stock return predictability across economic regimes and document strong evidence of time-varying expected returns across both expansionary and contractionary states. I contribute in two ways. First, I introduce a state-switching predictive regression in which the market state is defined in real time using the slope of the yield curve. Relative to the standard one-state predictive regression, the state-switching specification increases both in-sample and out-of-sample performance for the set of popular predictors considered by \textcite{WelchGoyal2008}, improving the out-of-sample performance of most predictors in economically meaningful ways. Second, I propose a new aggregate predictor, the Aligned Economic Index, constructed via partial least squares (PLS). Under the state-switching model, the Aligned Economic Index exhibits statistically and economically significant predictive power in sample and out of sample, and it outperforms widely used benchmark predictors and alternative predictor-combination methods.</description>

      <title>Modeling Bank Systemic Risk of Emerging Markets under Geopolitical Shocks: Empirical Evidence from BRICS Countries</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.20515</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.20515v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The growing economic influence of the BRICS nations requires risk models that capture complex, long-term dynamics. This paper introduces the Bank Risk Interlinkage with Dynamic Graph and Event Simulations (BRIDGES) framework, which analyzes systemic risk based on the level of information complexity (zero-order, first-order, and second-order). BRIDGES utilizes the Dynamic Time Warping (DTW) distance to construct a dynamic network for 551 BRICS banks based on their strategic similarity, using zero-order information such as annual balance sheet data from 2008 to 2024. It then employs first-order information, including trends in risk ratios, to detect shifts in banks' behavior. A Temporal Graph Neural Network (TGNN), as the core of BRIDGES, is deployed to learn network evolutions and detect second-order information, such as anomalous changes in the structural relationships of the bank network. To measure the impact of anomalous changes on network stability, BRIDGES performs Agent-Based Model (ABM) simulations to assess the banking system's resilience to internal financial failure and external geopolitical shocks at the individual country level and across BRICS nations. Simulation results show that the failure of the largest institutions causes more systemic damage than the failure of the financially vulnerable or dynamically anomalous ones, driven by powerful panic effects. Compared to this "too big to fail" scenario, a geopolitical shock with correlated country-wide propagation causes more destructive systemic damage, leading to a near-total systemic collapse. It suggests that the primary threats to BRICS financial stability are second-order panic and large-scale geopolitical shocks, which traditional risk analysis models might not detect.</description>

      <title>Correcting Nonresponse Bias Using Panel Data on Data Requests and Responses</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.17693</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.17693v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: When subjects who respond to requests for data, such as in surveys or post-treatment follow-up, are not representative of the population as a whole, inferences drawn from the data can be misleading. We show that if subjects' accumulated requests and responses over time are recorded and organized as panel data, requests can be used as instruments to correct for nonresponse bias even if total requests are not randomized between subjects. We demonstrate our method by estimating an 18-percentage-point gender gap in entrepreneurial career intentions using a survey of undergraduates at the University of Wisconsin-Madison with a 15% response rate and a 20-percentage-point intention gap among respondents.</description>

      <title>Staggered Adoption DiD Designs with Misclassification and Anticipation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.20415</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.20415v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper examines the identification and estimation of treatment effects in staggered adoption designs -- a common extension of the canonical Difference-in-Differences (DiD) model to multiple groups and time-periods -- in the presence of (time varying) misclassification of the treatment status as well as of anticipation. We demonstrate that standard estimators are biased with respect to commonly used causal parameters of interest under such forms of misspecification. To address this issue, we provide modified estimators that recover the Average Treatment Effect of observed and true switching units, respectively. Additionally, we suggest two moment based specification tests aimed at detecting Parallel Trends violations in pre-treatment periods as well as the timing and extent of misclassification and anticipation effects. We illustrate the proposed methods with an application to the effects of an anti-cheating policy on school mean test scores in high stakes national exams in Indonesia.</description>
