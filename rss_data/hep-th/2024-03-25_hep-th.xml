      <title>Scalar field with a time-independent classical source, not trivial after all: from vacuum decay to scattering</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.15531</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.15531v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Historically it has been believed that a time-independent classical source has no effect on the scattering of relativistic uncharged field, in contrast with single particle quantum mechanics. In this work we show that the dynamics is not trivial. We solve exactly for the scattering amplitudes and find that a key ingredient is the production of particles from the unstable vacuum, conceptually similar to the Schwinger mechanism. We compute exactly the probabilities for the vacuum to decay in $n$ particles. The time dependence of such probabilities displays interesting properties such as the quantum Zeno effect and in particular has no regime where the exponential decay law is a good approximation. We show that the trivial scattering found in the past is the byproduct of the adiabatic switching of the interaction. In fact, it is not possible to switch off the interaction (adiabatically or otherwise) at distant times and recover the exact results. Finally, this non trivial vacuum behavior is a source of particle production. We argue that such non-perturbative calculations can be phenomenologically relevant for the production processes that are suppressed at the lower orders in perturbation theory, for instance dilaton production in a medium.</description>

      <title>Exotic supergravities and the Swampland</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.15535</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.15535v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In six dimensions, there is an exotic $\mathcal{N}=(4,0)$ supermultiplet that contains only fields of spin $\leq 2$, but no graviton, and that on a circle reduces to 5D $\mathcal{N}=4$ supergravity. It has been proposed that, if suitable interactions exist, the $(4,0)$ theory might provide a consistent alternative UV completion for $\mathcal{N}=4$ 5D supergravity, realizing a supersymmetric version of asymptotic safety. In this note we argue that any Lorentz-invariant $(4,0)$ theory (interacting or not) carries an exact global symmetry when compactified on $S^1$, and is therefore incompatible with the Swampland no global symmetries conjecture. Another example of exotic supergravity, the 6D $(3,1)$ theory, does not have this problem. We study the general case and find that the only exotic spin-2 field that reduces to Einsteinian gravity and has no global symmetries when compactified on a high-dimensional torus is that of the $(3,1)$ theory. All other possibilities either yield several gravitons or have global symmetries.</description>

      <title>Runaway Gravitational Production of Dark Photons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.15536</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.15536v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We demonstrate that gravitational particle production (GPP) of a massive, Abelian, vector (Proca) field during inflation in the presence of nonminimal coupling to gravity may suffer from an instability which leads to runaway production of high-momentum modes. This is untenable unless there is some mechanism to regulate the runaway. We discuss the parameter space of the particle mass and nonminimal couplings where such a runaway occurs and possible ways to tame the runaway. We find that there is no obvious way to resolve the runaway in a UV completion or with kinetic mixing to the standard model.</description>

      <title>The Non-triviality of Dynamical Chern-Simons Gravity and the Standard Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.15657</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.15657v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Given the growing interest in gravitational-wave and cosmological parity-violating effects in dynamical Chern-Simons (dCS) gravity, it is crucial to investigate whether the scalar-gravitational Pontryagin term in dCS persists when formulated in the context of the $\text{U(1)}_{\text{B}-\text{L}}$ anomaly in the Standard Model (SM). In particular, it has been argued that dCS gravity can be reduced to Einstein gravity after ''rotating away'' the gravitational-Pontryagin coupling into the phase of the Weinberg operator $\unicode{x2013}$ analogous to the rotation of the axion zero-mode into the quark mass matrix. We find that dCS is nontrivial if the scalar field $\phi$ has significant space-time dependence from dynamics. We provide a comprehensive consideration of the dCS classical and quantum symmetries relevant for embedding a dCS sector in the SM. We find that, because of the B-L chiral gravitational anomaly, the scalar-Pontryagin term cannot be absorbed by a field redefinition. Assuming a minimal extension of the SM, we also find that a coupling of the dCS scalar with right-handed neutrinos induces both the scalar-Pontryagin coupling and an axion-like phase in the dimension-five Weinberg operator. We comment on the issue of gauging the $\text{U(1)}_{\text{B}-\text{L}}$, the observational effects with these two operators present for upcoming experiments, and the origin of dCS gravity in string theory.</description>

      <title>Anomalies and Dynamics in Strongly-Coupled Gauge Theories, New Criteria for Different Phases, and a Lesson from Supersymmetric Gauge Theories</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.15775</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.15775v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We review recent developments in our understanding of the dynamics of strongly-coupled chiral $SU(N)$ gauge theories in four dimensions, problems which are potentially important in our quest to go beyond the standard $SU(3)_{QCD} \times (SU(2) \times U(1))_{GWS}$ model of the fundamental interactions. The generalized symmetries and associated new 't Hooft anomaly-matching constraints allow us to exclude, in a wide class of chiral gauge theories, confining vacuum with full flavor symmetries supported by a set of color-singlet massless composite fermions. The color-flavor-locked dynamical Higgs phase, dynamical Abelianization or more general symmetry breaking phase, appear as plausible IR dynamics, depending on the massless matter fermions present. We revisit and discuss critically several well-known confinement criteria in the literature, for both chiral and vectorlike gauge theories, and propose tentative, new criteria for discriminating different phases. Finally, we review an idea which might sound rather surprising at first, but is indeed realized in some softly-broken supersymmetric theories, that confinement in QCD is a small deformation (in the IR end of the renormalization-group flow) of a strongly-coupled, nonlocal, nonAbelian conformal fixed point.</description>

      <title>Local operator quench induced by two-dimensional inhomogeneous and homogeneous CFT Hamiltonians</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.15851</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.15851v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We explore non-equilibrium processes in two-dimensional conformal field theories (2d CFTs) due to the growth of operators induced by inhomogeneous and homogeneous Hamiltonians by investigating the time dependence of the partition function, energy density, and entanglement entropy. The non-equilibrium processes considered in this paper are constructed out of the Lorentzian and Euclidean time evolution governed by different Hamiltonians. We explore the effect of the time ordering on entanglement dynamics so that we find that in a free boson CFT and RCFTs, this time ordering does not affect the entanglement entropy, while in the holographic CFTs, it does. Our main finding is that in the holographic CFTs, the non-unitary time evolution induced by the inhomogeneous Hamiltonian can retain the initial state information longer than in the unitary time evolution.</description>

      <title>Localized structures in three-field models: geometrically constrained configurations and the first-order framework</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.15865</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.15865v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This work deals with models described by three real scalar fields in one spatial dimension. We study the case where two of the three fields engender kinematical modifications, which respond as geometrical constrictions, that can be used to change the center and/or the tails of the kinklike configurations. An important advantage of our procedure is the construction of a method for the obtention of first-order differential equations that solve the equations of motion and give rise to stable localized structures. We illustrate the general procedure investigating several distinct examples, and suggesting some possibilities of applications of practical use, in particular, to the case of domain walls and skyrmions in magnetic material, collisions of kinks and to deal with braneworld scenarios having a warped five-dimensional anti de Sitter geometry, with a single extra dimension of infinite extent.</description>

      <title>Plane waves, harmonic analysis in de Sitter and anti de Sitter Quantum Field Theory and the spectral condition</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.15893v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We review the role of the spectral condition as a characteristic feature unifying Minkowski, de Sitter and anti de Sitter Quantum Field Theory. In this context, we highlight the role of an important class of plane waves which are either de Sitter or anti de Sitter covariant and are compatible with the relevant analyticity domains linked to the spectral condition(s). We show again how to expand the two-point functions and propagators in terms of them and some of the advantages of doing so rather than using special coordinate systems and separated variables.</description>

      <title>Dimensionally Reducing Generalized Symmetries from (3+1)-Dimensions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.15995</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.15995v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recently there has been an increasing interest in the study of generalized symmetries in dimensions higher than two. This has lead to the discovery of various manifestations of generalized symmetries, notably higher-group and non-invertible symmetries, in four dimensions. In this paper we shall examine what happens to this structure when the 4d theory is compactified to lower dimensions, specifically to 3d and 2d, where we shall be mainly interested in generalized symmetry structures whose origin can be linked to mixed flavor-gauge anomalies. We discuss several aspects of the compactification, and in particular argue that under certain conditions the discussed generalized symmetry structure may trivialize in the infrared. Nevertheless, we show that even when this happens the presence of the 4d generalized symmetry structure may still leave an imprint on the low-energy theory in terms of additional 't Hooft anomalies or by breaking part of the symmetry. We apply and illustrate this using known examples of compactifications from four dimensions, particularly, the reduction of 4d $\mathcal{N}=1$ $U(N_c)$ SQCD on a circle to 3d and on a sphere to 2d.</description>

      <title>Roles of boundary and equation-of-motion terms in cosmological correlation functions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.16022</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.16022v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We revisit the properties of total time-derivative terms as well as terms proportional to the free equation of motion (EOM) in a Schwinger-Keldysh formalism. They are relevant to the correct calculation of correlation functions of curvature perturbations in the context of inflationary Universe. We show that these two contributions to the action play different roles in the operator or the path-integral formalism, but they give the same correlation functions as each other. As a concrete example, we confirm that the Maldacena's consistency relations for the three-point correlation function in the slow-roll inflationary scenario driven by a minimally coupled canonical scalar field hold in both the operator and path-integral formalisms. We also give some comments on loop calculations.</description>

      <title>Covariant Lagrangian Cubic Interaction Vertices For Irreducible Higher Spin Fields in Minkowski Backgrounds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.16164</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.16164v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We review the application of BRST and BRST-BV approaches to construct the generic off-shell local Lorentz covariant cubic interaction vertices for irreducible massless and massive higher integer spin fields (as the candidates for massive particles in the Dark Matter problem) on $d$-dimensional Minkowski spaces. It is shown that equivalence among two Lagrangian dynamics for the same cubically interacting fields with given masses and spins obtained by means of the approach with complete BRST, $Q$, operator and of one with incomplete BRST, $Q_c$, operator in presence of consistent off-shell holonomic (traceless) constraints can be uplifted from the equivalence of the Lagrangians for free higher spin fields. We found that to get non-contradictory Lagrangians for irreducible interacting higher-spin fields within approach with $Q_c$ operator, together with off-shell algebraic constraints in addition to necessary condition of superconmmuting of $Q_c$ with appropriate holonomic constraints on the field and gauge parameter vectors, these constraints should form Abelian superalgebra both with BRST operator above and with operators of cubic vertices.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.16166v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider the two-dimensional Schwinger model of a massless charged fermion coupled to an Abelian gauge field on a fixed de Sitter background. The theory admits an exact solution, first examined by Jayewardena, and can be analyzed efficiently using Euclidean methods. We calculate fully non-perturbative, gauge-invariant correlation functions of the electric field as well as the fermion and analyze these correlators in the late-time limit. We compare these results with the perturbative picture, for example by verifying the one-loop contribution to the fermion two-point function, as predicted from the exact solution, matches the direct computation of the one-loop Feynman diagram. We demonstrate many features endemic of quantum field theory in de Sitter space, including the appearance of late-time logarithms, their resummation to de Sitter invariant expressions, and Boltzmann suppressed non-perturbative phenomena, with surprising late-time features.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.16171v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This work presents the application of the q-algebra in the glueballs spectrum. This algebra will be implemented through Jackson's derivatives in a Schr\"odinger-like equation, where such an equation comes from the gravity fluctuations around the braneworld scenario in five dimensions. In our prescription, we find the shape of the modified spectrum in the AdS/QCD scenario. The boundary conditions for the spectrum constrain the value of q.</description>

      <title>Predicting Feynman periods in $\phi^4$-theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.16217</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.16217v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present efficient data-driven approaches to predict Feynman periods in $\phi^4$-theory from properties of the underlying Feynman graphs. We find that the numbers of cuts and cycles determines the period to approximately 2% accuracy. Hepp bound and Martin invariant allow to predict the period with accuracy much better than 1%. In most cases, the period is a multi-linear function of the parameters in question. Besides classical correlation analysis, we also investigate the usefulness of machine-learning algorithms to predict the period. When sufficiently many properties of the graph are used, the period can be predicted with better than 0.05% relative accuracy.
  We use one of the constructed prediction models for weighted Monte-Carlo sampling of Feynman graphs, and compute the primitive contribution to the beta function of $\phi^4$-theory at $L\in \left \lbrace 13, 14, 15, 16 \right \rbrace $ loops. Our results confirm the previously known numerical estimates of the primitive beta function and improve their accuracy. Compared to uniform random sampling of graphs, our new algorithm reaches 35-fold higher accuracy in fixed runtime, or requires 1000-fold less runtime to reach a given accuracy.
  The data set of all periods computed for this work, combined with a previous data set, is made publicly available. Besides the physical application, it could serve as a benchmark for graph-based machine learning algorithms.</description>

      <title>Canonical Quantization of the U(1) Gauge Field in the Rindler Coordinates</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.16423</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.16423v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper describes the canonical quantization of the U(1) gauge field across all four regions in the Rindler coordinates in the Lorentz covariant gauge. In the four regions (future, past, left and right Rindler-wedges) in the Rindler coordinates, defining the gauge-fixed Lagrangian in the Lorentz covariant gauge, which is composed of the U(1) gauge field, the $B$-field and ghost fields. Since the U(1) gauge and $B$-fields are decoupled from the ghost fields by the property of the U(1) gauge theory, the U(1) gauge field and the $B$-field are examined in this study.
  Then, by solving the equations of motion obtained from the gauge-fixed Lagrangian, the solutions of each mode of the U(1) gauge field and the $B$-field can be obtained. Following this, with the Klein-Gordon inner-product defined in the Rindler coordinates, the normalization constants of each of those mode-solutions are determined.
  Subsequently, formulating the canonical commutation relations of the U(1) gauge field and its canonical conjugate momentum, the commutation relations of the coefficient of each mode-solution in each direction of the U(1) gauge field in each region of the Rindler coordinates are obtained. From these, it can be seen that those coefficients have physical meaning as creation/annihilation operators. The polarization vectors in each region of the Rindler coordinates are also given in this study.
  From these, it is shown that the Minkowski ground state can be given as the outer-product of the quantum states multiplied by the creation operators of the U(1) gauge field in the left and right Rindler-wedge states.
  Then, obtaining the density matrix of the U(1) gauge theory in the right Rindler-wedge from that, it is shown that the U(1) gauge field in the constant accelerated system feels the Unruh temperature as well.</description>

      <title>Flux Quantization on 11-dimensional Superspace</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.16456</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.16456v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Flux quantization of the C-field in 11d supergravity is arguably necessary for the (UV-)completion of the theory, in that it determines the torsion charges carried by small numbers of M-branes. However, hypotheses about C-field flux-quantization ("models of the C-field") have previously been discussed only in the bosonic sector of 11d supergravity and ignoring the supergravity equations of motion. Here we highlight a duality-symmetric formulation of on-shell 11d supergravity on superspace, observe that this naturally lends itself to completion of the theory by flux quantization, and indeed that 11d super-spacetimes are put on-shell by carrying quantizable duality-symmetric super-C-field flux; the proof of which we present in detail.</description>

      <title>Rotating metrics and new multipole moments from scattering amplitudes in arbitrary dimensions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.16574</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.16574v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We compute the vacuum metric generated by a generic rotating object in arbitrary dimensions up to third post-Minkowskian order by computing the classical contribution of scattering amplitudes describing the graviton emission by massive spin-1 particles up to two loops. The solution depends on the mass, angular momenta, and on up to two parameters related to generic quadrupole moments. In $D=4$ spacetime dimensions, we recover the vacuum Hartle-Thorne solution describing a generic spinning object to second order in the angular momentum, of which the Kerr metric is a particular case obtained for a specific mass quadrupole moment dictated by the uniqueness theorem. At the level of the effective action, the case of minimal couplings corresponds to the Kerr black hole, while any other mass quadrupole moment requires non-minimal couplings. In $D&gt;4$, the absence of black-hole uniqueness theorems implies that there are multiple spinning black hole solutions with different topology. Using scattering amplitudes, we find a generic solution depending on the mass, angular momenta, the mass quadrupole moment, and a new stress quadrupole moment which does not exist in $D=4$. As special cases, we recover the Myers-Perry and the single-angular-momentum black ring solutions, to third and first post-Minkowksian order, respectively. Interestingly, at variance with the four dimensional case, none of these solutions corresponds to the minimal coupling in the effective action. This shows that, from the point of view of scattering amplitudes, black holes are the "simplest" General Relativity vacuum solutions only in $D=4$.</description>

      <title>A classical Bousso bound for higher derivative corrections to general relativity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.16658</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.16658v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We prove the classical version of the covariant entropy bound (also known as the Bousso bound) in arbitrary diffeomorphism invariant gravitational theories. We focus on theories for which the higher derivative terms are considered as small corrections in the Lagrangian to Einstein's two-derivative theory of general relativity (GR). Even if the higher derivative corrections are treated perturbatively, we provide instances of specific configurations for which they can potentially violate the Bousso bound. To tackle this obstruction, we propose a modification in the Bousso bound that incorporates the offending contributions from the higher derivative corrections. Our proposed modifications are equivalent to replacing the Bekenstein-Hawking area term by Wald's definition (with dynamical corrections as suggested by Wall) for the black hole entropy. Hence, the modifications are physically well motivated by results from the laws of black hole mechanics in higher derivative theories.</description>

      <title>Static equilibrium of multi-black holes in expanding bubbles in five dimensions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.16723</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.16723v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate possible configurations for vacuum multi-black holes that maintain static equilibrium in expanding bubbles. Our analysis assumes a five-dimensional Weyl metric to describe the spacetime, facilitating the derivation of solutions based on the provided rod structure. We consider a spacetime having expanding bubbles caused by one or two acceleration horizons, and show that various configurations such as two bubbles, four bubbles devoid of horizons, a black saturn, a black di-ring, a bicycling black ring (orthogonal black di-ring), and a five-dimensional black hole binary can achieve equilibrium within expanding bubbles. Specifically, we demonstrate that equilibrium requires two acceleration horizons on both sides for the bicycling ring and the five-dimensional black hole binary. However, only one acceleration horizon is necessary for achieving equilibrium in the case of the black saturn and the black di-ring.</description>

      <title>On Stability Behaviors of 5D M-theory Black Objects</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.16724</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.16724v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Using $N = 2$ supergravity formalism, we investigate certain behaviors of five dimensional black objects from the compactification of M-theory on a Calabi-Yau three-fold. The manifold has been constructed as the intersection of two homogeneous polynomials of degrees $ (\omega+2,1)$ and $ (2,1) $ in a product of two weighted projective spaces given by $ \mathbb{WP}^{4}(\omega,1,1,1,1) \times\mathbb{P}^{1}$. First, we determine the allowed electric charge regions of the BPS and non BPS black holes obtained by wrapping M2-branes on appropriate two cycles in such a proposed Calabi-Yau three-fold. After that, we calculate the entropy of these solutions which takes a maximal value corresponding to $\omega=1$ defining the ordinary projective space $\mathbb{P}^{4}$. For generic values of $\omega$, we show that the non BPS states are unstable. Then, we conduct a similar study of five dimensional black strings. Concerning the allowed magnetic charge regions of the BPS and non BPS black stringy solutions derived from M5-branes on dual divisors, we calculate the tension taking a minimal value for $\mathbb{P}^{4}$. By determining the recombination factor, we show that the non-BPS black string states are stable in the allowed regions in the magnetic charge space.</description>

      <title>Nambu-Goldstone Modes in Magnetized $T^{2n}$ Extra Dimensions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.16801</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.16801v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider a $U(1)$ gauge theory on $M^4\times T^4$ with background magnetic fluxes. We show that a theory including arbitrary fluxes can always be studied in a theory involving only diagonal fluxes by appropriate coordinate transformations. It is found that the number of independent magnetic fluxes is equal to the rank of the classical value of the field strength matrix, ${\rm rank}\langle F\rangle$. The number of massless zero modes induced from extra components of higher-dimensional gauge field (Wilson-line scalar field), is also determined by ${\rm rank}\langle F\rangle$. We explicitly confirm that the quantum corrections due to the matter fermion to the squared mass of Wilson-line scalar field cancel out at one-loop level. For this purpose, we derive the fermion mass spectrum on $M^4\times T^4$ with arbitrary fluxes. By taking the flux diagonal basis, creation and annihilation operators for Kaluza-Klein quantum numbers are defined appropriately. Our results are easily generalized to the case of $M^4\times T^{2n}~(n\geq3)$.</description>

      <title>Hadamard Regularization of the Graviton Stress Tensor</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.16806</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.16806v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present the details for the covariant renormalization of the stress tensor for vacuum tensor perturbations at the level of the effective action, adopting Hadamard regularization techniques to isolate short distance divergences and gauge fixing via the Faddeev-Popov procedure. The subsequently derived renormalized stress tensor can be related to more familiar forms reliant upon an averaging prescription, such as the Isaacson or Misner-Thorne-Wheeler forms. The latter, however, are premised on a prior scale separation (beyond which the averaging is invoked) and therefore unsuited for the purposes of renormalization. This can lead to potentially unphysical conclusions when taken as a starting point for the computation of any observable that needs regularization, such as the energy density associated to a stochastic background. Any averaging prescription, if needed, should only be invoked at the end of the renormalization procedure. The latter necessarily involves the imposition of renormalization conditions via a physical measurement at some fixed scale, which we retrace for primordial gravitational waves sourced from vacuum fluctuations through direct or indirect observation.</description>

      <title>Hydrodynamic fluctuations and topological susceptibility in chiral magnetohydrodynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.16957</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.16957v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Chiral magnetohydrodynamics is devoted to understanding the late-time and long-distance behavior of a system with an Adler-Bell-Jackiw anomaly at finite temperatures. The non-conservation of the axial charge is determined by the topological density $\vec{E} \cdot \vec{B}$; in a classical hydrodynamic description this decay rate can be suppressed by tuning the background magnetic field to zero. However it is in principle possible for thermal fluctuations of $\vec{E} \cdot \vec{B}$ to result in a non-conservation of the charge even at vanishing $B$-field; this would invalidate the classical hydrodynamic effective theory. We investigate this by computing the real-time susceptibility of the topological density at one-loop level in magnetohydrodynamic fluctuations, relating its low-frequency limit to the decay rate of the axial charge. We find that the frequency-dependence of this susceptibility is sufficiently soft as to leave the axial decay rate unaffected, validating the classical hydrodynamic description. We show that the susceptibility contains non-analytic frequency-dependence which is universally determined by hydrodynamic data. We comment briefly on possible connections to the recent formulation of the ABJ anomaly in terms of non-invertible symmetry.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.08583v2 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In processes taking place at energies much higher than the weak scale, electroweak corrections can be taken into account by using electroweak evolution equations, that are analogous to the DGLAP equations in QCD. We show that weak isospin conservation in these equations imposes to modify the expressions of the splitting functions commonly used in the literature. These modifications have a profound impact on the parton distribution functions.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.15460v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We give a full classification of general affine connections on Galilei manifolds in terms of independently specifiable tensor fields. This generalises the well-known case of (torsional) Galilei connections, i.e. connections compatible with the metric structure of the Galilei manifold. Similarly to the well-known pseudo-Riemannian case, the additional freedom for connections that are not metric-compatible lies in the covariant derivatives of the two tensors defining the metric structure (the clock form and the space metric), which however are not fully independent of each other.</description>

      <title>On a B-field transform of generalized complex structures over complex tori</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.15515</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.15515v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Let $(X^n,\check{X}^n)$ be a mirror pair of an $n$-dimensional complex torus $X^n$ and its mirror partner $\check{X}^n$. Then, by SYZ transform, we can construct a holomorphic line bundle with an integrable connection from each pair of a Lagrangian section of $\check{X}^n\to \mathbb{R}^n/\mathbb{Z}^n$ and a unitary local system along it, and those holomorphic line bundles with integrable connections forms a dg-category $DG_{X^n}$. In this paper, we focus on a certain B-field transform of the generalized complex structure induced from the complex structure on $X^n$, and interpret it as the deformation $X_{\mathcal{G}}^n$ of $X^n$ by a flat gerbe $\mathcal{G}$. Moreover, we construct the deformation of $DG_{X^n}$ associated to the deformation from $X^n$ to $X_{\mathcal{G}}^n$, and also discuss the homological mirror symmetry between $X_{\mathcal{G}}^n$ and its mirror partner on the object level.</description>

      <title>Generation of narrow beams of super high-energy gamma quanta in the resonant inverse Compton-effect in the field of a strong x-ray wave</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.15519</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.15519v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The article presents a theoretical study of Oleinik resonances in the process of scattering a gamma quantum by an ultrarelativistic electron in the field of a strong electromagnetic wave. It is shown that under resonant conditions, the scattering channels of the reaction effectively split into two first-order processes according to a fine structure constant such as the external field-stimulated Compton effect. And the annihilation channel of the reaction effectively decays into direct and reverse the external field-stimulated Breit-Wheeler processes. The significant dependence of the resonant energy of final particles and resonant cross sections on the outgoing angles of the final gamma quantum, the number of absorbed and emitted photons of the wave, as well as the characteristic quantum parameters of the problem is shown. These quantum parameters are determined by the ratio of the initial particle energies to the characteristic energies of the Compton effect and the Breit-Wheeler process. An unambiguous relationship between the outgoing angles of final electrons and gamma quanta has been obtained, which qualitatively distinguishes the resonant process from the non-resonant one. The cases when the energy of the initial electrons significantly exceeds the energy of the initial gamma quanta have been studied. The conditions under which the energy of high-energy initial electrons is converted into the energy of final gamma quanta are obtained. At the same time, the resonant differential cross-section of such a process significantly (by several orders of magnitude) exceeds the corresponding non-resonant cross-section. This theoretical study predicts a number of new physical effects that may explain the high-energy fluxes of gamma quanta born near neutron stars and magnetars.</description>

      <title>Momentum shift and on-shell constructible massive amplitudes</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.15538v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We construct tree-level amplitude for massive particles using on-shell recursion relations based on two classes of momentum shifts: an all-line transverse shift that deforms momentum by its transverse polarization vector, and a massive BCFW-type shift. We illustrate that these shifts allow us to correctly calculate four-point and five-point amplitudes in massive QED, without an ambiguity associated with the contact terms that may arise from a simple ``gluing'' of lower-point on-shell amplitudes. We discuss various aspects and applicability of the two shifts, including the large-z behavior and complexity scaling. We show that there exists a ``good'' all-line transverse shift for all possible little group configurations of the external particles, which can be extended to a broader class of theories with massive particles such as massive QCD and theories with massive spin-1 particles. The massive BCFW-type shift enjoys more simplicity, but a ``good'' shift does not exist for all the spin states due to the specific choice of spin axis.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.15555v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We show that the Schr\"odinger equation can be derived assuming the Galilean covariance of a generic wave equation and the validity of the de Broglie's wave-particle duality hypothesis. We also obtain from this set of assumptions the transformation law for the wave function under a Galilean boost and prove that complex wave functions are unavoidable for a consistent description of a physical system. The extension to the relativistic domain of the above analysis is also provided. We show that Lorentz covariance and wave-particle duality are consistent with two different transformation laws for the wave function under a Lorentz boost. This leads to two different wave equations, namely, the Klein-Gordon equation and the Lorentz covariant Schr\"odinger equation.</description>

      <title>Exotic tetraquarks at the HL-LHC with JETHAD: A high-energy viewpoint</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.15639</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.15639v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We review the semi-inclusive hadroproduction of a neutral hidden-flavor tetraquark with light and heavy quark flavor at the HL-LHC, accompanied by another heavy hadron or a light-flavored jet. We make use of the novel TQHL1.0 determinations of leading-twist fragmentation functions to describe the formation mechanism of a tetraquark state within the next-to-leading order perturbative QCD. This framework builds on the basis of a spin-physics inspired model, taken as a proxy for the lowest-scale input of the constituent heavy-quark fragmentation channel. Then, all parton-to-tetraquark fragmentation functions are consistently obtained via the above-threshold DGLAP evolution in a variable-flavor number scheme. We provide predictions for a series of differential distributions calculated by the hands of the JETHAD method well-adapted to NLL/NLO+ hybrid-factorization studies, where the resummation of next-to-leading energy logarithms and beyond is included in the collinear picture. We provide corroborating evidence that high-energy observables sensitive to semi-inclusive tetraquark emissions at the HL-LHC exhibit a fair stability under radiative corrections as well as MHOU studies. Our analysis constitutes a prime contact point between QCD resummations and the exotic matter.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.15742v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose a possible quantum signature of the early Universe that could lead to observational imprints of the quantum nature of the inflationary period. Graviton production in the presence of an inflaton scalar field results in entangled states in polarization. This is because of a non-trivial effect due to the derivatives on two scalar fluctuations and it provides a fingerprint that depends on the polarization of the graviton that Alice and/or Bob measured in their patch. At horizon crossing, interactions between the gravitons and inflatons perform the required Bell experiments leading to a definitive measure. We hint how this signature could be measure in the high-order correlation function of galaxies, in particular on the halo bias and the intrinsic alignment.</description>

Abstract: In this document, we examine exact and efficient numerical approaches to the MIT Bag Model, a theoretical framework used to describe the properties of bound quarks in Hadrons. We present the exact and Boundary Value Problem (BVP) numerical approaches. Both methods are effective in calculating the eigen-functions and energy levels. Notably, the precision of the BVP approach matches up to 10 decimal places when compared to the exact approach.</description>

      <title>Change of the sign of the Hubble parameter and its stability in higher-order torsion gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.15867</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.15867v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We explore the change in the sign of the Hubble parameter in the early universe and its stability in higher-order torsion gravity. Our study explores the various scenarios involving the sub-relativistic universe, radiation universe, ultra-relativistic universe, dust universe, and stiff fluid universe. Different analytical methods, including power-law, exponential scalar factor, and hybrid scale factor methods, are employed to examine the behavior of the universe about the equation of state (EoS) parameters. This study is based on the previous ones by presenting a more comprehensive analysis of the bouncing scenarios within the higher-order torsion gravity framework. It makes significant progress in reconstructing gravitational Lagrangians, which are tailored to specific parameter values, allowing for a thorough examination of the energy conditions necessary for successful bouncing models. These derived Lagrangians provide analytical solutions for a range of bouncing models, including symmetric bounce, super-bounce, oscillatory bounce, matter bounce, and exponential bouncing settings. The presence of exotic matter is responsible for the accelerated expansion of the universe, as it exhibits substantial negative pressure. A thorough analysis of torsion-based gravity theories and the specific investigations into bouncing scenarios set it apart from previous works exploring alternative gravity theories and their cosmological consequences. These contributions lie in the comprehensive exploration of bouncing models and the detailed examination of the energy conditions in higher-order torsion gravity.</description>

Abstract: We obtain the gravitational emission from particles scattering via the Yukawa interaction, presenting both classical and approximate quantum results. We also estimate the contribution from the tensor part of the internucleon interaction. This emission is the main source of a very-high frequency component to the stochastic background in the Solar System and in neutron stars. The emission from the Sun (allowing for Debye screening) and from a typical neutron star are obtained. The gravitational wave luminosity of the Sun is $41 \pm 10$ MW.</description>

      <title>The strong coupling in the nonperturbative and near-perturbative regimes</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.16126v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We use analytic continuation to extend the gauge/gravity duality nonperturbative description of the strong force coupling into the transition, near-perturbative, regime where perturbative effects become important. By excluding the unphysical region in coupling space from the flow of singularities in the complex plane, we derive a specific relation between the scales relevant at large and short distances; this relation is uniquely fixed by requiring maximal analyticity. The unified effective coupling model gives an accurate description of the data in the nonperturbative and the near-perturbative regions.</description>

      <title>Testing disformal non-circular deformation of Kerr black holes with LISA</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.16192</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.16192v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: There is strong observational evidence that almost every large galaxy has a supermassive black hole at its center. It is of fundamental importance to know whether such black holes are described by the standard Kerr solution in General Relativity (GR) or by another black hole solution. An interesting alternative is the so-called disformal Kerr black holes which exist within the framework of degenerate higher-order scalar-tensor (DHOST) theories of gravity. The departure from the standard Kerr black hole spacetime is parametrized by a parameter $D$, called $\textit{disformal parameter}$. In the present work, we discuss the capability of LISA to detect the disformal parameter. For this purpose, we study Extreme Mass Ratio Inspirals (EMRI's) around disformal Kerr black holes within the framework of the quadrupole hybrid formalism. Even when the disformal parameter is very small, its effect on the globally accumulated phase of the gravitational waveform of an EMRI can be significant due to the large number of cycles in the LISA band made by the small compact object. We show that LISA will in principle be able to detect and measure extremely small values of the disformal parameter which in turn, can be seen as an assessment of LISA's ability to detect very small deviations from the Kerr geometry.</description>

      <title>Non-relativistic stellar structure in the Fierz--Pauli theory and generic linear massive gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.16363</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.16363v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the structure of static spherical stars composed of non-relativistic matter in linear massive gravity with or without the Fierz-Pauli (FP) tuning. Adopting a polytropic equation of state, we construct master differential equations for the stellar profile function, which is fourth order in the FP theory or sixth order in generic non-FP theories, where the difference in the differential order reflects the presence of a ghost spin-0 graviton in the latter. In both cases, even when the spin-0 ghost is present, we find exact solutions with finite radius for the polytropic indices n = 0 and 1. Analyzing the dependences of the stellar radius, mass, and Yukawa charge on the graviton masses, we observe that a discontinuous behavior arises in the massless limit of the FP theory similarly to the van Dam-Veltman-Zakharov discontinuity, while it is absent in non-FP theories. We discuss rough observational constraints on the graviton masses.</description>

      <title>Coupling elastic media to gravitational waves: an effective field theory approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.16550</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.16550v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The interaction of a gravitational wave (GW) with an elastic body is usually described in terms of a GW "force" driving the oscillations of the body's normal modes. However, this description is only possible for GW frequencies for which the response of the elastic body is dominated by a few normal modes. At higher frequencies the normal modes blend into a quasi-continuum and a field-theoretical description, as pioneered by Dyson already in 1969, becomes necessary. However, since the metric perturbation $h_{\mu\nu}$ is an intrinsically relativistic object, a consistent coupling to GWs can only be obtained within a relativistic (and, in fact generally covariant) theory of elasticity. We develop such a formalism using the methods of modern effective field theories, and we use it to provide a derivation of the interaction of elastic bodies with GWs valid also in the high-frequency regime, providing a first-principle derivation of Dyson's result (and partially correcting it). We also stress that the field-theoretical results are obtained working in the TT frame, while the description in terms of a force driving the normal modes is only valid in the proper detector frame. We show how to transform the results between the two frames. Beside an intrinsic conceptual interest, these results are relevant to the computation of the sensitivity of the recently proposed Lunar Gravitational Wave Antenna.</description>

      <title>Dynamics of Cayley Forms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.16661</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.16661v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The most natural first-order PDE's to be imposed on a Cayley 4-form in eight dimensions is the condition that it is closed. As is known, this implies integrability of the Spin(7) structure defined by the Cayley form, as well as Ricci-flatness of the associated metric. We address the question as to what the most natural second-order in derivatives set of conditions is. We start by constructing the most general diffeomorphism invariant second order in derivatives Lagrangian that is quadratic in the perturbations of the Cayley form. We find that there is a one-parameter family of such Lagrangians. We then describe a non-linear completion of the linear story. To this end, we parametrise the intrinsic torsion of a Spin(7) structure by a 3-form, and show that this 3-form is completely determined by the exterior derivative of the Cayley form. We construct an action functional, which depends on the Cayley 4-form and and auxiliary 3-form as independent variables. There is a unique functional whose Euler-Lagrange equation for the auxiliary 3-form states that it is equal to the torsion 3-form. There is, however, a more general one-parameter family of functionals that can be constructed, and we show how the linearisation of these functionals reproduces the linear story. For any member of our family of theories, the Euler-Lagrange equations are written only using the operator of exterior differentiation of forms, and do not require the knowledge of the metric-compatible Levi-Civita connection. Geometrically, there is a preferred member in the family of Lagrangians, and we propose that its Euler-Lagrange equations are the most natural second-order equations to be satisfied by Cayley forms. Our construction also leads to a natural geometric flow in the space of Cayley forms, defined as the gradient flow of our action functional.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.16710v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Assuming the extrinsic $Q$-curvature admits a decomposition into the Pfaffian, a scalar conformal submanifold invariant, and a tangential divergence, we prove that the renormalized area of an even-dimensional minimal submanifold of a Poincar\'e-Einstein manifold can be expressed as a linear combination of its Euler characteristic and the integral of a scalar conformal submanifold invariant. We derive such a decomposition of the extrinsic $Q$-curvature in dimensions two and four, thereby recovering and generalizing results of Alexakis-Mazzeo and Tyrrell, respectively. We also conjecture such a decomposition for general natural submanifold scalars whose integral over compact submanifolds is conformally invariant, and verify our conjecture in dimensions two and four. Our results also apply to the area of a compact even-dimensional minimal submanifold of an Einstein manifold.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.16721v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: There has been strong interest in the possibility that in the quantum-gravity realm momentum space might be curved, mainly focusing, especially for what concerns phenomenological implications, on the case of a de Sitter momentum space. We here take as starting point the known fact that quantum gravity coupled to matter in $2+1$ spacetime dimensions gives rise to an effective picture characterized by a momentum space with anti-de Sitter geometry, and we point out some key properties of $2+1$-dimensional anti-de Sitter momentum space. We observe that it is impossible to implement all of these properties in theories with a $3+1$-dimensional anti-de Sitter momentum space, and we then investigate, with the aim of providing guidance to the relevant phenomenology focusing on possible modified laws of conservation of momenta, the implications of giving up, in the $3+1$-dimensional case, some of the properties of the $2+1$-dimensional case.</description>

      <title>Action of the axial $U(1)$ non-invertible symmetry on the 't~Hooft line operator: A lattice gauge theory study</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.16752</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.16752v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study how the symmetry operator of the axial $U(1)$ non-invertible symmetry acts on the 't~Hooft line operator in the $U(1)$ gauge theory by employing the modified Villain-type lattice formulation. We model the axial anomaly by a compact scalar boson, the ``QED axion''. For the gauge invariance, the simple 't~Hooft line operator, which is defined by a line integral of the dual $U(1)$ gauge potential, must be ``dressed'' by the scalar and $U(1)$ gauge fields. The anomalous Ward--Takahashi identity with the dressing factor shows that, when the symmetry operator sweep out a 't~Hooft loop, the loop acquires a surface operator of the $U(1)$ field strength with a correction of a higher cup product. This result appears consistent with the phenomenon observed in the continuum theory. A similar analysis for the axion string operator shows that it is not affected by the symmetry operator.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.16816v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We solve the coupled Dyson-Schwinger equations for quark propagator and quark gluon vertex in the Nambu-Gorkov basis which is widely applied to study the color superconductivity. After considering the non-Abelian feature in the off-diagonal part of quark gluon vertex, we acquire a quark pairing gap in chiral limit above the chiral phase transition temperature $T_c$. The gap persists up to $2-3\,T_c$ and vanishes at higher temperature. Such a quark pairing characterizes the strongly coupled quark gluon plasma phase as a new phase and distinct from the phase with quasi quarks and gluons. Its new features can be disclosed in the heavy ion collision experiments.</description>

      <title>Explanation of the Generalizations of Uncertainty Principle from Coordinate and Momentum Space Periodicity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.16893</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.16893v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Generalizations of coordinate $x$-momentum $p_x$ Uncertainty Principle, with $\Delta x$ and $\Delta p_x$ dependent terms ($\Delta$ denoting standard deviation), $$\Delta x \Delta p_x\geq i\hbar (1+\alpha\Delta p_x^2 +\beta \Delta x^2)$$ have provided rich dividends as a poor person's approach towards Quantum Gravity, because these can introduce coordinate and momentum scales ($\alpha,\beta$ ) that are appealing conceptually. However, these extensions of Uncertainty Principle are purely phenomenological in nature. Apart from the inherent ambiguity in their explicit structures, the introduction of generalized commutations relations compatible with the Uncertainty Principle has serious drawbacks.
  In the present paper we reveal that these generalized Uncertainty Principles can appear in a perfectly natural way, in canonical quantum mechanics, if one assumes a periodic nature in coordinate or momentum space, as the case may be. We bring in to light quite old, (but no so well known), works by Judge and by Judge and Lewis, that explains in detail how the popularly known structure of Extended Uncertainty Principle is generated in the case of angle $\phi$ angular momentum $L_z$, $$\Delta \phi \Delta L_z \geq i\hbar (1 +\nu \Delta \phi^2)$$ purely from a consistent implementation of periodic nature of the angle variable $\phi $, without changing the $\phi, L_z$ canonical commutation relation. We directly apply this formalism to construction to formulate generalizations in $\Delta x \Delta p_x $ Uncertainty Principle. We identify $\beta$ with an observed length scale relevant in astrophysics context. We speculate about the $\alpha$ extension.</description>

      <title>Constraining the history of reheating with the NANOGrav 15-year data</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.16963v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Over the last few years, primordial black holes (PBHs) have emerged as a strong candidate for cold dark matter. A significant number of PBHs are produced when the strength of the primordial scalar power spectrum is enhanced on small scales (compared to the COBE normalized values on large scales). Such primordial spectra also inevitably lead to strong amplification of the scalar-induced, secondary gravitational waves (GWs) at higher frequencies. The recent detection of the stochastic gravitational wave background (SGWB) by the pulsar timing arrays (PTAs) has opened up the possibility of directly probing the very early universe. Different studies have shown that, when PBHs are assumed to have been formed during the epoch of radiation domination, the mechanism for the amplification of the scalar-induced GWs that is required to explain the PTA data can overproduce the PBHs over some ranges of masses. In this work, we assume a specific functional form for the primordial scalar power spectrum and examine the production of PBHs and the scalar-induced secondary GWs during the phase of reheating, which precedes the standard epoch of radiation domination. Specifically, we account for the uncertainties in the conditions for the formation of PBHs and ensure that the extent of PBHs produced remains within the observational bounds. We find that the scalar-induced SGWB generated during a phase of reheating with a steeper equation of state (than that of radiation) fit the NANOGrav 15-year data with a stronger Bayesian evidence than the astrophysical scenario involving GWs produced by merging supermassive binary black holes.</description>

      <title>Mapping Large N Slightly Broken Higher Spin (SBHS) theory correlators to Free theory correlators</title>

      <description>arXiv:2207.05101v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We develop a systematic method to constrain any n-point correlation function of spinning operators in Large N Slightly Broken Higher Spin (SBHS) theories. As an illustration of the methodology, we work out the three point functions which reproduce the previously known results. We then work out the four point functions of spinning operators. We show that the correlation functions of spinning operators in the interacting SBHS theory take a remarkably simple form and that they can be written just in terms of the free fermionic and critical bosonic theory correlators. They also interpolate nicely between the results in these two theories. When expressed in spinor-helicity variables we obtain an anyonic phase which nicely interpolates between the free fermionic and critical bosonic results which makes 3D bosonization manifest. Further, we also obtain a form for five and higher point functions as well by performing a similar analysis.</description>

      <title>Possible ambient kinematics</title>

Abstract: In a seminal paper, Bacry and L\'evy-Leblond classified kinematical algebras, a class of Lie algebras encoding the symmetries of spacetime. Homogeneous spacetimes (infinitesimally, Klein pairs) associated to these possible kinematics can be partitioned into four families -- riemannian, lorentzian, galilean and carrollian -- based on the type of invariant metric structure they admit. In this work, we classify possible ambient kinematics -- defined as extensions of kinematical algebras by a scalar ideal -- as well as their associated Klein pairs. Kinematical Klein pairs arising as quotient space along the extra scalar ideal are said to admit a lift into the corresponding ambient Klein pair. While all non-galilean Klein pairs admit a unique -- trivial and torsion-free -- higher-dimensional lift, galilean Klein pairs are constructively shown to admit lifts into two distinct families of ambient Klein pairs. The first family includes the bargmann algebra as well as its curved/torsional avatars while the second family is novel and generically allows lifts into torsional ambient spaces. We further comment on the relation between these two families and the maximally symmetric family of leibnizian Klein pairs.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2306.08031v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Equilibrium finite temperature observables of a CFT can be described by a local effective action for background fields -- a "thermal effective action." This effective action determines the asymptotic density of states of a CFT as a detailed function of dimension and spin. We discuss subleading perturbative and nonperturbative corrections to the density, comparing with free and holographic examples. We furthermore show how to use the thermal effective action on more complicated geometries at special locations called "hot spots." The hot spot idea makes a prediction for a CFT partition function on a higher-dimensional version of a genus-2 Riemann surface, in a particular high temperature limit. By decomposing the partition function into a novel higher-dimensional version of genus-2 conformal blocks (which we compute at large scaling dimension), we extract the asymptotic density of heavy-heavy-heavy OPE coefficients in a higher-dimensional CFT. We also compute asymptotics of thermal 1-point functions using the same techniques.</description>

Abstract: Quasinormal modes and frequencies are the eigenvectors and eigenvalues of a non-Hermitian differential operator. They hold crucial significance in the physics of black holes. The analysis of quasinormal modes of black holes in asymptotically Anti-de Sitter geometries plays also a key role in the study of strongly coupled quantum many-body systems via gauge/gravity duality. In contrast to normal Sturm-Liouville operators, the eigenvalues of non-Hermitian (and non-normal) operators generally exhibit instability under small perturbations. This research focuses on the stability analysis of quasinormal frequencies pertaining to asymptotically planar AdS black holes, employing pseudospectrum analysis. Specifically, we concentrate on the pseudospectra of scalar and transverse gauge fields, shedding light on their relevance within the framework of gauge/gravity duality.</description>

      <title>Twisted traces on abelian quantum Higgs and Coulomb branches</title>

      <description>arXiv:2308.15198v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study twisted traces on the quantum Higgs branches $A_{\operatorname{Higgs}}$ of $3d, \mathcal{N}=4$ gauge theories, that is, the quantum Hamiltonian reductions of Weyl algebras. In theories which are good, we define a twisted trace that arises naturally from the correlation functions of the gauge theory. We show that this trace induces an inner product and a short star product on $A_{\operatorname{Higgs}}$.
  We analyze this trace in the case of an abelian gauge group and show that it has a natural expansion in terms of the twisted traces of Verma modules, confirming a conjecture of the first author and Okazaki. This expansion has a natural interpretation in terms of 3-d mirror symmetry, and we predict that it can be interpreted as an Atiyah-Bott fixed-point formula under the quantum Hikita isomorphism.</description>

      <title>Hartle-Hawking state and its factorization in 3d gravity</title>

      <description>arXiv:2309.05126v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study 3d quantum gravity with two asymptotically anti-de Sitter regions, in particular, using its relation with coupled Alekseev-Shatashvili theories and Liouville theory. Expressions for the Hartle-Hawking state, thermal $2n$-point functions, torus wormhole correlators and Wheeler-DeWitt wavefunctions in different bases are obtained using the ZZ boundary states in Liouville theory. Exact results in 2d Jackiw-Teitelboim (JT) gravity are uplifted to 3d gravity, with two copies of Liouville theory in 3d gravity playing a similar role as Schwarzian theory in JT gravity. The connection between 3d gravity and the Liouville ZZ boundary states are manifested by viewing BTZ black holes as Maldacena-Maoz wormholes, with the two wormhole boundaries glued along the ZZ boundaries. In this work, we also study the factorization problem of the Hartle-Hawking state in 3d gravity. With the relevant defect operator that imposes the necessary topological constraint for contractibility, the trace formula in gravity is modified in computing the entanglement entropy. This trace matches with the one from von Neumann algebra considerations, further reproducing the Bekenstein-Hawking area formula from entanglement entropy. Lastly, we propose a calculation for off-shell geometrical quantities that are responsible for the ramp behavior in the late time two-point functions, which follows from the understanding of the Liouville FZZT boundary states in the context of 3d gravity, and the identification between Verlinde loop operators in Liouville theory and "baby universe" operators in 3d gravity.</description>

      <title>Celestial Eikonal Amplitudes in the Near-Horizon Region</title>

      <description>arXiv:2310.03430v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate the celestial description of an eikonal amplitude for the scattering of massless scalars mediated by soft gravitons in the near-horizon region of a large eternal Schwarzschild black hole. Our construction thus provides a celestial conformal field theory on the horizon corresponding to a non-perturbative scattering process that accounts for event horizons on asymptotically flat spacetimes. From the \emph{known} two-dimensional near-horizon scattering amplitude computed within the effective field theory framework, we first construct a four-dimensional amplitude in a flat spacetime frame around the bifurcation sphere strictly in a small angle approximation limit. While the kinematics of external particles in this frame at leading order are analogous to a Minkowski spacetime, the eikonal amplitude differs from those about flat spacetime due to the near-horizon scattering potential. We construct a celestial correlator following a Mellin transform that provides an all loop order result, with a universal leading ultraviolet (UV) soft scaling behavior of the conformally invariant cross-ratio, and an infrared (IR) pole for the scaling dimension at each loop order. We argue these properties manifest soft graviton exchanges in the near-horizon region and, consequently, the soft UV behavior of the amplitude.</description>

      <title>The Basso-Dixon Formula and Calabi-Yau Geometry</title>

      <description>arXiv:2310.08625v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We analyse the family of Calabi-Yau varieties attached to four-point fishnet integrals in two dimensions. We find that the Picard-Fuchs operators for fishnet integrals are exterior powers of the Picard-Fuchs operators for ladder integrals. This implies that the periods of the Calabi-Yau varieties for fishnet integrals can be written as determinants of periods for ladder integrals. The representation theory of the geometric monodromy group plays an important role in this context. We then show how the determinant form of the periods immediately leads to the well-known Basso-Dixon formula for four-point fishnet integrals in two dimensions. Notably, the relation to Calabi-Yau geometry implies that the volume is also expressible via a determinant formula of Basso-Dixon type. Finally, we show how the fishnet integrals can be written in terms of iterated integrals naturally attached to the Calabi-Yau varieties.</description>

      <title>FiniteFieldSolve: Exactly Solving Large Linear Systems in High-Energy Theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.01671</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.01671v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Large linear systems play an important role in high-energy theory, appearing in amplitude bootstraps and during integral reduction. This paper introduces FiniteFieldSolve, a general-purpose toolkit for exactly solving large linear systems over the rationals. The solver interfaces directly with Mathematica, is straightforward to install, and seamlessly replaces Mathematica's native solvers. In testing, FiniteFieldSolve is approximately two orders of magnitude faster than Mathematica and uses an order of magnitude less memory. The package also compares favorably against other public solvers in FiniteFieldSolve's intended use cases. As the name of the package suggests, solutions are obtained via well-known finite field methods. These methods suffer from introducing an inordinate number of modulo (or integer division) operations with respect to different primes. By automatically recompiling itself for each prime, FiniteFieldSolve converts the division operations into much faster combinations of instructions, dramatically improving performance. The technique of compiling the prime can be applied to any finite field solver, where the time savings will be solver dependent. The operation of the package is illustrated through a detailed example of an amplitude bootstrap.</description>

      <title>Spontaneous baryogenesis and generation of gravitational waves in a new model of quintessential $\alpha$-attractor</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.02730</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.02730v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the role of $\alpha$-parameter of the newly proposed model of quintessential $\alpha$-attractor inflation (arXiv: 2305.00230 [gr-qc]) to the case of quintessential spontaneous baryogenesis and generation of relic gravitational waves in presence of a rolling scalar field during kination. An \textit{effective 4-Fermi construct} technique has been employed to compute the freeze-out temperature and the baryon-to-entropy ratio, of which the obtained results conform to the experimental requirements for $0.28\leq\alpha\leq 0.30$. This range of $\alpha$ is found to originate from the functional behaviour of the end-value expression of the potential concerned. We also find a blue-tilted gravitational wave spectrum during a transition from inflation to kination. The amplitudes of the gravitational waves during radiation domination satisfy the constraint for nucleosynthesis and the characteristic strain of the ongoing gravitational wave detectors. Thus, the most important observation emerged from the present study is that, increasingly small fractional values of $\alpha$ are favourable for unification of inflation, baryogenesis, quintessence and gravitational waves within a single model. This could have an interesting connection with the fundamental origin of $\alpha$-attractor.</description>

      <title>Dynamics of Inspiraling Dark Energy</title>

      <description>arXiv:2311.07839v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate the dynamics of a multifield dark energy model, which arises from certain rapid-turning and inspiraling trajectories in field space. We find the speed of sound $c_s$ of the dark energy perturbations around the background and show that $c_s$ is monotonically decreasing with time. Furthermore, it has a positive-definite lower bound that implies a certain clustering scale. We also extend the previously known background solution for dark energy to an exact solution that includes matter. This allows us to address the implications of our model for two cosmological tensions. More precisely, we argue that the $\sigma_8$ tension can be alleviated generically, while reducing the Hubble tension requires certain constraints on the parameter space of the model. Notably, a necessary condition for alleviating the Hubble tension is that the transition from matter domination to the dark energy epoch begins earlier than in $\Lambda$CDM.</description>

      <title>Expansion of hypergeometric functions in terms of polylogarithms with nontrivial variable change</title>

      <description>arXiv:2312.06242v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Hypergeometric functions of one and many variables play an important role in various branches of modern physics and mathematics. Often we have hypergeometric functions with indices linear dependent on a small parameter with respect to which one needs to perform Laurent expansions. Moreover such expansions are desirable to be expressed in terms of well known functions which can be evaluated with arbitrary precision. To solve this problem we use the differential equation method and the reduction of corresponding differential systems to canonical basis. Specifically we will be interested in the generalized hypergeometric functions of one variable together with Appell and Lauricella functions and their expansions in terms of Goncharov polylogarithms. Particular attention will be given to the case of rational indices of considered hypergeometric functions when the reduction to canonical basis involves nontrivial variable change. The article comes with a Mathematica package Diogenes, which provides algorithmic implementation of the required steps.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2312.10629v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This chapter explains the concept of \emph{Effective String Theories}(EST), and their success in explaining the results that Yang-Mills flux tubes behave, to a high degree of accuracy, like Bosonic Strings(BST). It describes EST's of L\"uscher and Weisz, and their principal conclusions. It then discusses the Polchinski-Strominger EST's. which are valid in all dimensions. It then describes the works by Drummond, and, the author and Peter Matlock, which extended the analysis to $R^{-3}$ order and showed, that even at that order the spectrum is that of BST. The chapter analyses the issues of string momentum in higher orders. It discusses at length the powerful covariant calculus, to systematically construct EST's to arbitrary orders. The most general actions to $R^{-7}$ order are shown to be governed by just two parameters. The works of Aharony and collaborators on the spectrum of EST's, both in static and conformal gauges,to $R^{-5}$ order, and their results that even at that order the ground state energy remains the same as that of BST, but the excited spectrum gets corrected for $D\,&gt;\,3$, are explained. It discusses the simulation results for excited states. It also discusses the AdS-CFT approaches and thickness of flux tubes.Recent works by Ambjorn, Makeenko, and Sedrakyan on the path-integral approaches to this issue are also discussed and compared with the other approaches. It concludes with remarks on the significance of the results for QCD.</description>

We show that the presence of quantum fields in such a background leads to a substantial backreaction on the metric: 2D dilatonic analog of the semiclassical Einstein equations are solved self-consistently, and we demonstrate that taking into account of backreaction leads to a geometry with two horizons with coinciding temperatures.</description>

Abstract: In this work we study families of $\mathbb{Z}_2$ orbifolds of toroidal conformal field theories based on both factorizable and non-factorizable target space tori. For these classes of theories, we analyze their moduli spaces, and compute their partition functions. Building on previous work, we express the calculated partition functions in terms of suitable Siegel-Narain theta functions that allow us to determine their ensemble averages. We express the derived averaged partition functions of the studied families of conformal field theories in a manifest modular invariant finite sum of products of real analytic Eisenstein series. We speculate on a tentative holographic three-dimensional dual bulk interpretations for the considered $\mathbb{Z}_2$ orbifold classes of ensembles of conformal field theories.</description>

Abstract: We undertake a detailed study of the gaugings of two-dimensional Yang-Mills theory by its intrinsic charge conjugation 0-form and centre 1-form global symmetries, elucidating their higher algebraic and geometric structures, as well as the meaning of dual lower form symmetries. Our derivations of orbifold gauge theories make use of a combination of standard continuum path integral methods, networks of topological defects, and techniques from higher gauge theory. We provide a unified description of higher and lower form gauge fields for a $p$-form symmetry in the geometric setting of $p$-gerbes, and derive reverse orbifolds by the dual $(-1)$-form symmetries. We identify those orbifolds in which charge conjugation symmetry is spontaneously broken, and relate the breaking to mixed anomalies involving $(-1)$-form symmetries. We extend these considerations to gaugings by the non-invertible 1-form symmetries of two-dimensional Yang-Mills theory by introducing a notion of generalized $\theta$-angle.</description>

      <title>The Schwarzschild Black Hole from Perturbation Theory to all Orders</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.13216v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Applying the quantum field theoretic perturbiner approach to Einstein gravity, we compute the metric of a Schwarzschild black hole order by order in perturbation theory. Using recursion, this calculation can be carried out in de Donder gauge to all orders in Newton's constant. The result is a geometric series which is convergent outside a disk of finite radius, and it agrees within its region of convergence with the known de Donder gauge metric of a Schwarzschild black hole. It thus provides a first all-order perturbative computation in Einstein gravity with a matter source, and this series converges to the known non-perturbative expression in the expected range of convergence.</description>

      <title>Thermodynamics of charged black holes in Maxwell-dilaton-Massive gravity</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.13328v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Considering the nonminimal coupling of dilaton field to the massive graviton field in Maxwell-dilaton-Massive gravity, we obtain a class of analytical solutions of charged black holes, which are neither asymptotically flat nor (A)dS. The calculated thermodynamic quantities, such as mass, temperature and entropy, verify the valid of first law of black hole thermodynamics. Moreover, we further investigate the critical behaviors of these black holes in grand canonical ensemble and canonical ensemble, respectively, and find that there is a new and novel critical phenomenon which is never found before, called ``reversed" reentrant phase transition with a tricritical point. It implies that the system undergoes a novel ``SBH-LBH-SBH" phase transition process, and is the reverse of the ``LBH-SBH-LBH" process observed in reentrant phase transitions.</description>

      <title>A (2+1)-Dimensional Domain Wall at One-Loop</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.14062</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.14062v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider the domain wall in the (2+1)-dimensional $\phi^4$ double well model, created by extending the $\phi^4$ kink in an additional infinite direction. Classically, the tension is $m^3/3\lambda$ where $\lambda$ is the coupling and $m$ is the meson mass. At order $O(\lambda^0)$ all ultraviolet divergences can be removed by normal ordering, less trivial divergences arrive only at the next order. This allows us to easily quantize the domain wall, working at order $O(\lambda^0)$. We calculate the leading quantum correction to its tension as a two-dimensional integral over a function which is determined analytically. This integral is performed numerically, resulting in $-0.0866m^2$. We also find, at this order, the excitation spectrum.</description>

      <title>3d Modularity Revisited</title>

Abstract: The three-manifold topological invariants $\hat Z$ capture the half-index of the three-dimensional theory with ${\cal N}=2$ supersymmetry obtained by compactifying the M5 brane theory on the closed three-manifold. In 2019, surprising general relations between the $\hat Z$-invariants, quantum modular forms, and vertex algebras, have been proposed. In the meanwhile, an extensive array of examples have been studied, but several general important structural questions remain. First, for many three-manifolds it was observed that the different $\hat Z$-invariants for the same three-manifolds are quantum modular forms that span a subspace of a Weil representation for the modular group $SL_2(Z)$, corresponding to the structure of vector-valued quantum modular forms. We elucidate the meaning of this vector-valued quantum modular form structure by first proposing the analogue $\hat Z$-invariants with supersymmetric defects, and subsequently showing that the full vector-valued quantum modular form is precisely the object capturing all the $\hat Z$-invariants, with and without defects, of a given three-manifold. Second, it was expected that matching radial limits is a key feature of $\hat Z$-invariants when changing the orientation of the plumbed three-manifold, suggesting the relevance of mock modularity. We substantiate the conjecture by providing explicit proposals for such $\hat Z$-invariants for an infinite family of three-manifolds and verify their mock modularity and limits. Third, we initiate the study of the vertex algebra structure of the mock type invariants by showcasing a systematic way to construct cone vertex operator algebras associated to these invariants, which can be viewed as the partner of logarithmic vertex operator algebras in this context.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2106.04339v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We prove that the topological recursion formalism can be used to quantize any generic classical spectral curve with smooth ramification points and simply ramified away from poles. For this purpose, we build both the associated quantum curve, i.e.~the differential operator quantizing the algebraic equation defining the classical spectral curve considered, and a basis of wave functions, that is to say a basis of solutions of the corresponding differential equation. We further build a Lax pair representing the resulting quantum curve and thus present it as a point in an associated space of meromorphic connections on the Riemann sphere, a first step towards isomonodromic deformations. We finally propose two examples: the derivation of a 2-parameter family of formal trans-series solutions to Painlev\'e 2 equation and the quantization of a degree three spectral curve with pole only at infinity.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2203.08168v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: It has long been known that weakly nonlinear field theories can have a late-time stationary state that is not the thermal state, but a wave turbulent state with a far-from-equilibrium cascade of energy. We go beyond the existence of the wave turbulent state, studying fluctuations about the wave turbulent state. Specifically, we take a classical field theory with an arbitrary quartic interaction and add dissipation and Gaussian-random forcing. Employing the path integral relation between stochastic classical field theories and quantum field theories, we give a prescription, in terms of Feynman diagrams, for computing correlation functions in this system. We explicitly compute the two-point and four-point functions of the field to next-to-leading order in the coupling. Through an appropriate choice of forcing and dissipation, these correspond to correlation functions in the wave turbulent state. In particular, we derive the kinetic equation to next-to-leading order.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2207.08828v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A spontaneous symmetry-breaking order is conventionally described by a tensor-product wave-function of some few-body clusters. We discuss a type of symmetry-breaking orders, dubbed entanglement-enabled symmetry-breaking orders, which cannot be realized by any tensor-product state. Given a symmetry breaking pattern, we propose a criterion to diagnose if the symmetry-breaking order is entanglement-enabled, by examining the compatibility between the symmetries and the tensor-product description. For concreteness, we present an infinite family of exactly solvable gapped models on one-dimensional lattices with nearest-neighbor interactions, whose ground states exhibit entanglement-enabled symmetry-breaking orders from a discrete symmetry breaking. In addition, these ground states have gapless edge modes protected by the unbroken symmetries. We also propose a construction to realize entanglement-enabled symmetry-breaking orders with spontaneously broken continuous symmetries. Under the unbroken symmetries, some of our examples can be viewed as symmetry-protected topological states that are beyond the conventional classifications.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2212.02555v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We derive a scheme by which to solve the Liouville equation perturbatively in the nonlinearity, which we apply to weakly nonlinear classical field theories. Our solution is a variant of the Prigogine diagrammatic method, and is based on an analogy between the Liouville equation in infinite volume and scattering in quantum mechanics, described by the Lippmann-Schwinger equation. The motivation for our work is wave turbulence: a broad class of nonlinear classical field theories are believed to have a stationary turbulent state -- a far-from-equilibrium state, even at weak coupling. Our method provides an efficient way to derive properties of the weak wave turbulent state. A central object in these studies, which is a reduction of the Liouville equation, is the kinetic equation, which governs the occupation numbers of the modes. All properties of wave turbulence to date are based on the kinetic equation found at leading order in the weak nonlinearity. We explicitly obtain the kinetic equation to next-to-leading order.</description>

Abstract: We review the applications of twisted spectral triples to the Standard Model. The initial motivation was to generate a scalar field, required to stabilise the electroweak vacuum and fit the Higgs mass, while respecting the first-order condition. Ultimately, it turns out that the truest interest of the twist lies in a new -- and unexpected -- field of 1-forms, which is related to the transition from Euclidean to Lorentzian signature.</description>

      <title>Derivation of all structure constants for boundary Liouville CFT</title>

      <description>arXiv:2305.18266v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We prove that the probabilistic definition of the most general boundary three-point and bulk-boundary structure constants in Liouville conformal field theory (LCFT) agree respectively with the formula proposed by Ponsot-Techsner (2002) and by Hosomichi (2001). These formulas also respectively describe the fusion kernel and modular kernel of the Virasoro conformal blocks, which are important functions in various contexts of mathematical physics. As an intermediate step, we obtain the formula for the boundary reflection coefficient of LCFT proposed by Fateev-Zamolodchikov-Zamolodchikov (2000). Our proof relies on the boundary Belavin-Polyakov-Zamolodchikov differential equation recently proved by the first named author, and inputs from the coupling theory of Liouville quantum gravity (LQG) and Schramm Loewner evolution. Our results supply all the structure constants needed to perform the conformal bootstrap for boundary LCFT. They also yield exact descriptions for the joint law of the area and boundary lengths of basic LQG surfaces, including quantum triangles and two-pointed quantum disks.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2306.03386v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We studied the cosmological dynamics of a dilatonic ghost condensate field as a source of dark energy, which is non-minimally coupled to gravity through torsion. We performed a detailed phase-space analysis by finding all the critical points and their stability conditions. Also, we compared our results with the latest $H(z)$ and Supernovae Ia observational data. In particular, we found the conditions for the existence of scaling regimes during the dark matter era. Furthermore, we obtained the conditions for a successful exit from the scaling regime, such that, at late times, the universe tends towards an attractor point describing the dark energy-dominated era. These intriguing features can allow us to alleviate the energy scale problem of dark energy since, during a scaling regime, the field energy density is not necessarily negligible at early times.</description>

Abstract: Over the past two decades, the enigma of the deconfined quantum critical point (DQCP) has attracted broad attention across the condensed matter, quantum field theory, and high-energy physics communities, as it is expected to offer a new paradigm in theory, experiment, and numerical simulations that goes beyond the Landau-Ginzburg-Wilson framework of symmetry breaking and phase transitions. However, the nature of DQCP has been controversial. For instance, in the square-lattice spin-1/2 $J$-$Q$ model, believed to realize the DQCP between N\'eel and valence bond solid states, conflicting results, such as first-order versus continuous transition, and critical exponents incompatible with conformal bootstrap bounds, have been reported. The enigma of DQCP is exemplified in its anomalous logarithmic subleading contribution in its entanglement entropy (EE), which was discussed in recent studies. In the current work, we demonstrate that similar anomalous logarithmic behavior persists in a class of models analogous to the DQCP. We systematically study the quantum EE of square-lattice SU($N$) DQCP spin models. Based on large-scale quantum Monte Carlo computation of the EE, we show that for a series of $N$ smaller than a critical value, the anomalous logarithmic behavior always exists in the EE, which implies that the previously determined DQCPs in these models do not belong to conformal fixed points. In contrast, when $N\ge N_c$ with a finite $N_c$ that we evaluate to lie between $7$ and $8$, the DQCPs are consistent with conformal fixed points that can be understood within the Abelian Higgs field theory with $N$ complex components.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2307.15547v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recently, the pulsar timing array (PTA) collaborations have reported the evidence for a stochastic gravitational wave background (SGWB) at nano-Hertz band. The spectrum of inflationary gravitational wave (IGW) is unknown, which might exhibit different power law at different frequency-bands, thus if the PTA signal is primordial, it will be significant to explore the underlying implications of current PTA and CMB data on IGW. In this paper, we perform a joint Markov Chain Monte Carlo analysis for a broken power-law spectrum of IGW with the NANOGrav 15-year and BICEP/Keck 2018 data. It is found that though the bestfit spectral tilt of IGW at PTA band is $n^\text{PTA}_\text{T} =2.42^{+0.32}_{-0.91}$, at CMB band the bestfit is $n^\text{CMB}_\text{T} =0.55^{+0.37}_{-0.10}$ while a detectable amplitude of $r$ with $n^\text{CMB}_\text{T} \simeq 0$ is still compatible. The implication of our results for inflation is also discussed.</description>

      <title>Alleviating both $H_0$ and $\sigma_8$ tensions in Tsallis cosmology</title>

      <description>arXiv:2308.01200v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present how Tsallis cosmology can alleviate both $H_0$ and $\sigma_8$ tensions simultaneously. Such a modified cosmological scenario is obtained by the application of the gravity-thermodynamics conjecture, but using the non-additive Tsallis entropy, instead of the standard Bekenstein-Hawking one. Hence, one obtains modified Friedmann equations, with extra terms that depend on the new Tsallis exponent $\delta$ that quantifies the departure from standard entropy. We show that for particular $\delta$ choices we can obtain a phantom effective dark energy, which is known to be one of the sufficient mechanisms that can alleviate $H_0$ tension. Additionally, for the same parameter choice we obtain an increased friction term and an effective Newton's constant smaller than the usual one, and thus the $\sigma_8$ tension is also solved. These features act as a significant advantage of Tsallis modified cosmology.</description>

Abstract: It is well known that the Einstein-Hilbert action in two dimensions is topological and yields an identically vanishing Einstein tensor. Consequently one is faced with difficulties when formulating a non-trivial gravity model. We present a new, intrinsically two-dimensional, approach to this problem based on the Einstein action. This yields a well defined variational approach which results in new field equations that break diffeomorphism invariance. Our proposed approach does not require the introduction of additional scalar fields, nor the use of conformal transformations. However, we can show how including conformal counter terms leads to equivalent results. In doing so, we can provide an explanation for why previous approaches worked. Solutions to the field equations are briefly discussed.</description>

Abstract: According to the preceding studies, the lattice SU(2) gauge-scalar model with a single scalar field in the fundamental representation of the gauge group has a single confinement-Higgs phase where confinement and Higgs regions are subregions of an analytically continued single phase and there are no thermodynamic phase transitions, which is a well-known consequence of the Osterwalder-Seiler-Fradkin-Shenker theorem. In this paper, we show that we can define new types of gauge-invariant operators by combining the original fundamental scalar field and the so-called color-direction field which is obtained by change of field variables based on the gauge-covariant decomposition of the gauge field due to Cho-Duan-Ge-Shabanov and Faddeev-Niemi. By performing the numerical simulations on the lattice without any gauge fixing, we reproduce the conventional thermodynamic transition line in the weak gauge coupling, and moreover we find a new transition line detected by the new gauge-invariant operators which separates the confinement-Higgs phase into two parts, confinement phase and the Higgs phase, in the strong gauge coupling. All results are obtained in the gauge-independent way, since no gauge fixing has been imposed in the numerical simulations. Moreover, we discuss a physical interpretation for the new transition from the viewpoint of the realization of a global symmetry.</description>

      <title>Entanglement in Cosmology</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.17208</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.17208v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We compute the evolution of the entanglement entropy for a massless field within a spherical region throughout the inflationary period and the subsequent era of radiation domination, starting from the Bunch-Davies vacuum. In order to focus on the entanglement of modes that are directly accessible to observations, we impose an ultraviolet cutoff set by the wavelength of the last mode that exited the horizon at the end of inflation. The transition of each mode towards a squeezed state upon horizon exit during inflation and the additional squeezing when radiation domination sets in enhance the entanglement entropy. Shortly after the transition to the radiation-dominated era, a volume term develops and becomes the leading contribution to the entropy at late times, as is common for systems lying in squeezed states. We estimate the magnitude of the entropy and discuss its interpretation in the light of the quantum to classical transition for modes exiting the horizon during inflation. Our results raise the possibility that the quantum nature of weakly interacting fields, such as gravitational waves resulting from tensor modes during inflation, may be detectable in today's universe. On the other hand, an observer with no knowledge of the degrees of freedom beyond the horizon would interpret the entropy as thermal. From this point of view, the reheating after inflation would be a result of quantum entanglement.</description>

      <title>Graded pseudo-traces for strongly interlocked modules for a vertex operator algebra and applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.17257</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.17257v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We define the notion of strongly interlocked for indecomposable generalized modules for a vertex operator algebra, and show that the notion of graded pseudo-trace is well defined for modules which satisfy this property. We prove that the graded pseudo-trace is a symmetric linear operator that satisfies the logarithmic derivative property. As an application, we prove that all the indecomposable reducible generalized modules for the rank one Heisenberg (one free boson) vertex operator algebras are strongly interlocked, independent of the choice of conformal vector and thus have well-defined graded pseudo-traces. We also completely characterize which indecomposable reducible generalized modules for the universal Virasoro vertex operator algebras induced from the level zero Zhu algebra are strongly interlocked. In particular, we prove that the universal Virasoro vertex operator algebra with central charge c has modules induced from the level zero Zhu algebra with conformal weight h that are strongly interlocked if and only if either (c,h) is outside the extended Kac table, or the central charge is either c = 1 or 25, the conformal weight satisfies a certain property, and the level zero Zhu algebra module being induced is determined by a Jordan block of size less than a certain specified parameter. We give several examples of graded pseudo-traces for Heisenberg and Virasoro strongly interlocked modules.</description>

      <title>Conformal Transformations and Cosmological Perturbations in New General Relativity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.16021</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.16021v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study conformal transformations in the most general parity-preserving models of the New General Relativity type. Then we apply them to analysis of cosmological perturbations in the (simplest) spatially flat cosmologies. Strong coupling issues around Minkowski spacetime are seen for many special cases of these models. At the same time, the behaviour of the most general three-parameter case seems to be very robust, presumably always with only the eight first-class constraints coming from diffeomorphisms. Also the case of the so-called 1-parameter New GR doesn't show any discontinuity between Minkowski and the cosmology, though without showing any deviations from GR which would be observable at this level either.</description>

      <title>Frame transformation and stable-causal hydrodynamic theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.16407</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.16407v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this work, a connection has been indicated between the different existing hydrodynamic formalisms, which in order to be causal and stable, (i) either requires to promote the `non-fluid' variables as the new degrees of freedom apart from the velocity and temperature, or (ii) needs to be in a general hydrodynamic frame other than the ones given by Landau and Eckart. We have rewritten the BDNK stress tensor (originally in the general frame) into the Landau frame by redefining the fluid variables such as velocity ($u^{\mu}$) and temperature ($T$) via a hydrodynamic frame transformation. This `fluid frame' transformation includes shift variables $\delta u^{\mu}$ and $\delta T$, which are small enough to be treated linearly but encompass all orders of gradient corrections. The redefinition indicates that though the BDNK formalism has a finite number of derivatives, in the Landau frame, it will either have an infinite number of derivatives or one has to resum them by introducing new `non-fluid' variables much like the MIS theory. The infinite derivative series are summed in two different ways that lead to two different methods of `integrating in' new `non-fluid' variables, showing the non-uniqueness of the process of `integrating in' new variables. Finally, the dispersion relations and the corresponding spectra of these different systems of MIS type equations have been analyzed to check that the systems of equations presented here are indeed equivalent to the BDNK formalism, at least in the hydrodynamic regime.</description>

      <title>Analyzing the transport coefficients and observables of a rotating QGP medium in kinetic theory framework with a novel approach to the collision integral</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.01240</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.01240v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In the present work, we have studied how the rotation of the QGP medium affects the transport coefficients and observables in heavy ion collisions. For the noncentral collisions, although most of the angular momentum gets carried away by the spectators, there still remains a finite angular momentum with a finite range of angular velocity, which thus incites rotation in the produced matter. As a result, various properties of the QGP medium are likely to be modulated by the rotation. We have calculated the transport coefficients and observables, such as electrical conductivity, thermal conductivity, Knudsen number, elliptic flow, specific heat at constant pressure, specific heat at constant volume, trace anomaly, thermal diffusion constant and isothermal compressibility using the kinetic theory to see the effect of rotation on them. In particular, we have used the novel relaxation time approximation for the collision integral in the relativistic Boltzmann transport equation to derive the transport coefficients and compared them with their values in the relaxation time approximation within the kinetic theory approach in conjunction with the finite angular velocity. We have found that the angular velocity plays an important role and enhances the flow of charge and heat in the medium. Further, as compared to the relaxation time approximation, the electrical and thermal conductivities have smaller values in the novel relaxation time approximation and these differences between the conductivities in the said approximations are more pronounced at high temperature than at low temperature. Furthermore, all the aforesaid observables are found to be sensitive to the rotation of the QGP medium.</description>

      <title>Solutions of tetrahedron equation from quantum cluster algebra associated with symmetric butterfly quiver</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.08814</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.08814v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We construct a new solution to the tetrahedron equation by further pursuing the quantum cluster algebra approach in our previous works. The key ingredients include a symmetric butterfly quiver attached to the wiring diagrams for the longest element of type $A$ Weyl groups and the implementation of quantum $Y$-variables through the $q$-Weyl algebra. The solution consists of four products of quantum dilogarithms, incorporating a total of seven parameters. By exploring both the coordinate and momentum representations, along with their modular double counterparts, our solution encompasses various known three-dimensional (3D) $R$-matrices. These include those obtained by Kapranov-Voevodsky ('94) utilizing the quantized coordinate ring, Bazhanov-Mangazeev-Sergeev ('10) from a quantum geometry perspective, Kuniba-Matsuike-Yoneyama ('23) linked with the quantized six-vertex model, and Inoue-Kuniba-Terashima ('23) associated with the Fock-Goncharov quiver. The 3D $R$-matrix presented in this paper offers a unified perspective on these existing solutions, coalescing them within the framework of quantum cluster algebra.</description>

      <title>Solving lattice gauge theories using the quantum Krylov algorithm and qubitization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.08859</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.08859v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Computing vacuum states of lattice gauge theories (LGTs) containing fermionic degrees of freedom can present significant challenges for classical computation using Monte-Carlo methods. Quantum algorithms may offer a pathway towards more scalable computation of groundstate properties of LGTs. However, a comprehensive understanding of the quantum computational resources required for such a problem is thus far lacking. In this work, we investigate using the quantum subspace expansion (QSE) algorithm to compute the groundstate of the Schwinger model, an archetypal LGT describing quantum electrodynamics in one spatial dimension. We perform numerical simulations, including the effect of measurement noise, to extrapolate the resources required for the QSE algorithm to achieve a desired accuracy for a range of system sizes. Using this, we present a full analysis of the resources required to compute LGT vacuum states using a quantum algorithm using qubitization within a fault tolerant framework. We develop of a novel method for performing qubitization of a LGT Hamiltonian based on a 'linear combination of unitaries' (LCU) approach. The cost of the corresponding block encoding operation scales as $\tilde{\mathcal{O}}(N)$ with system size $N$. Including the corresponding prefactors, our method reduces the gate cost by multiple orders of magnitude when compared to previous LCU methods for the QSE algorithm, which scales as $\tilde{\mathcal{O}}(N^2)$ when applied to the Schwinger model. While the qubit and single circuit T-gate cost resulting from our resource analysis is appealing to early fault-tolerant implementation, we find that the number of shots required to avoid numerical instability within the QSE procedure must be significantly reduced in order to improve the feasibility of the methodology we consider and discuss how this might be achieved.</description>
