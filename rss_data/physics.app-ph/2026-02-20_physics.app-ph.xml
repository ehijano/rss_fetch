      <title>g4chargeit: Geant4-based kinetic Monte Carlo simulations of charging in dielectric materials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.17332</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.17332v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present g4chargeit, a kinetic Monte Carlo framework built on Geant4 for self-consistent simulation of time-dependent electrostatic charging in dielectric materials. The model explicitly incorporates stochastic particle transport and scattering processes using validated Geant4 cross-sections, while self-consistently evolving the electric potential and field. As a representative application, we simulate the charging of regolith grains under average dayside conditions on the Moon. The surface of the Moon, in addition to other airless planetary bodies, are regularly exposed to solar ultraviolet photons and solar-wind plasma, creating a radiation environment in which electrostatic interactions among regolith grains become significant. Until now, simulations of regolith charging have often relied on analytical approximations that oversimplify grain geometry and interaction mechanisms. Our Geant4-based simulations reveal charge accumulation within intergrain micro-cavities, leading to repulsive electrostatic forces consistent with experimental observations. The framework establishes a multiscale approach that links microscopic scattering events to the continuity equation of surface charge density and to the formation of macroscopic surface charge patches in complex grain geometries. Although demonstrated here for planetary regolith, the method is general and applicable to a broad range of dielectric charging problems. The code is openly available at https://github.com/kgandhi63/g4chargeit.git.</description>

      <title>On the Concept of Violence: A Comparative Study of Human and AI Judgments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.17256</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.17256v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Background: What counts as violence is neither self-evident nor universally agreed upon. While physical aggression is prototypical, contemporary societies increasingly debate whether exclusion, humiliation, online harassment or symbolic acts should be classified within the same moral category. At the same time, Large Language Models (LLMs) are being consulted in everyday contexts to interpret and label complex social behaviors. Whether these systems reproduce, reshape or simplify human conceptions of violence remains an open question. Methods: Here we present a systematic comparison between human judgements and LLM classifications across 22 scenarios carefully designed to be morally dividing, spanning from physical and verbally aggressive behavior, relational dynamics, marginalization, symbolic actions and verbal expressions. Human responses were compared with outputs from multiple instruction-tuned models of varying sizes and architectures. We conducted global, sentence-level and thematic-domain analyses, and examined variability across models to assess patterns of convergence and divergence. Findings: This study treats violence as a strategically chosen proxy through which broader belief formation dynamics can be observed. Violence is not the focus of the study, but it serves as a tool to investigate broader analysis. It enables a structured investigation of how LLMs operationalize ambiguous moral constructs, negotiate conceptual boundaries, and transform plural human interpretations into singular outputs. More broadly, the findings contribute to ongoing debates about the epistemic role of conversational AI in shaping everyday interpretations of harm, responsibility and social norms, highlighting the importance of transparency and critical engagement as these systems increasingly mediate public reasoning.</description>

      <title>Atomic-Scale Surface Imaging of bulk Epitaxial CsPbBr3 Perovskite Single Crystals on Mica using Light Assisted Scanning Tunneling Microscopy at Low-Temperature (80 K)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.17388</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.17388v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Epitaxial single-crystalline CsPbBr3 perovskite films on mica, prepared ex-situ, are explored using a low-temperature scanning tunneling microscope (STM) by probing the unoccupied electronic states of their surface in ultra-high vacuum (UHV) at 80 K. Light-assisted STM measurements under a broadband illumination with visible light were employed to enhance and stabilize surface conductivity. STM imaging across the surface of macroscopic bulk CsPbBr3 films reveals large flat terraces characterized by a specific type of surface reconstruction, consisting of parallel rows of U-shaped atomic nanostructures. These structures are spaced by 12 angstroms and exhibit an internal periodicity of 5.1 angstroms. Density functional theory (DFT) calculations reproduce the experimental observations and reveal a competition between different orthorhombic CsPbBr3(110) surface reconstructions: a Cs-rich structure, identified as the most energetically stable, and three alternative PbBr rich reconstructions, which are slightly higher in energy yet remain consistent with the STM data. Additional analyses that explicitly account for the mica substrate exclude the cubic CsPbBr3 phase and other orthorhombic surface orientations, while showing that variations in the mica surface termination do not alter the preferred CsPbBr3(110) reconstruction. This combined approach thereby confirms our assignment and resolves previous STM interpretations of CsPbBr3.</description>

      <title>Tracking the Brownian motion of DNA-functionalized magnetic nanoparticles for conformation analysis beyond the optical resolution limit</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.17496</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.17496v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Brownian motion provides access to hydrodynamic properties of nanoscale objects independent of their optical resolvability. Here, we present a diffusion-based approach to infer effective particle size distributions of DNA-functionalized magnetic nanoparticles (MNPs), consisting of a magnetic core and a polystyrene shell, in a regime where direct geometric sizing is limited by optical diffraction. Using multi-particle tracking microscopy, we analyze the Brownian dynamics of MNPs grafted with double-stranded DNA (dsDNA) of varying contour length under low-salt conditions. A physically motivated model is introduced that relates dsDNA contour length to an effective hydrodynamic diameter via an attenuated corona description. The measured diffusion coefficient distributions exhibit a systematic and monotonic dependence on dsDNA length in quantitative agreement with the model. While the tracked objects are predominantly dsDNA-mediated agglomerates rather than isolated nanoparticles, clustering does not obscure the length-dependent signal. Instead, the dsDNA corona determines the hydrodynamic scaling, whereas agglomeration mainly introduces an offset and distribution broadening. These results demonstrate that Brownian dynamics enables robust readout of biomolecular length scales even far below the optical resolution limit. The distribution-based approach is inherently tolerant to polydispersity and aggregation, making diffusion-based tracking a simple and promising strategy for future biotechnological and biomedical assays.</description>

      <title>Dual-purpose architected materials: Optimizing graded BCC lattices for crashworthiness and heat dissipation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.17561</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.17561v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Body-centered Cubic (BCC) lattice structures demonstrate promising performance for applications that require simultaneous mechanical energy absorption and thermal management. However, current optimization approaches are typically confined to single-domain objectives, such as mechanical parameters like impact energy and peak stress, neglecting the role of multiple physics in real-world performance. To address this, we propose a multi-objective optimization framework for density-graded BCC lattices that effectively dissipates heat while maximizing absorbed impact energy. A parametric three-zone lattice configuration is investigated to explore various trade-offs between mechanical and thermal properties. Each design is evaluated through independent impact and forced-convection simulations using commercial solvers. Specific Energy Absorption (SEA) and peak stresses at the distal end quantify impact absorption performance, while the Nusselt number and pressure drop characterize thermal dissipation performance. Surrogate models constructed from this data enable multi-objective optimization via Goal Programming to identify an optimal design. Two Pareto-optimal lattice designs are identified with reduced pressure drop and peak stress, underlining the superiority of strategic density gradation. Analysis of the optimal designs reveals how material distribution and geometric design variables influence mechanical-thermal trade-offs, establishing quantitative design guidelines for lattice structures in this multi-physics application.</description>

      <title>Chromatic and Spherical Aberration Correction with Hexapole and Quadrupole Fields</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.11458</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.11458v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We report the development of a chromatic and spherical aberration corrector based on combinations of hexapole and quadrupole fields. Thick hexapole fields are used to generate negative third order spherical aberration and to correct residual axial and off-axial aberrations. As an alternative to the use of round transfer lenses placed between the hexapoles, a quadrupole multiplet producing superimposed electric and magnetic quadrupole fields is used to produce negative chromatic aberration. This quadrupole multiplet also functions as a transfer doublet within the corrector. The simultaneous correction of chromatic and spherical aberrations using this corrector design is described, and a resolution improvement is demonstrated for cases where the energy spread is limiting.</description>

      <title>Self-Assembled hBN Wrinkles as Planar Optofluidic Channels</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.26370</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.26370v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Optically accessible, scalable planar nanofluidic channels are attractive for studying transport and localization under confinement. Two dimensional (2D) materials provide large area, atomically flat interfaces for generating such platforms, yet achieving long range one-dimensional (1D) confinement with top-down nanofabrication remains challenging because it requires reproducible nanoscale feature control over extended distances, high yield, and low nonspecific adsorption of analytes under aqueous conditions. Here we demonstrate that thermally induced wrinkling of exfoliated hexagonal boron nitride (hBN) produces self-assembled, liquid-accessible, channel-like networks through a lithography-free process. By varying flake thickness and substrate choice, we quantify statistical trends in wrinkle density and morphology, thereby establishing a practical fabrication design space. Atomic force microscopy and electron microscopy reveal wrinkle-derived geometries with vertical confinement ranging from &lt;2 nm to &gt;100 nm depending on flake thickness and substrate. We further employ time-sequence optical imaging upon droplet-contact, which together with Raman mapping of the water OH-stretch band and capacitance-gradient mapping (dC/dz) by scanning dielectric microscopy (KPFM-based) measurements, demonstrates liquid infiltration and long-term liquid retention within the wrinkle network for more than 10 h. We finally show a proof-of-concept biomolecule confinement application in which we integrate a graphene overlayer as a background suppression interface, enabling wide-field fluorescence localization of ATTO647N labeled DNA along hBN wrinkle-induced nanochannels. Overall, this work establishes self-assembled hBN wrinkles as a scalable, and optically addressable planar nanofluidic platform for confinement of fluids and biomolecules.</description>

      <title>Enhanced transverse electron transport via disordered composite formation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.04433</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.04433v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Transverse electron transport in magnetic materials - manifested in effects such as the anomalous Hall and Nernst effects - holds promise for spintronic and thermoelectric applications. While recent advances have focused on enhancing such transport through topological single crystals via intrinsic mechanisms linked to Berry curvature, practical limitations remain due to their mechanical fragility and narrow material scope. Here, we demonstrate a distinct approach for transverse transport enhancement based on composite formation. Using both theoretical modeling and experiments, we show that disordered mixtures of two ferromagnetic materials can exhibit significantly stronger transverse electron deflection than either constituent alone. This enhancement originates from meandering electron pathways created by the disordered mixture of two materials and does not rely on long-range crystalline order. The identified requirements for this mechanism can be broadly satisfied across different material systems, offering a universal and tunable strategy to engineer large transverse responses in structurally robust platforms.</description>
