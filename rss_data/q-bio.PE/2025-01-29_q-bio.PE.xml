      <title>Modeling Cost-Associated Cooperation: A Dilemma of Species Interaction Unveiling New Aspects of Fear Effect</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.16522</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.16522v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: With limited resources, competition is widespread, yet cooperation persists across taxa, from microorganisms to large mammals. Recent observations reveal contingent factors often drive cooperative interactions, with the intensity heterogeneously distributed within species. While cooperation has beneficial outcomes, it may also incur significant costs, largely depending on species density. This creates a dilemma that is pivotal in shaping sustainable cooperation strategies. Understanding how cooperation intensity governs the cost-benefit balance, and whether an optimal strategy exists for species survival, is a fundamental question in ecological research, and the focus of this study. We develop a novel mathematical model within the Lotka-Volterra framework to explore the dynamics of cost-associated partial cooperation, which remains relatively unexplored in ODE model-based studies. Our findings demonstrate that partial cooperation benefits ecosystems up to a certain intensity, beyond which costs become dominant, leading to system collapse via heteroclinic bifurcation. This outcome captures the cost-cooperation dilemma, providing insights for adopting sustainable strategies and resource management for species survival. We propose a novel mathematical approach to detect and track heteroclinic orbits in predator-prey systems. Moreover, we show that introducing fear of predation can protect the regime shift, even with a type-I functional response, challenging traditional ecological views. Although fear is known to resolve the "paradox of enrichment," our results suggest that certain levels of partial cooperation can reestablish this dynamic even at higher fear intensity. Finally, we validate the system's dynamical robustness across functional responses through structural sensitivity analysis.</description>

      <title>Ancestral Inference and Learning for Branching Processes in Random Environments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.16526</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.16526v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Ancestral inference for branching processes in random environments involves determining the ancestor distribution parameters using the population sizes of descendant generations. In this paper, we introduce a new methodology for ancestral inference utilizing the generalized method of moments. We demonstrate that the estimator's behavior is critically influenced by the coefficient of variation of the environment sequence. Furthermore, despite the process's evolution being heavily dependent on the offspring means of various generations, we show that the joint limiting distribution of the ancestor and offspring estimators of the mean, under appropriate centering and scaling, decouple and converge to independent Gaussian random variables when the ratio of the number of generations to the logarithm of the number of replicates converges to zero. Additionally, we provide estimators for the limiting variance and illustrate our findings through numerical experiments and data from Polymerase Chain Reaction experiments and COVID-19 data.</description>

      <title>Scaling of connectivity metrics in river networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.17033</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.17033v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Rivers are well-known to exhibit fractal-like properties that lead to existence of scaling laws that link network geometry and size. However, these geometric relations might not necessarily capture the spatial features that most directly influence ecological processes such as the generation and maintenance of biodiversity. Connectivity metrics, on the other hand, have been shown both theoretically and empirically to influence relevant large-scale ecological outcomes. Therefore, in this work, we establish how river network connectivity scales with system size by analyzing networks obtained for more than 1000 rivers across the globe. Specifically, we found clear power-law scaling of both the Harmonic and Betweenness centrality network connectivity metrics. We then created a synthetic river network dataset by fitting an Optimal Channel Network (OCN) model to each real river, to ask if OCNs, which are widely used to represent rivers in many theoretical studies, exhibit the same connectivity scaling laws as empirical river networks. We found excellent agreement between empirical and OCN-based scaling laws, supporting the notion that OCNs can accurately represent rivers in network-based models and analyses. Finally, we examined the robustness of the connectivity scaling laws by varying species movement strategies from perfect shortest-path navigation to unbiased random walks. Surprisingly, we found that random walk movement breaks the power-law scaling relationship for harmonic, but not for betweenness centrality.</description>

      <title>Reinforcement Learning for Control of Non-Markovian Cellular Population Dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.08439</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.08439v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Many organisms and cell types, from bacteria to cancer cells, exhibit a remarkable ability to adapt to fluctuating environments. Additionally, cells can leverage a memory of past environments to better survive previously-encountered stressors. From a control perspective, this adaptability poses significant challenges in driving cell populations toward extinction, and thus poses an open question with great clinical significance. In this work, we focus on drug dosing in cell populations exhibiting phenotypic plasticity. For specific dynamical models switching between resistant and susceptible states, exact solutions are known. However, when the underlying system parameters are unknown, and for complex memory-based systems, obtaining the optimal solution is currently intractable. To address this challenge, we apply reinforcement learning (RL) to identify informed dosing strategies to control cell populations evolving under novel non-Markovian dynamics. We find that model-free deep RL is able to recover exact solutions and control cell populations even in the presence of long-range temporal dynamics. To further test our approach in more realistic settings, we demonstrate robust RL-based control strategies in environments with measurement noise and dynamic memory strength.</description>
