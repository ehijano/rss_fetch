      <title>Predicting the future applications of any stoichiometric inorganic material through learning from past literature</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.06120</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.06120v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Through learning from past literature, artificial intelligence models have been able to predict the future applications of various stoichiometric inorganic materials in a variety of subfields of materials science. This capacity offers exciting opportunities for boosting the research and development (R&amp;D) of new functional materials. Unfortunately, the previous models can only provide the prediction for existing materials in past literature, but cannot predict the applications of new materials. Here, we construct a model that can predict the applications of any stoichiometric inorganic material (regardless of whether it is a new material). Historical validation confirms the high reliability of our model. Key to our model is that it allows the generation of the word embedding of any stoichiometric inorganic material, which cannot be achieved by the previous models. This work constructs a powerful model, which can predict the future applications of any stoichiometric inorganic material using only a laptop, potentially revolutionizing the R&amp;D paradigm for new functional materials</description>

      <title>One-Dimensional Model for Coupled Flexural, Torsional and Extensional Motions of Elastic Beams with Embedded Point Magnets under Magnetic Fields</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.06232</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.06232v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper establishes a one-dimensional theoretical model for an elastic beam with embedded point magnets in extensional, bending and torsional motions. The beam has a circular cross-section. The point magnets may be in the interior or at the ends of the beam. They are assumed to be small and rigid, and may be ferromagnetic with spontaneous magnetic moments that can change their directions with respect to the magnets. The model shows that the extensional, flexural and torsional motions of the beam may be coupled by the point magnets when an external magnetic field is applied. A few examples are given. Piezoelectric beams with point magnets are also discussed.</description>

      <title>Extending the Defect Tolerance of Halide Perovskite Nanocrystals to Hot Carrier Cooling Dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.06276</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.06276v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Defect tolerance is a critical enabling factor for efficient lead-halide perovskite materials, but the current understanding is primarily on band-edge (cold) carriers, with significant debate over whether hot carriers (HCs) can also exhibit defect tolerance. Here, this important gap in the field is addressed by investigating how internationally-introduced traps affect HC relaxation in CsPbX3 nanocrystals (X = Br, I, or mixture). Using femtosecond interband and intraband spectroscopy, along with energy-dependent photoluminescence measurements and kinetic modelling, it is found that HCs are not universally defect tolerant in CsPbX3, but are strongly correlated to the defect tolerance of cold carriers, requiring shallow traps to be present (as in CsPbI3). It is found that HCs are directly captured by traps, instead of going through an intermediate cold carrier, and deeper traps cause faster HC cooling, reducing the effects of the hot phonon bottleneck and Auger reheating. This work provides important insights into how defects influence HCs, which will be important for designing materials for hot carrier solar cells, multiexciton generation, and optical gain media.</description>

      <title>Coherent Heat Transfer Leads to Genuine Quantum Enhancement in Performances of Continuous Engines</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.05799</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.05799v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The conventional continuous quantum heat engines rely on incoherent heat transfer with the baths and, thus, have limited capability to outperform their classical counterparts. In this work, we introduce distinct continuous quantum heat engines that utilize coherent heat transfer with baths, yielding significant quantum enhancement in performance. These continuous engines, termed as coherent engines, consist of one qutrit system and two photonic baths and enable coherent heat transfer via two-photon transitions involving three-body interactions between the system and hot and cold baths. The closest quantum incoherent analogs are those that only allow incoherent heat transfer between the qutrit and the baths via one-photon transitions relying on two-body interactions between the system and hot or cold baths. We demonstrate that coherent engines deliver much higher power output and a much lower signal-to-noise ratio in power, where the latter signifies the reliability of an engine, compared to incoherent engines. Coherent engines manifest more non-classical features than incoherent engines because they violate the classical thermodynamic uncertainty relation by a greater amount and for a wider range of parameters. Importantly, coherent engines can operate close to or at the fundamental lower limit on reliability given by the quantum version of the thermodynamic uncertainty relation, making them highly reliable. These genuine enhancements in performance by hundreds of folds over incoherent engines and the saturation of the quantum limit by coherent engines are directly attributed to its capacity to harness higher energetic coherence which is, again, a consequence of coherent heat transfer. The experimental feasibility of coherent engines and the improved understanding of how quantum properties can enhance performance may find important implications in emerging quantum technologies.</description>

      <title>Experimental Demonstration of Controllable PT and anti-PT Coupling in a non-Hermitian Metamaterial</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.05922</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.05922v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Non-Hermiticity has recently emerged as a rapidly developing field due to its exotic characteristics related to open systems, where the dissipation plays a critical role. In the presence of balanced energy gain and loss with environment, the system exhibits parity-time (PT) symmetry, meanwhile as the conjugate counterpart, anti-PT symmetry can be achieved with dissipative coupling within the system. Here, we demonstrate the coherence of complex dissipative coupling can control the transition between PT and anti-PT symmetry in an electromagnetic metamaterial. Notably, the achievement of the anti-PT symmetric phase is independent of variations in dissipation. Furthermore, we observe phase transitions as the system crosses exceptional points in both anti-PT and PT symmetric metamaterial configurations, achieved by manipulating the frequency and dissipation of resonators. This work provides a promising metamaterial design for broader exploration of non-Hermitian physics and practical application with controllable Hamiltonian.</description>

      <title>Vacancy enhanced cation ordering enables &gt;15% efficiency in Kesterite solar cells</title>

Abstract: Atomic disorder, a widespread problem in compound crystalline materials, is a imperative affecting the performance of multi-chalcogenide Cu2ZnSn(S, Se)4 (CZTSSe) photovoltaic device known for its low cost and environmental friendliness. Cu-Zn disorder is particularly abundantly present in CZTSSe due to its extraordinarily low formation energy, having induced high-concentration deep defects and severe charge loss, while its regulation remains challenging due to the contradiction between disorder-order phase transition thermodynamics and atom-interchange kinetics. Herein, through introducing more vacancies in the CZTSSe surface, we explored a vacancy-assisted strategy to reduce the atom-interchange barrier limit to facilitate the Cu-Zn ordering kinetic process. The improvement in the Cu-Zn order degree has significantly reduced the charge loss in the device and helped us realize 15.4% (certified at 14.9%) and 13.5% efficiency (certified at 13.3%) in 0.27 cm2 and 1.1 cm2-area CZTSSe solar cells, respectively, thus bringing substantial advancement for emerging inorganic thin-film photovoltaics.</description>

      <title>Copper doping effects on the superconducting properties of Sm-based oxypnictides</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.06146</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.06146v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A systematic investigation has been performed by synthesis and comprehensive characterization of a series of SmFe1-xCuxAsO0.8F0.2 bulks (x = 0 to 0.2). These samples are well characterized by structural, Raman spectroscopy, microstructural, transport, magnetic measurements, and supplementary calculations within density functional theory (DFT). The parent compound, SmFeAsO0.8F0.2 (Sm1111), exhibits a superconducting transition temperature (Tc) of approximately 54 K. The lattice volume (V) is increased with Cu substitution (x) without observing any impurity phase related to copper, which confirms the successful incorporation of Cu at Fe sites in the superconducting FeAs layers. These analyses are also well in agreement with Raman spectroscopy measurements and relevant DFT results. The superconducting transition is decreased systematically with copper doping and completely suppressed for 7% Cu-doped Sm1111 (x = 0.07). A large amount of Cu substitution (x greater than 0.07) has demonstrated the metal to insulate transition in the low-temperature range, and no impurity phase was observed even at high Cu doping levels (x = 0.2). The calculated critical current density of the parent sample is suppressed with copper substitution, suggesting the reduced pinning centers, sample density, and grain connections, as confirmed by the microstructural analysis. Our studies suggest that the substitution of Cu in the superconducting FeAs layer, resulting the enlargement of the lattice volume, is a source of strong disorder scattering, leading to the suppression of Tc and the emergence of metal-to-insulator, unlike the more successful carrier doping by nickel (Ni) or cobalt (Co), as previously reported.</description>

      <title>Transport resistance strikes back: unveiling its impact on fill factor losses in organic solar cells</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.06190</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.06190v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The fill factor ($FF$) is a critical parameter for solar cell efficiency, yet its analytical description is challenging due to the interplay between recombination and charge extraction processes. An often overlooked yet significant factor contributing to $FF$ losses, beyond recombination, is the influence of charge transport. In most state-of-the-art organic solar cells, the primary limitation of the $FF$ arises not from recombination but rather from low conductivity, highlighting the need for refined models to predict the $FF$ accurately. Here, we extend the analytical model for transport resistance to a more general case. Drawing from a large set of experimental current-voltage and light intensity-dependent open-circuit voltage data, we systematically incorporate crucial details previously omitted in the model. Consequently, we introduce a straightforward set of equations to predict the $FF$ of a solar cell, enabling the differentiation of losses attributed to recombination and transport resistance. Our study provides valuable insights into strategies for mitigating $FF$ losses based on the experimentally validated analytical model, guiding the development of more efficient solar cell designs and optimization strategies.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.06398</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.06398v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Electro-optics serves as the crucial bridge between electronics and photonics, unlocking a wide array of applications ranging from communications and computing to sensing and quantum information. Integrated electro-optics approaches in particular enable essential electronic high-speed control for photonics while offering substantial photonic parallelism for electronics. Recent strides in thin-film lithium niobate photonics have ushered revolutionary advancements in electro-optics. This technology not only offers the requisite strong electro-optic coupling but also boasts ultra-low optical loss and high microwave bandwidth. Further, its tight confinement and compatibility with nanofabrication allow for unprecedented reconfigurability and scalability, facilitating the creation of novel and intricate devices and systems that were once deemed nearly impossible in bulk systems. Building upon this platform, the field has witnessed the emergence of various groundbreaking electro-optic devices surpassing the current state of the art, and introducing functionalities that were previously non-existent. This technological leap forward provides a unique framework to explore various realms of physics as well, including photonic non-Hermitian synthetic dimensions, active topological physics, and quantum electro-optics. In this review, we present the fundamental principles of electro-optics, drawing connections between fundamental science and the forefront of technology. We discuss the accomplishments and future prospects of integrated electro-optics, enabled by thin-film lithium niobate platform.</description>

      <title>Direct electrochemical reduction of graphene oxide thin film for aptamer-based selective and highly sensitive detection of Matrix metalloproteinase 2</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.04674</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.04674v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Simple and low-cost biosensing solutions are suitable for point-of-care applications aiming to overcome the gap between scientific concepts and technological production. To compete with sensitivity and selectivity of golden standards, such as liquid chromatography, the functionalization of biosensors is continuously optimized to enhance the signal and improve their performance, often leading to complex chemical assay development. In this research, the efforts are made on optimizing the methodology for electrochemical reduction of graphene oxide to produce thin film-modified gold electrodes. Under the employed specific conditions, 20 cycles of cyclic voltammetry (CV) are shown to be optimal for superior electrical activation of graphene oxide into electrochemically reduced graphene oxide (ERGO). This platform is further used to develop a matrix metalloproteinase 2 (MMP-2) biosensor, where specific anti-MMP2 aptamers are utilized as a biorecognition element. MMP-2 is a protein which is typically overexpressed in tumor tissues, with important roles in tumor invasion, metastasis as well as in tumor angiogenesis. Based on impedimetric measurements, we were able to detect as low as 3.32 pg/mL of MMP-2 in PBS with a dynamic range of 10 pg/mL - 10 ng/mL. Besides high specificity, ERGO-based aptasensor showed a potential of reuse due to demonstrated successful signal restoration after experimental detection of MMP-2.</description>
