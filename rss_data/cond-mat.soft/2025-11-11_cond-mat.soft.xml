      <title>Design of an engaging-disengaging compliant mechanism by using bistable arches</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.06039</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.06039v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Compliant mechanisms utilise elastic deformation of their segments to transmit motion or force. The utility and behaviour of specific compliant mechanisms can be enhanced by introducing an engaging and disengaging ability with its elastic segments. Towards this, we present an engaging-disengaging compliant mechanism (EDCM) that can switch its stiffness between infinite and zero. The design of the EDCM is based on bistable arches and a locking mechanism. We describe its working, identify its design parameters, and use analytical expressions to arrive at its dimension. The design is verified by detailed finite element analysis and experiments on a 3D-printed prototype. Three alternate designs that lead us to the final mechanism are also briefly discussed.</description>

      <title>Enhanced Coalescence in Driven Foams</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.06480</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.06480v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: External driving leads to the emergence of unique phenomena and properties in soft matter systems. We show that driving quasi-2D foams by mechanical vibration results in significant bubble coalescence, which is enhanced by the continuous phase yield stress. The competition between coarsening and coalescence can be modulated through vibration amplitude and foam liquid fraction, which can be used to create unusual structural motifs. The combined effect of coarsening and coalescence is captured through a statistical model that quantitatively describes the time evolution of the number of bubbles.</description>

      <title>Thermal conductivity of commodity polymers under high pressures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.06561</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.06561v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Understanding the thermal conductivity of polymers under high--pressure conditions is essential for a range of applications, from aerospace and deep--sea engineering to common lubricants. However, the complex relationship between pressure, $P$, the thermal transport coefficient, $\kappa$, and polymer architecture poses substantial challenges to both experimental and theoretical investigations. In this work, we study the pressure--dependent thermal transport properties of a widely used commodity polymer -- poly(methyl methacrylate) (PMMA) -- using a combination of all--atom molecular dynamics simulations and semi-analytical approaches. While we report both classical and quantum-corrected estimates of $\kappa$, the latter approach reveals that as the pressure increases from 1 atm to 10 GPa, $\kappa$ rises by up to a factor of four -- from 0.21 W m$^{-1}$ K$^{-1}$ to 0.80 W m$^{-1}$ K$^{-1}$. To better understand the mechanisms behind this increase, we disentangle the contributions from bonded and nonbonded monomer interactions. Our analysis shows that nonbonded energy-transfer rates increase by a factor of six over the pressure range, while bonded interactions show a more modest increase -- about a factor of three. This observation further consolidates the fact that the nonbonded interactions play the dominant role in dictating the microscopic heat flow in polymers. These individual energy-transfer rates are also incorporated into a simplified heat diffusion model to predict $\kappa$. The results obtained from different approaches show internal consistency and align well with available experimental data. Additionally, some data for polylactic acid (PLA) are presented.</description>

      <title>Mechanical instability generates monodisperse colloidosomes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.06588</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.06588v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Formation and rupture of vesicles is a fundamental process underlying diverse phenomena in biology, materials science, and biomedical applications. Vesicles form when the area of a growing disk-like membrane exceeds a critical value at which the edge and bending energies balance each other. Observing such topological transitions in lipid bilayers is a challenge because of their nanoscale dimensions and rapid dynamics. We study a scaled-up model of colloidal membranes assembled from rod-shaped colloidal particles. The unique features of colloidal membranes enable the real-time visualization of spontaneous closure driven by instability relevant to all membrane-based materials. First-principles theory quantitatively predicts the instability point for vesicle formation and intermediate membrane conformations during the disk-to-vesicle transition. The instability generates monodisperse, selectively permeable colloidosomes with size controlled by gravity and membrane thickness, providing a scalable and programmable platform for diverse applications.</description>

      <title>Shape-controlled growth of two-dimensional kagome-lattice colloidal crystals through nanoparticle capping</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.06630</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.06630v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Organic capping ligands can selectively bind to crystal facets to modulate growth kinetics and are important in chemical synthesis of inorganic nanocrystals. Using the capping ligands for shape-controlled growth of colloidal crystals is challenging due to the size mismatch of molecules and nanoparticle building blocks. In existing synthetic pathways, colloidal crystal shapes are determined by their thermodynamically favored phases yet controlling their shapes independent of lattice symmetry is vital to study many solid-state properties. Here, we develop a nanoparticle capping strategy to control colloidal crystal shapes and structural heterogeneity. Au bipyramids were used as building blocks and assembled into rhombohedral colloidal crystals driven by DNA hybridization. In (111) planes of the crystals, bipyramids assembled into kagome lattices, featuring structure cavities organized in a hexagonal lattice. The rhombohedral crystals have truncated tetrahedral crystal habits, and the degree of truncation defines the exposed facets and crystal shapes. Our surface capping strategy is to introduce DNA-modified nanospheres as effective capping agents, which selectively register on the surface vacancies of the kagome facets and resemble the role of organic ligands in classic nanocrystal growth. Such selective capping is driven by maximizing DNA hybridization and leads to slower growth of the (111) kagome facets, changing the crystal shape from three-dimensional truncated tetrahedra to two-dimensional layered microplates with structural heterogeneity and shape anisotropy. This study underpins the importance of capping agents in colloidal crystal growth and inspires effective ways to control the growth kinetics and heterostructures of colloidal crystals.</description>

      <title>Colloidal rod dynamics under large amplitude oscillatory extensional flow</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.06703</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.06703v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We perform a combined experimental and theoretical investigation of the orientational dynamics of rod-like colloidal particles in dilute suspension as they are subjected to a time-dependent homogeneous planar elongational flow. Our experimental approach involves the flow of dilute suspensions of cellulose nanocrystals (CNC) within a cross-slot-type stagnation point microfluidic device through which the extension rate is modulated sinusoidally over a wide range of P\'{e}clet number amplitudes ($Pe_0$) and Deborah numbers ($De$). The time-dependent orientation of the CNC is assessed via quantitative flow-induced birefringence measurements. For small $Pe_0 \lesssim 1$ and small $De \lesssim 0.03$, the birefringence response is sinusoidal and in phase with the strain rate, i.e., the response is linear. With increasing $Pe_0$, the response becomes non-sinusoidal (i.e., nonlinear) as the birefringence saturates due to the high degree of particle alignment at higher strain rates during the cycle. With increasing $De$, the CNC rods have insufficient time to respond to the rapidly changing strain rate, leading to asymmetry in the birefringence response around the minima and a residual effect as the strain rate passes through zero. These varied dynamical responses of the rod-like CNC are captured in a detailed series of Lissajous plots of the birefringence versus the strain rate. Experimental measurements are compared with simulations performed on both monodisperse and polydisperse systems, with rotational diffusion coefficients $D_r$ matched to the CNC. A semiquantitative agreement is found for simulations of a polydisperse system with $D_r$ heavily weighted to the longest rods in the measured CNC distribution. The results will be valuable for understanding, predicting, and optimizing the orientation of rod-like colloids during transient processing flows such as fiber spinning and film casting.</description>

      <title>Anomalous Enhancement of Yield Strength due to Static Friction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.06807</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.06807v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Friction is fundamental to mechanical stability across scales, from geological faults and architectural structures to granular materials and animal feet. We study the mechanical stability of a minimal friction-stabilized structure composed of three cylindrical particles arranged in a triangular stack on a floor under gravity. We analyze the yield force, defined as the threshold compressive force applied quasi-statically from above at which the structure collapses due to sliding at the floor contact. Using singular perturbation analysis, we derive an expression which quantitatively predicts the yield force as a function of the static friction coefficient and a small dimensionless parameter $\epsilon$ characterizing elastic deformation.</description>

      <title>Mobility of Lactose in Milk Powders</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.06834</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.06834v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Lactose is the major component of milk powders and is normally found to be in a glassy/amorphous state. During storage, lactose is known to participate in physicochemical processes, including crystallization on the surface and reaction with proteins such as $\beta$-lactoglobulin. Lactose needs to be mobile to participate in such processes. However, there is a lack of evidence of its mobility in milk powders. In this study, we demonstrate that some of the lactose becomes mobile when milk powders are exposed to humid air $-$ an inappropriate storage condition. This mobility is evidenced by peaks in magic angle spinning $^{1}\mathrm{H}$ NMR spectra of milk powders in the range of 3.5 ppm to 4.0 ppm, which stem from lactose molecules displaying considerable rotational mobility. These signals have a longitudinal relaxation time constant T1 similar to that of mobile water according to 2D T1$-\delta(^{1}\mathrm{H})$ experiments under magic angle spinning. Furthermore, 2D $^{1}\mathrm{H}-^{13}\mathrm{C}$ HSQC magic angle spinning experiments of skim milk powder demonstrate the same fingerprint as that of lactose in the solution, confirming our observations.</description>

      <title>Coupling of Lipid Phase Behavior and Protein Oligomerization in a Lattice Model of Raft Membranes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.06949</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.06949v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Membrane proteins often form dimers and higher-order oligomers whose stability and spatial organization depend sensitively on their lipid environment. To investigate the physical principles underlying this coupling, we employ a lattice Monte Carlo model of ternary lipid mixtures that exhibit liquid-disordered ($L_d$) and liquid-ordered ($L_o$) phase coexistence. In this framework, proteins are represented as small membrane inclusions with tunable nearest neighbor interactions with both lipids and other proteins, allowing us to examine how protein-lipid affinity competes with protein-protein interactions and lipid-lipid demixing. We find that the balance of these interactions controls whether proteins remain dispersed, assemble into small oligomers, or form large stable clusters within $L_o$ domains, and that increasing the protein concentration further promotes coarsening of the ordered phase. To incorporate ligand-regulated activation, we extend the model to a kinetic Monte Carlo scheme in which proteins stochastically switch between inactive and active states with distinct affinities. The inverse switching rate, relative to the time required for a protein to diffuse across the characteristic size of the $L_o$ domains, governs the aggregation behavior. Rapid switching yields only transient small oligomers, slow switching reproduces the static limit with persistent large clusters, and intermediate rates produce broad cluster-size distributions. These results highlight the interplay between lipid phase organization, protein-lipid affinity, and activation dynamics in regulating membrane protein oligomerization, a coupling that is central to signal transduction and membrane organization in living cells.</description>

      <title>Controlling viscosity to engineer focal conic domains in photonic cellulose nanocrystal films</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.06981</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.06981v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Cellulose nanocrystals (CNCs) form cholesteric architectures that can have color specific reflectivity and enable sustainable photonic films. However, achieving uniform color, suppressing iridescence, and accessing ordered defect structures such as focal conic domains remain challenging. Here, we control the photonic properties of CNC films by steering the self assembly process. Across 24 dish-cast films with varying salt concentrations and sonication doses, we combine viscosity measurements, timelapse polarized optical microscopy, and angle-resolved reflectance spectroscopy to correlate evaporation dynamics with photonic structure. We show that viscosity, jointly controlled by NaCl-mediated electrostatic screening and sonication-induced bundle fragmentation, dictates the extent of tactoid coalescence. Low-viscosity suspensions generate large, homogeneous cholesteric domains and narrow spectral responses, while high viscosity leads to arrested, heterogenous domains and increased diffuse light reflection. Critically, within a narrow parameter window of intermediate ionic strength and moderate sonication, we reproducibly engineer photonically active focal conic domains. These results identify viscosity-driven flow as a key, previously underappreciated factor in CNC self-assembly and establish design rules for producing structurally colored films with tunable photonic response, reduced iridescence, and controllable defect architectures.</description>

      <title>Why Extensile and Contractile Tissues Could be Hard to Tell Apart</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.07012</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.07012v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Active nematic models explain the topological defects and flow patterns observed in epithelial tissues, but the nature of active stress-whether it is extensile or contractile, a key parameter of the theory-is not well established experimentally. Individual cells are contractile, yet tissue-level behavior often resembles extensile nematics. To address this discrepancy, we use a continuum theory with two-tensor order parameters that distinguishes cell shape from active stress. We show that correlating cell shape and flow, whether in coherent flows in channels, near topological defects, or at rigid boundaries, cannot unambiguously determine the type of active stress. Our results demonstrate that simultaneous measurements of stress and cell shape are essential to fully interpret experiments investigating the nature of the physical forces acting within epithelial cell layers.</description>

      <title>Sedimentation profiles and phase stacking diagrams in polydisperse hard rounded rectangle fluids</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.07034</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.07034v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We analyze the sedimentation behavior of a polydisperse two-dimensional liquid-crystal fluid using a local density functional theory based on scaled particle theory. Polydispersity is incorporated through variations in the roundness of hard rectangular particles interacting solely via excluded area effects. Despite its simplicity, the model displays a rich phenomenology. In bulk, the fluid exhibits isotropic, nematic, and tetratic phases. In sedimentation, we obtain complex phase stacking diagrams featuring multiphasic stacking sequences with up to four stacks of different bulk phases, inverted stacking sequences such as top isotropic and bottom nematic together with top nematic and bottom isotopic, as well as stacking sequences with reentrant stacks such as tetratic and nematic stacks floating between two isotropic stacks. This phenomenology arises as a result of an intricate coupling between particle polydispersity and the effect of gravity. Our approach can be easily adapted to investigate the sedimentation behaviour of other polydisperse colloidal systems.</description>

      <title>From Fresh to Salty: How Ions Modulate Solvent-Mediated Interactions between Grafted Silica Nanoparticles in Water</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.07279</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.07279v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Nanoparticles (NPs) are fundamental building blocks for engineering functional soft materials, where precise control over the solvent-mediated inter-particle effective interaction (Ueff) is essential for tailoring bulk structure and properties. These solvent-mediated interactions are strongly influenced by NP's surface chemistry, solvent properties, and thermodynamic conditions such as temperature (T) and pressure (P). However, despite considerable progress, a general predictive framework for tuning Ueff and guiding self-assembly remains lacking. In this work, using all-atom molecular dynamics simulations, we investigated the alteration of Ueff between silica nanoparticles (Si-NPs) functionalized with polyethylene (PE) and polyethylene glycol (PEG) by salt (sodium chloride) across a range of thermodynamic conditions. At ambient thermodynamic conditions, bare (not functionalized) Si-NPs exhibit minimal variation in Ueff even at high salt concentrations. In contrast, PE-grafted Si-NPs display strong salt-induced attractions, while PEG-grafted Si-NPs show an intermediate, more gradual response. To asses the transferability of these salt-induced effects on effective interactions, we further examined the effects of salt on Ueff under different (T,P) conditions. Our results indicate that the salt-induced modulation of Ueff between both bare and grafted Si-NPs is largely invariant across the explored (T,P) conditions. Molecular-level analysis reveals that salt promotes solvent depletion within the interparticle cavity for both hydrophobic PE and hydrophilic PEG grafts, with the strongest effect observed in the PE case. In general, this study highlights the coupled roles of surface chemistry, ion-polymer interactions, and solvent structuring in the regulation of Ueff, and provides important insights into the predictable control of interparticle interactions for soft material engineering.</description>

      <title>Molecular Dynamics Simulations of Membrane Selectivity of Star Peptides Across Different Bacterial and Mammalian Bilipids</title>

      <description>arXiv:2511.05513v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Structurally nanoengineered antimicrobial peptide polymers (SNAPPs) are emerging as promising selective agents against bacterial membranes. In this study, we used all atom molecular dynamics simulation techniques to investigate the interaction of a promising cationic SNAPP architecture (Alt-SNAPP with 8 arms made of alternating lysine and valine residues) with modelled Gram-negative, Gram-positive, mammalian, and red blood cell membranes. Alt-SNAPP exhibited rapid and stable binding to bacterial membranes, driven by electrostatic interactions with anionic lipids such as phosphatidylglycerol (PG) and cardiolipin (CL), and supported by membrane fluidity. In contrast, mammalian and red blood cell membranes, enriched in zwitterionic lipids and cholesterol, resisted peptide association entirely. Analyses of center of mass distance, partial density, hydrogen bonding, and interaction energy confirmed that SNAPP remains fully excluded from host like membranes while forming stable, multivalent interactions with bacterial bilayers. These findings provide mechanistic insight into membrane selectivity of SNAPP and offer a molecular framework for designing next generation antimicrobial polymers with minimal off target toxicity.</description>

      <title>Gas Mixture Diffusion and Distribution in the Porous ZIF-90 Framework</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.05602</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.05602v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Understanding how gas mixtures diffuse and distribute within porous frameworks is central to designing advanced separation and storage materials. Here, we investigate the transport and spatial distribution of binary gas mixtures in a porous metal organic framework, viz., ZIF-90, using molecular simulations. We perform grand canonical Monte Carlo (GCMC) simulations to examine the competitive adsorption of carbon dioxide and nitrogen from a binary gas mixture in ZIF-90, while molecular dynamics (MD) simulations are conducted to investigate the transport behavior of the adsorbed molecules within the framework. These integrated simulations reveal that the framework topology and pore chemistry jointly dictate diffusion pathways and preferential occupancy of gas species, underscoring their intrinsic interdependence. Competitive adsorption leads to distinct spatial partitioning within the pores, which in turn modulates mixture diffusivity inside the porous medium compared to their bulk properties. Our results provide molecular-level insight into how ZIF-90 accommodates and separates gas mixtures, offering design principles for optimizing metal-organic frameworks in energy and environmental applications.</description>

      <title>Global Buckley--Leverett for Multicomponent Flow in Fractured Media: Isothermal Equation-of-State Coupling and Dynamic Capillarity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.06233</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.06233v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present an isothermal Global Buckley--Leverett framework for multicomponent, multiphase flow in porous and fractured media that retains the interpretability of classical Buckley--Leverett while incorporating essential physics: equation of state-based phase behavior, multicomponent Maxwell--Stefan diffusion, dynamic capillarity, stress-sensitive permeability, and non-Darcy fracture flow. The formulation yields a single global-pressure equation driving the total Darcy flux and an exact fractional-flow decomposition of phase velocities with buoyancy and capillary drifts; inertial effects enter as per-phase damping that renormalizes mobilities. Crucially, the combination of Maxwell--Stefan diffusion and dynamic capillarity renders transport pseudo-parabolic, resolving the loss of strict hyperbolicity that plagues three-phase Buckley--Leverett and ensuring a well-posed initial-value problem. In practice, each time step solves the scalar global-pressure equation, reconstructs phase fluxes via the split, and advances strictly conservative component balances; axisymmetric (cylindrical) forms for radial injection with vertical buoyancy are provided. The model reduces exactly to classical Buckley--Leverett when added physics are disabled, making it a practical backbone for carbon storage and contaminant transport in fractured, compositionally complex reservoirs.</description>

      <title>Theory of Semi-discontinuous DNA Replication</title>

      <description>arXiv:2511.06904v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In biological cells, DNA replication is carried out by the replisome, a protein complex encompassing multiple DNA polymerases. DNA replication is semi-discontinuous: a DNA polymerase synthesizes one (leading) strand of the DNA continuously, and another polymerase synthesizes the other (lagging) strand discontinuously. Complex dynamics of the lagging-strand polymerase within the replisome result in the formation of short interim fragments, known as Okazaki fragments, and gaps between them. Although the semi-discontinuous replication is ubiquitous, a detailed characterization of it remains elusive. In this work, we develop a framework to investigate the semi-discontinuous replication by incorporating stochastic dynamics of the lagging-strand polymerase. Computing the size distribution of Okazaki fragments and gaps, we uncover the significance of the polymerase dissociation in shaping them. We apply the method to the previous experiment on the T4 bacteriophage replication system and identify the key parameters governing the polymerase dynamics. These results reveal that the collisions of lagging-strand polymerase with pre-synthesised Okazaki fragments primarily trigger its dissociation from the lagging strand.</description>

      <title>Entanglement-driven responses through multiscale 3D-printed knits</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.07404</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.07404v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: For their resilience and toughness, filamentous entanglements are ubiquitous in both natural and engineered systems across length scales, from polymer-chain- to collagen-networks and from cable-net structures to forest canopies. Textiles are an everyday manifestation of filamentous entanglement: the remarkable resilience and toughness in knitted fabrics arise predominately from the topology of interlooped yarns. Yet most architected materials do not exploit entanglement as a design primitive, and industrial knitting fixes a narrow set of patterns for manufacturability. Additive manufacturing has recently enabled interlocking structures such as chainmail, knot and woven assemblies, hinting at broader possibilities for entangled architectures. The general challenge is to treat knitting itself as a three-dimensional architected material with predictable and tunable mechanics across scales. Here, we show that knitted architectures fabricated additively can be recast as periodic entangled solids whose responses are both fabric-like and programmable. We reproduce the characteristic behavior of conventional planar knits and extend knitting into the third dimension by interlooping along three orthogonal directions, yielding volumetric knits whose stiffness and dissipation are tuned by prescribed pre-strain. We propose a simple scaling that unifies the responses across stitch geometries and constituent materials. Further, we realize the same topology from centimeter to micrometer scales, culminating in the fabrication of what is, to our knowledge, the smallest knitted structure ever made. By demonstrating 3D-printed knits can be interpreted both as a traditional fabric, as well as a novel architected material with defined periodicity, this work establishes the dual nature of entangled filaments and paves the way towards a new form of material architectures with high degrees of entanglement.</description>

      <title>In situ vs ex situ: Comparing the structure of PNIPAM microgels at the air/water and air/solid interfaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.14181</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.14181v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: For studying the structure of microgel particles at the air/water interface, specular and off-specular X-ray reflectivity (OSR/XRR) allows in situ measurements without any labelling techniques. Herein we investigate the vertical and lateral structure of poly(N-isopropylacrylamide) (PNIPAM) microgels (MGs) at the air/water interface and the effect of Langmuir-Blodgett (LB) transfer onto solid substrates. The initial ex situ atomic force microscopy (AFM) scans of LB-transferred MGs at the air/solid interface reveal strong lateral 2D hexagonal ordering across a broad range of lateral surface pressures at the air/water interface before LB-transfer. Notably, for the first time, these results were confirmed by OSR, demonstrating the existence of the long-range hexagonal ordering at low and intermediate surface pressures. For in situ conditions and upon uniaxial compression at the air/water interface, the MG lattice constant decreases non-monotonically. This indicates the formation of domains at low pressures that approach each other and only compress when the surface isotherm reaches a plateau. Comparing the results of in situ and ex situ measurements, our study demonstrates a clear transfer effect during the LB-deposition on the lateral ordering of the MGs: the distance between the particles decreased during LB-transfer, and at high pressures ($\Pi\,&gt;\,17\,\mathrm{mNm^{-1}}$) a second distance occurs indicating small domains with hexagonal internal ordering. The novel surface characterisation approaches debuted here highlight the use of both XRR and OSR to probe the vertical and lateral structure of adsorbed MGs, offering in situ, non-invasive insights without the need for doping or transfer-induced artefacts.</description>

      <title>Complexity reduction of physical models: an equation-free approach by means of scaling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.05029</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.05029v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The description of complex physical phenomena often involves sophisticated models that rely on a large number of parameters, with many dimensions and scales. One practical way to simplify that kind of models is to discard some of the parameters, or terms of underlying equations, thus giving rise to reduced models. Here, we propose a general approach to obtaining such reduced models. The method is independent of the model in use, i.e., equation-free, depends only on the interplay between the scales and dimensions involved in the description of the phenomena, and controls over-parametrization. It also quantifies conditions for asymptotic models by providing explicitly computable thresholds on values of parameters that allow for reducing complexity of a model, while preserving essential predictive properties. Although our focus is on complexity reduction, this approach may also help with calibration by mitigating the risks of over-parameterization and instability in parameter estimation. The benefits of this approach are discussed in the context of the classical projectile model.</description>

Abstract: Over nearly two decades, Differential Dynamic Microscopy (DDM) has become a standard technique for extracting dynamic correlation functions from time-lapse microscopy data, with applications spanning colloidal suspensions, polymer solutions, active fluids, and biological systems. In its most common implementation, DDM analyzes image sequences acquired with a conventional microscope equipped with a digital camera, yielding time- and wavevector-resolved information analogous to that obtained in multi-angle Dynamic Light Scattering (DLS). With a widening array of applications and a growing, heterogeneous user base, lowering the technical barrier to performing DDM has become a central objective. In this tutorial article, we provide a step-by-step guide to conducting DDM experiments -- from planning and acquisition to data analysis -- and introduce the open-source software package fastDDM, designed to efficiently process large image datasets. fastDDM employs optimized, parallel algorithms that reduce analysis times by up to four orders of magnitude on typical datasets (e.g., 10,000 frames), thereby enabling high-throughput workflows and making DDM more broadly accessible across disciplines.</description>

Abstract: When liquids are cooled, their dynamics are slowed, and if crystallization is avoided, they will solidify into an amorphous structure referred to as a glass. Experiments show that chemically distinct glass-forming liquids have universal features of the spectrum and temperature dependence of the main structural relaxation. We introduce Randium, a generic energetically coarse-grained model of viscous liquids, and demonstrate that the intrinsic dynamics of viscous liquids emerges. These results suggest that Randium belongs to a universal class of systems whose dynamics capture the essential physics of viscous liquid relaxation, bridging microscopic molecular models and coarse-grained theoretical descriptions.</description>

      <title>Addressing bedload flux variability due to grain shape effects and experimental channel geometry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.07689</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.07689v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The study-to-study variability of bedload flux measurements in turbulent sediment transport borders an order of magnitude, even for idealized laboratory conditions. This uncertainty stems from physically poorly supported, empirical methods to account for channel geometry effects in the determination of the transport-driving bed shear stress and from study-to-study grain shape variations. Here, we derive a universal method of bed shear stress determination. It consists of a physically-based definition of the bed surface and a channel sidewall correction that does not rely on empirical elements, except for well-established scaling coefficients associated with Kolmog\'orov's theory of turbulence. Application of this method to bedload transport of spherical grains -- to rule out grain shape effects -- collapses data from existing laboratory measurements and grain-resolved CFD-DEM simulations for various channel geometries onto a single curve. In contrast, classical sidewall corrections, as well as an alternative bed surface definition, are unable to universally capture these data, especially those from shallow or very narrow channel flows. We then apply our method to an extended grain-shape-controlled data compilation, complemented by literature data for non-spherical grains and from grain-unresolved CFD-DEM simulations. This compilation covers a very diverse range of transport conditions, ranging from very narrow to infinitely wide channels, from shallow to deep channel flows, from mild to steep bed slopes, and from weak to intense transport. We generalize an existing physical bedload flux model to account for grain shape variability and show that it explains almost all the compiled data within a factor of only $1.3$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2507.03957v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We show that long-wavelength interfacial fluctuations are strongly suppressed in non-equilibrium phase coexistence between bulk hyperuniform systems. Using simulations of three distinct microscopic models, we demonstrate that hyperuniform interfaces are much smoother than equilibrium ones, with a universal reduction of height fluctuations at large scale. We derive a non-equilibrium interface equation from the field theory of the bulk order parameter, and predict a reduction in height fluctuations, $S_h(\boldsymbol k)\equiv \langle |h(\boldsymbol k)|^2\rangle\sim |\boldsymbol k|^{-1}$, in stark contrast to equilibrium capillary wave theory where $S_h(\boldsymbol k)\sim |\boldsymbol k|^{-2}$. Our results establish a new universality class for non-equilibrium interfaces, highlighting the fundamental role of suppressed bulk fluctuations in shaping interfacial dynamics far from equilibrium.</description>

      <title>Black hole interiors of homogeneous holographic solids under shear strain</title>

      <description>arXiv:2511.00877v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate the interior of AdS black holes under finite shear strain in a class of holographic axion models, which are widely used to describe strongly-coupled systems with broken translations. We demonstrate that the shear anisotropy necessarily eliminates the inner Cauchy horizon, such that the deformed black hole approaches a space like singularity. The anisotropic effect induced by the axion fields triggers a collapse of the Einstein-Rosen bridge at the would-be Cauchy horizon, accompanied by a rapid change in the anisotropy of the spatial geometry. In addition, for a power-law axion potential, sufficiently large shear deformations give rise to a domain wall solution that includes a Lifshitz like scaling geometry near the boundary as well as a near horizon Kasner epoch with the Kasner exponents determined by the powers of the potential. Finally, we find that the interior dynamics of black holes generally enter an era described by an anisotropic Kasner universe at later interior time. Depending on the form of the potential, they either tend to stable Kasner universes, or exhibit an endless alternation of different Kasner epochs toward the singularity.</description>
