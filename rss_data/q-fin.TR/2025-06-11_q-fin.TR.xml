      <title>Price Discovery in Cryptocurrency Markets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.08718</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.08718v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This document analyzes price discovery in cryptocurrency markets by comparing centralized and decentralized exchanges, as well as spot and futures markets. The study focuses first on Ethereum (ETH) and then applies a similar approach to Bitcoin (BTC). Chapter 1 outlines the theoretical framework, emphasizing the structural differences between centralized exchanges and decentralized finance mechanisms, especially Automated Market Makers (AMMs). It also explains how to construct an order book from a liquidity pool in a decentralized setting for comparison with centralized exchanges. Chapter 2 describes the methodological tools used: Hasbrouck's Information Share, Gonzalo and Granger's Permanent-Transitory decomposition, and the Hayashi-Yoshida estimator. These are applied to explore lead-lag dynamics, cointegration, and price discovery across market types. Chapter 3 presents the empirical analysis. For ETH, it compares price dynamics on Binance and Uniswap v2 over a one-year period, focusing on five key events in 2024. For BTC, it analyzes the relationship between spot and futures prices on the CME. The study estimates lead-lag effects and cointegration in both cases. Results show that centralized markets typically lead in ETH price discovery. In futures markets, while they tend to lead overall, high-volatility periods produce mixed outcomes. The findings have key implications for traders and institutions regarding liquidity, arbitrage, and market efficiency. Various metrics are used to benchmark the performance of modified AMMs and to understand the interaction between decentralized and centralized structures.</description>

      <title>Optimal hedging of an informed broker facing many traders</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.08992</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.08992v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper investigates the optimal hedging strategies of an informed broker interacting with multiple traders in a financial market. We develop a theoretical framework in which the broker, possessing exclusive information about the drift of the asset's price, engages with traders whose trading activities impact the market price. Using a mean-field game approach, we derive the equilibrium strategies for both the broker and the traders, illustrating the intricate dynamics of their interactions. The broker's optimal strategy involves a Stackelberg equilibrium, where the broker leads and the traders follow. Our analysis also addresses the mean field limit of finite-player models and shows the convergence to the mean-field solution as the number of traders becomes large.</description>

      <title>The Subtle Interplay between Square-root Impact, Order Imbalance &amp; Volatility: A Unifying Framework</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.07711</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.07711v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this work, we aim to reconcile several apparently contradictory observations in market microstructure: is the famous ''square-root law'' of metaorder impact that decays with time compatible with the random-walk nature of prices and the linear impact of order imbalances? Can one entirely explain the volatility of prices as resulting from the flow of uninformed metaorders that mechanically impact prices? We introduce a new theoretical framework to describe metaorders with different signs, sizes and durations, which all impact prices as a square-root of volume but with a subsequent time decay. We show that, as in the original propagator model, price diffusion is ensured by the long memory of cross-correlations between metaorders. In order to account for the effect of strongly fluctuating volumes $q$ of individual trades, we further introduce two $q$-dependent exponents, which allows us to account for the way the moments of generalized volume imbalance and the correlation between price changes and generalized order flow imbalance scales with $T$. We predict in particular that the corresponding power-laws depend in a non-monotonic fashion on a parameter $a$ that allows one to put the same weight on all child orders or overweight large orders, a behaviour clearly borne out by empirical data. We also predict that the correlation between price changes and volume imbalances should display a maximum as a function of $a$, which again matches observations. Such noteworthy agreement between theory and data suggests that our framework correctly captures the basic mechanism at the heart of price formation, namely the average impact of metaorders. We argue that our results support the ''Order-Driven'' theory of excess volatility, and are at odds with the idea that a ''Fundamental'' component accounts for a large share of the volatility of financial markets.</description>

      <title>Exploring Microstructural Dynamics in Cryptocurrency Limit Order Books: Better Inputs Matter More Than Stacking Another Hidden Layer</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.05764</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.05764v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Cryptocurrency price dynamics are driven largely by microstructural supply demand imbalances in the limit order book (LOB), yet the highly noisy nature of LOB data complicates the signal extraction process. Prior research has demonstrated that deep-learning architectures can yield promising predictive performance on pre-processed equity and futures LOB data, but they often treat model complexity as an unqualified virtue. In this paper, we aim to examine whether adding extra hidden layers or parameters to "blackbox ish" neural networks genuinely enhances short term price forecasting, or if gains are primarily attributable to data preprocessing and feature engineering. We benchmark a spectrum of models from interpretable baselines, logistic regression, XGBoost to deep architectures (DeepLOB, Conv1D+LSTM) on BTC/USDT LOB snapshots sampled at 100 ms to multi second intervals using publicly available Bybit data. We introduce two data filtering pipelines (Kalman, Savitzky Golay) and evaluate both binary (up/down) and ternary (up/flat/down) labeling schemes. Our analysis compares models on out of sample accuracy, latency, and robustness to noise. Results reveal that, with data preprocessing and hyperparameter tuning, simpler models can match and even exceed the performance of more complex networks, offering faster inference and greater interpretability.</description>
