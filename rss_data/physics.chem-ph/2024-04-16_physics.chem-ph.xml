      <title>Calculation of DC Stark Resonances for the Ammonia Molecule</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.10000</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.10000v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A model potential previously developed for the ammonia molecule is treated in a single-center partial-wave approximation in analogy with a self-consistent field method developed by Moccia. The latter was used in a number of collision studies. The model potential is used to calculate dc Stark resonance parameters, i.e., resonance positions and shifts within a single-center partial wave expansion, using the exterior complex scaling method for the radial coordinate. Three molecular valence orbitals are investigated for fields along the three Cartesian coordinates, i.e., along the molecular axis and in two perpendicular directions. The work extends previous work on the planar-geometry water molecule for which non-monotonic shifts were observed. We find such non-monotonic shifts for fields along the molecular axis. For perpendicular fields we report the splitting of the 1e orbitals into a fast- and a slow-ionizing orbital.</description>

      <title>Lightweight Geometric Deep Learning for Molecular Modelling in Catalyst Discovery</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.10003</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.10003v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: New technology for energy storage is necessary for the large-scale adoption of renewable energy sources like wind and solar. The ability to discover suitable catalysts is crucial for making energy storage more cost-effective and scalable. The Open Catalyst Project aims to apply advances in graph neural networks (GNNs) to accelerate progress in catalyst discovery, replacing Density Functional Theory-based (DFT) approaches that are computationally burdensome. Current approaches involve scaling GNNs to over 1 billion parameters, pushing the problem out of reach for a vast majority of machine learning practitioner around the world. This study aims to evaluate the performance and insights gained from using more lightweight approaches for this task that are more approachable for smaller teams to encourage participation from individuals from diverse backgrounds. By implementing robust design patterns like geometric and symmetric message passing, we were able to train a GNN model that reached a MAE of 0.0748 in predicting the per-atom forces of adsorbate-surface interactions, rivaling established model architectures like SchNet and DimeNet++ while using only a fraction of trainable parameters.</description>

      <title>Kinematics Modeling of Peroxy Free Radicals: A Deep Reinforcement Learning Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.10010</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.10010v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Tropospheric ozone, known as a concerning air pollutant, has been associated with health issues including asthma, bronchitis, and impaired lung function. The rates at which peroxy radicals react with NO play a critical role in the overall formation and depletion of tropospheric ozone. However, obtaining comprehensive kinetic data for these reactions remains challenging. Traditional approaches to determine rate constants are costly and technically intricate. Fortunately, the emergence of machine learning-based models offers a less resource and time-intensive alternative for acquiring kinetics information. In this study, we leveraged deep reinforcement learning to predict ranges of rate constants (\textit{k}) with exceptional accuracy, achieving a testing set accuracy of 100%. To analyze reactivity trends based on the molecular structure of peroxy radicals, we employed 51 global descriptors as input parameters. These descriptors were derived from optimized minimum energy geometries of peroxy radicals using the quantum composite G3B3 method. Through the application of Integrated Gradients (IGs), we gained valuable insights into the significance of the various descriptors in relation to reaction rates. We successfully validated and contextualized our findings by conducting cross-comparisons with established trends in the existing literature. These results establish a solid foundation for pioneering advancements in chemistry, where computer analysis serves as an inspirational source driving innovation.</description>

      <title>Energy Transfer Mechanism Under Incoherent Light Excitation in noisy Environments: Memory Effects in Efficiency Control</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.10016</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.10016v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Fluctuations in the energy gap and coupling constants in and between chromophores can play important role in the absorption and energy transfer across a collection of two level systems. In a noisy environment, fluctuations can control efficiency of energy transfer through several factors, including quantum coherence. Several recent studies have investigated the impact of light-induced stationary quantum coherence on the efficiency of transferring optical excitation to a designated "trap" state, crucial for subsequent reactions such as those in photosynthesis. However, these studies have typically employed either a Markovian, or a perturbative approximation for the environment induced fluctuations. In this study, we depart from these approaches to incorporate memory effects by using Kubo's quantum stochastic Liouville equation (QSLE). We introduce the effects of the decay of excitation (to the ground state) and the desired trapping that provides the direction of the motion of the excitation. In the presence of light-induced pumping, we establish a relation between the mean survival time, efficiency, and the correlation decay time of the bath-induced fluctuations. We find a decrease in the steady state coherence during the transition from the non-Markovian regime (characterized by small values of fluctuation strength V and inverse of bath correlation time b) to the Markovian limit (where V and b are both large), resulting in a decrease in efficiency. We recover a connection between transfer flux and the imaginary part of coherences in both equilibrium and excited bath states, in both correlated and We uncover a non-monotonic dependence of efficiency on site energy heterogeneity for both correlated and uncorrelated bath models.</description>

      <title>Capturing the Macroscopic Behaviour of Molecular Dynamics with Membership Functions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.10523</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.10523v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Markov processes serve as foundational models in many scientific disciplines, such as molecular dynamics, and their simulation forms a common basis for analysis. While simulations produce useful trajectories, obtaining macroscopic information directly from microstate data presents significant challenges. This paper addresses this gap by introducing the concept of membership functions being the macrostates themselves. We derive equations for the holding times of these macrostates and demonstrate their consistency with the classical definition. Furthermore, we discuss the application of the ISOKANN method for learning these quantities from simulation data. In addition, we present a novel method for extracting transition paths based on the ISOKANN results and demonstrate its efficacy by applying it to simulations of the mu-opioid receptor. With this approach we provide a new perspective on analyzing the macroscopic behaviour of Markov systems.</description>

      <title>Extending the Tavis-Cummings model for molecular ensembles -- Exploring the effects of dipole self energies and static dipole moments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.10680</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.10680v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Strong coupling of organic molecules to the vacuum field of a nanoscale cavity can be used to modify their chemical and physical properties. We extend the Tavis-Cummings model for molecular ensembles and show that the often neglected interaction terms arising from the static dipole moment and the dipole self-energy are essential for a correct description of the light-matter interaction in polaritonic chemistry. On the basis of a full quantum description, we simulate the excited-state dynamics and spectroscopy of MgH$^+$ molecules resonantly coupled to an optical cavity. We show that the inclusion of static dipole moments and the dipole self-energy is necessary to obtain a consistent model. We construct an efficient two-level system approach that reproduces the main features of the real molecular system and may be used to simulate larger molecular ensembles.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.10022</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.10022v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: COBRAPRO is a new open-source physics-based battery modeling software with the capability to conduct closed-loop parameter optimization using experimental data. Physics-based battery models require systematic parameter calibration to accurately predict battery behavior across different usage scenarios. While parameter calibration is essential to predict the dynamic behavior of batteries, many existing open-source DFN tools lack parameter identification features. COBRAPRO addresses this gap by featuring an embedded parameter optimization routines that optimizes the model parameters by minimizing the error between the simulated and experimentally observed current-voltage data. With COBRAPRO, users can non-invasively identify unknown battery model parameters for any given battery chemistry.</description>

      <title>Picturing the Gap Between the Performance and US-DOE's Hydrogen Storage Target: A Data-Driven Model for MgH2 Dehydrogenation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.10249</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.10249v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Developing solid-state hydrogen storage materials is as pressing as ever, which requires a comprehensive understanding of the dehydrogenation chemistry of a solid-state hydride. Transition state search and kinetics calculations are essential to understanding and designing high-performance solid-state hydrogen storage materials by filling in the knowledge gap that current experimental techniques cannot measure. However, the ab initio analysis of these processes is computationally expensive and time-consuming. Searching for descriptors to accurately predict the energy barrier is urgently needed, to accelerate the prediction of hydrogen storage material properties and identify the opportunities and challenges in this field. Herein, we develop a data-driven model to describe and predict the dehydrogenation barriers of a typical solid-state hydrogen storage material, magnesium hydride (MgH2), based on the combination of the crystal Hamilton population orbital of Mg-H bond and the distance between atomic hydrogen. By deriving the distance energy ratio, this model elucidates the key chemistry of the reaction kinetics. All the parameters in this model can be directly calculated with significantly less computational cost than conventional transition state search, so that the dehydrogenation performance of hydrogen storage materials can be predicted efficiently. Finally, we found that this model leads to excellent agreement with typical experimental measurements reported to date and provides clear design guidelines on how to propel the performance of MgH2 closer to the target set by the United States Department of Energy (US-DOE).</description>

      <title>Millisecond-resolved infrared spectroscopy study of polymer brush swelling dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.10447</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.10447v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present the study of millisecond-resolved polymer brush swelling dynamics using infrared spectroscopy with a custom-built quantum cascade laser-based infrared spectrometer at a 1 kHz sampling rate after averaging. By cycling the humidity of the environment of the polymer brush, we are able to measure the swelling dynamics sequentially at different wavenumbers. The high sampling rate provides us with information on the reconformation of the brush at a higher temporal resolution than previously reported. Using spectroscopic ellipsometry, we study the brush swelling dynamics as a reference experiment and to correct artefacts of the infrared measurement approach. This technique informs on the changes in the brush thickness and refractive index. Our results indicate that the swelling dynamics of the polymer brush are poorly described by Fickian diffusion and the Berens-Hopfenberg formalism, pointing toward more complicated underlying transport.</description>

      <title>Quantum Simulation of Open Quantum Dynamics via Non-Markovian Quantum State Diffusion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.10655</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.10655v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Quantum simulation of non-Markovian open quantum dynamics is essential but challenging for standard quantum computers due to their non-Hermitian nature, leading to non-unitary evolution, and the limitations of available quantum resources. Here we introduce a hybrid quantum-classical algorithm designed for simulating dissipative dynamics in system with non-Markovian environment. Our approach includes formulating a non-Markovian Stochastic Schr\"odinger equation with complex frequency modes (cNMSSE) where the non-Markovianity is characterized by the mode excitation. Following this, we utilize variational quantum simulation to capture the non-unitary evolution within the cNMSSE framework, leading to a substantial reduction in qubit requirements. To demonstrate our approach, we investigated the spin-boson model and dynamic quantum phase transitions (DQPT) within transverse field Ising model (TFIM). Significantly, our findings reveal the enhanced DQPT in TFIM due to non-Markovian behavior.</description>

      <title>Interpolation and differentiation of alchemical degrees of freedom in machine learning interatomic potentials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.10746</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.10746v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Machine learning interatomic potentials (MLIPs) have become a workhorse of modern atomistic simulations, and recently published universal MLIPs, pre-trained on large datasets, have demonstrated remarkable accuracy and generalizability. However, the computational cost of MLIPs limits their applicability to chemically disordered systems requiring large simulation cells or to sample-intensive statistical methods. Here, we report the use of continuous and differentiable alchemical degrees of freedom in atomistic materials simulations, exploiting the fact that graph neural network MLIPs represent discrete elements as real-valued tensors. The proposed method introduces alchemical atoms with corresponding weights into the input graph, alongside modifications to the message-passing and readout mechanisms of MLIPs, and allows smooth interpolation between the compositional states of materials. The end-to-end differentiability of MLIPs enables efficient calculation of the gradient of energy with respect to the compositional weights. Leveraging these gradients, we propose methodologies for optimizing the composition of solid solutions towards target macroscopic properties and conducting alchemical free energy simulations to quantify the free energy of vacancy formation and composition changes. The approach offers an avenue for extending the capabilities of universal MLIPs in the modeling of compositional disorder and characterizing the phase stabilities of complex materials systems.</description>

Abstract: Extracting consistent statistics between relevant free-energy minima of a molecular system is essential for physics, chemistry and biology. Molecular dynamics (MD) simulations can aid in this task but are computationally expensive, especially for systems that require quantum accuracy. To overcome this challenge, we develop an approach combining enhanced sampling with deep generative models and active learning of a machine learning potential (MLP). We introduce an adaptive Markov chain Monte Carlo framework that enables the training of one Normalizing Flow (NF) and one MLP per state, achieving rapid convergence towards the Boltzmann distribution. Leveraging the trained NF and MLP models, we compute thermodynamic observables such as free-energy differences or optical spectra. We apply this method to study the isomerization of an ultrasmall silver nanocluster, belonging to a set of systems with diverse applications in the fields of medicine and catalysis.</description>

      <title>Unveiling interatomic distances influencing the reaction coordinates in alanine dipeptide isomerization: An explainable deep learning approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.08448</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.08448v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The present work shows that the free energy landscape associated with alanine dipeptide isomerization can be effectively represented by specific interatomic distances without explicit reference to dihedral angles. Conventionally, two stable states of alanine dipeptide in vacuum, i.e., C$7_{\mathrm{eq}}$ ($\beta$-sheet structure) and C$7_{\mathrm{ax}}$ (left handed $\alpha$-helix structure), have been primarily characterized using the main chain dihedral angles, $\varphi$ (C-N-C$_\alpha$-C) and $\psi$ (N-C$_\alpha$-C-N). However, our recent deep learning combined with "Explainable AI" (XAI) framework has shown that the transition state can be adequately captured by a free energy landscape using $\varphi$ and $\theta$ (O-C-N-C$_\alpha$) [T. Kikutsuji, et al. J. Chem. Phys. 156, 154108 (2022)]. In perspective of extending these insights to other collective variables, a more detailed characterization of transition state is required. In this work, we employ the interatomic distances and bond angles as input variables for deep learning, rather than the conventional and more elaborate dihedral angles. Our approach utilizes deep learning to investigate whether changes in the main chain dihedral angle can be expressed in terms of interatomic distances and bond angles. Furthermore, by incorporating XAI into our predictive analysis, we quantified the importance of each input variable and succeeded in clarifying the specific interatomic distance that affects the transition state. The results indicate that constructing a free energy landscape based on using the identified interatomic distance can clearly distinguish between the two stable states and provide a comprehensive explanation for the energy barrier crossing.</description>

      <title>Two liquid states of distinguishable helium-4: the existence of another non-superfluid frozen by heating</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.07716</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.07716v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We demonstrate that there can exist two liquid states in distinguishable helium-4 ($^4$He) obeying Boltzmann statistics. This is an indication of quantum liquid polyamorphism induced by nuclear quantum effect. For 0.08-3.3 K and 1-500 bar, we extensively conducted the isothermal-isobaric path integral centroid molecular dynamics simulations to explore not only possible states and state diagram but the state characteristics. The distinguishable $^4$He below 25 bar does not freeze down to 0.08 K even though it includes no Bosonic exchange effect and therefore no Bose condensation. One liquid state, low quantum-dispersion liquid (LQDL), is nearly identical to normal liquid He-I of real $^4$He. The other is high quantum-dispersion liquid (HQDL) consisting of atoms with longer quantum wavelength. This is another non-superfluid existing below 0.5 K or the temperatures of LQDL. The HQDL is also a low-entropy and fragile liquid to exhibit, unlike conventional liquids, rather gas-like relaxation of velocity autocorrelation function, while there the atoms diffuse without noticeable contribution from quantum tunneling. The LQDL-HQDL transition is not a thermodynamic phase transition but a continuous crossover accompanied by the change of the expansion factor of quantum wavelength. Freezing of HQDL into the low quantum-dispersion amorphous solid occurs by heating from 0.2 to 0.3 K at 40-50 bar, while this $P$-$T$ condition coincides with the Kim-Chan normal-supersolid phase boundary of real $^4$He. It is suggested that HQDL has relevance to the non-superfluid states of confined subnano-scale $^4$He systems which are semi-Boltzmann-like owing to the suppression of Bosonic correlation.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.08493v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The success behind many pseudopotential methods such as Projected Augmented Waves (PAW) and Phillips-Kleinman pseudopotential methods is that these methods are all electron methods in disguise. For the Phillips Kleinman and PAW methods we show that there is an all electron formulation. In the all electron formulation there are regular low wavevector wavefunctions and several, specially chosen, high wavevector wavefunctions that are specialized to the atomic environment. Using this as inspiration here we propose a new, PAW pseudopotential inspired, basis set method for small molecules, where we use the recently introduced LO or lo (Localized orbitals) basis set is paired with a Gaussian basis for a hybrid basis for small molecules.</description>

Abstract: The advent of Neural-network Quantum States (NQS) has significantly advanced wave function ansatz research, sparking a resurgence in orbital space variational Monte Carlo (VMC) exploration. This work introduces three algorithmic enhancements to reduce computational demands of VMC optimization using NQS: an adaptive learning rate algorithm, constrained optimization, and block optimization. We evaluate the refined algorithm on complex multireference bond stretches of $\rm H_2O$ and $\rm N_2$ within the cc-pVDZ basis set and calculate the ground-state energy of the strongly correlated chromium dimer ($\rm Cr_2$) in the Ahlrichs SV basis set. Our results achieve superior accuracy compared to coupled cluster theory at a relatively modest CPU cost. This work demonstrates how to enhance optimization efficiency and robustness using these strategies, opening a new path to optimize large-scale Restricted Boltzmann Machine (RBM)-based NQS more effectively and marking a substantial advancement in NQS's practical quantum chemistry applications.</description>

      <title>More Quantum Chemistry with Fewer Qubits</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.16873</link>

Abstract: Quantum computation is one of the most promising new paradigms for the simulation of physical systems composed of electrons and atomic nuclei, with applications in chemistry, solid-state physics, materials science, or molecular biology. This requires a truncated representation of the electronic structure Hamiltonian using a finite number of orbitals. While it is, in principle, obvious how to improve on the representation by including more orbitals, this is usually unfeasible in practice (e.g., because of the limited number of qubits available) and severely compromises the accuracy of the obtained results. Here, we propose a quantum algorithm that improves on the representation of the physical problem by virtue of second-order perturbation theory. In particular, our quantum algorithm evaluates the second-order energy correction through a series of time-evolution steps under the unperturbed Hamiltonian. An important application is to go beyond the active-space approximation, allowing to include corrections of virtual orbitals, known as multireference perturbation theory. Here, we exploit that the unperturbed Hamiltonian is diagonal for virtual orbitals and show that the number of qubits is independent of the number of virtual orbitals. This gives rise to more accurate energy estimates without increasing the number of qubits. Moreover, we demonstrate numerically for realistic chemical systems that the overall runtime of our method has highly favourable scaling in the number of virtual orbitals compared to previous work. The numerical calculations confirm the necessity of the multireference perturbation theory energy corrections to reach accurate ground state energy estimates. Our perturbation theory quantum algorithm can also be applied to Symmetry-Adapted Perturbation Theory. As such, we reduce the quantum hardware requirements for quantum chemistry by leveraging perturbation theory.</description>
