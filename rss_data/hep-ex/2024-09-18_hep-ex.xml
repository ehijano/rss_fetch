      <title>Global Extraction of the $\rm^{12}C$ Nuclear Electromagnetic Response Functions (${\cal R}_L$ and ${\cal R}_T$) and Comparisons to Nuclear Theory and Neutrino/Electron Monte Carlo Generators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.10637</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.10637v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We have performed a global extraction of the ${\rm ^{12}C}$ longitudinal (${\cal R}_L$) and transverse (${\cal R}_T$) nuclear electromagnetic response functions from an analysis of all available electron scattering data on carbon. The response functions are extracted for energy transfer $\nu$, spanning the nuclear excitation, quasielastic (QE), resonance and inelastic continuum over a large range of the square of the four-momentum transfer ($Q^2$), for fixed values of $Q^2$ and for fixed values of 3-momentum transfer $\bf q$. The data sample consists of approximately 10,000 differential electron scattering and photo-absorption-cross section measurement points for ${\rm ^{12}C}$. In addition, we perform a universal fit to all ${\rm ^{12}C}$ electron scattering data which also provides parmeterizations of ${\cal R}_L$ and ${\cal R}_T$ over a larger kinematic range. Since the extracted response functions and the universal fit cover a large range of $Q^2$ and $\nu$, they can be readily used for comparison to theoretical predictions as well as validating and tuning Monte Carlo generators for electron and neutrino scattering experiments. In this paper we focus on the nuclear excitation, QE, and $\Delta$(1232) regions and compare the measurements to predictions of the following theoretical approaches: ``Energy Dependent-Relativistic Mean Field'' (ED-RMF), ``Green's Function Monte Carlo'' (GFMC), "Short Time Approximation Quantum Monte Carlo" (STA-QMC), "Correlated Fermi Gas" (CFG), as well as the {\textsc{NuWro}}, \ {{\sc{achilles}}}~ and {{\sc{genie}}}~generators. We find that among all the models ED-RMF provides the best description of both the QE and {\it nuclear excitations} response functions over the largest kinematic range $0.01\le Q^2 \le 1.25$ GeV$^2$. The ED-RMF formalism has the added benefit that it should be directly applicable to the same kinematic regions for neutrino scattering.</description>

      <title>Search for light long-lived particles decaying to displaced jets in proton-proton collisions at $\sqrt{s}$ = 13.6 TeV</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.10806</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.10806v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A search for light long-lived particles decaying to displaced jets is presented, using a data sample of proton-proton collisions at a center-of-mass energy of 13.6 TeV, corresponding to an integrated luminosity of 34.7 fb$^{-1}$, collected with the CMS detector at the CERN LHC in 2022. Novel trigger, reconstruction, and machine-learning techniques were developed for and employed in this search. After all selections, the observations are consistent with the background predictions. Limits are presented on the branching fraction of the Higgs boson to long-lived particles that subsequently decay to quark pairs or tau lepton pairs. An improvement by up to a factor of 10 is achieved over previous limits for models with long-lived particle masses smaller than 60 GeV and proper decay lengths smaller than 1 m. The first constraints are placed on the fraternal twin Higgs and folded supersymmetry models, where the lower bounds on the top quark partner mass reach up to 350 GeV for the fraternal twin Higgs model and 250 GeV for the folded supersymmetry model.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.10879v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The charged particles are tracked in the high energy physics detectors to provide the information of their properties. One of the tracking detector is straw tube detector that has been used by many experiments. The aim of this paper is to study the different properties of particles using different gas composition. The gas mixture that shows maximum transition radiation among xenon gas mixtures was found to be $XeHeCH_{4}$ :: 30:55:15. The gas mixture that has shown maximum primary ionization has been $XeCO_{2}O_{2}$ :: 70:27:3. The simulated detector has been also used for the identification of different particles.</description>

      <title>Evaluating Modifications to Classifiers for Identification of Higgs Bosons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.10902</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.10902v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Higgs boson, discovered back in 2012 through collision data at the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) by ATLAS and CMS experiments, marked a significant inflection point in High Energy Physics (HEP). Today, it's crucial to precisely measure Higgs production processes with LHC experiments in order to gain insights into the universe and find any invisible physics. To analyze the vast data that LHC experiments generate, classical machine learning has become an invaluable tool. However, classical classifiers often struggle with detecting higgs production processes, leading to incorrect labeling of Higgs Bosons. This paper aims to tackle this classification problem by investigating the use of quantum machine learning (QML).</description>

      <title>Measurements of polarization and spin correlation and observation of entanglement in top quark pairs using lepton+jets events from proton-proton collisions at $\sqrt{s}$ = 13 TeV</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.11067</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.11067v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Measurements of the polarization and spin correlation in top quark pairs ($\mathrm{t\bar{t}}$) are presented using events with a single electron or muon and jets in the final state. The measurements are based on proton-proton collision data from the LHC at $\sqrt{s}$ = 13 TeV collected by the CMS experiment, corresponding to an integrated luminosity of 138 fb$^{-1}$. All coefficients of the polarization vectors and the spin correlation matrix are extracted simultaneously by performing a binned likelihood fit to the data. The measurement is performed inclusively and in bins of additional observables, such as the mass of the $\mathrm{t\bar{t}}$ system and the top quark scattering angle in the $\mathrm{t\bar{t}}$ rest frame. The measured polarization and spin correlation are in agreement with the standard model. From the measured spin correlation, conclusions on the $\mathrm{t\bar{t}}$ spin entanglement are drawn by applying the Peres-Horodecki criterion. The standard model predicts entangled spins for $\mathrm{t\bar{t}}$ states at the production threshold and at high masses of the $\mathrm{t\bar{t}}$ system. Entanglement is observed for the first time in events at high $\mathrm{t\bar{t}}$ mass, where a large fraction of the $\mathrm{t\bar{t}}$ decays are space-like separated, with an expected and observed significance of above 5 standard deviations.</description>

      <title>Gamma/hadron discrimination through the analysis of the shower footprint at low energies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.11093</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.11093v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Gamma/hadron discrimination in ground-based gamma-ray observatories at the GeV energy range is challenging as traditional muon-based methods become less effective at lower energies. This work explores a novel gamma/hadron discrimination method for Extensive Air Shower arrays that analyzes the shower signal footprint patterns using advanced Vision Transformer (ViT) models. The robustness of this method against noise, including atmospheric muons and low-energy proton showers, demonstrates its potential for application in future gamma-ray observatories.</description>

      <title>Measurement of top-quark pair production in association with charm quarks in proton-proton collisions at $\sqrt{s}=13$ TeV with the ATLAS detector</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.11305</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.11305v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Inclusive cross-sections for top-quark pair production in association with charm quarks are measured with proton-proton collision data at a center-of-mass energy of 13 TeV corresponding to an integrated luminosity of 140 fb$^{-1}$, collected with the ATLAS experiment at the LHC between 2015 and 2018. The measurements are performed by requiring one or two charged leptons (electrons and muons), two $b$-tagged jets, and at least one additional jet in the final state. A custom flavor-tagging algorithm is employed for the simultaneous identification of $b$-jets and $c$-jets. In a fiducial phase space that replicates the acceptance of the ATLAS detector, the cross-sections for $t\bar{t}+ {\geq} 2c$ and $t\bar{t}+1c$ production are measured to be $1.28^{+0.27}_{-0.24}\;\text{pb}$ and $6.4^{+1.0}_{-0.9}\;\text{pb}$, respectively. The measurements are primarily limited by uncertainties in the modeling of inclusive $t\bar{t}$ and $t\bar{t}+b\bar{b}$ production, in the calibration of the flavor-tagging algorithm, and by data statistics. Cross-section predictions from various $t\bar{t}$ simulations are largely consistent with the measured cross-section values, though all underpredict the observed values by 0.5 to 2.0 standard deviations. In a phase-space volume without requirements on the $t\bar{t}$ decay products and the jet multiplicity, the cross-section ratios of $t\bar{t}+ {\geq} 2c$ and $t\bar{t}+1c$ to total $t\bar{t}+\text{jets}$ production are determined to be $(1.23 \pm 0.25) \%$ and $(8.8 \pm 1.3) \%$.</description>

      <title>Feasibility study of True Muonium discovery with CERN-SPS H4 positron beam</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.11342</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.11342v2 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: True muonium ($\mu^+\mu^-$) is one of the heaviest and smallest electromagnetic bound states not containing hadrons, and has never been observed so far. In this work it is shown that the spin-1 TM state (ortho-TM) can be observed at a discovery level of significance in three months at the CERN SPS North-Area H4A beam line, using 43.7 GeV secondary positrons. In this way, by impinging the positrons on multiple thin low-Z targets, ortho-TM, which decays predominantly to $e^+e^-$, can be produced from $e^+e^- \to TM$ interactions on resonance ($\sqrt{s} \sim 2m_{\mu}$).</description>

      <title>Nuclear-level effective theory of $\mu\rightarrow e$ conversion: Inelastic process</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.10581</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.10581v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Mu2e and COMET will search for electrons produced via the neutrinoless conversion of stopped muons bound in 1s atomic orbits of $^{27}$Al, improving existing limits on charged lepton flavor violation (CLFV) by roughly four orders of magnitude. Conventionally, $\mu\rightarrow e$ conversion experiments are optimized to detect electrons originating from transitions where the nucleus remains in the ground state, thereby maximizing the energy of the outgoing electron. Clearly, detection of a positive signal in forthcoming experiments would stimulate additional work $-$ including subsequent conversion experiments using complementary nuclear targets $-$ to further constrain the new physics responsible for CLFV. Here we argue that additional information can be extracted without the need for additional experiments, by considering inelastic conversion in $^{27}$Al. Transitions to low-lying nuclear excited states can modify the near-endpoint spectrum of conversion electrons, with the ratio of the elastic and inelastic responses being sensitive to the underlying CLFV operator. We extend the nuclear effective theory of $\mu\rightarrow e$ conversion to the inelastic case, which adds five new response functions to the six that arise for the elastic process. We evaluate these nuclear response functions in $^{27}$Al and calculate the resulting conversion-electron signal, taking into account the resolution anticipated in Mu2e/COMET. We find that $^{27}$Al is an excellent target choice from the perspective of the new information that can be obtained from inelastic $\mu \rightarrow e$ conversion.</description>

      <title>Status of tension between NO$\nu$A and T2K after Neutrino 2024 and possible role of non-standard neutrino interactions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.10599</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.10599v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In a previous work we have shown that the data presented by the two long-baseline accelerator experiments NO$\nu$A and T2K at the Neutrino 2020 conference displayed a tension, and that it could be alleviated by non-standard neutrino interactions (NSI) of the flavor changing type involving the $e-\mu$ or the $e-\tau$ sectors with couplings $|\varepsilon_{e\mu}| \sim |\varepsilon_{e\tau}|\sim 0.1$. As a consequence a hint in favor of NSI emerged. In the present paper we reassess the issue in light of the new data released by the two experiments at the Neutrino 2024 conference. We find that the tension in the determination of the standard CP-phase $\delta_{\mathrm {CP}}$ extracted by the two experiments in the normal neutrino mass ordering persists and has a statistical significance of $\sim2\sigma$. Concerning the NSI, we find that including their effects in the fit, the two values of $\delta_{\mathrm {CP}}$ preferred by NO$\nu$A and T2K return in very good agreement. The current statistical significance of the hint of non zero NSI is $\sim1.8\sigma$. Further experimental data are needed in order to settle the issue.</description>

      <title>The higher $\chi_{cJ}(nP)$, $h_c(nP)$ states and the role of the gluon-exchange potential</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.10761</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.10761v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The masses, the fine-structure splitting, and two-photon decay widths of the higher $nP$-charmonium states are calculated in the relativistic string model, reduced to the spinless Salpeter equation, where the static potential has no fitting parameters and the $c-$quark mass has the physical value. The resulting masses of $h_c(3P)$, $\chi_{c1}(3P)$, $\chi_{c0}(4P)$, $\chi_{c0}(5P)$, $\chi_{c1}(5P)$ are obtained in a good agreement with the experimental masses of the LHCb resonances: $h_c(4300)$, $\chi_{c1}(4274)$, $X(4500)$, $X(4700)$, $X(4685)$. To test sensitivity of results to a chosen gluon-exchange (GE) potential, three types of $V_{ge}(r)$ are considered. In first case the non-screened GE potential with large vector coupling at asymptotic, $\alpha_{\rm V}(\rm asym.)=0.635$, and the $c$-quark mass $m_c=1.430$ GeV are taken; in second case a screened $V_{ge}$ and $m_c=1.385$ are investigated, and in third case the GE potential is totally suppressed, $V_{ge}=0$, and $m_c=1.32$ GeV. The agreement with experiment is reached only if the same (universal) flattened confining potential, introduced in the analysis of the radial Regge trajectories of light mesons, is used. The unobserved $6P,0^+$ resonance with the mass $\cong 4.81$ GeV, near $J/\psi\phi(1680)$ threshold, is predicted. Our analysis shows that the screening of the GE potential is possible but weakly affects the physical results obtained. The calculated two-photon decay widths weakly differ in the three cases but may become an important factor, which distinguishes $c\bar c$ and four-quark states.</description>

      <title>Investigating baryon-strangeness and charge-strangeness correlations in Pb$-$Pb collisions at $\sqrt{s_\mathrm{NN}}$ = 5.02 TeV with ALICE</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.10939</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.10939v2 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: To explore the quantum chromodynamics (QCD) phase transitions and the properties of quark$-$gluon plasma, the ALICE collaboration at CERN has conducted an extensive analysis of the correlations among net-conserved quantities, namely net-baryon, net-charge, and net-strangeness. These correlations are essential for understanding the QCD phase structure, as they are directly connected to ratios of thermodynamic susceptibilities calculated in lattice QCD. This analysis focuses on the correlations between net-kaon and net-proton, as well as net-kaon and net-charge, in Pb$-$Pb collisions at $\sqrt{s_\mathrm{NN}} = 5.02$ TeV, where net-proton and net-kaon serve as effective proxies for net-baryon and net-strangeness, respectively. A comparison with theoretical predictions from the Thermal-FIST model sheds light on the role of resonance decays and the effects of charge conservation laws in shaping these correlations. Furthermore, the measurements show sensitivity to the correlation volume in which these conservation laws are applied, underscoring the importance of modeling the underlying dynamics to fully understand the experimental results on fluctuations and correlations in heavy-ion collisions.</description>

      <title>Measurement of photonuclear jet production in ultra-peripheral Pb+Pb collisions at $\sqrt{s_{\text{NN}}} = 5.02$ TeV with the ATLAS detector</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.11060</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.11060v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In ultra-relativistic heavy ion collisions, the photoproduction of high-energy jets can be used to constrain nuclear parton distributions for a wide range of parton kinematics. Results are presented from a measurement of photonuclear production of dijet and multi-jet final states in ultra-peripheral \mbox{Pb+Pb} collisions at $\sqrt{s_{\text{NN}}} = 5.02$ TeV using a data set recorded in 2018 with the ATLAS detector at the LHC and corresponding to an integrated luminosity of 1.72 $\text{nb}^{-1}$. Photonuclear final states are selected by requiring a rapidity gap in the photon direction; this selects events where one of the outgoing nuclei remains intact. Jets are reconstructed using the anti-$k_\text{t}$ algorithm with radius parameter, $R = 0.4$. Triple-differential cross-sections, unfolded for detector response, are measured and presented using two sets of kinematic variables. The first set consists of the total transverse momentum ($H_\text{T}$), rapidity, and mass of the jet system. The second set uses $H_\text{T}$ and particle-level nuclear and photon parton momentum fractions, $x_\text{A}$ and $z_{\gamma}$, respectively. The results are compared with leading-order perturbative QCD calculations of photonuclear jet production cross-sections, demonstrating their potential to provide a strong new constraint on nuclear parton distributions.</description>

      <title>Hidden strangeness in meson weak decays to baryon pair</title>

Abstract: We study the weak decays of heavy mesons into baryon pairs, focusing on channels dominated by annihilation-type diagrams, where short-distance (SD) contributions are highly suppressed. We focus on decays with small energy release to further ensure the dominance of long-distance (LD) physics. The final state interactions of the triangular diagrams do not require a cutoff, making our numerical results reliable. Moreover, the hidden strangeness in the intermediate state naturally avoids chiral suppression. The branching fractions are predicted to be ${\cal B}(D_s^+ \to p\overline{n}) = (1.43 \pm 0.10 ) \times 10^{-3}$ and ${\cal B} (B_s^0 \to \Lambda_c^+ \overline{\Lambda}_c^-) &gt; 4.7 \times 10^{-5}$, respectively. The former is in agreement with the experimental data of $(1.22 \pm 0.11)\times 10^{-3}$, while the latter suggests that a measurement is now feasible. Using the experimental upper bound of ${\cal B} (B_s^0 \to \Lambda_c^+ \overline{\Lambda}_c^-) &lt; 8 \times 10^{-5}$, we set a constraint on the coupling constant $g_{D^+ \Lambda_c^+ n} &lt; 7.5$. The CP symmetry suggests that $B_{sH/L}^0 \to \Lambda_c^+ \overline{\Lambda}_c^-$ is dominated by $P/S$ wave. This selection rule distinguishes the SD and LD contributions, allowing experiments to further test our understanding in the nonperturbative region. We propose future measurements on $B^0 \to \Xi_c^+ \overline{\Xi}_c^-$ to test final state interaction mechanisms, predicting significant $SU(3)_F$ breaking effects with ${\cal B}(B^0 \to \Xi_c^+ \overline{\Xi}_c^-) / {\cal B} (B_s^0 \to \Lambda_c^+ \overline{\Lambda}_c^-) = 1.4\%$, contrary to the naive estimate of $5.3\%$.</description>

      <title>Thermodynamics of a rotating hadron resonance gas with van der Waals interaction</title>

      <description>arXiv:2304.05190v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Studying the thermodynamics of the systems produced in ultra-relativistic heavy-ion collisions is crucial in understanding the QCD phase diagram. Recently, a new avenue has opened regarding the implications of large initial angular momentum and subsequent vorticity in the medium evolution in high-energy collisions. This adds a new type of chemical potential into the partonic and hadronic systems, called the rotational chemical potential. We study the thermodynamics of an interacting hadronic matter under rotation, formed in an ultra-relativistic collision. We introduce attractive and repulsive interactions through the van der Waals equation of state. Thermodynamic properties like the pressure ($P$), energy density ($\varepsilon$), entropy density ($s$), trace anomaly ($(\varepsilon - 3P)/T^{4}$), specific heat ($c_{\rm v}$) and squared speed of sound ($c_{\rm s}^{2}$) are studied as functions of temperature ($T$) for zero and finite rotation chemical potential. The conserved charge fluctuations, which can be quantified by their respective susceptibilities, are also studied. The rotational (spin) density corresponding to the rotational chemical potential is explored. In addition, we explore the possible liquid-gas phase transition in the hadron gas with van der Waals interaction in the $T$ -- $\omega$ phase space.</description>

      <title>Impact of Medium Anisotropy on Quarkonium Dissociation and Regeneration</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.18909</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.18909v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Quarkonium production in ultra-relativistic collisions plays a crucial role in probing the existence of hot QCD matter. This study explores quarkonia states dissociation and regeneration in the hot QCD medium while considering momentum anisotropy. The net quarkonia decay width ($\Gamma_{D}$) arises from two essential processes: collisional damping and gluonic dissociation. The quarkonia regeneration includes the transition from octet to singlet states within the anisotropic medium. Our study utilizes a medium-modified potential that incorporates anisotropy via particle distribution functions. This modified potential gives rise to collisional damping for quarkonia due to the surrounding medium, as well as the transition of quarkonia from singlet to octet states due to interactions with gluons. Furthermore, we employ the detailed balance approach to investigate the regeneration of quarkonia within this medium. Our comprehensive analysis spans various temperature settings, transverse momentum values, and anisotropic strengths. Notably, we find that, in addition to medium temperatures and heavy quark transverse momentum, anisotropy significantly influences the dissociation and regeneration of various quarkonia states.</description>

      <title>Exclusive $J/\psi$, $\psi(2s)$, and $e^{+}e^{-}$ pair production in Au$+$Au ultra-peripheral collisions at RHIC</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.13632</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.13632v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Measurements of exclusive $J/\psi$, $\psi(2s)$, and electron-positron ($e^{+}e^{-}$) pair photoproduction in Au$+$Au ultra-peripheral collisions are reported by the STAR experiment at $\sqrt{s_{_\mathrm{NN}}}=200~\rm{GeV}$. We report several first measurements at the Relativistic Heavy-Ion Collider, which are i) $J/\psi$ photoproduction with large momentum transfer up to $2.2~\rm{(GeV/c)^{2}}$, ii) coherent $J/\psi$ photoproduction associated with neutron emissions from nuclear breakup, iii) the rapidity dependence of incoherent $J/\psi$ photoproduction, iv) the $\psi(2s)$ photoproduction cross section at mid-rapidity, and v) $e^{+}e^{-}$ pair photoproduction up to high invariant mass of 6 $\rm{GeV/c^2}$. For measurement ii), the coherent $J/\psi$ total cross section of $\gamma^{\ast} + \rm{Au} \rightarrow J/\psi + \rm{Au}$ as a function of the center-of-mass energy $W_{\rm{\gamma* N}}$ has been obtained without photon energy ambiguities. The data are quantitatively compared with the Monte Carlo models STARlight, Sartre, BeAGLE, and theoretical calculations of gluon saturation with color glass condensate, nuclear shadowing with leading twist approximation, Quantum Electrodynamics, and the Next-to-Leading Order perturbative QCD. At the photon-nucleon center-of-mass energy of 25.0 GeV, the coherent and incoherent $J/\psi$ cross sections of Au nuclei are found to be $71\pm10\%$ and $36\pm7\%$, respectively, of that of free protons. These data provide an important experimental constraint for nuclear parton distribution functions and a unique opportunity to advance the understanding of the nuclear modification effect at the top RHIC energy.</description>

      <title>Probing Higgs-muon interactions at a multi-TeV muon collider</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.13082</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.13082v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the capabilities of a muon collider, at 3 and 10 TeV center-of-mass energy, of probing the interactions of the Higgs boson with the muon. We consider all the possible processes involving the direct production of EW bosons ($W,Z$ and $H$) with up to five particles in the final state. We study these processes both in the HEFT and SMEFT frameworks, assuming that the dominant BSM effects originate from the muon Yukawa sector. Our study shows that a Muon Collider has sensitivity beyond the LHC, as it not only relies on the Higgs-decay branching fraction to muons. A 10 TeV muon collider provides a unique sensitivity on muon and (multi-) Higgs interactions, significantly better than the 3 TeV option. We find searches based purely on multi-Higgs production to be particularly effective in probing these couplings.</description>

      <title>Preliminary Investigation of a Higgs Factory based on Proton-Driven Plasma Wakefield Acceleration</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.14765</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.14765v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A Higgs Factory is considered the highest priority next collider project by the high-energy physics community. Very advanced designs based on radio-frequency cavities exist, and variations on this approach are still being developed. Recently, an option based on electron-bunch driven plasma wakefield acceleration has also been proposed. In this article, we discuss a further option based on proton-driven plasma wakefield acceleration. This option has significant potential advantages due to the high energy of the plasma wakefield driver, simplifying the plasma acceleration stage. Its success will depend on further developments in producing compact high-energy proton bunches at a high rate, which would also make possible a broad range of synergistic particle-physics research.</description>

      <title>Interpretation of excess in $H \to Z \gamma$ using a light axion-like particle</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.05678</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.05678v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We interpret the recent excess in a rare decay of the Higgs boson, $H\to Z\gamma$, using a light axion-like particle (ALP) in the massrange $0.05 - 0.1$ GeV.The dominant decay of such a light ALP is into a pair of collimated photons, whose decay is required to happen before reaching the ECAL detector, such that it mimics a single photon in the detector. It can explain the excess with a coupling $C^{\rm eff}_{aZH} / \Lambda \sim 4 \times 10^{-5}\;{\rm GeV}^{-1}$, while the decay of the ALP before reaching the ECAL requires the diphoton coupling $C^{\rm eff}_{\gamma\gamma}/ \Lambda \ge 0.35 \,{\rm TeV}^{-1} (0.1\,{\rm eV}/m_a)^2$. A potential test would be the rare decay of the $Z$ boson $Z \to a H^* \to a (b \bar b)$ at the Tera-$Z$ option of the future FCC and CEPC. However, it has a branching ratio of only $O(10^{-12})$, and thus barely testable. The production cross section for $pp \to Z^* \to a H$ via the same coupling $C^{\rm eff}_{aZH} / \Lambda$ at the LHC is too small for detection.</description>

      <title>Anisotropy Scaling Functions in Heavy-Ion Collisions: Insights into the `Ultra-Central Flow Puzzle' and Constraints on Transport Coefficients and Nuclear Deformation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.09389</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.09389v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Anisotropy scaling functions derived from comprehensive measurements of transverse momentum- and centrality-dependent anisotropy coefficients \(v_2(p_T,\text{cent})\) and \(v_3(p_T,\text{cent})\) in Pb+Pb collisions at 5.02 and 2.76 TeV, Xe+Xe collisions at 5.44 TeV and Au+Au collisions at 0.2 TeV, offer new insights into the `ultra-central flow puzzle.' These functions integrate diverse measurements into a single curve, clarifying anisotropy attenuation throughout the entire \(p_T\) and centrality range. They reveal the influence of initial-state eccentricities (\(\varepsilon_{n}\)), dimensionless size (\(\mathbb{R}\)), radial flow, viscous correction to the thermal distribution function (\(\delta_f\)), the medium's stopping power (\(\Hat{q}\)), and specific shear viscosity (\(\eta/s\)) on the observed anisotropies. This analysis not only enhances understanding of transport coefficients but also provides crucial constraints on nuclear deformation.</description>

      <title>A plethora of long-range neutrino interactions probed by DUNE and T2HK</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.02775</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.02775v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Upcoming neutrino experiments will soon search for new neutrino interactions more thoroughly than ever before, boosting the prospects of extending the Standard Model. In anticipation of this, we forecast the capability of two of the leading long-baseline neutrino oscillation experiments, DUNE and T2HK, to look for new flavor-dependent neutrino interactions with electrons, protons, and neutrons that could affect the transitions between different flavors. We interpret their sensitivity in the context of long-range neutrino interactions, mediated by a new neutral boson lighter than $10^{-10}$ eV, and sourced by the vast amount of nearby and distant matter in the Earth, Moon, Sun, Milky Way, and beyond. For the first time, we explore the sensitivity of DUNE and T2HK to a wide variety of $U(1)^\prime$ symmetries, built from combinations of lepton and baryon numbers, each of which induces new interactions that affect oscillations differently. We find ample sensitivity: in all cases, DUNE and T2HK may constrain the existence of the new interaction even if it is supremely feeble, may discover it, and, in some cases, may identify the symmetry responsible for it.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.12812v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this work, we systematically study the radiative decays of singly heavy baryons, a crucial aspect of their spectroscopic behavior. To enhance the accuracy of our calculations, we utilize numerical spatial wave functions for the singly heavy baryons obtained through the Gaussian Expansion Method, which also yields their mass spectrum. As hadron spectroscopy enters an era of high precision, we believe our study of the radiative decays of singly heavy baryons will provide valuable insights for further exploration of these particles.</description>

      <title>Towards an Interpretation of the First Measurements of Energy Correlators in the Quark-Gluon Plasma</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.07936</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.07936v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Energy correlators have recently been proposed as a class of jet substructure observables that directly link experimental measurements of the asymptotic energy flux with the field theoretic description of the underlying microscopic dynamics. This link holds particular promise in heavy-ion physics, where both experimental measurements and theoretical interpretations are inherently complex. With recent measurements of energy correlators in proton-proton collisions, the first measurement of these observables on inclusive jets in heavy-ion collisions underscores the importance of a theoretical understanding of their behavior in this complex environment. In this manuscript, we extend our previous calculations to account for several effects necessary for a qualitative understanding of the behavior of energy correlators on inclusive jets in heavy-ion collisions. Through a semi-analytic approach implemented in a hydrodynamically expanding quark-gluon plasma (QGP), we account for medium-induced radiation with leading broadening effects, selection biases arising from energy loss, and a description of the confinement transition. Our results represent a crucial first step towards interpreting the measurements of energy correlators on inclusive jets in heavy-ion collisions, which marks a significant milestone in connecting heavy-ion experiment and fundamental quantum field theory, in the quest to disentangle the microscopic dynamics of the QGP.</description>

      <title>First lattice QCD calculation of $J/\psi$ semileptonic decay containing $D$ and $D_s$ particles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.13568</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.13568v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We perform the first lattice calculation on the semileptonic decay of $J/\psi$ using the (2+1)-flavor Wilson-clover gauge ensembles generated by CLQCD collaboration. Three gauge ensembles with different lattice spacings, from 0.0519 fm to 0.1053 fm, and pion masses, $m_{\pi}\sim$ 300 MeV, are utilized. After a naive continuum extrapolation using three lattice spacings, we obtain $\operatorname{Br}(J/\psi\rightarrow D_s e\nu_e)=1.90(6)(5)_{V_{cs}}\times 10^{-10}$ and $\operatorname{Br}(J/\psi\rightarrow D e\nu_e)=1.21(6)(9)_{V_{cd}}\times 10^{-11}$, where the first errors are statistical, and the second come from the uncertainties of CKM matrix element $V_{cs(d)}$. The ratios of the branching fractions between lepton $\mu$ and $e$ are also calculated as $R_{J/\psi}(D_s)=0.97002(8)$ and $R_{J/\psi}(D)=0.97423(15)$ after performing a continuum limit including only $a^2$ term. The ratios provide necessary theoretical support for the future experimental test of lepton flavor universality.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2408.15910v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this work we investigate the muon anomalous dipole moment $a_\mu$ in a model that extends the Standard Model with a scalar triplet and a lepton triplet. Different from previous studies, we find that there is still viable parameter space in this model to explain the discrepancy $\Delta a_\mu=a_{\mu}(\mathrm{Exp})-a_{\mu}(\mathrm{SM})$. While being consistent with the current data of neutrino mass, electroweak precision measurements and the perturbativity of couplings, our model can provide new physics contribution $a_\mu^\textrm{NP}$ to cover the central region of $\Delta a_\mu$ with new scalar and lepton mass as low as around TeV. This mass scale is allowed by the current collider searches for doubly charged scalars and the lepton triplet, and they can be tested at future high energy and/or high luminosity colliders.</description>
