      <title>Too fast to be single: Tidal evolution and photometric identification of stellar and planetary companions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.03839</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.03839v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Many stars exist in binary or multiple systems where tidal interactions modify rotational evolution. In single stars, magnetic braking slows rotation, but in close binaries, tidal forces synchronize rotation, leading to high spin rates. Thus, fast rotators are often synchronized binaries or planetary systems. We analyze stellar rotation in the Kepler field to identify non-single systems photometrically. By studying young clusters, we derive an initial rotation temperature relation for single stars, validated through magnitude excess and previous binarity studies, identifying 1219 candidate non-single systems with Prot smaller than 3 days. For ultra-fast rotators (Prot smaller than 3 days), we compile a catalog of 1296 candidate ultra short period binaries, often part of hierarchical triples, reinforcing the link between rapid spins and multiplicity. Applying our method to planet-host stars, we uncover two potential circumbinary systems (Kepler 1184, Kepler 1521) and two systems possibly synchronized by close-in planets (Kepler 493, Kepler 957), with five additional cases as potential false positives. Our analysis of known non-single stars reveals clear tidal features: period synchronization, orbit circularization, and a constraint on the minimal pericenter, where rp scales as (Porb/Prot)^0.77. These findings provide new insights into tidal evolution and offer a robust method for identifying stellar multiplicity, with implications for stellar evolution, binary formation, and exoplanet dynamics.</description>

      <title>Testing the Flux Rope Paradigm for Coronal Mass Ejections Using a Three Spacecraft Encounter Event</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.03863</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.03863v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a 3-D morphological and field reconstruction of a coronal mass ejection (CME) from 2023 November 28, which hits three spacecraft near 1 au: Wind at Earth's L1 Lagrange point; STEREO-A with a longitudinal separation of $6.5^{\circ}$ west of Earth; and Solar Orbiter (SolO) at $10.7^{\circ}$ east of Earth. The reconstruction assumes a magnetic flux rope (MFR) structure for the CME. With this event, we test whether field tracings observed by a spacecraft passing near the central axis of a CME MFR (STEREO-A) can be used to successfullly predict the field behavior seen by a spacecraft $17^{\circ}$ away (SolO), which has a more grazing encounter with the CME. We find that the MFR model does have significant success in simultaneously reproducing the field signs and rotations seen at STEREO-A, Wind, and SolO. This provides support for the MFR paradigm for CME structure. However, the SolO measurements, which are farthest from the central axis of the MFR, show less defined MFR signatures, presumably due to a greater degree of erosion and degradation of the MFR structure far from its central axis.</description>

      <title>Improving the Temporal Resolution of SOHO/MDI Magnetograms of Solar Active Regions Using a Deep Generative Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.03959</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.03959v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a novel deep generative model, named GenMDI, to improve the temporal resolution of line-of-sight (LOS) magnetograms of solar active regions (ARs) collected by the Michelson Doppler Imager (MDI) on board the Solar and Heliospheric Observatory (SOHO). Unlike previous studies that focus primarily on spatial super-resolution of MDI magnetograms, our approach can perform temporal super-resolution, which generates and inserts synthetic data between observed MDI magnetograms, thus providing finer temporal structure and enhanced details in the LOS data. The GenMDI model employs a conditional diffusion process, which synthesizes images by considering both preceding and subsequent magnetograms, ensuring that the generated images are not only of high-quality, but also temporally coherent with the surrounding data. Experimental results show that the GenMDI model performs better than the traditional linear interpolation method, especially in ARs with dynamic evolution in magnetic fields.</description>

      <title>A model of X-ray and EUV emission from magnetically heated atmospheres in classical T Tauri stars: a case study of TW Hya</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.04000</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.04000v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Photoevaporation caused by X-rays and ultraviolet radiation from the central star has attracted attention as a key process driving the dispersal of protoplanetary discs. Although numerous models have been used to investigate the photoevaporation process, their conclusions vary, partly due to differences in the adopted radiation spectra of the host star in particular in the extreme ultraviolet (EUV) and soft X-ray bands. This study aims to construct the EUV and (soft) X-ray emission spectrum from pre-main-sequence stars using a physics-based model. While the high-energy radiation sources of pre-main-sequence stars include accretion shocks and magnetically heated coronae, this study focuses on the latter. An MHD model capable of reproducing the coronal emission of main-sequence stars is applied to a pre-main-sequence star TW Hya, and its feasibility is assessed by comparing the predicted and observed emission-line intensities. We find that the emission lines formed at coronal temperatures ($T = 4-13 \times 10^6$ K) are reproduced in intensity within a factor of three. Emission lines from lower-temperature ($T &lt; 4 \times 10^6$ K) plasmas are systematically underestimated, with typical intensities at 10-30% of observed values, consistent with previous findings that these emissions predominantly originate from accretion shocks. Emission lines emitted at extremely high temperatures ($T &gt; 13 \times 10^6$ K) account for only about 1-10% of the observed values, likely due to the neglect of transient heating associated with flares. These results indicate that the quiescent coronal emission of pre-main-sequence stars can be adequately modeled using a physics-based approach.</description>

      <title>Characterisation of magnetic activity of M dwarfs. Possible impact on the surface brightness</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.04364</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.04364v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Context. M dwarfs are an ideal laboratory for hunting Earth-like planets, and the study of chromospheric activity is an important part of this task. On the one hand, its short-term activity show high levels of magnetic activity that can affect habitability and make it difficult to detect exoplanets orbiting around them. But on the other hand, long-term activity studies can show whether these stars exhibit cyclical behavior or not in their activity, facilitating the detection of planets in those periods of low magnetic activity. Aims. The long-term cyclical behavior of magnetic activity can be detected studying several spectral lines and explained by different stellar dynamo models. In this work, we studied the Mount Wilson $S$-index to search for evidence of activity cycles possibly driven by a solar-type dynamo. Methods. We studied a sample of 35 dM with spectral classes ranging from dM0 to dM6. To perform this, we used 2965 spectra in the optical range to build time series with extensions of up to 21 years. We have analysed thesm with different time-domain techniques to detect cyclical patterns. In addition, we have also studied the potential impact of chromospheric activity on the surface brightness. Results. Using the color index (V-Ks), we have computed the chromospheric emission levels and we found that the majority of the stars in the sample have low emission levels. In this work, we have detected 13 potential activity cycles with a duration between 3 and 19 years and with false alarm probabilities (FAPs) less than 0.1%. For stars with non-cyclic behaviour, we have found that the mean value of the $S$-Index varies between 0.350 and 1.765 and its mean variability and chromospheric emission level are around 12% and -5.110 dex, respectively. We do not find any impact of chromospheric activity on the surface brightness in the domain of -5.6 &lt; log $R'_{HK}$ &lt; -4.5.</description>

      <title>HERACLES++: a multi-dimensional Eulerian code for exascale computing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.04428</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.04428v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Numerical simulations of multidimensional astrophysical fluids present considerable challenges. However, the development of exascale computing has significantly enhanced computational capabilities, motivating the development of new codes that can take full advantage of these resources. In this article, we introduce HERACLES++, a new hydrodynamics code with high portability, optimized for exascale machines with different architectures and running efficiently both on CPUs and GPUs. The code is Eulerian and employs a Godunov finite-volume method to solve the hydrodynamics equations, which ensures accuracy in capturing shocks and discontinuities. It includes different Riemann solvers, equations of state, and gravity solvers. It works in Cartesian and spherical coordinates, either in 1-D, 2-D, or 3-D, and uses passive scalars to handle gases with several species. The code accepts a user-supplied heating or cooling term to treat a variety of astrophysical contexts. In addition to the usual series of benchmarking tests, we use HERACLES++ to simulate the propagation of a supernova shock in a red-supergiant star envelope, from minutes after core collapse until shock emergence. In 1-D, the results from HERACLES++ are in agreement with those of V1D for the same configuration. In 3-D, the Rayleigh-Taylor instability develops and modifies the 1-D picture by introducing density and composition fluctuations as well as turbulence. The focus on a wedge, rather than the full solid angle, and the ability of running HERACLES++ with a large number of GPUs allow for long-term simulations of 3-D supernova ejecta with a sub-degree resolution. Future development is to extend HERACLES++ to a radiation-hydrodynamics code.</description>

      <title>Comparative study of small-scale magnetic fields on $\xi$ Boo A using optical and near-infrared spectroscopy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.04519</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.04519v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Magnetic field investigations of Sun-like stars, using Zeeman splitting of non-polarised spectra, in the optical and H-band have found significantly different magnetic field strengths for the same stars, the cause of which is currently unknown. We aim to further investigate this issue by systematically analysing the magnetic field of $\xi$ Boo A, a magnetically active G7 dwarf, using spectral lines at different wavelengths. We used polarised radiative transfer accounting for the departures from local thermodynamic equilibrium to generate synthetic spectra. To find the magnetic field strengths in the optical, H-band, and K-band, we employed MCMC sampling analysis of high-resolution spectra observed with the spectrographs CRIRES$^+$, ESPaDOnS, NARVAL, and UVES. We also determine the formation depth of different lines by calculating the contribution functions for each line employed in the analysis. We find that the magnetic field strength discrepancy between lines in the optical and H-band persists even when treating the different wavelength regions consistently. In addition, the magnetic measurements derived from the K-band appear to more closely align with the optical. The H-band appears to yield magnetic field strengths $\sim$ 0.4 kG with a statistically significant variation while the optical and K-band is stable at $\sim$ 0.6 kG for observations spanning about two decades. The contribution functions reveal that the optical lines form at a significantly higher altitude in the photosphere compared to those in the H- and K-band. While we find that the discrepancy remains, the variation of formation depths could indicate that the disagreement between magnetic field measurements obtained at different wavelengths is linked to the variation of the magnetic field along the line of sight and between different structures, such as star spots and faculae, in the stellar photosphere.</description>

      <title>VLBA Detections in the Oph-S1 Binary System near Periastron Confirmation of its Orbital Elements and Mass</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.04594</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.04594v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Oph-S1 is the most luminous and massive stellar member of the nearby Ophiuchus star-forming region. Previous Very Long Baseline Array (VLBA) observations have shown it to be an intermediate-mass binary system ($\sim 5\,{\rm M}_\odot$) with an orbital period of about 21 months, but a paucity of radio detections of the secondary near periastron could potentially have affected the determination of its orbital parameters. Here, we present nine new VLBA observations of Oph-S1 focused on its periastron passage in early 2024. We detect the primary in all observations and the secondary at five epochs, including three within about a month of periastron passage. The updated orbit, determined by combining our new data with 35 previous observations, agrees well with previous calculations and yields masses of $4.115 \pm0.039 \,{\rm M}_\odot$ and $0.814\pm0.006 \,{\rm M}_\odot$ for the two stars in the system.</description>

      <title>Finding White Dwarfs' Hidden Companions using an Unsupervised Machine Learning Technique</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.04672</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.04672v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: White dwarfs (WD) with main-sequence (MS) companions are crucial probes of stellar evolution. However, due to the significant difference in their luminosities, the WD is often outshined by the MS star. The aim of this work is to find hidden companions in Gaia's sample of single WD candidates. Our methodology involves applying an unsupervised machine learning algorithm for dimensionality reduction and clustering, known as Self-Organizing Map (SOM), to Gaia BP/RP (XP) spectra. This strategy allows us to naturally separate WDMS binaries from single WDs from the detection of subtle red flux excesses in the XP spectra that are indicative of low-mass MS companions. We validate our approach using confirmed WDMS binary pairs from the SDSS and LAMOST surveys, achieving a precision of $\sim 90\%$. Applying our SOM to 90,667 sources, we identify 993 WDMS candidates, 801 of which have not been previously reported in the literature. If confirmed, our sample will increase the known WDMS binaries by $20\%$, making it a valuable source for stellar evolution studies. Additionally, we use the Virtual Observatory Spectral Energy Distribution Analyzer (VOSA) tool to further refine and parameterize a "golden sample" of 136 WDMS candidates through multi-wavelength photometry and a two-body Spectral Energy Distribution fitting. These high-confidence WDMS binaries are composed by low-mass WDs ($\sim 0.41 M_{\odot}$), with cool MS companions ($\sim 2800$ K). Finally, 13 systems exhibit periodic variability consistent with eclipsing binaries, making them prime targets for further follow-up observations.</description>

      <title>Setting the Stage for Uranian Seismology from Rings and Radial Velocities</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.03807v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A Uranus orbiter would be well positioned to detect the planet's free oscillation modes, whose frequencies can resolve questions about Uranus's weakly constrained interior. We calculate the spectra that may manifest in resonances with ring orbits or in Doppler imaging of Uranus's visible surface, using a wide range of interior models that satisfy the present constraints. Recent work has shown that Uranus's fundamental (f) and internal gravity (g) modes have appropriate frequencies to resonate with Uranus's narrow rings. We show that even a single $\ell=2$ f or g mode detected in ring imaging or occultations can constrain Uranus's core extent and density. Fully fluid models typically have $\ell=2-7$ f mode frequencies slightly too high to resonate among the narrow rings. If Uranus has a solid core that f modes cannot penetrate, their frequencies are reduced, rendering them more likely to be observed. A single $\ell\gtrsim7$ f mode detection would constrain Uranus's unknown rotation period. Meanwhile, the different technique of Doppler imaging seismology requires specialized instrumentation but could deliver many detections, with best sensitivity to acoustic (p) modes at mHz frequencies. Deviations from uniform frequency spacing can be used to locate density interfaces in Uranus's interior, such as a sharp core boundary. Shallower nonadiabaticity and condensation layers complicate this approach, but higher-order frequency differences can be analyzed to disentangle deep and near-surface effects. The detection of normal modes by a Uranus orbiter would help to discern among the degenerate solutions permitted by conventional measurements of the planet's static gravity field.</description>

      <title>SN 2024abfo: a partially stripped SN II from a white supergiant</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.03851</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.03851v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present photometric and spectroscopic data of the type IIb supernova (SN) 2024abfo in NGC 1493 (at 11 Mpc). The ATLAS survey discovered the object just a few hours after the explosion, and observed a fast rise on the first day. Signs of the sharp shock break-out peak and the subsequent cooling phase are observed in the ultraviolet and the bluest optical bands in the first couple of days, while no peak is visible in the reddest filters. Subsequently, in analogy with normal SNe IIb, the light curve of SN 2024abfo rises again in all bands to the broad peak, with the maximum light reached around one month after the explosion. Its absolute magnitude at peak is $M_r=-16.5\pm0.1$ mag, making it a faint SN IIb. The early spectra are dominated by Balmer lines with broad P-Cygni profiles indicating ejecta velocity of 22,500 \kms. One month after the explosion, the spectra display a transition towards being He-dominated, though the H lines do not completely disappear, supporting the classification of SN 2024abfo as a relatively H-rich SN IIb. We identify the progenitor of SN 2024abfo in archival images of the Hubble Space Telescope, the Dark Energy Survey, and the XMM-Newton space telescope, in multiple optical filters. From its spectral energy distribution, the progenitor is consistent with being a white supergiant, Deneb-like star, with a photospheric temperature of 8110 K, a radius of 176 \Rsun, a luminosity of $\log(L/L_{\odot})=5.08$, having an initial mass of 15-16 \Msun. This detection supports an emerging trend of SN IIb progenitors being more luminous and hotter than SN II ones, and being primaries of massive binaries. Within the SN IIb class, fainter events such as SN 2024abfo tend to have cooler and more expanded progenitors than luminous SNe IIb.</description>

      <title>Ground-Based Reconnaissance Observations of 21 Exoplanet Atmospheres with the Exoplanet Transmission Spectroscopy Imager</title>

Abstract: One of the most prolific methods of studying exoplanet atmospheres is transmission spectroscopy, which measures the difference between the depth of an exoplanet's transit signal at various wavelengths and attempts to correlate the depth changes to potential features in the exoplanet's atmosphere. Here we present reconnaissance observations of 21 exoplanet atmospheres measured with the Exoplanet Transmission Spectroscopy Imager (ETSI), a recently deployed spectro-photometer on the McDonald Observatory Otto Struve 2.1 m telescope. ETSI measurements are mostly free of systematics through the use of a novel observing technique called common-path multi-band imaging (CMI), which has been shown to achieve photometric color precision on-par with space-based observations (300ppm or 0.03%). This work also describes the various statistical tests performed on the data to evaluate the efficacy of the CMI method and the ETSI instrument in combination. We find that none of the 8 comparisons of exoplanet atmospheres measured with ETSI and other observatories (including the Hubble Space Telescope) provide evidence that the spectra are statistically dissimilar. These results suggest that ETSI can provide initial transmission spectroscopy observations for a fraction of the observational and monetary overhead previously required to detect an exoplanet's atmosphere. Ultimately these reconnaissance observations increase the number of planets with transmission spectroscopy measurements by ~10% and provide an immediate prioritization of 21 exoplanets for future follow-up with more precious observatories, such as the James Webb Space Telescope. The reconnaissance spectra are available through the Filtergraph visualization portal at the URL: https://filtergraph.com/etsi/.</description>

      <title>Rapid characterization of exoplanet atmospheres with the Exoplanet Transmission Spectroscopy Imager (ETSI)</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.03931v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Exoplanet Transmission Spectroscopy Imager (ETSI) amalgamates a low resolution slitless prism spectrometer with custom multi-band filters to simultaneously image 15 spectral bandpasses between 430 nm and 975 nm with an average spectral resolution of $R = \lambda/\delta\lambda \sim 20$. ETSI requires only moderate telescope apertures ($\sim2$ m) and is capable of characterizing an exoplanet atmosphere in as little as a single transit, enabling selection of the most interesting targets for further characterization with other ground and space-based observatories and is also well suited to multi-band observations of other variable and transient objects. This enables a new technique, common-path multi-band imaging (CMI), used to observe transmission spectra of exoplanets transiting bright (V$&lt;$14 magnitude) stars. ETSI is capable of near photon-limited observations, with a systematic noise floor on par with the Hubble Space Telescope and below the Earth's atmospheric amplitude scintillation noise limit. We report the as-built instrument optical and optomechanical design, detectors, control system, telescope hardware and software interfaces, and data reduction pipeline. A summary of ETSI's science capabilities and initial results are also included.</description>

      <title>Precise constraint on properties of neutron stars through new universal relations and astronomical observations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.03981</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.03981v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In view of the great uncertainty of the equation of state (EOS) of high-density nuclear matter, establishing EOS-independent universal relations between global properties of neutron stars provides a practical way to constrain the unobservable or difficult-to-observe properties through astronomical observations. It is common to construct universal relations between EOS-dependent properties (e.g., moment of inertia, tidal deformation, etc.) or combined properties (e.g., compactness). Improving the precision of the universal relations may provide stricter constraint on the properties of neutron star. We find that in 3-dimensional space with mass and radius as the base coordinates, the points corresponding to a certain property of neutron star described by different EOSs are almost located in the same surface. Thus the universal relation between the property and the stellar mass-radius can be expressed through describing the surface.
  It is shown that the resulting universal relations have higher precisions. As an example, we construct high-precision universal relations for the moment of inertia, the $f$-mode frequency, and the dimensionless tidal deformation respect to the mass-radius. As the observational data of neutron star mass and radius from NICER grows in data and accuracy, these universal relations allow for more precise constraints on the unobservable or difficult-to-observe properties.</description>

      <title>Quasi-periodic oscillations of GHz-band polarization in a black hole</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.04011v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Relativistic jets from accreting black holes (BHs) radiate non-thermal emission which is highly variable in different time scales. Magnetic fields anchored to a rotating BH or accretion disc accelerate and collimate jets of the BH systems. Previous studies on black holes of different mass scales, including supermassive and stellar-mass black holes, only report flux quasi-periodic oscillations in radio, optical, X-ray and gamma-ray bands. No quasi-periodic variations in polarization have yet been detected in any black hole systems. Here, we report the first detection of GHz radio polarization oscillations in GRS 1915+105, which harbors a spinning stellar-mass BH with a relativistic jet. Our observations show that during the increasing phase of radio emission, linear polarization and flux exhibit similar oscillation periods of $\sim 17$ and $33$ seconds, and their variation patterns anti-correlate with each other. These rare, short-period oscillations in both polarization and flux would be important to understand instabilities and special dynamics in magnetized jets.</description>

      <title>MIRI-LRS spectrum of a cold exoplanet around a white dwarf: water, ammonia, and methane measurements</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.04531</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.04531v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The study of the atmosphere of exoplanets orbiting white dwarfs is a largely unexplored field. With WD\,0806-661\,b, we present the first deep dive into the atmospheric physics and chemistry of a cold exoplanet around a white dwarf. We observed WD 0806-661 b using JWST's Mid-InfraRed Instrument Low-Resolution Spectrometer (MIRI-LRS), covering the wavelength range from 5 -- 12~$\mu \rm{m}$, and the Imager, providing us with 12.8, 15, 18 and 21\,$\mu$m photometric measurements. We carried the data reduction of those datasets, tackling second-order effects to ensure a reliable retrieval analysis. Using the \textsc{TauREx} retrieval code, we inferred the pressure-temperature structure, atmospheric chemistry, mass, and radius of the planet. The spectrum of WD 0806-661 b is shaped by molecular absorption of water, ammonia, and methane, consistent with a cold Jupiter atmosphere, allowing us to retrieve their abundances. From the mixing ratio of water, ammonia and methane we derive $\rm{C/O} = 0.34 \pm 0.06$, $\rm{C/N} = 14.4 ^{+2.5}_{-1.8}$ and $\rm{N/O} = 0.023 \pm 0.004$ and the ratio of detected metals as proxy for metallicity. We also derive upper limits for the abundance of CO and $\rm{CO_2}$ ($1.2\cdot10^{-6} \rm{\,and\,} 1.6\cdot10^{-7}$ respectively), which were not detected by our retrieval models. While our interpretation of WD\,0806-661\,b's atmosphere is mostly consistent with our theoretical understanding, some results -- such as the lack of evidence for water clouds, an apparent increase in the mixing ratio of ammonia at low pressure, or the retrieved mass at odds with the supposed age -- remain surprising and require follow-up observational and theoretical studies to be confirmed.</description>

Abstract: We obtain stringent bounds on neutrino quantum decoherence from the analysis of SN1987A data. We show that for the decoherence model considered here, which allows for neutrino-loss along the trajectory, the bounds are many orders of magnitude stronger than the ones that can be obtained from the analysis of data from reactor neutrino oscillation experiments or neutrino telescopes.</description>

      <title>Parameter degeneracies associated with interpreting HST WFC3 transmission spectra of exoplanetary atmospheres</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.04600</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.04600v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Wide Field Camera 3 (WFC3) instrument on the Hubble Space Telescope has provided an abundance of exoplanet spectra over the years. These spectra have enabled analysis studies using atmospheric retrievals to constrain the properties of these objects. However, follow-up observations from the James Webb Space Telescope have called into question some of the results from these older datasets, and highlighted the need to properly understand the degeneracies associated with retrievals of WFC3 spectra. In this study, we perform atmospheric retrievals of 38 transmission spectra from WFC3 and use model comparison to determine the complexity required to fit the data. We explore the effect of retrieving system parameters such as the stellar radius and planet's surface gravity, and thoroughly investigate the degeneracies between individual model parameters -- specifically the temperature, abundance of water, and cloud-top level. We focus on three case studies (HD 209458b, WASP-12b, and WASP-39b) in an attempt to diagnose some of the issues with these retrievals, in particular the low retrieved temperatures when compared to the equilibrium values. Our study advocates for the careful consideration of parameter degeneracies when interpreting retrieval results, as well as the importance of wider wavelength coverage to break these degeneracies, in agreement with previous studies. The combination of data from multiple instruments, as well as analysis from multiple data reductions and retrieval codes, will allow us to robustly characterise the atmosphere of these exoplanets.</description>

      <title>An active repeating fast radio burst in a magnetized eruption environment</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.04727v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Fast radio bursts (FRBs) are millisecond-duration radio bursts with unidentified extra-galactic origin. Some FRBs exhibit mild magneto-ionic environmental variations, possibly attributed to plasma turbulence or geometric configuration variation in a binary system. Here we report an abrupt magneto-ionic environment variation of FRB 20220529, a repeating FRB from a disk galaxy at redshift 0.1839. Initially, its Faraday rotation measure (RM) was $21 \pm 96~{\rm rad~m^{-2}}$ over 17 months. In December 2023, it jumped to $1976.9~{\rm rad~m^{-2}}$, exceeding twenty times of the standard deviation of the previous RM variation, and returned to the typical values within two weeks. Such a drastic RM variation suggests a dense magnetized clump moving across the line of sight, possibly due to coronal mass ejection associated with a stellar flare. It indicates that the FRB likely has a companion star that produced the stellar flare.</description>

      <title>The distribution of misalignment angles in multipolar planetary nebulae</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.04549</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.04549v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We measure the projected angle on the plane of the sky between adjacent symmetry axes of tens of multipolar planetary nebulae and find that the distribution of these misalignment angles implies a random three-dimensional angle distribution limited to &lt;60 degrees. We identify a symmetry axis as a line connecting two opposite lobes (bubbles) or clumps. We build a cumulative distribution function of the projected angles alpha and find that an entirely random distribution of the three-dimensional angles delta between adjacent symmetry axes, namely, uncorrelated directions, does not fit the observed one. A good fit to the observed distribution is a limited random distribution of the three-dimensional angle between adjacent symmetry axes, i.e., random distribution in the range of 20&lt;delta&lt;60 degrees. We assume that a pair of jets along the angular momentum axis of an accretion disk around the companion shape each symmetry axis. The limited random distribution might result from two sources of angular momentum to the accretion disks with comparable magnitude: one with a fixed direction and one with a stochastic direction variation. We discuss a scenario where the fixed-axis angular momentum source is the binary orbital angular momentum, while the stochastic source of angular momentum is due to the vigorous envelope convection of the mass-losing giant progenitor.</description>

      <title>Deep Optical Images of the Ejecta Nebula Around the Wolf-Rayet Star WR 8 (HD 62910)</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.08931v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We report the results of deep H$\alpha$ and [O III] images of the bright WN6/WC4 Wolf-Rayet star WR~8 (HD~62910). These data show considerably more surrounding nebulosity than seen in prior imaging. The brighter portions of the nebula span $\simeq6'$ in diameter and exhibit considerable fine-scale structure including numerous emission clumps and bright head-tail like features presumably due to the effects of the WR star's stellar winds. Due to the overlap of a relatively bright band of unrelated foreground diffuse interstellar H$\alpha$ emission, WR~8's nebula is best viewed via its [O III] emission. A faint $9' \times 13'$ diffuse outer nebulosity is detected surrounding the nebula's main ring of emission. Comparison of the nebula's optical structure with that seen in WISE 22 $\mu$m data shows a similarly clumpy structure but in a better defined emission shell of thermal continuum from dust. The infrared shell is coincident with the nebula's southern [O III] emissions but is mainly seen in the fainter outer portions of the northern [O III] emission clumps. It is this greater radial distance of dust emission in the nebula's northern areas that leads to a striking off-center position of the WR star in the IR shell.</description>

      <title>Mapping the Outcomes of Stellar Evolution in the Disks of Active Galactic Nuclei</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.16050</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.16050v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The disks of Active Galactic Nuclei (AGNs) are expected to be populated by numerous stars, either formed in the outer regions of the disk via gravitational instability, or captured from the nearby nuclear star cluster. Regardless of their formation mechanism, these stars experience altered evolutionary paths, mostly shaped by the accretion of dense disk material. In this study, through the comparison of different timescales, we chart the evolutionary outcomes of these AGN stars as a function of disk radius and across a range of supermassive black hole (SMBH) masses, spanning from $10^6$ to $10^9 \rm M_\odot$, for two popular AGN disk models. We find that, in the outer regions of the disk, stars evolve similarly to those in the interstellar medium, but in the inner and denser regions accretion quickly turns low-mass stars into massive stars, and their fate depends on just how quickly they accrete. If accretion occurs at a faster rate than nuclear burning, they can reach a quasi-steady `immortal' state. If stars accrete faster than they can thermally adjust, runaway accretion occurs, potentially preventing a quasi-steady state and altering the disk structure. During the AGN lifetime, in the regions of the disk that produce massive stars, supernovae (SNe) and Gamma-Ray Bursts (GRBs) may occur within the disk over a wide range of optical depths and ambient densities. Subsequently, in the final phase of the AGN, as the disk becomes depleted, formerly immortal stars will be unable to replenish their fuel, leading to additional SNe and GRBs.</description>

      <title>NICER observations of type-I X-ray bursts from the ultra-compact X-ray binary M15 X-2</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.02177v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Type-I X-ray bursts are thermonuclear explosions caused by the unstable burning of accreted material on the surface of neutron stars. We report the detection of seven type-I X-ray bursts from the ultracompact X-ray binary M15 X-2 observed by the Neutron Star Interior Composition Explorer (NICER) during its 2022 outburst. We found all the bursts occurred in the soft state and exhibited similar light curve profiles, with no cases of photospheric radius expansion. Time-resolved spectroscopy showed clear deviations from the blackbody model during the first ten seconds of all the bursts. The fits were improved by using the enhanced persistent emission method, which we interpret as evidence of burst-disk interaction. We compared the performance of these models against a neutron star atmosphere model and found it made no significant improvements. After analyzing the burst rise times and fuel composition, we propose that these bursts were powered by the burning of pure helium, confirming the ultracompact nature of the source.</description>
