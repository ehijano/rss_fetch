      <title>MicroLad: 2D-to-3D Microstructure Reconstruction and Generation via Latent Diffusion and Score Distillation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.20138</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.20138v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A major obstacle to establishing reliable structure-property (SP) linkages in materials engineering is the scarcity of diverse 3D microstructure datasets. Limited dataset availability and insufficient control over the analysis and design space restrict the variety of achievable microstructure morphologies, hindering progress in solving the inverse (property-to-structure) design problem. To address these challenges, we introduce MicroLad, a latent diffusion framework specifically designed for reconstructing 3D microstructures from 2D data. Trained on 2D images and employing multi-plane denoising diffusion sampling in the latent space, the framework reliably generates stable and coherent 3D volumes that remain statistically consistent with the original data. While this reconstruction capability enables dimensionality expansion (2D-to-3D) for generating statistically equivalent 3D samples from 2D data, effective exploration of microstructure design requires methods to guide the generation process toward specific objectives. To achieve this, MicroLad integrates score distillation sampling (SDS), which combines a differentiable score loss with microstructural descriptor-matching and property-alignment terms. This approach updates encoded 2D slices of the 3D volume in the latent space, enabling robust inverse-controlled 2D-to-3D microstructure generation. Consequently, the method facilitates exploration of an expanded 3D microstructure analysis and design space in terms of both microstructural descriptors and material properties.</description>

      <title>Revealing degradation mechanisms in YSZ ceramics through machine learning-guided aging and multiscale characterization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.20149</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.20149v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The long-term performance of yttria-stabilized zirconia (YSZ) based energy and biomedical devices is compromised by low-temperature degradation (LTD). This study presents a novel integration of machine learning-guided hydrothermal aging with multiscale characterization to resolve a two-stage degradation mechanism in 3 mol% YSZ. Stage 1 (0 to 30 hrs) features initial surface relief building, which transitions to partial refinement and relief distribution in stage 2 (30 to 60 hrs), alongside a rise in monoclinic phase content. The evolving microstructure increases triple-junction grain boundary density, and these junctions act as degradation hotspots, where vacancy exchange and water access accelerate the transformation. These findings highlight grain boundary chemistry, rather than grain size alone, as a key LTD driver, suggesting boundary engineering as a strategy to enhance YSZ stability for energy, biomedical, and thermal applications.</description>

      <title>Strong Raman Optical Activity and Chiral Phonons in Chiral Hybrid Organic-Inorganic Perovskites</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.20338</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.20338v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Hybrid organic-inorganic perovskites with chiral organic cations are very interesting for optoelectronic applications because of their intrinsically chiral light-matter interactions. Chiral distortions in these materials lead to circular dichroism, circular birefringence, and circularly polarized luminescence in the band transitions of the inorganic sublattice. Raman-active vibrational modes in these crystals are governed by crystal symmetry and therefore are also strongly impacted by the nature and magnitude of the chiral distortions. Here, we report low-frequency Raman modes that are sensitive to circularly polarized excitation in chiral hybrid organic-inorganic perovskites (CHOIPs) across a wide range of structures and compositions. The circularly polarized Raman spectra from enantiomers of CHOIP single crystals exhibit sharp modes below 150 cm-1, corresponding to vibrations of the lead iodide octahedra. These modes exhibit strong differences in intensities (Raman optical activity, ROA) depending on the handedness of the excitation, with high degree of polarization for several modes. Calculations reveal the presence of several chiral phonon modes with opposite phonon angular momenta. The strong ROA and the chiral phonon modes are a direct consequence of chirality transfer from the chiral organic linker to the lead iodide octahedra in the CHOIP structure, resulting in a strong chiroptical response in the phonon modes.</description>

      <title>Atomistic understanding of hydrogen bubble-induced embrittlement in tungsten enabled by machine learning molecular dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.20350</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.20350v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Hydrogen bubble formation within nanoscale voids is a critical mechanism underlying the embrittlement of metallic materials, yet its atomistic origins remains elusive. Here, we present an accurate and transferable machine-learned potential (MLP) for the tungsten-hydrogen binary system within the neuroevolution potential (NEP) framework, trained through active learning on extensive density functional theory data. The developed NEP-WH model reproduces a wide range of lattice and defect properties in tungsten systems, as well as hydrogen solubility, with near first-principles accuracy, while retaining the efficiency of empirical potentials. Crucially, it is the first MLP capable of capturing hydrogen trapping and H\textsubscript{2} formation in nanovoids, with quantitative fidelity. Large-scale machine-learning molecular dynamics simulations reveal a distinct aggregation pathway where planar hydrogen clusters nucleate and grow along \{100\} planes near voids, with hexagonal close-packed structures emerging at their intersections. Under uniaxial tension, these aggregates promote bubble fracture and the development of regular \{100\} cracks, suppressing dislocation activity and resulting in brittle fracture behavior. This work provides detailed atomistic insights into hydrogen bubble evolution and fracture in nanovoids, enables predictive modeling of structural degradation in extreme environments, and advances fundamental understanding of hydrogen-induced damage in structural metals.</description>

      <title>Lattice-induced spin dynamics in Dirac magnet CoTiO3</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.20354</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.20354v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Spin-lattice coupling is crucial for understanding the spin transport and dynamics for spintronics and magnonics applications. Recently, cobalt titanate (CoTiO3), an easy-plane antiferromagnet, has been found to host axial phonons with a large magnetic moment, which may originate from spin-lattice coupling. Here, we investigate the effect of light-driven lattice dynamics on the magnetic properties of CoTiO3 using time-resolved spectroscopy with a THz pump and a magneto-optic probe. We found resonantly driven Raman active phonons, phonon-polariton-induced excitation of the antiferromagnetic magnons, and a slow increase in the polarization rotation of the probe, all indicating symmetry breaking that is not intrinsic to the magnetic space group. The temperature dependence confirmed that the observed spin dynamics is related to the magnetic order, and we suggest surface effects as a possible mechanism. Our results of THz-induced spin-lattice dynamics signify that extrinsic symmetry breaking may contribute strongly and unexpectedly to light-driven phenomena in bulk complex oxides.</description>

      <title>Toughening beta-Ga2O3 via mechanically seeded dislocations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.20439</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.20439v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: \b{eta}-Ga2O3 is a promising candidate for next-generation semiconductors, but is limited by its intrinsic brittleness, which hinders its application in flexible electronics and high-precision devices. This study explores a new approach to improving the damage tolerance of (001)-oriented \b{eta}-Ga2O3 by introducing mechanically seeded dislocations via surface scratching. By applying a Brinell indenter to scratch the surface along the [100] direction, we effectively generate edge-type dislocations belonging to the (011)[01-1] and/or (0-11)[011] slip systems within a mesoscale wear track. Through a combination of nanoindentation tests, surface morphology analysis, and microstructural characterization using scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM), we reveal that the introduction of dislocations significantly mitigates the formation of cleavage cracks during indentation, in contrast to that observed in as-received \b{eta}-Ga2O3. The mechanically seeded dislocations in the subsurface layers play an important role in preventing brittle fracture by facilitating stable plastic deformation.</description>

      <title>Physics-informed Hamiltonian learning for large-scale optoelectronic property prediction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.20536</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.20536v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Predicting optoelectronic properties of large-scale atomistic systems under realistic conditions is crucial for rational materials design, yet computationally prohibitive with first-principles simulations. Recent neural network models have shown promise in overcoming these challenges, but typically require large datasets and lack physical interpretability. Physics-inspired approximate models offer greater data efficiency and intuitive understanding, but often sacrifice accuracy and transferability. Here we present HAMSTER, a physics-informed machine learning framework for predicting the quantum-mechanical Hamiltonian of complex chemical systems. Starting from an approximate model encoding essential physical effects, HAMSTER captures the critical influence of dynamic environments on Hamiltonians using only few explicit first-principles calculations. We demonstrate our approach on halide perovskites, achieving accurate prediction of optoelectronic properties across temperature and compositional variations, and scalability to systems containing tens of thousands of atoms. This work highlights the power of physics-informed Hamiltonian learning for accurate and interpretable optoelectronic property prediction in large, complex systems.</description>

      <title>Accurate Screening of Functional Materials with Machine-Learning Potential and Transfer-Learned Regressions: Heusler Alloy Benchmark</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.20556</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.20556v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A machine learning-accelerated high-throughput (HTP) workflow for the discovery of magnetic materials is presented. As a test case, we screened quaternary and all-$d$ Heusler compounds for stable compounds with large magnetocrystalline anisotropy energy ($E_{\mathrm{aniso}}$). Structure optimization and evaluation of formation energy and distance to hull convex were performed using the eSEN-30M-OAM interatomic potential, while local magnetic moments, phonon stability, magnetic stability, and $E_{\mathrm{aniso}}$ were predicted by eSEM models trained on our DxMag Heusler database. A frozen transfer learning strategy was employed to improve accuracy. Candidate compounds identified by the ML-HTP workflow were validated with density functional theory, confirming high predictive precision. We also benchmark the performance of different MLIPs, and discuss the fidelity of local magnetic moment prediction and its extension to other magnetic materials.</description>

      <title>A perspective on inelastic light scattering spectroscopy for probing transport of collective acoustic excitations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.20599</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.20599v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Understanding and manipulating nanoscale energy transport and conversion processes are essential for diverse applications, ranging from thermoelectrics and energy harvesting to thermal management of microelectronics. While it has long been recognized that acoustic and thermal properties in condensed matters are primarily due to microscopic transport of phonons as quasiparticles, probing thermal acoustic excitations particularly at sub-THz remains a challenge primarily due to limitations in experimental techniques with spatiotemporal resolutions pertinent to probing them. Brillouin light scattering (BLS) and its variant, impulsive stimulated Brillouin scattering (ISS), provide access to these thermal acoustic excitations, enabling measurement of quantities such as acoustic dispersions along with relaxation dynamics occurring in ultrasonic as well as hypersonic frequencies. In this perspective, we provide a brief overview of the operational principles of BLS and ISS, and highlight their applications in probing acoustic, thermal, and magnetic excitations in emerging and low-dimensional materials. We conclude by discussing current challenges and future opportunities for advanced material characterization using Brillouin light scattering spectroscopy techniques.</description>

      <title>Decoding local framework dynamics in the ultra-small pore MOF MIL-120(Al) CO2 sorbent with Machine Learned Potentials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.20608</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.20608v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) with ultra-small pores offer an optimal environment to effectively capture guest molecules such as CO2. Subtle local dynamics of their frameworks, either throughout reorientation of functional groups grafted to the organic linkers or those present in their inorganic nodes, is expected to play a major role in their sorption behaviors. Here, we combine density-functional theory (DFT) with a purpose-trained machine-learned potential to systematically investigate the local dynamics of the bridging hydroxyl groups, {\mu}2-OH groups present in the prototypical ultra-small pore MOF MIL-120(Al), reported recently as an attractive CO2 sorbent. We identified six MOF configurations associated with distinct {\mu}2-OH orientations with relatively low interconversion energy barriers (0.07-0.19 eV per unit cell) suggesting that all these states can be observed experimentally at room temperature. We demonstrated that our MLP achieves near-DFT-level fidelity, reproducing the energy barriers and phonon spectra of the empty MOF, and accurately predicting CO2 adsorption geometries depending on the {\mu}2-OH orientations with CO2 adopting either parallel or perpendicular alignment to the pore axis, which in turn governs the adsorption energetics. This work establishes that a reliable description of the local structure, such as reorientation/flipping of bridging hydroxyl groups, is a key feature to gain an accurate description of the guest locations and energetics in ultra-small pore MOFs.</description>

      <title>Prediction of EDS Maps from 4DSTEM Diffraction Patterns Using Convolutional Neural Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.20657</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.20657v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Understanding the relationship between atomic structure (order) and chemical composition (chemistry) is critical for advancing materials science, yet traditional spectroscopic techniques can be slow and damaging to sensitive samples. Four-dimensional scanning transmission electron microscopy (4D-STEM) captures detailed diffraction patterns across scanned regions, providing rich structural information, while energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDS) offers complementary chemical data. In this work, we develop a machine learning framework that predicts EDS spectra directly from 4D-STEM diffraction patterns, reducing beam exposure and acquisition time. A convolutional neural network (CNN) accurately infers elemental compositions, particularly for elements with strong diffraction contrast or higher concentrations, such as Oxygen and Tellurium. Both extrapolation and interpolation strategies demonstrate consistent performance, with improved predictions when additional structural context is available. Visual and cross-correlation analyses confirm the model's ability to capture global and local compositional trends. This approach establishes a data-driven pathway to non-destructive, high-throughput materials characterization.</description>

      <title>Electric-field induced half-metallicity in a two-dimensional ferromagnetic Janus VSSe bilayer</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.20679</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.20679v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Two-dimensional (2D) half-metals with intrinsic ferromagnetism hold great potential for applications in spintronics. In this study, we aim to expand the known space of such 2D ferromagnetic (FM) half-metals by investigating bilayer of Janus VSSe, an FM semiconductor. Its structural, electronic, and magnetic properties are examined using density functional theory, employing the DFT+$U$ method, coupled with the PBE functional. The stability of the bilayer is examined using ab initio molecular dynamics simulations at finite temperatures up to 400 K. To ensure the stability further, the elastic constants of the system have also been investigated and we found that VSSe bilayer manifests an easy plane of magnetization similar to its monolayer counterpart. At the DFT+$U$ level, the considered VSSe bilayer exhibits a tendency towards half-metallicity with a small band gap of 0.11 eV for the majority spin carriers, and of 0.66 eV for the minority ones. To include a transition from a semiconductor to a half-metal, the bilayer is subjected to an external electric field of varying strengths normal to the plane. The lack of horizontal mirror symmetry in the bilayer allows bidirectional tuning of the band gap, with different values for the field in "upward" and "downward" directions. The band gaps for the two spin channels increase with the increasing upward electric field, while the opposite happens for the downward fields, with the majority carrier gap closing at 0.16 V/$\unicode{x212B}$, making the material a spin gapless semiconductor. Further increase in the electric field renders the material half metallic at 0.18 V/$\unicode{x212B}$. Given the fact that these values of the external electric field are achievable in the lab suggests that the FM Janus VSSe bilayer is a promising candidate for spintronic devices.</description>

      <title>Dynamic compression of glassy GeO$2$ up to the TPa range and first observation of shock induced crystallization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.20695</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.20695v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work we present an extensive study of glassy GeO$_2$ under laser induced dynamic compression. New VISAR and SOP data provide the extension of Hugoniot EoS up to the TPa range for this material including temperature measurements. Reflectivity data at both 532 and 1064 nm wavelenght are also reported. In the low compression range we observe changes of the optical properties from transparent, to opaque, to metallic state. The second part of this work describes a further laser shock experiment combined with in-situ X-ray diffraction. Here we observe, for the first time, the laser shock-induced crystallization of glassy GeO$_2$ to a structure compatible with the rutile phase at pressure higher than 20 GPa and melting occurring at around 75 GPa.</description>

      <title>Magnetism and nonlinear charge transport in NiFe2O4/{\gamma}-Al2O3/SrTiO3 heterostructure for spintronic applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.20710</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.20710v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present the synthesis and study of the magnetic and electronic properties of NiFe2O4/{\gamma}-Al2O3/SrTiO3 heterostructure. The {\gamma}-Al2O3/SrTiO3 interface hosts a high-mobility two-dimensional electron gas (2DEG) with large spin-orbit coupling, making it promising for spintronics applications if it can be coupled to a suitable source of spin currents. Here, we synthesize a ferrimagnetic insulating NiFe2O4(001) layer on {\gamma}-Al2O3(001)/SrTiO3(001) using a low-temperature reactive sputtering at 150 deg C without compromising the mobility and charge carrier density of the 2DEG at the {\gamma}-Al2O3(001)/SrTiO3(001) interface. The sheet resistance of both {\gamma}-Al2O3/SrTiO3 and NiFe2O4/{\gamma}-Al2O3/SrTiO3 exhibits metallic behavior down to cryogenic temperatures, with a low temperature upturn driven by the Kondo-like scattering. Most importantly, NiFe2O4/{\gamma}-Al2O3/SrTiO3 behaves as a magnetic diode at low temperatures, and its rectification performance increases significantly with increasing magnetic field strength giving rise to a robust magneto-electronic rectification effect at low temperatures, which provides a first step towards the development of all-oxide heterostructures capable of efficient spin-charge conversion.</description>

      <title>Ultrafast solid-state chemical synthesis of BaTiO3 initiated by gyrotron microwave radiation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.20714</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.20714v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This work presents the results of a study on the solid-state synthesis of barium titanate under continuous microwave radiation from a 24 GHz gyrotron in a multimode cavity reactor. It is shown that in localized domains where fine-scale thermal instabilities develop, initiated by microwave radiation within the initial stoichiometric reaction mixture of ultrafine barium carbonate and titanium dioxide powders, the synthesis can proceed within 1,5 - 7 minutes, achieving a target product yield of up to 90%. Based on a developed realistic numerical model of the multimode reactor, involving an iterative solution of stationary Maxwell and heat conduction equations, it is demonstrated that the specific absorbed power in the domains where fine-scale thermal instabilities develop can reach 670 W/cm3 under an input microwave power of 400 W.</description>

      <title>Revival of Layered Ferroelectrics in Thin Films</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.20742</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.20742v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Layered perovskites are a versatile class of ferroelectrics with their structural anisotropy reflected in unusual electrostatics that give rise to exceptional ferroelectric properties. These materials fall into four main families: Aurivillius, Carpy-Galy, Ruddlesden-Popper, and Dion-Jacobson phases; each forming natural superlattices by interleaving perovskite slabs with spacer layers. For a long time, these materials were considered too structurally complex to prepare as high-quality thin films. However, recent breakthroughs in deposition and advanced characterization have made it possible to stabilize high-quality films with atomic precision, uncovering a wide range of unconventional ferroelectric functionalities. These include robust in-plane polarization without a critical thickness, the emergence of charged domain walls and non-trivial polar textures, resilience to doping with magnetic ions and charge carriers, and possibility to epitaxially integrate them into standard perovskite heterostructures. This review aims to unify current knowledge on the fabrication and characterization of layered ferroelectric thin films, and to present research findings across all four structural families, with the goal of highlighting their common features despite differences in crystal structure and polarization mechanisms. We also discuss promising research directions, including polar metallicity, (alter-)magnetoelectricity, exfoliation, and soft-chemistry-driven phase transformations, with the goal of consolidating the field and encouraging further exploration of these materials for both fundamental studies and applications.</description>

      <title>Electrode modified domain morphology in ferroelectric capacitors revealed by X-ray microscopy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.20925</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.20925v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Ferroelectric thin films present a powerful platform for next generation computing and memory applications. However, domain morphology and dynamics in buried ferroelectric stacks have remained underexplored, despite the importance for real device performance. Here, nanoprobe X-ray diffraction (nano-XRD) is used to image ferroelectric domains inside BiFeO3-based capacitors, revealing striking differences from bare films such as local disorder in domain architecture and partial polarization reorientation. We demonstrate sensitivity to ferroelectric reversal in poled capacitors, revealing expansive/compressive (001) strain for up-/down-polarization using nano-XRD. We observe quantitative and qualitative differences between poling by piezoresponse force microscopy (PFM) and in devices. Further, biasing induces lattice tilt at electrode edges which may modify performance in down-scaled devices. Direct comparison with PFM polarized structures even demonstrates potential nano-XRD sensitivity to domain walls. Our results establish nano-XRD as a noninvasive probe of buried ferroelectric domain morphologies and dynamics, opening avenues for operando characterization of energy-efficient nanoscale devices.</description>

      <title>Control of polarization and polar chiral textures in BiFeO$_3$ by epitaxial strain and interfacial chemistry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.20930</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.20930v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The balance between interfacial chemistry, electrostatics, and epitaxial strain plays a crucial role in stabilizing polarization in ferroelectric thin films. Here, we bring these contributions into competition in BiFeO$_3$ (BFO) thin films grown on the charged-surface-terminated La$_{0.7}$Sr$_{0.3}$MnO$_3$ (LSMO)-buffered NdGaO$_3$ (001) substrates. The large anisotropic compressive strain from the substrate promotes the formation of ferroelectric domains despite the expected stabilization of a uniform out-of-plane polarization by the (La,Sr)O$^{0.7+}$ termination of the metallic buffer. Piezoresponse force microscopy and scanning transmission electron microscopy reveal that the resulting nanoscale domain architecture is stabilized by the deterministic formation of a fluorite-like Bi$_2$O$_2$ surface layer on regions polarized oppositely to the LSMO-imposed polarization orientation. Leveraging this polarization compensation mechanism, we stabilize a uniform out-of-plane polarization in our highly strained BFO films by inserting a Bi$_2$O$_2$-terminated Aurivillius film as a buffer layer. Additionally, we reveal signatures of homochiral polarization textures in our BFO films on the level of domain configurations using local polarization switching experiments. Our work thus brings new strategies for controlling polarization direction and chiral textures in oxide ferroelectrics, opening pathways for functional domain-wall and domain-based electronics.</description>

      <title>Controlled spin-to-charge conversion in noncollinear antiferromagnet-based Py/Mn$_{3}$Pt heterostructure</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.21014</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.21014v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Noncollinear antiferromagnets (NCAFs) have recently emerged as promising candidates for future spintronic technologies, offering ultrafast switching, negligible stray fields allowing dense packing, and robustness against external magnetic perturbations. When interfaced with ferromagnets (FMs), they can strongly influence interfacial exchange and spin-torque mechanisms that enable manipulating magnetic order and realizing functionalities beyond conventional heavy metals (HMs) based FM/HM heterostructures. Here, we perform a broadband ferromagnetic resonance (FMR) study to systematically investigate the magnetization dynamics and spin-to-charge conversion in permalloy (Py) and Mn$_3$Pt bilayers. High-quality Py films provide a well-defined FMR spectra with a low Gilbert damping parameter ( $\alpha_{\mathrm{eff}} \approx 9.8 \times 10^{-3}$). We observe a pronounced enhancement of damping with intrinsic value $\alpha_{\mathrm{int}} \approx 3.1 \times 10^{-2}$ in the Py/Mn$_3$Pt bilayer, indicating efficient spin pumping into the NCAF layer. Frequency dependent linewidth analysis shows a predominantly Gilbert type damping in the bilayers and the corresponding effective spin-mixing conductance ( $g^{\uparrow\downarrow}_{\mathrm{eff}} \approx 4.8 \times 10^{18}$m$^{-2}$) is comparable to that of other high-performance antiferromagnetic heterostructures. These results are significant for establishing NCAFs as a candidate material for spin generation and highlights the potential of Py/Mn$_3$Pt bilayers for efficient and ultrafast spintronic applications.</description>

      <title>Lithiation Analysis of Metal Components for Li-Ion Battery using Ion Beams</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.21017</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.21017v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Metal components are extensively used as current collectors, anodes, and interlayers in lithium-ion batteries. Integrating these functions into one component enhances the cell energy density and simplifies its design. However, this multifunctional component must meet stringent requirements, including high and reversible Li storage capacity, rapid lithiation/delithiation kinetics, mechanical stability, and safety. Six single-atom metals (Mg, Zn, Al, Ag, Sn and Cu) are screened for lithiation behavior through their interaction with ion beams in electrochemically tested samples subjected to both weak and strong lithiation regimes. These different lithiation regimes allowed us to differentiate between the thermodynamics and kinetic aspects of the lithiation process. Three types of ions are used to determine Li depth profile: $H^+$ for nuclear reaction analysis (NRA), $He^+$ for Rutherford backscattering (RBS), and $Ga^+$ for focused ion beam (FIB) milling. The study reveals three lithiation behaviors: (i) Zn, Al, Sn form pure alloys with Li; (ii) Mg, Ag create intercalation solid solutions; (iii) Cu acts as a lithiation barrier. NRA and RBS offer direct and quantitative data, providing a more comprehensive understanding of the lithiation process in LIB components. These findings fit well with our ab-initio simulation results, establishing a direct correlation between electrochemical features and fundamental thermodynamic parameters.</description>

      <title>Topotactic phase transition in epitaxial La0.7Sr0.3MnO3-{\delta} films induced by oxygen getter assisted thermal annealing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.21023</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.21023v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Oxygen vacancies play a crucial role in controlling the physical properties of complex oxides. In La0.7Sr0.3MnO3-{\delta}, the topotactic phase transition from Perovskite (PV) to Brownmillerite (BM) can be triggered e.g. via oxygen removal during thermal annealing. Here we report on a very efficient thermal vacuum annealing method using aluminum as an oxygen getter material. The topotactic phase transition is characterized by X-ray Diffraction which confirms a successful transition from PV to BM in La0.7Sr0.3MnO3-{\delta} thin films grown via physical vapor deposition. The efficiency of this method is confirmed using La0.7Sr0.3MnO3-{\delta} micron-sized bulk powder. The accompanying transition from the original Ferromagnetic (FM) to an Antiferromagnetic (AF) state and the simultaneous transition from a metallic to an insulating state is characterized using Superconducting Quantum Interference Device (SQUID)-magnetometry and Alternating Current (AC) resistivity measurements, respectively. The near surface manganese oxidation states are probed by synchrotron X-ray Absorption Spectroscopy. Moreover, X-ray Reflectivity, Atomic Force Microscopy and Scanning Transmission Electron Microscopy reveal surface segregation and cation redistribution during the oxygen getter assisted annealing process.</description>

      <title>Predicting Trends in $V_{OC}$ Through Rapid, Multimodal Characterization of State-of-the-Art p-i-n Perovskite Devices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.21037</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.21037v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Perovskite photovoltaic technologies are approaching commercial deployment, yet single junction and tandem architectures both still have significant room to improve power conversion efficiency and stability. The ability to perform rapid screening of material quality after altering processing conditions is critical to accelerating the optimization and commercialization of perovskite-based technologies. Currently, researchers utilize a wide range of stand-alone metrology tools to isolate sources of power loss throughout a device stack, which can be slow and labor intensive. Here, we demonstrate the use of a multimodal metrology approach to rapidly determine the maximum achievable and predicted open circuit voltages of &gt; 100 perovskite devices during fabrication. Acquisition of these different data are facilitated by combining them into a single integrated measurement platform. We show that these data and automated analysis can be used to rapidly understand and ultimately predict quantitative trends in open circuit voltages of state-of-the-art devices architectures. The data and automated analysis workflow presented provides a reliable approach to quickly identify absorber and charge transport layer combinations that can lead to improved open circuit voltages.</description>

      <title>Altermagnetic Shastry-Sutherland fullerene networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.21056</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.21056v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Molecular building blocks provide a versatile platform for realising exotic quantum phases. Using charge neutral, pure carbon fullerene molecules as an example, we design altermagnetic C$_{40}$ monolayers in Shastry-Sutherland lattice. The resonance structure of one unpaired electron leads to an effective spin-1/2 cluster on both long sides of the molecule, which, after rotating into a 2D rutile-like crystal structure, forms altermagnetic ground state. We show $d$-wave spitting of the spin-polarised electronic band structure and strong chiral-split magnon bands. Most interestingly, the effective spin-1/2 clusters form the Shastry-Sutherland model with a rich phase diagram including altermagenti, quantum spin liquid, plaquette, and dimer phases, which can be easily accessed to via moderate bi-axial strains. Our findings present magnetic fullerene monolayers as a tunable platform for exotic quantum magnetism and spintronic applications.</description>

      <title>CrystalICL: Enabling In-Context Learning for Crystal Generation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.20143</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.20143v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Designing crystal materials with desired physicochemical properties remains a fundamental challenge in materials science. While large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated strong in-context learning (ICL) capabilities, existing LLM-based crystal generation approaches are limited to zero-shot scenarios and are unable to benefit from few-shot scenarios. In contrast, human experts typically design new materials by modifying relevant known structures which aligns closely with the few-shot ICL paradigm. Motivated by this, we propose CrystalICL, a novel model designed for few-shot crystal generation. Specifically, we introduce a space-group based crystal tokenization method, which effectively reduces the complexity of modeling crystal symmetry in LLMs. We further introduce a condition-structure aware hybrid instruction tuning framework and a multi-task instruction tuning strategy, enabling the model to better exploit ICL by capturing structure-property relationships from limited data. Extensive experiments on four crystal generation benchmarks demonstrate the superiority of CrystalICL over the leading baseline methods on conditional and unconditional generation tasks.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2508.20163v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose extended s-wave altermagnets (sAMs) as a class of magnetic states which are fully gapped, spin-compensated, and feature spin-polarized bands. sAMs are formed through valley-exchange symmetries, which act as momentum-space translations beyond standard crystallographic spin-group classifications. Using an effective two-valley model, we demonstrate that sAMs exhibit isotropic spin splitting, enable spin-selective transport in tailored heterostructures, and give rise to descendant pair density wave order. From a microscopic sAM minimal model, we develop the guiding principles to identify sAMs in quantum magnets.</description>

      <title>Beyond Optimization: Exploring Novelty Discovery in Autonomous Experiments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.20254</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.20254v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Autonomous experiments (AEs) are transforming how scientific research is conducted by integrating artificial intelligence with automated experimental platforms. Current AEs primarily focus on the optimization of a predefined target; while accelerating this goal, such an approach limits the discovery of unexpected or unknown physical phenomena. Here, we introduce a novel framework, INS2ANE (Integrated Novelty Score-Strategic Autonomous Non-Smooth Exploration), to enhance the discovery of novel phenomena in autonomous experimentation. Our method integrates two key components: (1) a novelty scoring system that evaluates the uniqueness of experimental results, and (2) a strategic sampling mechanism that promotes exploration of under-sampled regions even if they appear less promising by conventional criteria. We validate this approach on a pre-acquired dataset with a known ground truth comprising of image-spectral pairs. We further implement the process on autonomous scanning probe microscopy experiments. INS2ANE significantly increases the diversity of explored phenomena in comparison to conventional optimization routines, enhancing the likelihood of discovering previously unobserved phenomena. These results demonstrate the potential for AE to enhance the depth of scientific discovery; in combination with the efficiency provided by AEs, this approach promises to accelerate scientific research by simultaneously navigating complex experimental spaces to uncover new phenomena.</description>

      <title>Diamond-loaded polyimide aerogel scattering filters and their applications in astrophysical and planetary science observations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.20406</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.20406v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Infrared-blocking, aerogel-based scattering filters have a broad range of potential applications in astrophysics and planetary science instruments in the far-infrared, sub-millimeter, and microwave regimes. This paper demonstrates the ability of conductively-loaded, polyimide aerogel filters to meet the mechanical and science instrument requirements for several experiments, including the Cosmology Large Angular Scale Surveyor (CLASS), the Experiment for Cryogenic Large-Aperture Intensity Mapping (EXCLAIM), and the Sub-millimeter Solar Observation Lunar Volatiles Experiment (SSOLVE). Thermal multi-physics simulations of the filters predict their performance when integrated into a cryogenic receiver. Prototype filters have survived cryogenic cycling to 4\,K with no degradation in mechanical properties. Measurement of total hemispherical reflectance and transmittance, as well as cryogenic tests of the aerogel filters in a full receiver context, allow estimates of the integrated infrared emissivity of the filters. Knowledge of the emissivity will help instrument designers incorporate the filters into future experiments in planetary science, astrophysics, and cosmology.</description>

Abstract: This study investigates the relationship between phase retardation and strain rates in combined extensional-shear flows using the Jeffery-Hamel flow formalism, which yields an analytical velocity solution. Flow birefringence was measured in a 1.0 wt$\%$ cellulose nanocrystal (CNC) suspension using a high-speed polarization camera. The velocity field was validated via particle image velocimetry (PIV), which showed good agreement with the analytical solution. In regions dominated by either shear or extensional components, the birefringence behavior was consistent with prior theoretical and experimental findings. In the combined extensional-shear regions of the Jeffery-Hamel flow, the birefringence magnitude followed the root-sum-square (RSS) of the shear- and extension-induced contributions. This observation aligns with the principal stress formulation derived from Mohr's circle, in which the principal stress is expressed as the RSS of extensional and shear stresses. This finding provides a basis for extending stress-birefringence analysis to flows with coexisting deformation modes.</description>

      <title>Toward triggered generation of indistinguishable single-photons from MoTe$_2$ quantum emitters</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.20743</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.20743v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Single-photon sources operating in the telecom band are fundamental components for long-distance optical quantum communication and information processing. Two-dimensional (2D) transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDs) offer a promising platform for such sources, but their development has been hindered by limited spectral range and poor single-photon indistinguishability. Here, we demonstrate a reproducible and systematic approach for generating near-infrared (1090-1200 nm) quantum emitters in bilayer MoTe$_2$ using deterministic strain and defect engineering. These emitters exhibit strong linear polarization (DOLP $&gt;70\%$), sub-nanosecond lifetimes ($\tau \leqslant$ ~450 ps), high single-photon purity ($g^{(2)}(0)&lt;0.1$), and resolution-limited emission ($\sim$200 $\mu$eV). Electrostatic biasing enables Stark tuning over a $\sim$3 meV range, reduced photon bunching, and significantly shortened radiative lifetimes, yielding narrow emission with ratios of experimental to transform-limited linewidths as low as $R\sim55$. Most notably, two-photon interference measurements reveal a Hong-Ou-Mandel visibility of $V_\text{HOM}\sim $10$\%$, and up to $V_\text{HOM}\sim$ 40$\%$ with post-selection by temporal filtering, representing the highest reported indistinguishability for any TMD quantum emitters and the first such demonstration in the near-infrared regime. These results establish MoTe$_2$ as a viable platform for tunable, low-noise, high-purity single-photon sources with promising indistinguishability, paving the way for their integration into telecom-compatible quantum photonic technologies.</description>

      <title>LeMat-Traj: A Scalable and Unified Dataset of Materials Trajectories for Atomistic Modeling</title>

      <description>arXiv:2508.20875v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The development of accurate machine learning interatomic potentials (MLIPs) is limited by the fragmented availability and inconsistent formatting of quantum mechanical trajectory datasets derived from Density Functional Theory (DFT). These datasets are expensive to generate yet difficult to combine due to variations in format, metadata, and accessibility. To address this, we introduce LeMat-Traj, a curated dataset comprising over 120 million atomic configurations aggregated from large-scale repositories, including the Materials Project, Alexandria, and OQMD. LeMat-Traj standardizes data representation, harmonizes results and filters for high-quality configurations across widely used DFT functionals (PBE, PBESol, SCAN, r2SCAN). It significantly lowers the barrier for training transferrable and accurate MLIPs. LeMat-Traj spans both relaxed low-energy states and high-energy, high-force structures, complementing molecular dynamics and active learning datasets. By fine-tuning models pre-trained on high-force data with LeMat-Traj, we achieve a significant reduction in force prediction errors on relaxation tasks. We also present LeMaterial-Fetcher, a modular and extensible open-source library developed for this work, designed to provide a reproducible framework for the community to easily incorporate new data sources and ensure the continued evolution of large-scale materials datasets. LeMat-Traj and LeMaterial-Fetcher are publicly available at https://huggingface.co/datasets/LeMaterial/LeMat-Traj and https://github.com/LeMaterial/lematerial-fetcher.</description>

      <title>Subspace-Protected Topological Phases and Bulk-Boundary Correspondence</title>

      <description>arXiv:2508.20908v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: While tremendous research has revealed that symmetry enriches topological phases of matter, more general principles that protect topological phases have yet to be explored. In this Letter, we elucidate the roles of subspaces in free-fermionic topological phases. A subspace property for Hamiltonians enables us to define new topological invariants. They result in peculiar topological boundary phenomena, i.e., the emergence of an unpaired zero mode or zero-winding skin modes, characterizing subspace-protected topological phases. We establish and demonstrate the bulk-boundary correspondence in subspace-protected topological phases. We further discuss the interplay of the subspace property and internal symmetries. Toward application, we also propose possible platforms possessing the subspace property.</description>

      <title>Spin structures and phase diagrams of the spin-$\frac{5}{2}$ triangular-lattice antiferromagnet Na$_2$BaMn(PO$_4$)$_2$ under magnetic field</title>

      <description>arXiv:2508.21021v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We combine single-crystal neutron diffraction studies and Monte Carlo simulations to determine the spin structures and finite-temperature phase diagram of the spin-5/2 triangular-lattice antiferromagnet Na$_2$BaMn(PO$_4$)$_2$ in magnetic field. With the application of a magnetic field in two different directions, namely along the $c$-axis and in the $ab$-plane of the trigonal symmetry, we track the evolution of the spin structure through changes of the magnetic propagation vector. We account for these results with a minimal Heisenberg Hamiltonian that includes easy-axis anisotropy and weak, frustrated interlayer couplings in addition to intralayer exchange. Guided by representation analysis, we refine symmetry-allowed modes to the measured intensities and obtain the spin structures for all field-induced phases, which we compare quantitatively with simulated configurations. Taken together, our measurements and simulations show that frustrated interlayer exchange -- rather than purely 2D physics -- organizes the unexpectedly rich field-induced phases of Na$_2$BaMn(PO$_4$)$_2$.</description>

      <title>Atomic-scale 3D structural dynamics and functional degradation of Pt alloy nanocatalysts during the oxygen reduction reaction</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.01727v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Pt-based electrocatalysts are the primary choice for fuel cells due to their superior oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) activity. To enhance ORR performance and durability, extensive studies have investigated transition metal alloying, doping, and shape control to optimize the three key governing factors for ORR: geometry, local chemistry, and strain of their surface and subsurface. However, systematic optimization remains incomplete, as it requires an atomic-scale understanding of these factors and their dynamics over potential cycling, as well as their relationship to ORR activity. Here, we implement neural network-assisted atomic electron tomography to measure the 3D atomic structural dynamics and their effects on the functional degradation of PtNi alloy catalysts. Our results reveal that PtNi catalysts undergo shape changes, surface alloying, and strain relaxation during cycling, which can be effectively mitigated by Ga doping. By combining geometry, local chemistry, and strain analysis, we calculated the changes in ORR activity over thousands of cycles and observed that Ga doping leads to higher initial activity and greater stability. These findings offer a pathway to understanding 3D atomic structural dynamics and their relation to ORR activity during cycling, paving the way for the systematic design of durable, high-efficiency nanocatalysts.</description>

      <title>Grain boundaries amplify local chemical ordering in complex concentrated alloys</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.03901v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Local chemical ordering strongly influences the behavior of complex concentrated alloys, yet its characterization remains challenging due to the nanoscale dimensions and scattered spatial distribution of the ordered domains. Here, we study chemical ordering near grain boundaries, demonstrating they can act as microstructural anchor points that amplify chemical order and drive the formation of compositional nanopatterns. Atomistic simulations reveal the development of composition waves with ordering vectors normal to the boundary plane in two distinct material systems, CrCoNi and NbMoTaW. These waves manifest as periodic enrichment-depletion patterns that reflect the underlying chemical ordering tendencies of each system, but with amplified contrast that extends several nanometers into the grain interior before gradually decaying. By examining multiple grain boundary orientations and alloys, we show that both the interfacial segregation profile and the crystallographic terminating plane govern the extent and character of this amplification. This interplay between boundary-dictated directional ordering and the diffuse, untemplated chemical domain evolution within the grain advances our understanding of interface-mediated ordering phenomena and suggests new opportunities for experimentally detecting local chemical order in complex concentrated alloys.</description>

Abstract: Following the experimental realization of Quantum anomalous Hall (QAH) effect in thin films of chromium-doped (Bi,Sb)$_2$Te$_3$, enhancing the work temperature of QAH effect has emerged as a significant and challenging task. Here we demonstrate monolayer TbCl as a promising candidate to realize the room temperature QAH effect. Using DFT+U method, double checked by HSE06 and DMFT calculations, we identify the Hall conductivity $G = -e^2/h$ per layer in three-dimensional ferromagnetic insulator TbCl, which is a weakly stacking of QAH layers. The monolayer TbCl inherits the magnetic and topological properties, exhibiting the QAH effect with Chern number $C$=-1. The large topological band gap reaches 42.8 meV, which is beyond room temperatue. The extended 5$d$ electrons lead to sizable exchange and superexchange interactions, resulting in a high Curie temperature $T_c$$\sim$457K. All these features demonstrate that monolayer TbCl will provide an ideal platform to realize the room temperature QAH effect.</description>

      <title>Band-spin-valley coupled exciton physics in antiferromagnetic MnPS$_3$</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.14821v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The introduction of intrinsic magnetic order in two-dimensional (2D) semiconductors offers great opportunities for investigating correlated excitonic phenomena. Here, we employ full-spinor GW plus Bethe-Salpeter equation methodology to reveal rich exciton physics in a prototypical 2D N\'{e}el-type antiferromagnetic semiconductor MnPS$_3$, enabled by the interplay among inverted dispersion of the second valence band, spin-valley coupling and magnetic order. The negative hole mass increases the reduced mass of the lowest-energy bright exciton, leading to exchange splitting enhancement of the bright exciton relative to band-edge dark exciton. Notably, such splitting couples with spontaneous valley polarization to generate distinct excitonic fine structure between $K$ and $-K$ valleys, which dictate distinct relaxation behaviors. Crucially, magnetic order transition from N\'{e}el antiferromagnetic to ferromagnetic state induces significant quasiparticle band structure reconstruction and excitonic transitions modification, with low-energy optical excitations being exclusively contributed by majority-spin channel. These findings establish 2D antiferromagnetic semiconductors as an intriguing platform to study band-spin-valley coupled exciton physics.</description>

      <title>Enhanced Neel temperature and unusual thermal expansion in flux-grown FeCrAs crystals</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.21735v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We report results from our experimental investigation of the distorted-kagome compound FeCrAs. For this work, we developed a procedure using tin metal as a flux to produce needlelike crystals. The crystals were characterized by single crystal x-ray diffraction as well as measurements of magnetization, electrical transport, and heat capacity. The physical behaviors are generally similar to published results on crystals grown from a stoichiometric melt with two notable exceptions. The Sommerfeld coefficient is found to be 18 mJ/K2/mol, a little more than half of the previously reported value, and the Neel temperature is found to be 150 K, about 25K higher than in previous reports. The reason for these discrepancies are uncertain, but they may be related to differences in stoichiometry or disorder; it is expected that the Cr/Fe ratio has some variability in this compound. In addition, we find unusual thermal expansion behavior, with an anomaly at the Neel temperature and nearly temperature independent thermal expansion along the hexagonal c-axis above this transition. This suggests significant spin-lattice coupling, which may provide insight into non-metallic transport properties that have been associated with anomalous charge carrier scattering.</description>

Abstract: Platelet array linear complexions have been predicted in Al-Cu, with notable features being dislocation faceting and climb into the precipitate, both of which should impact plasticity. In this study, we examine the strain rate dependence of strength for platelet linear complexions using atomistic simulations, with classical precipitate strengthening through particle cutting and particle bowing used as baseline comparisons. Dislocation segments with edge character must climb down from the platelet structures prior to the commencement of glide, introducing a significant time-dependent barrier to plastic deformation. Consequently, the strain rate sensitivity of strength for the platelet linear complexions system was found to be up to five times higher than that of classical precipitation strengthening mechanisms.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2507.14053v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The structural development and change in elemental composition of SU-8 3005 photoresist into glass-like carbon due to pyrolysis up to 1000~$\degree$C is investigated utilising \textit{in-situ} x-ray and ultraviolet photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS/UPS) under ultra-high vacuum (UHV). XPS spectra were analysed in order to investigate changes to elemental composition and physical structure. Peak asymmetry in the measured C 1s spectra is found to be a clear indicator of a transition in both physical structure and increased electrical conductivity. The \textit{in-situ} XPS measurement of pyrolysis is effective in isolating changes in oxygen composition solely due to the pyrolysis process. Oxygen concentration, C 1s peak asymmetry and C 1s peak positions are strong indicators of semiconducting SU-8 transitioning to conducting glass-like carbon. For SU-8 pyrolysed above temperatures of 500~$\degree$C, a clear development is observed in the material structure and composition towards a carbon rich conducting network indicative of glass-like carbon. UPS spectra were analysed to investigate the changes in secondary electron cut-off (SECO) and valence band maximum (VBM) as the SU-8 layer is heated in UHV. The changes in SECO and VBM correlates well with the XPS data and a zero binding energy state is observed at 1000~$\degree$C.</description>

      <title>Type-II Antiferroelectricity</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.20285v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Antiferroelectricity (AFE) is a fundamental concept in physics and materials science. Conventional AFEs have the picture of alternating local electric dipoles defined in real space. Here, we discover a new class of AFEs, termed type-II AFEs, which possess opposite polarizations defined in momentum space across a pair of symmetry decoupled subspaces. Unlike conventional AFEs, the order parameter of type-II AFEs is rigorously formulated through Berry-phase theory and can be quantitatively extracted from the electronic band structure. Focusing on a subclass of type-II AFEs that preserve spin-rotation symmetry, we establish the relevant symmetry constraints and identify all compatible spin point groups. Remarkably, we find that type-II AFE order intrinsically coexists with antiferromagnetism, revealing a robust form of magnetoelectric coupling. We construct an altermagnetic model and identify several concrete antiferromagnetic/altermagnetic materials, such as FeS, Cr2O3, MgMnO3, monolayer MoICl2 and bilayer CrI3, that exhibit this novel ordering. Furthermore, we uncover unique physical phenomena associated with type-II spin-AFE systems, including spin current generation upon AFE switching and localized spin polarization at boundaries and domain walls. Our findings reveal a previously hidden class of quantum materials with intertwined ferroic orders, offering exciting opportunities for both fundamental exploration and technological applications.</description>

      <title>A Fermi Surface Descriptor Quantifying the Correlations between Anomalous Hall Effect and Fermi Surface Geometry</title>

      <description>arXiv:2308.05788v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In the last few decades, basic ideas of topology have completely transformed the prediction of quantum transport phenomena. Following this trend, we go deeper into the incorporation of modern mathematics into quantum material science focusing on geometry. Here we investigate the relation between the geometrical type of the Fermi surface and Anomalous and Spin Hall Effects. An index, $\mathbb{H}_F$, quantifying the hyperbolic geometry of the Fermi surface, shows a universal correlation (R$^2$ = 0.97) with the experimentally measured intrinsic anomalous Hall conductivity, of 16 different compounds spanning a wide variety of crystal, chemical, and electronic structure families, including those where topological methods give R$^2$ = 0.52. This raises a question about the predictive limits of topological physics and its transformation into a wider study of bandstructures' and Fermi surfaces' geometries and relating them to the quantum geometry theory of a more general metric of eigenstates, opening horizon for the prediction of phenomena beyond topological understanding.</description>

      <title>Origin of the hidden energy scale and the $f$-ratio in geometrically frustrated magnets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.12966</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.12966v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Sufficiently clean geometrically frustrated (GF) magnets are the largest class of candidate materials that may host quantum spin liquids (QSLs). Some of them have been shown to exhibit spin-glass freezing, potentially precluding QSLs, at the "hidden energy scale", which is significantly lower than the microscopic energy scale of spin interactions. Here, we investigate the origin of the hidden energy scale and its relationship to the $f$-ratio, the figure of merit for the degree of frustration in GF magnetic materials. The available experimental and numerical data provide evidence that GF magnets display, universally, two distinct temperature scales in the specific heat, the lowest of which is of the order of the hidden energy scale $T^*$. We argue that this scale is determined by non-magnetic excitations, similar to spin exchanges in chains of spins. The collective entropy of such excitations matches the entropy of the ground states of the Ising model on the same lattice, which provides a way to verify the proposed scenario in experiment. We demonstrate that in the presence of quenched disorder, a broad class of materials exhibits spin-glass freezing at temperatures of order $T^*$, in accordance with experimental observations. As $T^*$ is a property of the clean GF medium, it leads to a constraint on the $f$-ratio.</description>

      <title>Cavity Control of Topological Qubits: Fusion Rule, Anyon Braiding, and Majorana-Schr\"odinger Cat States</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.04515</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.04515v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate the effects of coupling a local electromagnetic cavity to a segment of a topological Kitaev chain (KC), with particular emphasis on the interplay between photons and Majorana zero modes (MZMs). In addition to the well-known {\it scissor effect}-which effectively partitions the chain and isolates free MZMs in the bulk-we provide evidence of non-trivial fusion rules and braiding operations, hallmark signatures of non-Abelian anyons, enabled by spatially selective ultrastrong KC-cavity coupling. We propose that these distinctive MZM properties can be experimentally probed via fermionic parity measurements and photon-induced Berry phases. Furthermore, we demonstrate that, in the so-called sweet-spot regime, the coupled system can be mapped onto a Rabi-like model with a homodyne-rotated quadrature, offering a simplified yet powerful theoretical description. Exploiting the symmetry of fermionic modes within a two-site cavity configuration, we also show the feasibility of generating hybrid MZM-polariton Schr\"odinger cat states. Our findings offer a novel approach to manipulating topological quantum matter through local light-matter interactions and provide theoretical tools for future experimental realizations in platforms such as quantum materials or superconducting circuits.</description>

Abstract: I carry out numerical scattering calculations against a family of finite-length one-dimensional point-like arrangements of atoms, $\chi(x)$, related to the distribution of prime numbers by a shift operation making the atomic density approximately constant. I show how the Riemann Zeta Function (RZF) naturally parameterizes the analytic structure of the scattering amplitude and give numerical results.</description>

      <title>Theory of Microphase Separation in Elastomers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.05910</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.05910v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Inspired by recent experiments, we present a phase-field model of microphase separation in an elastomer swollen with a solvent. The imbalance between the molecular scale of demixing and the mesoscopic scale beyond which elasticity operates produces effective long-range interactions, forming stable finite-sized domains. Our predictions concerning the dependence of the domain size and transition temperature on the stiffness of the elastomer are in good agreement with the experiments. Analytical phase diagrams, aided by numerical findings, capture the richness of the microphase morphologies, paving the way to create stable, patterned elastomers for various applications.</description>

      <title>Photon State Evolution in Arbitrary Time-Varying Media</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.04836</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.04836v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We introduce the instantaneous eigenstate method to study the evolution of quantum states in media with arbitrary time-varying permittivity and permeability. This method leverages the Heisenberg equation to bypass the Schr\"odinger equation, which leads to a complicated infinite set of coupled differential equations. Instead, the method allows the computation of the state evolution by solving only two coupled differential equations. Using this approach, we draw general conclusions about photon statistics in time-varying media. Our findings reveal that the maximum probability of generating a single photon pair from vacuum in such media is 25%, while Bell states can be created with a maximum probability of 84%. Additionally, we demonstrate that the spectral profile of emitted photons can be precisely controlled through the temporal profiles of permittivity and permeability. These results provide deeper insights into photon state manipulation in time-varying media. Furthermore, the instantaneous eigenstate method opens new opportunities to study state evolution in other systems where the Heisenberg equation offers a more tractable solution than the Schr\"odinger equation.</description>

      <title>Diagonal Symmetrization of Neural Network Solvers for the Many-Electron Schr\"odinger Equation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.05318</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.05318v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Incorporating group symmetries into neural networks has been a cornerstone of success in many AI-for-science applications. Diagonal groups of isometries, which describe the invariance under a simultaneous movement of multiple objects, arise naturally in many-body quantum problems. Despite their importance, diagonal groups have received relatively little attention, as they lack a natural choice of invariant maps except in special cases. We study different ways of incorporating diagonal invariance in neural network ans\"atze trained via variational Monte Carlo methods, and consider specifically data augmentation, group averaging and canonicalization. We show that, contrary to standard ML setups, in-training symmetrization destabilizes training and can lead to worse performance. Our theoretical and numerical results indicate that this unexpected behavior may arise from a unique computational-statistical tradeoff not found in standard ML analyses of symmetrization. Meanwhile, we demonstrate that post hoc averaging is less sensitive to such tradeoffs and emerges as a simple, flexible and effective method for improving neural network solvers.</description>

      <title>Exciton Energy Routing via Defect Networks in hBN/2D-Perovskite Hybrids</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.12024</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.12024v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Excitons in two dimensional Ruddlesden Popper perovskites (RPPs) exhibit large and tunable binding energies, making them promising candidates for optoelectronic applications. In particular, long-range exciton energy transfer in these materi-als holds potential for light-harvesting technologies and nanoscale interconnects. Here, using cathodoluminescence spectros-copy, we demonstrate that exciton energy can be transferred over ultralong distances, up to 150 micrometers, in heterostructures composed of hexagonal boron nitride (hBN) and RPPs. This transfer is enabled by efficient exciton coupling to defect centers in hBN and subsequent defect defect interactions. This mechanism not only facilitates long-range energy transfer, but also leads to enhanced luminescence intensity, narrower emission linewidths, extended exciton lifetimes, and reduced electron-beam-induced degradation. Owing to the high density of emitters within the hBN layers, the investigated van der Waals heterostructure emerges as a robust and stable hybrid platform. Our findings open promising pathways for room-temperature excitonic devices with enhanced performance, including quantum transducers, light-harvesting systems, and optoelectronic interconnects.</description>

      <title>A critical note on the sideband peak count-index technique: failure for nonlinear damage characterization of impacted CFRP plates</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.05611</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.05611v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: It is widely accepted, that nonlinear elastodynamic methods are superior to linear methods in detecting early stages of material deterioration. A number of recently developed methods are reported to be particularly sensitive to nonlinearities and thus appropriate to indicate early damage. We applied systematically one of the methods, the sideband peak count index (SPC-I), to a series of increasingly damaged carbon fiber reinforced plastic (CFRP) plates. Our data leads to different conclusions. The SPC-I values are influenced by (usually undocumented) variations in the index calculation procedure, which is not acceptable for a robust method. Moreover, the behavior of the index when the ultrasound amplitude is varied contradicts material nonlinearity as a direct and significant contributor to the index value. To clarify the apparent contradiction of our results with the previously published statements, it is recommended that (a) our data are re-evaluated by independent researchers and (b) the experiments already published are repeated or (if sufficient data is availThe paper has been updated for submission to NDT&amp;E.able) also re-evaluated.</description>

      <title>Fractional Chern insulator states in an isolated flat band of zero Chern number</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.09009</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.09009v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A flat band with Chern number $C=0$, and well isolated from the rest of Hilbert space by a gap much larger than interaction strength, is a context that has not been regarded as relevant for fractional quantum Hall physics. In this work, we demonstrate the emergence of the fractional Chern insulator (FCI) states in such a trivial flat band, using large-scale exact diagonalization (ED) and infinite density matrix renormalization group (iDMRG) simulations. The $C=0$ isolated flat band is hosted by an anisotropic fluxed dice lattice. Both the quantum metric and Berry curvature of the $C=0$ flat band have a sharp peak at the $\Gamma$ point, whereas in the rest of the Brillouin zone (BZ) they mimic the quantum geometry of the lowest Landau level. We consider nearest-neighbor repulsion that is weak enough to ensure the isolated-band limit is always satisfied. From the projected ED simulations at $\nu_\mathrm{F}=2/3$ electron filling of the flat band (i.e. $1/3$ hole filling), we find the unexpected FCI with 3-fold ground-state degeneracy and $\sigma_\mathrm{H}=-1/3 (e^2/h)$. The momentum space carrier distribution shows that the quantum metric peak tends to push the interacting holes away from $\Gamma$ point towards the BZ regions with the nearly ``ideal'' quantum geometry, underlying the formation of FCI in the $C=0$ flat band. Besides, when tuning the single-particle anisotropy such that the quantum geometry of the $C=0$ flat band becomes less sharp around $\Gamma$, we find the ground state becomes a charge density wave with tripled unit cell at $\nu_\mathrm{F}=2/3$. Our two-band iDMRG simulations further corroborate the FCI in the isolated $C=0$ flat band, demonstrating in such parameter regime the fractionally quantized charge pumping upon flux insertion as well as the momentum-resolved entanglement spectrum characteristic of the $1/3$ Laughlin state.</description>

      <title>Structure-Dynamics Correlation and Its Link to Fragility and Dynamic Heterogeneity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.12773</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.12773v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Understanding the connection between structure, dynamics, and fragility, the rate at which the relaxation time grows with decreasing temperature, is central to unravelling the glass transition. Fragility is often associated with dynamic heterogeneity, implying that if structure influences dynamics, more fragile systems should exhibit stronger structure dynamics correlations. In this study, we test the generality of this assumption using: Lennard Jones (LJ) and Weeks Chandler Andersen (WCA) systems, where fragility is tuned via density, and a modified LJ (q,p) system, where fragility is varied by changing the potential softness. We define a structural order parameter based on a mean field caging potential and analyse energy barriers at both macroscopic and microscopic levels. While the macroscopic free energy barrier slope correlates with fragility, the microscopic free energy barrier does not show a consistent trend. Instead, it exhibits a strong correlation with a structure dynamics correlation measure obtained from isoconfigurational ensemble simulations. Interestingly, the two systems showing the highest structure dynamics correlation, LJ at rho = 1.1 and the (8,5) model, are respectively the least and most fragile within their classes. These systems exhibit broad mobility distributions, large non Gaussian parameters, yet low four point susceptibilities, suggesting a decoupling between spatial correlation length and mobility contrast. Both systems lie in the enthalpy dominated regime and are close to the spinodal, pointing to mechanical instability as a source of heterogeneity. Our results reveal that structure dynamics correlation is more closely linked to the contrast in individual particle mobility than to the spatial extent of dynamic correlations that typically scale with fragility.</description>
