      <title>Asymptotic Product-form Steady-state for Multiclass Queueing Networks: A Reentrant Line Case Study</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.00930</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.00930v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper serves as a companion to "Asymptotic Product-form Steady-state for Multiclass Queueing Networks with SBP Service Policies in Multi-scale Heavy Traffic." In this short paper, we illustrate the main results of the main paper through a two-station, five-class reentrant line under a specific static buffer priority policy, while avoiding heavy notations. For this example, we prove the asymptotic steady-state limit and uniform moment bound under general inter-arrival and service time distributions.</description>

      <title>Gaussian universality of $p$-adic random matrix products via corners</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.01104</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.01104v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We establish the universality of the singular numbers in random matrix products over $\mathrm{GL}_n(\mathbb{Q}_p)$ as the number of products approaches infinity, with a fixed $n\ge 1$. We demonstrate that, under a broad class of distributions, which we term as ``split", the asymptotics of matrix products align with the sum of the singular numbers of the matrix corners. Specifically, when matrices are independent and identically distributed, we derive the strong law of large numbers and the central limit theorem. Our approach is inspired by Van Peski's work (arXiv:2011.09356), which examines products of $n\times n$ corners of Haar-distributed elements $\mathrm{GL}_N(\mathbb{Z}_p)$. We extend the method so that the criterion now works as long as the measures are left- and right-invariant under the multiplication of $\mathrm{GL}_n(\mathbb{Z}_p)$. Building on this approach for $\mathrm{GL}_n$, we further demonstrate similar universality for $\mathrm{GSp}_{2n}$ and discuss potential extensions to general split reductive groups.</description>

      <title>Global Dynamics of McKean-Vlasov SDEs via Stochastic Order</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.01364</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.01364v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper studies the rich dynamics of general one-dimensional McKean-Vlasov stochastic differential equations based on the preservation of stochastic order. The existing work is limited to the case of additive noises, while our framework allows multiplicative noises. When the equation has multiple invariant measures, we show basins of attraction of certain invariant measures contain unbounded open sets in the 2-Wasserstein space, which is vacant in previous research even for additive noises. Also, our main results target on total orderedness and finiteness of invariant measures, global convergence to order interval enclosed by two order-related invariant measures, alternating arrangement of invariant measures in terms of stability (locally attracting) and instability (connecting orbits). Our theorems cover a wide range of classical granular media equations, such as symmetric, flat-bottom and asymmetric double-well confinement potentials with quadratic interaction, multi-well landscapes, and double-well landscapes with perturbations. Specific values for the parameter ranges, explicit descriptions of attracting sets and phase diagrams are provided.</description>

      <title>Conformal covariance of connection probabilities in the 2D critical FK-Ising model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.01467</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.01467v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study connection probabilities between vertices of the square lattice for the critical random-cluster (FK) model with cluster weight $2$, which is related to the critical Ising model. We consider the model on the plane and on domains conformally equivalent to the upper half-plane. We prove that, when appropriately rescaled, the connection probabilities between vertices in the domain or on the boundary have nontrivial limits, as the mesh size of the square lattice is sent to zero, and that those limits are conformally covariant. Because of the relation between the FK and Ising models, this provides an alternative proof of the conformal covariance of the Ising spin correlation functions. In an appendix, we also derive exact formulas for some Ising boundary spin correlation functions.</description>

      <title>On the Limit of the Tridiagonal Model for $\beta$-Dyson Brownian Motion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.01633</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.01633v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In previous work, Edelman and Dumitriu provide a description of the result of applying the Householder tridiagonalization algorithm to a G$\beta$E random matrix. The resulting tridiagonal ensemble makes sense for all $\beta&gt;0$, and has spectrum given by the $\beta$-ensemble for all $\beta&gt;0$. Moreover, the tridiagonal model has useful stochastic operator limits introduced and analyzed by Edelman and Sutton, and subsequently analyzed in work by Ramirez, Rider, and Vir\'ag. In this work we analogously study the result of applying the Householder tridiagonalization algorithm to a G$\beta$E process which has eigenvalues governed by $\beta$-Dyson Brownian motion. We propose an explicit limit of the upper left $k \times k$ minor of the $n \times n$ tridiagonal process as $n \to \infty$ and $k$ remains fixed. We prove the result for $\beta=1$, and also provide numerical evidence for $\beta=1,2,4$. This leads us to conjecture the form of a dynamical $\beta$-stochastic Airy operator with smallest $k$ eigenvalues evolving according to the $n \to \infty$ limit of the largest, centered and re-scaled, $k$ eigenvalues of $\beta$-Dyson Brownian motion.</description>

      <title>$L^2$-Wasserstein contraction of modified Euler schemes for SDEs with high diffusivity and applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.01731</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.01731v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we are concerned with a modified Euler scheme for the SDE under consideration, where the drift is of super-linear growth and dissipative merely outside a closed ball. By adopting the synchronous coupling, along with the construction of an equivalent quasi-metric, the $L^2$-Wasserstein contraction of the modified Euler scheme is addressed provided that the diffusivity is large enough. In particular, as a by-product, the $L^2$ Wasserstein contraction of the projected (truncated) Euler scheme and the tamed Euler algorithm is treated under much more explicit conditions imposed on drifts. The theory derived on the $L^2$-Wasserstein contraction has numerous applications on various aspects. In addition to applications on Poincar\'{e} inequalities (with respect to the numerical transition kernel and the numerical invariant probability measure), concentration inequalities for empirical averages, and bounds concerning the KL-divergence, in this paper we present another two potential applications. One concerns the non-asymptotic $L^2$-Wasserstein bound corresponding to the projected Euler scheme and the tamed Euler recursion, respectively, which further implies the $L^2$-Wasserstein error bound between the exact invariant probability measure and the numerical counterpart. It is worthy to emphasize that the associated convergence rate is improved greatly in contrast to the existing literature. Another application is devoted to the strong law of large numbers of additive functionals related to the modified Euler algorithm, where the observable functions involved are allowed to be of polynomial growth, and the associated convergence rate is also enhanced remarkably.</description>

Abstract: In this paper, we establish the existence and uniqueness of solutions of elliptic-parabolic stochastic Keller-Segel systems. The solution is obtained through a carefully designed localization procedure together with some a priori estimates. Both noise of linear growth and nonlinear noise are considered.

      <description>arXiv:2411.01849v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose a tamed-adaptive Milstein scheme for stochastic differential equations in which the first-order derivatives of the coefficients are locally H\"older continuous of order $\alpha$. We show that the scheme converges in the $L_2$-norm with a rate of $(1+\alpha)/2$ over both finite intervals $[0, T]$ and the infinite interval $(0, +\infty)$, under certain growth conditions on the coefficients.</description>

      <title>Finite ergodic components for upper probabilities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.02030</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.02030v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Under the notion of ergodicity of upper probability in the sense of Feng and Zhao (2021) that any invariant set either has capacity $0$ or its complement has capacity 0, we introduce the definition of finite ergodic components (FEC). We prove an invariant upper probability has FEC if and only if it is in the regime that any invariant set has either capacity $0$ or capacity $1$, proposed by Cerreia-Vioglio, Maccheroni, and Marinacci (2016). Furthermore, this is also equivalent to that the eigenvalue $1$ of the Koopman operator is of finite multiplicity, while in the ergodic upper probability regime, as in the classical ergodic probability case, the eigenvalue $1$ of the Koopman operator is simple.
  Additionally, we obtain the equivalence of the law of large numbers with multiple values, the asymptotic independence and the FEC. Furthermore, we apply these to obtain the corresponding results for non-invariant probabilities.</description>

Abstract: This study delves into first-passage percolation (FPP) on random geometric graphs (RGGs) in the supercritical regime, where RGGs feature a unique infinite connected component. We investigate properties such as geodesic paths, moderate deviations, and fluctuations, aiming to establish a quantitative shape theorem. Furthermore, we examine fluctuations in geodesic paths and characterize the properties of spanning trees and their semi-infinite paths.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.02156v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider an outward degenerate drifted Brownian motion in the quarter plane with oblique reflections on the boundaries. In this article, we explicitly compute the Laplace transforms of the Green's functions associated with the process. These Laplace transforms are expressed as an infinite sum of products using the compensation method. We also derive the asymptotics of the Green's functions along all possible paths and determine the (minimal) Martin boundary. Finally, we provide explicit formulae for all the corresponding harmonic functions.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.00792v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: With the development of information technology, requirements for data flow have become diverse. When multiple data streams (MDS) are used, the demands of users change over time, which makes traditional teletraffic analysis not directly applicable. This paper proposes probabilistic models for the demand of MDS services, and analyzes in three states: non-tolerance, tolerance and delay. When the requirement random variables are co-distributed with respect to time, we rigorously prove the practicability of the Erlang Multirate Loss Model (EMLM) from a mathematical perspective by discretizing time and error analysis. An algorithm of pre-allocating resources for communication society is given to guild the construction of base resources.</description>

      <title>Two timescales in stochastic evolutionary games</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.01032</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.01032v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Convergence of discrete-time Markov chains with two timescales is a powerful tool to study stochastic evolutionary games in subdivided populations. Focusing on linear games within demes, convergence to a diffusion process for the strategy frequencies as the population size increases yields a strong-migration limit. The same limit is obtained for a linear game in a well-mixed population with effective payoffs that depend on reproductive values and identity measures between individuals. The first-order effect of selection on the fixation probability of a strategy introduced as a single mutant can be calculated by using the diffusion approximation, or alternatively by summing the successive expected changes in the mutant strategy frequency that involve expected coalescence times of ancestral lines under neutrality. These can be approached by resorting to the existence of two timescales in the genealogical process. Keeping the population size fixed but letting the intensity of migration go to zero, convergence to a continuous-time Markov chain after instantaneous initial transitions yields a low-migration limit that depends on fixation probabilities within demes in the absence of migration. In the limit of small uniform dispersal, the fixation probability of a mutant strategy in the whole population exceeds its initial frequency if it is risk-dominant over the other strategy with respect to the overall average payoffs in pairwise interactions. Finally, in the low-mutation limit in the presence of recurrent mutation, the average abundance of a strategy in the long run is determined by the fixation probabilities of both strategies when introduced as single mutants in a deme chosen at random.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.01355</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.01355v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider a periodic Riesz gas consisting of $N$ classical particles on a circle, interacting via a two-body repulsive potential which behaves locally as a power law of the distance, $\sim g/|x|^s$ for $s&gt;-1$. Long range (LR) interactions correspond to $s&lt;1$, short range (SR) interactions to $s&gt;1$, while the cases $s=0$ and $s=2$ describe the well-known log-gas and the Calogero-Moser (CM) model respectively. We study the fluctuations of the positions around the equally spaced crystal configuration, both for Brownian and run-and-tumble particles (RTP). Focusing on the regime of weak noise, we obtain exact expressions for the space-time correlations, both at the macroscopic and microscopic scale, for $N \gg 1$ and at fixed mean density $\rho$. They are characterized by a dynamical exponent $z_s=\min(1+s,2)$. We also obtain the gap statistics, described by a roughness exponent $\zeta_s=\frac{1}{2} \min(s,1)$. For $s&gt;0$ in the Brownian case, we find that in a broad time window, the mean square displacement of a particle is sub-diffusive as $t^{1/2}$ for SR as in single-file diffusion, and $t^{s/(1+s)}$ for LR interactions. Remarkably, this coincides, including the amplitude, with a recent prediction obtained using macroscopic fluctuation theory. These results also apply to RTPs beyond a time-scale $1/\gamma$, with $\gamma$ the tumbling rate, and a characteristic length-scale. Instead, for either shorter times or shorter distances, the active noise leads to a rich variety of static and dynamical regimes, with distinct exponents. For $-1&lt;s&lt;0$, the displacements are bounded, leading to true crystalline order at weak noise. The melting transition, recently observed numerically, is discussed in light of our calculation. Finally, we extend our method to the active Dyson Brownian motion and active CM model in a harmonic trap, generalizing to finite $\gamma$ the results of our earlier work.</description>

      <title>Some easy optimization problems have the overlap-gap property</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.01836</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.01836v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We show that the shortest $s$-$t$ path problem has the overlap-gap property in (i) sparse $\mathbf{G}(n,p)$ graphs and (ii) complete graphs with i.i.d. Exponential edge weights. Furthermore, we demonstrate that in sparse $\mathbf{G}(n,p)$ graphs, shortest path is solved by $O(\log n)$-degree polynomial estimators, and a uniform approximate shortest path can be sampled in polynomial time. This constitutes the first example in which the overlap-gap property is not predictive of algorithmic intractability for a (non-algebraic) average-case optimization problem.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.01983v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We develop a unifying framework for modeling multiple term structures arising in financial, insurance, and energy markets. We adopt the Heath-Jarrow-Morton approach under the real-world probability and provide a full description of the set of local martingale deflators, which ensure market viability. We perform a thorough analysis of the stochastic partial differential equation arising in the model, addressing existence and uniqueness of a solution, invariance properties and existence of affine realizations.</description>

      <title>Two-loop Loewner potentials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.02232</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.02232v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study a generalization of the Schramm-Loewner evolution loop measure to pairs of non-intersecting Jordan curves on the Riemann sphere. We also introduce four equivalent definitions for a two-loop Loewner potential: respectively expressing it in terms of normalized Brownian loop measure, zeta-regularized determinants of the Laplacian, an integral formula generalizing universal Liouville action, and Loewner-Kufarev energy of a foliation. Moreover, we prove that the potential is finite if and only if both loops are Weil-Petersson quasicircles, that it is an Onsager-Machlup functional for the two-loop SLE, and a variational formula involving Schwarzian derivatives.
  Addressing the question of minimization of the two-loop Loewner potential, we find that any such minimizers must be pairs of circles. However, the potential is not bounded, diverging to negative infinity as the circles move away from each other and to positive infinity as the circles merge, thus preventing a definition of two-loop Loewner energy for the prospective large deviations theory for the two-loop SLE.
  To remedy the divergence, we study a way of generalizing the two-loop Loewner potential by taking into account how conformal field theory (CFT) partition functions depend on the modulus of the annulus between the loops. This generalization is motivated by the correspondence between SLE and CFT, and it also emerges from the geometry of the real determinant line bundle as introduced by Kontsevich and Suhov.</description>

Abstract: In this work we consider loop-erased random walk (LERW) and its scaling limit in three dimensions, and prove that 3D LERW parametrized by renormalized length converges to its scaling limit parametrized by some suitable measure with respect to the uniform convergence topology in the lattice size scaling limit. Our result greatly improves the work (Acta Math. 199(1):29-152) of Gady Kozma which establishes the weak convergence of the rescaled trace of 3D LERW towards a random compact set with respect to the Hausdorff distance.</description>

      <title>Functional central limit theorems for spatial averages of the parabolic Anderson model with delta initial condition in dimension $d\geq 1$</title>

      <description>arXiv:2208.11323v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Let $\{u(t,x)\}_{t&gt;0,x\in{{\mathbb R}^{d}}}$ denote the solution to a $d$-dimensional parabolic Anderson model with delta initial condition and driven by a multiplicative noise that is white in time and has a spatially homogeneous covariance given by a nonnegative-definite measure $f$. Let $S_{N,t}:=N^{-d}\int_{{[0,N]}^d}{[U(t,x)-1]}{\rm d}x$ denote the spatial average on ${{\mathbb R}^{d}}$. We obtain various functional central limit theorems (CLTs) for spatial averages based on the quantitative analysis of $f$ and spatial dimension $d$. In particular, when $f$ is given by Riesz kernel, that is, $f({\rm x})={\Vert x \Vert}^{-\beta}{\rm d}x$, $\beta\in(0,2\wedge d)$, the functional CLT is also based on the index $\beta$.</description>

      <title>The short memory limit for long time statistics in a stochastic Coleman-Gurtin model of heat conduction</title>

      <description>arXiv:2212.05646v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider a class of semi-linear differential Volterra equations with polynomial-type potentials that incorporates the effects of memory while being subjected to random perturbations via an additive Gaussian noise. Our main study is the long time statistics of the system in the singular regime as the memory kernel collapses to a Dirac function. Specifically, we show that provided that sufficiently many directions in the phase space are stochastically forced, there is a unique invariant probability measure to which the system converges, with respect to a suitable Wasserstein-type topology, and at an exponential rate which is independent of the decay rate of the memory kernel. We then prove the convergence of this unique statistically steady state to the unique invariant probability measure of the classical stochastic reaction-diffusion equation in the zero-memory limit. Consequently, we establish the global-in-time validity of the short memory approximation.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2301.07394v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Understanding the interplay between recombination and resampling is a significant challenge in mathematical population genetics and of great practical relevance. Asymptotic results about the distribution of samples when recombination is strong compared to resampling are often based on the approximate solution of certain recursions, which is technically hard and offers little conceptual insight. This work generalises an elegant probabilistic argument, based on the coupling of ancestral processes but so far only available in the case of two sites, to the multilocus setting. This offers an alternative route to, and slightly generalises, a classical result of Bhaskar and Song.</description>

Abstract: We study fluctuations of small noise multiscale diffusions around their homogenized deterministic limit. We derive quantitative rates of convergence of the fluctuation processes to their Gaussian limits in the appropriate Wasserstein metric requiring detailed estimates of the first and second order Malliavin derivative of the slow component. We study a fully coupled system and the derivation of the quantitative rates of convergence depends on a very careful decomposition of the first and second Malliavin derivatives of the slow and fast component to terms that have different rates of convergence depending on the strength of the noise and timescale separation parameter.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2303.15898v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the properties of a subclass of stochastic processes called discrete-time nonlinear Markov chains with an aggregator. In these chains, the next period's distribution depends on both the current state and a real-valued function of the current distribution. For these chains, we provide conditions for the uniqueness of an invariant distribution that do not rely on typical contraction arguments. Instead, our approach leverages flexible monotonicity properties imposed on the nonlinear Markov kernel. We also provide existence results and introduce a straightforward computational method for finding the invariant distribution. We demonstrate the necessity of these monotonicity conditions in proving the uniqueness of an invariant distribution through simple examples. We apply our findings to analyze invariant distributions in strategic queueing systems, establish conditions under which a class of nonlinear equations in $\mathbb{R}^{n}$ has a unique solution, and examine the properties of stationary wealth distributions in large dynamic economies.</description>

      <title>Large Sample Theory for Bures-Wasserstein Barycentres</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.15592</link>
      <description>arXiv:2305.15592v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We establish a strong law of large numbers and a central limit theorem in the Bures-Wasserstein space of covariance operators -- or equivalently centred Gaussian measures -- over a general separable Hilbert space. Specifically, we show that empirical barycentre sequences indexed by sample size are almost certainly relatively compact, with accumulation points comprising population barycentres. We give a sufficient regularity condition for the limit to be unique. When the limit is unique, we also establish a central limit theorem under a refined pair of moment and regularity conditions.
  Finally, we prove strong operator convergence of the empirical optimal transport maps to their population counterparts. Though our results naturally extend finite-dimensional counterparts, including associated regularity conditions, our techniques are distinctly different owing to the functional nature of the problem in the general setting. A key element is the characterisation of compact sets in the Bures-Wasserstein topology that reflects an ordered Heine-Borel property of the Bures-Wasserstein space.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2309.16271v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this work, we develop excursion theory for the Wright--Fisher diffusion with mutation. Our construction is intermediate between the classical excursion theory where all excursions begin and end at a single point and the more general approach considering excursions of processes from general sets. Since the Wright--Fisher diffusion has two boundary points, it is natural to construct excursions which start from a specified boundary point, and end at one of two boundary points which determine the next starting point. In order to do this we study the killed Wright--Fisher diffusion, which is sent to a cemetery state whenever it hits either endpoint. We then construct a marked Poisson process of such killed paths which, when concatenated, produce a pathwise construction of the Wright--Fisher diffusion.</description>

Abstract: In this paper, we investigate the scaling limit of heavy-tailed unstable cumulative INAR($\infty$) processes. These processes exhibit a power-law tail of the form $n^{-(1+\alpha)}$ for $\alpha \in (\frac{1}{2}, 1)$, and the $\ell^1$ norm of the kernel vector approaches $1$. Our results contrast with the scaling limits of continuous-time heavy-tailed unstable Hawkes processes and those of INAR($p$) processes. We show that the discrete-time scaling limit also has a long-memory property and can be seen as an integrated fractional Cox-Ingersoll-Ross process.</description>

Abstract: We pursue the current developments in random tensor theory by laying the foundations of a free probability theory for tensors and establish its relevance in the study of random tensors of high dimension. We give a definition of freeness associated to a collection of tensors of possibly different orders. Our definition reduces to the usual freeness when only tensors of order 2 are concerned. We define the free cumulants which are associated to this notion of tensor freeness. We prove that the basic models of random tensors are asymptotically free as the dimension goes to infinity. On the way, we establish Schwinger-Dyson loop equations associated to random tensors.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.06813v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: For correlated real symmetric or complex Hermitian random matrices, we prove that the local eigenvalue statistics at any cusp singularity are universal. Since the density of states typically exhibits only square root edge or cubic root cusp singularities, our result completes the proof of the Wigner-Dyson-Mehta universality conjecture in all spectral regimes for a very general class of random matrices. Previously only the bulk and the edge universality were established in this generality [arXiv:1804.07744], while cusp universality was proven only for Wigner-type matrices with independent entries [arXiv:1809.03971, arXiv:1811.04055]. As our main technical input, we prove an optimal local law at the cusp using the Zigzag strategy, a recursive tandem of the characteristic flow method and a Green function comparison argument. Moreover, our proof of the optimal local law holds uniformly in the spectrum, thus also re-establishing universality of the local eigenvalue statistics in the previously studied bulk [arXiv:1705.10661] and edge [arXiv:1804.07744] regimes.</description>

      <title>Diffusions and random walks with prescribed sub-Gaussian heat kernel estimates</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.15611</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.15611v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Given suitable functions $V, \Psi:[0,\infty) \to [0,\infty)$, we obtain necessary and sufficient conditions on $V,\Psi$ for the existence of a metric measure space and a symmetric diffusion process that satisfies sub-Gaussian heat kernel estimates with volume growth profile $V$ and escape time profile $\Psi$. We prove sufficiency by constructing a new family of diffusions. Special cases of this construction also leads to a new family of infinite graphs whose simple random walks satisfy sub-Gaussian heat kernel estimates with prescribed volume growth and escape time profiles. In particular, these random walks on graphs generalizes earlier results of Barlow who considered the case $V(r)=r^\alpha$ and $\Psi(r)=r^\beta$ (Rev Mat Iberoam 2004). The family of diffusions we construct have martingale dimension one but can have arbitrarily high spectral dimension. Therefore our construction shows the impossibility of obtaining non-trivial lower bounds on martingale dimension in terms of spectral dimension which is in contrast with upper bounds on martingale dimension using spectral dimension obtained by Hino (Probab Theory Relat Fields 2013).</description>

      <title>A non-de Finetti theorem for countable Euclidean spaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.22930</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.22930v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The classical de Finetti Theorem classifies the $\mathrm{Sym}(\mathbb N)$-invariant probability measures on $[0,1]^{\mathbb N}$. More precisely it states that those invariant measures are combinations of measures of the form $\nu^{\otimes\mathbb N}$ where $\nu$ is a measure on $[0,1]$. Recently, Jahel--Tsankov generalized this theorem showing that under conditions on $M$, the group $\operatorname{Aut}(M)$ is de Finetti, i.e. $\operatorname{Aut}(M)$-invariant measures on $[0,1]^M$ are mixtures of measures of the form $\nu^{\otimes M}$ where $\nu$ is a measure on $[0,1]$. In this note, we give an example of a non-de Finetti non-Archimedean group.</description>

      <title>Interpretation of generalized Langevin equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2210.03781</link>
      <description>arXiv:2210.03781v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Many real-world systems exhibit ``noisy'' evolution in time; interpreting their finitely-sampled behavior as arising from continuous-time processes (in the It\^o or Stratonovich sense) has led to significant success in modeling and analysis in a wide variety of fields. Yet such interpretation hinges on a fundamental linear separation of randomness from determinism in the underlying dynamics. Here we propose some theoretical systems which resist easy and self-consistent interpretation into this well-defined class of equations, requiring an expansion of the interpretive framework. We argue that a wider class of stochastic differential equations, where evolution depends nonlinearly on a random or effectively-random quantity, may be consistently interpreted and in fact exhibit finite-time stochastic behavior in line with an equivalent It\^o process, at which point many existing numerical and analytical techniques may be used. We put forward a method for this conversion, and demonstrate its use on both a toy system and on a system of direct physical relevance: the velocity of a meso-scale particle suspended in a turbulent fluid. This work enables the theoretical and numerical examination of a wide class of mathematical models which might otherwise be oversimplified due to a lack of appropriate tools.</description>

      <title>An Instance-Based Approach to the Trace Reconstruction Problem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.14277</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.14277v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In the trace reconstruction problem, one observes the output of passing a binary string $s \in \{0,1\}^n$ through a deletion channel $T$ times and wishes to recover $s$ from the resulting $T$ "traces." Most of the literature has focused on characterizing the hardness of this problem in terms of the number of traces $T$ needed for perfect reconstruction either in the worst case or in the average case (over input sequences $s$). In this paper, we propose an alternative, instance-based approach to the problem. We define the "Levenshtein difficulty" of a problem instance $(s,T)$ as the probability that the resulting traces do not provide enough information for correct recovery with full certainty. One can then try to characterize, for a specific $s$, how $T$ needs to scale in order for the Levenshtein difficulty to go to zero, and seek reconstruction algorithms that match this scaling for each $s$. We derive a lower bound on the Levenshtein difficulty, and prove that $T$ needs to scale exponentially fast in $n$ for the Levenshtein difficulty to approach zero for a very broad class of strings. For a class of binary strings with alternating long runs, we design an algorithm whose probability of reconstruction error approaches zero whenever the Levenshtein difficulty approaches zero. For this class, we also prove that the error probability of this algorithm decays to zero at least as fast as the Levenshtein difficulty.</description>

      <title>The Harnack inequality fails for nonlocal kinetic equations</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.05223v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We prove that the Harnack inequality fails for nonlocal kinetic equations. Such equations arise as linearized models for the Boltzmann equation without cutoff and are of hypoelliptic type. We provide a counterexample for the simplest equation in this theory, the fractional Kolmogorov equation. Our result reflects a purely nonlocal phenomenon since the Harnack inequality holds true for local kinetic equations like the Kolmogorov equation.</description>

      <title>IID Prophet Inequality with Random Horizon: Going Beyond Increasing Hazard Rates</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.11752</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.11752v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Prophet inequalities are a central object of study in optimal stopping theory. In the iid model, a gambler sees values in an online fashion, sampled independently from a given distribution. Upon observing each value, the gambler either accepts it as a reward or irrevocably rejects it and proceeds to observe the next value. The goal of the gambler, who cannot see the future, is maximising the expected value of the reward while competing against the expectation of a prophet (the offline maximum). In other words, one seeks to maximise the gambler-to-prophet ratio of the expectations.
  This model has been studied with infinite, finite and unknown number of values. When the gambler faces a random number of values, the model is said to have random horizon. We consider the model in which the gambler is given a priori knowledge of the horizon's distribution. Alijani et al. (2020) designed a single-threshold algorithms achieving a ratio of $1/2$ when the random horizon has an increasing hazard rate and is independent of the values. We prove that with a single-threshold, a ratio of $1/2$ is actually achievable for several larger classes of horizon distributions, with the largest being known as the $\mathcal{G}$ class in reliability theory. Moreover, we extend this result to its dual, the $\overline{\mathcal{G}}$ class (which includes the decreasing hazard rate class), and to low-variance horizons. Finally, we construct the first example of a family of horizons, for which multiple thresholds are necessary to achieve a nonzero ratio. We establish that the Secretary Problem optimal stopping rule provides one such algorithm, paving the way towards the study of the model beyond single-threshold algorithms.</description>

      <title>A new unit-bimodal distribution based on correlated Birnbaum-Saunders random variables</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.00100</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.00100v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we propose a new distribution over the unit interval which can be characterized as a ratio of the type $Z=Y/(X+Y)$ where $X$ and $Y$ are two correlated Birnbaum-Saunders random variables. The density of $Z$ may be unimodal or bimodal. Simple expressions for the cumulative distribution function, moment-generating function and moments are obtained. Moreover, the stress-strength probability between $X$ and $Y$ is calculated explicitly in the symmetric case, that is, when the respective scale parameters are equal. Two applications of the ratio distribution are discussed.</description>

      <title>New matrix perturbation bounds via combinatorial expansion I: Perturbation of eigenspaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.20207</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.20207v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Matrix perturbation bounds (such as Weyl and Davis-Kahan) are frequently used in many branches of mathematics. Most of the classical results in this area are optimal, in the worst case analysis. However, in modern applications, both the ground and the nose matrices frequently have extra structural properties. For instance, it is often assumed that the ground matrix is essentially low rank, and the nose matrix is random or pseudo-random. We aim to rebuild a part of perturbation theory, adapting to these modern assumptions. The key idea is to exploit the skewness between the leading eigenvectors of the ground matrix and the noise matrix. We will do this by combining the classical contour integration method with combinatorial ideas, resulting in a new machinery, which has a wide range of applications. Our new bounds are optimal under mild assumptions, with direct applications to central problems in many different areas. Among others, we derive a sharp result for the perturbation of a low rank matrix with random perturbation, answering an open question in this area. Next, we derive new, optimal, results concerning covariance estimator of the spiked model, an important model in statistics, bridging two different directions of current research. Finally, and somewhat unexpectedly, we can use our results on the perturbation of eigenspaces to derive new results concerning eigenvalues of deterministic and random matrices. In particular, we obtain new results concerning the outliers in the deformed Wigner model and the least singular value of random matrices with non-zero mean.</description>

      <title>Regularized e-processes: anytime valid inference with knowledge-based efficiency gains</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.01427</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.01427v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Classical statistical methods have theoretical justification when the sample size is predetermined. In applications, however, it's often the case that sample sizes aren't predetermined; instead, they're often data-dependent. Since those methods designed for static sample sizes aren't reliable when sample sizes are dynamic, there's been recent interest in e-processes and corresponding tests and confidence sets that are anytime valid in the sense that their justification holds up for arbitrary dynamic data-collection plans. But if the investigator has relevant-yet-incomplete prior information about the quantity of interest, then there's an opportunity for efficiency gain, but existing approaches can't accommodate this. The present paper offer a new, regularized e-process framework that features a knowledge-based, imprecise-probabilistic regularization with improved efficiency. A generalized version of Ville's inequality is established, ensuring that inference based on the regularized e-process remains anytime valid in a novel, knowledge-dependent sense. In addition, the proposed regularized e-processes facilitate possibility-theoretic uncertainty quantification with strong frequentist-like calibration properties and other desirable Bayesian-like features: satisfies the likelihood principle, avoids sure-loss, and offers formal decision-making with reliability guarantees.</description>
