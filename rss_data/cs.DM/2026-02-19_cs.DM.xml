      <title>Computing Approximate Pareto Frontiers for Submodular Utility and Cost Tradeoffs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.15964</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.15964v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In many data-mining applications, including recommender systems, influence maximization, and team formation, the goal is to pick a subset of elements (e.g., items, nodes in a network, experts to perform a task) to maximize a monotone submodular utility function while simultaneously minimizing a cost function. Classical formulations model this tradeoff via cardinality or knapsack constraints, or by combining utility and cost into a single weighted objective. However, such approaches require committing to a specific tradeoff in advance and return only a single solution, offering limited insight into the space of viable utility-cost tradeoffs. In this paper, we depart from the single-solution paradigm and examine the problem of computing representative sets of high-quality solutions that expose different tradeoffs between submodular utility and cost. For this, we introduce $(\alpha_1,\alpha_2)$-approximate Pareto frontiers that provably approximate the achievable tradeoffs between submodular utility and cost. Specifically, we formalize the Pareto-$\langle f,c \rangle$ problem and develop efficient algorithms for multiple instantiations arising from different combinations of submodular utility $f$ and cost functions $c$. Our results offer a principled and practical framework for understanding and exploiting utility-cost tradeoffs in submodular optimization. Experiments on datasets from diverse application domains demonstrate that our algorithms efficiently compute approximate Pareto frontiers in practice.</description>

      <title>The Smallest String Attractors of Fibonacci and Period-Doubling Words</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.16152</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.16152v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A string attractor of a string $T[1..|T|]$ is a set of positions $\Gamma$ of $T$ such that any substring $w$ of $T$ has an occurrence that crosses a position in $\Gamma$, i.e., there is a position $i$ such that $w = T[i..i+|w|-1]$ and the intersection $[i,i+|w|-1]\cap \Gamma$ is nonempty. The size of the smallest string attractor of Fibonacci words is known to be $2$. We completely characterize the set of all smallest string attractors of Fibonacci words, and show a recursive formula describing the $2^{n-4} + 2^{\lceil n/2 \rceil - 2}$ distinct position pairs that are the smallest string attractors of the $n$th Fibonacci word for $n \geq 7$. Similarly, the size of the smallest string attractor of period-doubling words is known to be $2$. We also completely characterize the set of all smallest string attractors of period-doubling words, and show a formula describing the two distinct position pairs that are the smallest string attractors of the $n$th period-doubling word for $n\geq 2$. Our results show that strings with the same smallest attractor size can have a drastically different number of distinct smallest attractors.</description>

      <title>Randomized Zero Forcing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.16300</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.16300v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce randomized zero forcing (RZF), a stochastic color-change process on directed graphs in which a white vertex turns blue with probability equal to the fraction of its incoming neighbors that are blue. Unlike probabilistic zero forcing, RZF is governed by in-neighborhood structure and can fail to propagate globally due to directionality. The model extends naturally to weighted directed graphs by replacing neighbor counts with incoming weight proportions. We study the expected propagation time of RZF, establishing monotonicity properties with respect to enlarging the initial blue set and increasing weights on edges out of initially blue vertices, as well as invariances that relate weighted and unweighted dynamics. Exact values and sharp asymptotics are obtained for several families of directed graphs, including arborescences, stars, paths, cycles, and spiders, and we derive tight extremal bounds for unweighted directed graphs in terms of basic parameters such as order, degree, and radius. We conclude with an application to an empirical input-output network, illustrating how expected propagation time under RZF yields a dynamic, process-based notion of centrality in directed weighted systems.</description>

      <title>Fast Shortest Path in Graphs With Sparse Signed Tree Models and Applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.16605</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.16605v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A signed tree model of a graph $G$ is a compact binary structure consisting of a rooted binary tree whose leaves are bijectively mapped to the vertices of $G$, together with 2-colored edges $xy$, called transversal pairs, interpreted as bicliques or anti-bicliques whose sides are the leaves of the subtrees rooted at $x$ and at $y$. We design an algorithm that, given such a representation of an $n$-vertex graph $G$ with $p$ transversal pairs and a source $v \in V(G)$, computes a shortest-path tree rooted at $v$ in $G$ in time $O(p \log n)$. A wide variety of graph classes are such that for all $n$, their $n$-vertex graphs admit signed tree models with $O(n)$ transversal pairs: for instance, those of bounded symmetric difference, more generally of bounded sd-degeneracy, as well as interval graphs.
  As applications of our Single-Source Shortest Path algorithm and new techniques, we
  - improve the runtime of the fixed-parameter algorithm for first-order model checking on graphs given with a witness of low merge-width from cubic [Dreier and Toru\'nczyk, STOC '25] to quadratic;
  - give an $O(n^2 \log n)$-time algorithm for All-Pairs Shortest Path (APSP) on graphs given with a witness of low merge-width, generalizing a result known on twin-width [Twin-Width III, SICOMP '24];
  - extend and simplify an $O(n^2 \log n)$-time algorithm for multiplying two $n \times n$ matrices $A, B$ of bounded twin-width in [Twin-Width V, STACS '23]: now $A$ solely has to be an adjacency matrix of a graph of bounded twin-width and $B$ can be arbitrary;
  - give an $O(n^2 \log^2 n)$-time algorithm for APSP on graphs of bounded twin-width, bypassing the need for contraction sequences in [Twin-Width III, SICOMP '24; Bannach et al. STACS '24];
  - give an $O(n^{7/3} \log^2 n)$-time algorithm for APSP on graphs of symmetric difference $O(n^{1/3})$.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.06961</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.06961v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Arranging the bits of a random string or real into k columns of a two-dimensional array or higher dimensional structure is typically accompanied with loss in the Kolmogorov complexity of the columns, which depends on k. We quantify and characterize this phenomenon for arrays and trees and its relationship to negligible classes.</description>
