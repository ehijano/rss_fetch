      <title>Topological Defects from Quantum Reset Dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.00230</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.00230v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We analyze mechanisms for universal out-of-equilibrium dynamics near criticality by exploring the effect of randomized quantum resetting (QR) under a finite-time quench across a quantum phase transition. Using the transverse-field Ising chain as a generic model and exploiting its exact solution, QR is found to cause a crossover of the scaling of the topological defect density with the time scale $\tau$ of the quench, from Kibble-Zurek to anti-Kibble-Zurek scaling as $\tau$ increases. This reflects a competition between non-adiabatic quench-driven excitations and QR, giving rise to local minima of the defect densities at optimal annealing times. These times and the corresponding local minima are shown to scale as universal power laws with the rate of QR. Additional results for the scaling of the mean excess energy suggest that a system driven across a quantum critical point exhibits the same scaling behavior under a linear quench with QR as with uncorrelated noise.</description>

      <title>Deriving Reliable Nucleation Rates from Metadynamics Simulations: Application to Yukawa Fluids</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.00354</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.00354v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In order to solidify the usefulness of metadynamics in studying nucleation of crystals from supercooled liquids, we provide a specific procedure to calculate nucleation free energy barriers. After a pedagogical review of the important elements of classical nucleation theory and how metadynamics is used to find nucleation free energy barriers, we explain the benefits of local collective variables over more common global collective variables. We show how a metadynamics free energy barrier must be carefully postprocessed so that classical nucleation theory can be applied to calculate nucleation rates. We apply our procedure to a Yukawa plasma and show that a particular physically-motivated fit to metadynamics data reproduces low-temperature reference data, justifying the usefulness of metadynamics to predict nucleation rates and the nucleation critical temperature.</description>

      <title>Memory effects govern scale-free dynamics beyond universality classes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.00374</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.00374v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Scale-invariant avalanches -- with events of all sizes following power-law distributions -- are considered critical. Above the upper critical dimension of four, the mean-field solution with a robust $3/2$ size exponent describes the dynamics. In two and three dimensions, spatial constraints yield smaller yet robust exponent values governed by universality classes. However, both earthquake data and experiments often show exponent values larger than $3/2$, challenging those theoretical arguments based on critical behavior. Through extensive simulations in the classical OFC earthquake model, here we show a clear transition from the theoretical expected behavior of a robust exponent value, to a regime of quasi-critical dynamics with larger than $3/2$ exponents that depend on dissipation. While the first critical regime exhibits an inherently memoryless behavior, both the transition and the second regime are driven by memory effects provoked by the growth of avalanches over the traces left by previous events, due to dissipative mechanisms. The system hovers at a distance $d_{cp}$ from the critical point, and accounting for a power-law distribution of $d_{cp}$, validated by susceptibility measurements, captures the transition. This framework provides a unified description of both critical and quasi-critical behavior, and thus of the full spectrum of scale-free dynamics observed in nature.</description>

      <title>Observing quantum phase transitions at non-zero temperature: non-analytic behavior of order-parameter correlation times</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.00794</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.00794v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Phase transitions occur when a macroscopic number of local degrees of freedom coherently change their behavior. In ground states of quantum many-body systems, phase transitions due to quantum fluctuations are observed as non-analytic behaviors of order parameters, such as magnetization, as functions of a conjugate parameter, such as the magnetic field. However, as soon as thermal fluctuations are present, these effects are believed to disappear for local observables. We show that this is not necessarily the case: order parameters may still show non-analytic behaviors within their dynamics. With the example of the Ising model and using methods based on hydrodynamic fluctuations, we evaluate the exact order-parameter correlation time, in space-time directions of all velocities, in equilibrium states at nonzero temperature. We reveal non-analytic behaviors of spin correlation times as functions of the magnetic field, velocity, and temperature. As a function of the magnetic field, they occur at values that continuously approach that of the zero-temperature equilibrium transition point as the velocity is decreased and reach it within the light cone, where we obtain a new, temperature-independent logarithmic divergence characterizing the collective dynamics. Thus, collective effects induced by quantum fluctuations persist within the dynamics of local observables.</description>

      <title>Critical Temperatures from Domain-Wall Microstate Counting: A Topological Solution for the Potts Universality Class</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.00962</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.00962v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We derive a universal relation for the critical temperatures of the $q$-state Potts model based on the counting of domain-wall microstates. By balancing interface energy against configurational entropy, we show that the critical temperature is determined by the ratio of the coordination-dependent energy cost to the logarithm of a total multiplicity factor. This factor decomposes into a lattice-topological constant, representing a projection from an underlying orthogonal Euclidean space, and a term representing Markovian sampling in the $q$-dimensional state space. The framework recovers exact solutions for two-dimensional square, triangular, and honeycomb lattices and achieves sub-3\% accuracy for three-dimensional simple cubic, bcc, fcc, and diamond geometries. This approach unifies the Potts universality class into a single geometric classification, revealing that the phase transition is governed by the saturation of interface propagation through the lattice manifold and providing a predictive tool that characterizes the entire $q$-state family from a single topological calibration.</description>

      <title>Leaves of preferential attachment trees</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.01021</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.01021v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We provide a local probabilistic description of the limiting statistics of large preferential attachment trees in terms of the ordinary degree (number of neighbors) but augmented with information on leafdegree (number of neighbors that are leaves). The full description is the joint degree-leafdegree distribution $n_{k,\ell}$, which we derive from its associated multivariate generating function. From $n_{k,\ell}$ we obtain the leafdegree distribution, $m_{\ell}$, as well as the fraction of vertices that are protected (nonleaves with leafdegree zero) as a function of degree, $n_{k,0}$, among numerous other results. We also examine fluctuations and concentration of joint degree-leafdegree empirical counts $N_{k,\ell}$. Although our main findings pertain to the preferential attachment tree, the approach we present is highly generalizable and can characterize numerous existing models, in addition to facilitating the development of tractable new models. We further demonstrate the approach by analyzing $n_{k,\ell}$ in two other models: the random recursive tree, and a redirection-based model.</description>

      <title>Topological Quantum Criticality in Quasiperiodic Ising Chain</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.01223</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.01223v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Topological classifications of quantum critical systems have recently attracted growing interest, as they go beyond the traditional paradigms of condensed matter and statistical physics. However, such classifications remain largely unexplored at critical points in aperiodic environments, particularly under quasiperiodic modulations. In this Letter, we uncover a novel class of topological quasiperiodic fixed points that are intermediate between the clean and infinite-randomness limits. By exactly solving the quasiperiodic cluster-Ising chain, we unambiguously demonstrate that all phase boundaries separating quasiperiodically modulated phases are governed by a new family of topological Ising-like fixed points unique to strongly modulated quasiperiodic systems: Despite exhibiting indistinguishable bulk critical properties, these fixed points host robust topological edge degeneracies and are therefore topologically distinct from previously recognized quasiperiodic universality classes, as further supported by complementary lattice simulations.</description>

      <title>Superstable Geometry in Triadic Percolation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.01374</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.01374v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Triadic percolation turns bond percolation into a dynamical problem governed by an effective one-dimensional unimodal map. We show that the geometry of superstable cycles provides a direct, map-agnostic probe of local nonlinearity: specifically, the distance from the map's maximum to a distinguished next-to-maximum point on the attracting $2^n$-cycle (which coincides with a preimage of the maximum at $2^n$-superstability) scales as $|\Delta p|^{\gamma}$ with $\gamma = 1/z$, where $z$ is the nonflat order of the maximum. This prediction is verified across canonical unimodal families and heterogeneous triadic ensembles, with Lyapunov spectra corroborating the one-dimensional reduction. A derivative condition on the activation kernel fixes the local nonlinearity order $z$ (and thus, under standard unimodal-map hypotheses, the associated $z$-logistic universality class) and gives conditions under which $z&gt;2$ can be realized. The diagnostic operates directly on orbit data under standard regularity assumptions, providing a practical tool to classify universality in higher-order networks.</description>

      <title>Internal Trajectories and Observation Effects in Langevin Splitting Schemes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.01923</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.01923v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Langevin integrators based on operator splitting are widely used in molecular dynamics. This work examines Langevin splitting schemes from the perspective of their internal trajectories and observation points, complementing existing generator-based analyses. By exploiting merging, splitting, and cyclic permutation of elementary update operators, formally distinct schemes can be grouped according to identical or closely related trajectories. Accuracy differences arising from momentum updates and observation points are quantified for configurational sampling, free-energy estimates, and transition rates. While modern Langevin integrators are remarkably stable under standard simulation conditions, subtle but systematic biases emerge at large friction coefficients and time steps. These results clarify when accuracy differences between splitting schemes matter in practice and provide an intuitive framework for understanding observation effects.</description>

      <title>Quantum Geometric Entropy Production and Entropy Hall Effect</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.02040</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.02040v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum geometry, encoded in the Berry curvature and quantum metric, has unified diverse anomalous transport phenomena in solids, yet a microscopic quantum-geometric theory of entropy transport for Bloch electrons is still lacking. We formulate an entropy continuity equation for noninteracting fermions driven by an electric field, starting from the von Neumann entropy, and obtain quantum-mechanical expressions for the entropy current density and entropy production rate. Introducing relaxation through a relaxation-time dissipator, we identify the quantum metric as the origin of the leading entropy production, providing a direct microscopic diagnostic of dissipation in both the extrinsic Drude response and an intrinsic nonlinear Ohmic contribution controlled by quantum metric. We further predict an entropy Hall effect arising from the Berry curvature and show that it obeys an Onsager reciprocal relation with the anomalous Nernst effect under a temperature gradient. Finally, we establish universal relations connecting entropy and charge currents under DC and AC driving, offering experimentally accessible probes of quantum geometry through nonequilibrium entropy flow.</description>

      <title>Mandelbrot, Financial Markets and the Origins of "Econophysics"</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.02078</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.02078v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This text revisits the origins of econophysics through the figure of Beno\^it Mandelbrot, not as the father of fractals, but as the instigator of a distinctive scientific posture. The guiding thread is methodological: accept the stubborn features of the data and use models as instruments for intuition rather than as axiomatic certificates of truth. In this perspective, scaling, intermittency and extremes are not peripheral imperfections around a well-behaved equilibrium; they are the very texture of economic and financial fluctuations. This naturally shifts attention from exogenous narratives to endogenous dynamics: interactions, feedback loops, and collective amplification mechanisms that can make systems intrinsically {\it fragile}. We argue that the importation of concepts from statistical physics -- criticality, disorder, emergence, multiplicative cascades -- should be read not as an artificial transposition but as a candid attempt to look for generic mechanisms compatible with empirical regularities observed across scales, from markets to macroeconomic aggregates.</description>

      <title>Renewal theory for a run-and-tumble particle with stochastic resetting and a sticky boundary</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.02446</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.02446v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider a run-and-tumble particle (RTP) with stochastic resetting confined to the half line $[0,\infty)$ with a sticky boundary at $x=0$. In the bulk the RTP tumbles at a constant rate $\alpha&gt;0$ between velocity states $\pm v$ with $v&gt;0$ and randomly resets to its initial position and orientation $(x_0,k_0)\in(\mathbb{R}^+,\pm)$. When the RTP reaches the target at $x=0$ it attaches to the boundary for a random waiting time before either detaching and continuing to navigate the bulk domain or (permanently) entering the target. These events are the analogs of adsorption, desorption, and absorption of a particle by a partially reactive surface in physical chemistry. We use renewal theory to characterize the particle trajectory in terms of successive binding events under two distinct desorption protocols: via resetting to $(x_0,k_0)$ and via continuous movement from $x=0$ with velocity $+v$. First we derive the nonequilibrum stationary state (NESS) in the case of no absorption and characterize the accumulation at the boundary. Second, we compute the mean first passage time (MFPT) statistics. In addition to observing the usual unimodal dependence of the MFPT on bulk resetting, both the NESS and MFPT strongly depend on the initial orientation $k_0$ and the desorption protocol. For instance, if the initial orientation is toward the boundary, we find that the desorption-induced resetting protocol can reduce the MFPT more effectively than the non-resetting desorption protocol. We also show how matching the desorption kinetics with the bulk resetting or tumbling rate introduces a trade-off between minimizing the adsorption and absorption times. In this setting we find that the desorption protocol which minimizes the absorption MFPT for a given set of parameters is almost always the opposite of that favored when desorption and bulk kinetics are not the same.</description>

      <title>Resolution of the Two-Dimensional Ferromagnetic Spin-3/2 Ising Model via Cluster Growth</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.02460</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.02460v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose a computational methodology based on a hierarchical cluster growth process to solve spin-3/2 Ising models efficiently. The method circumvents the exponential complexity (\(4^{N}\)) of the canonical ensemble partition function by iteratively constructing finite magnetic clusters of size \(N_g\), where the effective spin state of a site in generation \(g+1\) is determined by the local magnetization of a cluster from generation \(g\). This approach, which shares conceptual ground with effective field theories, allows the study of systems of effectively very large size \(N = N_0 (N_g)^{g}\). We apply the formalism to the ferromagnetic spin-3/2 Ising model on a honeycomb lattice, modeling the monolayer CrI$_3$, a prototypical two-dimensional Ising magnet. The model, calibrated using the experimental transition temperature (\(T_{c} \simeq 45\) K), successfully reproduces key experimental features: the temperature dependence of the magnetization \(m(T)\), including its inflection point, and the broadened peak in the specific heat \(c_v(T)\). We also compute the entropy \(s(T)\), finding a finite residual value at low temperatures consistent with the system's double degeneracy. Our results demonstrate that this hierarchical cluster method provides a quantitatively accurate and computationally efficient framework for studying complex magnetic systems.</description>

      <title>Signatures of coherent initial ensembles on all work moments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.00227</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.00227v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Standard treatments of quantum work using projective energy measurements erase initial coherence and alter the dynamics, thereby failing to capture the thermodynamic effects of coherent superpositions of energy eigenstates in an ensemble of initial states. In this article, we use an operational work definition that is non-intrusive, applying it to the case of a driven dissipative qubit, where the qubit's initial preparation comprises coherent superposition states, while the driving is coherence-less. We derive an evolution equation for the moment generating function for this work, faithfully capturing the thermodynamic signature of coherent superpositions in the initial ensemble. We demonstrate that different initial ensembles that correspond to the same density matrix upon ensemble average, while having the same average work, display different work fluctuations. For monotonic driving, we show that fluctuations are maximum for coherence-less initial ensembles. As an application, we consider quantum bit-erasure in finite time and demonstrate significantly different work statistics for erasing a classical bit of information versus a Haar random initial ensemble. Our results indicate that coherence in the initial ensemble can be utilized as a resource for thermodynamic precision without incurring additional dissipative work costs. We also obtain a generalized fluctuation theorem that establishes a new quantum lower bound on the mean dissipated work. This bound, counterintuitively, is also applicable to a "classical" initial ensemble with the same initial density matrix and is connected to quantum absolute irreversibility.</description>

      <title>Discrete holography and density of states in the crossover from hyperbolic to Euclidean lattices</title>

      <description>arXiv:2602.00231v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study tight-binding models in the crossover from hyperbolic to Euclidean lattices, realized through the successive insertion of Euclidean defects into hyperbolic lattices. We analyze how the holographic two-point boundary correlation function and bulk density of states evolve as defects are gradually introduced. We find that bulk properties are strongly affected by the presence of Euclidean defects, whereas boundary observables remain remarkably robust even at high defect fractions. This robustness indicates that essential features of boundary physics on hyperbolic lattices, which capture aspects of AdS/CFT-like dualities in discrete systems, can be reproduced both experimentally and numerically without requiring perfectly hyperbolic lattices, thereby reducing the system size needed for implementation.</description>

      <title>Complexity of Quantum Trajectories</title>

      <description>arXiv:2602.00232v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Open quantum systems can be described by unraveling Lindblad master equations into ensembles of quantum trajectories. Here we investigate how the complexity of such trajectories is affected by conservation laws and other dynamical constraints of the underlying Lindblad evolution. We characterize this complexity using a data-driven approach based on the intrinsic dimension, defined as the minimal number of variables required to encode the information contained in a data set. Applying this framework to several systems, including dissipative variants of the quantum top and of the XXZ chain, we find that the intrinsic dimension is sensitive to the structure of their dynamics. The Lindblad evolution in these systems is typically chaotic, but additional constraints arise at specific parameter values, where the dynamics becomes integrable, exhibits Hilbert-space fragmentation, or develops a closed BBGKY hierarchy, leading to pronounced minima in the intrinsic dimension. Our approach results in an unsupervised probe of the complexity of dissipative quantum systems that is sensitive to chaos and ergodicity breaking phenomena beyond the initial transient regime.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2602.00258v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We establish a direct connection between the Feynman-Vernon path integral formalism for open quantum systems and the Wiener path integral used in classical stochastic dynamics. By considering a generalized influence functional in the strong decoherence limit, we demonstrate that integrating over the quantum coherence length leads to a derivation of stochastic Langevin dynamics. Specifically, we show that the quantum Feynman measure transforms into the stochastic Wiener measure. Applying this framework to the Wigner function representation, we show that the system follows a stochastic path interpretable via classical probability theory. Finally, we address the inverse problem: constructing an equivalent quantum influence functional from a given classical Langevin equation.</description>

      <title>Predicting the hydrogen bond strength from water reorientation dynamics at short timescales</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.00311</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.00311v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Path-integral molecular dynamics simulations and electronic structure-based energy decomposition analysis (EDA) are employed to connect hydrogen bond (H-bond) strength, its asymmetry, and the total delocalization energy at the water/air interface to experimentally measurable observables, such as the reorientation dynamics and the sum-frequency generation (SFG) spectrum. Using SFG spectra for distinct layers at the water/air interface, we validate the accuracy of our simulations and report a red-shift from the interface to bulk and a strongly bonded water peak at around 3250 cm$^{-1}$ in the layer closest to bulk. The reorientation dynamics of water molecules slow down from the interface to bulk, which correlates with the SFG results. From our EDA based on absolutely localized molecular orbitals, we observe a strong decline in total delocalization energy from bulk to the interface, as well as a decline in the strength of the strongest donor and acceptor interactions. The asymmetry between the two strongest interactions similarly rises towards the interface, while the importance of interactions from the outer solvation shells is greatly diminished and is lower than previously reported. Finally, we find that the strength of the strongest H-bond donor/acceptor is best correlated with the local minimum of the autocorrelation function resembling the L2 band librational motions. Following that, we propose a simple yet quantitative relationship between H-bond strength and the short-time reorientation dynamics at the water/air interface that could potentially be extended to predict H-bond strength in other hydrophobic systems from experimentally obtainable observables.</description>

      <title>Many-body contributions to polymorphism and polyhexaticity in a water monolayer</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.00320</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.00320v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Nanoconfined water plays a crucial role in nanofluidics, biology, and cutting-edge technologies. The process of melting water monolayers and quasi-two-dimensional confined water involves, as an intermediate stage, the hexatic phase--a state that lies between solid and liquid and is characterized by quasi-long-range orientational order and short-range translational order. However, the influence of hydrogen bond (HB) cooperativity in this process has not been thoroughly investigated. This gap hampers our understanding of the phase behavior of confined water and limits the accuracy of our models. To address this, we extend the water model developed by Franzese and Stanley, which explicitly includes many-body interactions (MBIs) of HBs. We distinguish the contributions of three-body and five-body HB-MBIs. Our Monte Carlo calculations in the isobaric-isothermal ensemble produces a detailed pressure-temperature phase diagram, revealing polymorphism and polyhexaticity: low-density square ice and high-density triangular ice are separated from the liquid phase by distinct hexatic phases. Three-body interactions notably promote crystallization and can destabilize the low-density hexatic phase, while cooperative five-body interactions help restore it, thus modifying the thermodynamic landscape. These findings demonstrate that HB-MBIs are key in determining the phase behavior of confined water, influencing phenomena such as the non-monotonic specific heat, maximum density lines, and the accessibility of the liquid-liquid critical point. Beyond advancing theoretical understanding, these results have wide-ranging implications for nanofluidics, interfacial science, and applications in biology, food technology, and pharmaceutics, where controlling water under confinement is essential.</description>

      <title>Unified origin of negative energetic elasticity in a lattice polymer chain: soft self-repulsion and bending stiffness</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.00553</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.00553v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study a single lattice polymer chain under a fixed end-to-end distance, incorporating both Domb--Joyce (DJ) soft-core self-repulsion between polymer segments and a local bending-energy cost. By decomposing the stiffness into energetic and entropic contributions, we survey the parameter space defined by the self-repulsion strength and bending-energy cost. We find that the energetic contribution to stiffness is negative across the entire explored range, whereas the entropic contribution remains positive. These results unify two previously independent mechanisms of negative energetic elasticity -- solvent-induced self-repulsion and bending stiffness -- and demonstrate that either mechanism alone, as well as their combination, produces the same sign. Beyond this sign-level unification, we analyze the internal-energy scaling and show that, in the absence of the bending-energy term, the DJ (self-repulsion) limit exhibits a robust $(n-r)^{7/4}/n$ scaling collapse. In contrast, the introduction of finite bending stiffness progressively disrupts this scaling, providing an internal-energy-based diagnostic to distinguish between contributions from self-repulsion and bending stiffness.</description>

Abstract: I study via Langevin dynamics simulations two opposite cases of systems of particles that alternate their identity according to density dependent motility (DDM) rules and interact via a soft repulsive potential. In the correlated case, dilute regions are passive and dense regions are active, while in the anti-correlated case, dilute regions are active and dense regions are passive. I classify the emerging steady states, explain the principal phase transitions, and finally suggest directions for further investigation.</description>

      <title>Reshaping Global Loop Structure to Accelerate Local Optimization by Smoothing Rugged Landscapes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.01490</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.01490v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Probabilistic graphical models with frustration exhibit rugged energy landscapes that trap iterative optimization dynamics. These landscapes are shaped not only by local interactions, but crucially also by the global loop structure of the graph. The famous Bethe approximation treats the graph as a tree, effectively ignoring global structure, thereby limiting its effectiveness for optimization. Loop expansions capture such global structure in principle, but are often impractical due to combinatorial explosion. The $M$-layer construction provides an alternative: make $M$ copies of the graph and reconnect edges between them uniformly at random. This provides a controlled sequence of approximations from the original graph at $M=1$, to the Bethe approximation as $M \rightarrow \infty$. Here we generalize this construction by replacing uniform random rewiring with a structured mixing kernel $Q$ that sets the probability that any two layers are interconnected. As a result, the global loop structure can be shaped without modifying local interactions. We show that, after this copy-and-reconnect transformation, there exists a regime in which layer-to-layer fluctuations decay, increasing the probability of reaching the global minimum of the energy function of the original graph. This yields a highly general and practical tool for optimization. Using this approach, the computational cost required to reach these optimal solutions is reduced across sparse and dense Ising benchmarks, including spin glasses and planted instances. When combined with replica-exchange Monte Carlo, the same construction increases the polynomial-time algorithmic threshold for the maximum independent set problem. A cavity analysis shows that structured inter-layer coupling significantly smooths rugged energy landscapes by collapsing configurational complexity and suppressing many suboptimal metastable states.</description>

      <title>Finite-Size Scaling of the Full Eigenstate Thermalization in Quantum Spin Chains</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.01809</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.01809v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Despite the unitary evolution of closed quantum systems, long-time expectation of local observables are well described by thermal ensembles, providing the foundation of quantum statistical mechanics. A promising route to understanding this quantum thermalization is the eigenstate thermalization hypothesis (ETH), which posits that individual energy eigenstates already appear locally thermal. Subsequent studies have extended this concept to the full ETH, which captures higher-order correlations among matrix elements through nontrivial relations. In this work, we perform a detailed exact-diagonalization study of finite-size corrections to these relations in the canonical ensemble. We distinguish two distinct sources of corrections: those arising from energy fluctuations, which decay polynomially with system size, and those originating from fluctuations within each energy window, which decay exponentially with system size. In particular, our analysis resolves the puzzle that, for certain observables, finite-size corrections exhibit anomalous growth with increasing system size even in chaotic systems. Our results provide a systematic and practical methodology for validating the full ETH in quantum many-body systems.</description>

      <title>Universal scaling of finite-temperature quantum adiabaticity in driven many-body systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.01943</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.01943v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Establishing quantitative adiabaticity criteria at finite temperature remains substantially less developed than in the pure-state setting, despite the fact that realistic quantum systems are never at absolute zero. Here we derive rigorous bounds on the Hilbert-Schmidt fidelity between mixed states by combining a mixed-state quantum speed limit with mixed-state fidelity susceptibility within the Liouville space formulation of quantum mechanics. Applied to protocols that drive an initial Gibbs state toward a quasi-Gibbs target, these bounds yield an explicit threshold driving rate for the onset of nonadiabaticity. For a broad class of local Hamiltonians in gapped phases, we show that, in the thermodynamic limit, the threshold factorizes into two factors: a system-size contribution that recovers the zero-temperature scaling and a universal temperature-dependent factor. The latter is exponentially close to unity at low temperature, whereas at high temperature it increases linearly with temperature. We verify the predicted scaling in several spin-1/2 chains by obtaining closed-form expressions for the threshold driving rate. Our results provide practical and largely model-independent criteria for finite-temperature adiabaticity in closed many-body systems.</description>

      <title>Observing weakly broken conservation laws in a dipolar Rydberg quantum spin chain</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.02251</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.02251v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Integrable quantum many-body systems host families of extensive conservation laws, some of which are fragile: even infinitesimal perturbations can qualitatively alter their dynamical constraints. Here we show that this fragility leaves a clear experimental fingerprint in a one-dimensional quantum spin chain of as few as 14 Rydberg atoms. Weak integrability breaking from interatomic dipolar couplings is directly detectable within experimentally accessible times in the dynamics of non-local observables. In particular, magnetization fluctuations are highly sensitive to the breaking of fragile conservation laws and exhibit anomalous growth, which we observe experimentally; similar signatures appear in a semilocal string observable. Numerical simulations on substantially longer chains and a simplified classical stochastic model reproduce those features. We establish non-local observables as a sensitive probe of fragile conservation laws in quantum spin chains and Rydberg-atom arrays as a platform to test perturbative descriptions of quantum many-body dynamics with weak integrability breaking.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.11498v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Living systems operate out of equilibrium, continuously consuming energy to sustain organised, functional states. Their emergent behaviour usually relies on a set of interconnected chemical reaction networks (CRNs) driven by external fluxes that keep some species at fixed concentrations. Hence, uncovering the principles governing the functioning of these CRNs is crucial to understand how living systems generate and regulate complexity. While kinetics plays a key role in shaping detailed dynamical phenomena, the range of operations of a CRN is fundamentally constrained by thermodynamics. Here, we introduce and analytically derive the "thermodynamic space" of a CRN, i.e., the range of accessible stationary concentrations that can be realized under a given energetic budget. We establish analogous bounds for reaction affinities, shedding light on how global thermodynamic properties, such as the total non-equilibrium driving, can limit local non-equilibrium quantities. We illustrate our results in various paradigmatic examples, demonstrating how the onset of complex behaviors is intimately tangled with the presence of non-equilibrium conditions. By providing a general tool for analysing CRNs, the presented framework constitutes a stepping stone to deepen our ability to predict complex out-of-equilibrium phenomena and design artificial chemical systems, starting from the sole knowledge of the underlying thermodynamic properties.</description>

      <title>Effect of droplet configurations within the functional renormalization group of the Ising model approaching the lower critical dimension</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.23415</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.23415v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We explore the application of the nonperturbative functional renormalization group (NPFRG) within its most common approximation scheme based on truncations of the derivative expansion, to the $Z_2$-symmetric scalar $\varphi^4$ theory as the lower critical dimension $d_{\rm lc}$ is approached. We aim to assess whether the NPFRG - a broad, nonspecialized method which is accurate in $d\geq 2$ - can capture the effect of the localized (droplet) excitations that drive the disappearance of the phase transition in $d_{\rm lc}$ and control the critical behavior as $d\to d_{\rm lc}$. We extend a prior analysis to the next (second) order of the derivative expansion to check the convergence of the results and the robustness of the conclusions. The study turns out to be much more involved. Through extensive numerical and analytical work we provide evidence that the convergence to $d_{\rm lc}$ is nonuniform in the field dependence and is characterized by the emergence of a boundary layer near the minima of the fixed-point effective potential. This is the mathematical mechanism through which the NPFRG within the truncated derivative expansion reproduces nontrivial features predicted by the droplet theory of Bruce and Wallace [1,2], namely, the existence of two distinct small parameters as $d\to d_{\rm lc}$ that control different aspects of the critical behavior and that are nonperturbatively related. The second order of the derivative expansion fixes several issues that were encountered at the lower level and improves the compatibility with the droplet-theory predictions.

Abstract: We prove that for translationally invariant quantum spin chains with finite-range interactions, the existence of a specific conservation law known as the Reshetikhin condition implies the presence of infinitely many local conserved quantities, i.e., integrability. This shows that the entire hierarchy of conservation laws associated with solutions of the Yang--Baxter equation is already encoded in the lowest nontrivial conservation law. Combined with recent rigorous results on nonintegrability, our theorem strongly restricts the possibility of partially integrable systems that admit only a finite but large number of local conserved quantities. Our work establishes a rigorous foundation for the systematic identification of new integrable models and deepens the algebraic understanding of conservation-law structures in quantum spin chains.</description>

Abstract: We investigate the properties of a Kolmogorov equation governing the time evolution of the probability distribution defined in phase space. Energy is strictly conserved along a trajectory in phase space, meaning the equation is appropriate to describe an isolated system, and the stationary state is the Gibbs microcanonical distribution. The equation predicts the increase in entropy in agreement with thermodynamics, and in contrast with the Liouville equation, which conserves entropy. Using an approximation in which the distribution is a product of one-particle distributions, we derive the Boltzmann equation of kinetic theory. We also consider a Kolmogorov equation to describe an open system in contact with the external environment. In this case the equation describes not only the situation in which the system is found in thermodynamic equilibrium with a Gibbs canonical distribution in the stationary state, but also the nonequilibrium steady state with a continuous production of entropy.</description>

      <title>Entropic trade-off relations in stochastic thermodynamics via replica Markov processes</title>

      <description>arXiv:2512.18963v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Traditional thermodynamic trade-off relations usually apply to quantities that depend linearly on probability distributions. In contrast, many important information-theoretic measures, such as entropies, are nonlinear and thus difficult to analyze with existing frameworks. Motivated by replica ideas in quantum information and spin-glass theory, we introduce \emph{replica Markov processes}, i.e., Markovian dynamics of $K$ independent, identical copies, and derive trade-off relations that bound relative moments of replica observables in terms of dynamical activity. By choosing appropriate replica observables, these inequalities translate into bounds on nonlinear quantities of the original single process. Focusing on entropic measures of uncertainty, we obtain upper bounds on the time derivative and the value of the Tsallis entropy for general trajectory-observable distributions, and corresponding bounds for diffusion on networks. We also illustrate how replicas can handle other nonlinear functionals such as extreme-value observables. Finally, we extend the construction to continuously monitored open quantum systems governed by Lindblad dynamics, where the bounds are expressed in terms of the quantum dynamical activity. These results provide entropic counterparts to activity-based uncertainty relations and establish a general method for constraining nonlinear information-theoretic quantities in stochastic and quantum thermodynamics.</description>

      <title>Shearing Off the Tree: Emerging Branch Structure and Born's Rule in an Equilibrated Multiverse</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.06755</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.06755v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Within the many worlds interpretation (MWI) it is believed that, as time passes on, the linearity of the Schr\"odinger equation together with decoherence generate an exponentially growing tree of branches where "everything happens", provided the branches are defined for a decohering basis. By studying an example, using exact numerical diagonalization of the Schr\"odinger equation to compute the decoherent histories functional, we find that this picture needs revision. Our example shows decoherence for histories defined at a few times, but a significant fraction (often the vast majority) of branches shows strong interference effects for histories of many times. In a sense made precise below, the histories independently sample an equilibrated quantum process, and, remarkably, we find that only histories that sample frequencies in accordance with Born's rule remain decoherent. Our results suggest that there is more structure in the many worlds tree than previously anticipated, influencing arguments of both proponents and opponents of the MWI.</description>

      <title>Enhanced sensing of a weak Stark field under the influence of Aubry-Andr\'e-Harper criticality</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.03232v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The localization transition can be exploited as a resource for achieving quantum-enhanced sensitivity in parameter estimation. We demonstrate that by employing different classes of localization inducing potentials, one can significantly enhance the precision of parameter estimation. Specifically, we focus on the precision measurement of the Stark strength parameter encoded in the low- and high-energy eigenstates of a one-dimensional fermionic lattice under the influence of Aubry-Andr\'e-Harper localization-delocalization transition. For the ground state, we consider the single-particle system, in addition to the system at half filling. Our work reveals that Quantum Fisher Information (QFI) offers superior scaling with respect to the system size compared to the pure Stark case, leading to a better parameter estimation. However, experimental measurement of the QFI based on fidelity in a multibody system is a significant challenge. To address this, we suggest experimentally relevant operators that can be utilized to achieve precision surpassing the Heisenberg Limit (HL) or can even saturate the QFI scaling. These operators, relevant for practical experimental setups, provide a feasible pathway to harness the advantages offered by the localization-delocalization transition by exploiting two distinct localizing potentials for quantum-enhanced parameter estimation.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2501.16592v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Time crystals are a peculiar state of matter. Their emergence hinges on ergodicity breaking, which typically originates from many-body localization or Floquet prethermalization. Here we propose a novel scheme for devising robust dissipative time crystals where the ergodicity is broken through symmetry-induced fragmentation. Building upon a U(1)-symmetry-induced Liouville-space fragmentation, we first propose a generic Liouvillian with long-time oscillations typical of time crystals. We then show that, even when the U(1) symmetry is broken, a prethermal time-crystal behavior survives, with distinct oscillation frequencies at different times of the steady-state approaching dynamics. Intriguingly, the stage-wise prethermal dynamics derive from Fermi statistics and the Liouvillian skin effect of our model -- as the excitations above the boundary-localized dark states can be mapped to the irreducible representations of the permutation group, the branching rules of the permutation group ensure the robustness of the prethermal time crystal. Our work paves the way for devising time crystals through Hilbert-space fragmentation. It also sheds light on the dynamic effects of non-Hermitian physics in many-body quantum open systems.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.23189v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the competition between random multiplicative growth and redistribution/migration in the mean-field limit, when the number of sites is very large but finite. We find that for static random growth rates, migration should be strong enough to prevent localisation, i.e. extreme concentration on the fastest growing site. In the presence of an additional temporal noise in the growth rates, a third partially localised phase is predicted theoretically, using results from Derrida's Random Energy Model. Such temporal fluctuations mitigate concentration effects, but do not make them disappear. We discuss our results in the context of population growth and wealth inequalities.</description>

      <title>Transient and steady-state chaos in dissipative quantum systems</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.05475v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Dissipative quantum chaos plays a central role in the characterization and control of information scrambling, non-unitary evolution, and thermalization, but it still lacks a precise definition. The Grobe-Haake-Sommers conjecture, which links Ginibre level repulsion to classical chaotic dynamics, was recently shown to fail [Phys. Rev. Lett. 133, 240404 (2024)]. We properly restore the quantum-classical correspondence through a dynamical approach based on entanglement entropy and out-of-time-order correlators (OTOCs), which reveal signatures of chaos beyond spectral statistics. Focusing on the open anisotropic Dicke model, we identify two distinct regimes: transient chaos, marked by rapid early-time growth of entanglement and OTOCs followed by low saturation values, and steady-state chaos, characterized by high long-time values. We introduce a random matrix toy model and show that Ginibre spectral statistics signals short-time chaos rather than steady-state chaos. Our results establish entanglement dynamics and OTOCs as reliable diagnostics of dissipative quantum chaos across different timescales.</description>

      <title>Detecting (emergent) continuous symmetry of criticality via subsystem's entanglement spectrum</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.09889v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The (emergent) symmetry of a critical point is one of the most important information to identify the universality class and effective field theory, which is fundamental for various critical theories. However, the underlying symmetry so far can only be conjectured indirectly from the dimension of the order parameters in symmetry-breaking phases, and its correctness requires further verifications to avoid overlooking hidden order parameters, which by itself is also a difficult task. In this work, we propose an unbiased way to numerically identify the underlying (emergent) symmetry of a critical point in quantum many-body systems, without prior knowledge about its low-energy effective field theory. Through calculating the reduced density matrix in a very small subsystem of the total system numerically, the Anderson tower of states in the entanglement spectrum clearly reflects the underlying (emergent) symmetry of the criticality. It is attributed to the fact that the entanglement spectrum can observe the broken symmetry of the entanglement ground-state after cooling from the critical point along an extra temperature axis.</description>

      <title>Physics-Informed Gaussian Process Inference of Liquid Structure from Scattering Data</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.07948v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present a nonparametric Bayesian framework to infer radial distribution functions from experimental scattering measurements with uncertainty quantification using non-stationary Gaussian processes. The Gaussian process prior mean and kernel functions are designed to mitigate well-known numerical challenges with the Fourier transform, including discrete measurement binning and detector windowing, while encoding fundamental yet minimal physical knowledge of liquid structure. We demonstrate uncertainty propagation of the Gaussian process posterior to unmeasured quantities of interest. Experimental radial distribution functions of liquid argon and water with uncertainty quantification are provided as both a proof of principle for the method and a benchmark for molecular models. The full implementation is available on GitHub at: https://github.com/hoepfnergroup/LiquidStructureGP-Sullivan.</description>

      <title>When higher-order interactions enhance synchronization: the case of the Kuramoto model on random hypergraphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.10992</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.10992v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Synchronization is a fundamental phenomenon in complex systems, observed across a wide range of natural and engineered contexts. The Kuramoto model provides a foundational framework for understanding synchronization among coupled oscillators, traditionally assuming pairwise interactions. However, many real-world systems exhibit group and many-body interactions, which can be effectively modeled through hypergraphs. Previous studies suggest that higher-order interactions shrink the attraction basin of the synchronous state, making it harder to reach and potentially impairing synchronization, despite enriching the dynamics. In this work, we show that this is not always the case. Through a numerical study of higher-order Kuramoto models on random hypergraphs, we find that while strong higher-order interactions do generally work against synchronization, weak higher-order interactions can actually enhance it when combined with pairwise ones. This result is further corroborated by a cost-benefit analysis: under a constrained budget of both pairwise and higher-order interactions, a mixed allocation involving both consistently achieves higher synchronization than relying on either interaction type alone. These findings provide new insights into the role of higher-order interactions in shaping collective dynamics and point to design principles for optimizing synchronization in complex systems.</description>

Abstract: Variability of motility behavior in populations of microbiological agents is a ubiquitous phenomenon even in the case of genetically identical cells. Accordingly, passive objects introduced into such biological systems and driven by them will also exhibit heterogeneous motion patterns. Here, we study a biohybrid system of passive beads driven by active ameboid cells and use a likelihood approach to estimate the heterogeneity of the bead dynamics from their discretely sampled trajectories. We showcase how this approach can deal with information-scarce situations and provides natural uncertainty bounds for heterogeneity estimates. Using these advantages we particularly uncover that the heterogeneity in the system is time-dependent.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2509.26369v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Active matter has thrived in recent years, driven both by the insight that it underlies fundamental processes in nature, and by its vast potential for applications. This allows for innovation both inspired by experimental observations, and by construction of novel systems with desired properties. In this paper, we develop a novel system in the search for a new kind of pattern formation: microstructural motifs with orthogonal alignment. Taking a simple active Brownian particle (ABP) model applied to dumbbell-shaped particles, we add a quadrupolar interaction by positioning two antiparallel magnetic dipolar moments on each particle. We find that the phase behavior is determined by the competition between active motion and the orthogonal alignment favored by quadrupolar attraction. By varying these quantities, we are able to tune both the internal structure of the aggregates, and find a surprising stability of triangular aggregates, to the point of clusters of size $N=3$ being strongly overrepresented. Although none of the component particles are chiral, the resulting structures spin in a random, fixed direction due to combination of the polarity of the active motion. This results in an ensemble of windmilling (randomly spinning in a circular motion) aggregates with windmill-like shape (due to the three- or four core component dumbbells). Ultimately, this simple model shows an interesting range of microstructural motifs, with great potential for experimental implementations.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2510.09341v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Triadic interactions are special types of higher-order interactions that occur when regulator nodes modulate the interactions between other two or more nodes. In presence of triadic interactions, a percolation process occurring on a single-layer network becomes a fully-fledged dynamical system, characterized by period-doubling and a route to chaos. Here, we generalize the model to multilayer networks and name it as the multilayer triadic percolation (MTP) model. We find a much richer dynamical behavior of the MTP model than its single-layer counterpart. MTP displays a Neimark-Sacker bifurcation, leading to oscillations of arbitrarily large period or pseudo-periodic oscillations. Moreover, MTP admits period-two oscillations without negative regulatory interactions, whereas single-layer systems only display discontinuous hybrid transitions. This comprehensive model offers new insights on the importance of regulatory interactions in real-world systems such as brain networks, climate, and ecological systems.</description>

Abstract: Collective excitations are fundamental in quantum many-body physics, yet their spectra have traditionally been studied within Newtonian dynamics. In this paper, we investigate collective excitations in Bose gases under Modified Newtonian Dynamics (MOND). We derive an anisotropic excitation spectrum in the MOND regime. This anisotropy arises directly from the intrinsic nonlinear structure of the MOND Poisson equation, forming a distinctive signature of the modified gravitational response. We then analyze the Jeans instability, obtaining analytic expressions for the direction-dependent critical wavelength and mass. These results advance our understanding of collective behavior in quantum systems under modified dynamics and establish clear theoretical signatures for testing MOND-like effects in quantum simulators.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2601.14398v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Deconfined quantum critical point (DQCP) describes direct, non-fine-tuned quantum phase transition between two ordered phases that break distinct and seemingly unrelated symmetries, providing a route to continuous phase transition beyond the conventional Ginzburg--Landau paradigm. In this work we extend the DQCP paradigm to systems with internal supersymmetry (SUSY), where the on-site Hilbert space furnishes a representation of a Lie superalgebra, and the Hamiltonian is invariant under the corresponding Lie supergroup. Focusing on the minimal supersymmetric generalization of spin $SU(2)$, namely $OSp(1|2)$, we propose a supersymmetric deconfined quantum critical point (sDQCP) between a phase that breaks internal $OSp(1|2)$ and a phase that instead breaks lattice rotation symmetry. We formulate a non-linear sigma model on the supersphere target space that captures the symmetry intertwinement characteristic of the sDQCP, and we further develop a gauge theory description to address its dynamical properties, including a heuristic argument for 3D XY critical behavior. Finally, we show that explicitly breaking $OSp(1|2)$ down to $SU(2)$ continuously connects our sDQCP to the conventional DQCP scenario.</description>

      <title>Universal Digitized Counterdiabatic Driving</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.15972</link>

Abstract: Counterdiabatic driving realizes parameter displacement of an energy eigenstate of a given parametrized Hamiltonian using the adiabatic gauge potential. In this paper, we propose a universal method of digitized counterdiabatic driving, constructing the adiabatic gauge potential in a digital way with the idea of universal counterdiabatic driving. This method has three advantages over existing universal counterdiabatic driving and/or digitized counterdiabatic driving: it does not introduce any many-body and/or nonlocal interactions to an original target Hamiltonian; it can incorporate infinite nested commutators, which constitute the adiabatic gauge potential; and it gives explicit expression of rotation angles for digital implementation. We show the consistency of our method to the exact theory in an analytical way and the effectiveness of our method with the aid of numerical simulations.</description>

      <title>Holstein Primakoff spin codes for local and collective noise</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.17592</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.17592v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Quantum error correction is essential for fault-tolerant quantum computation, yet most existing codes rely on local control and stabilizer measurements that are difficult to implement in systems dominated by collective interactions. Inspired by spin-GKP codes in PhysRevA.108.022428, we develop a general framework for Holstein-Primakoff spin codes, which maps continuous-variable bosonic codes onto permutation-symmetric spin ensembles via the Holstein-Primakoff approximation. We show that HP codes are robust to both collective and local-spin noise and propose an explicit measurement-free local error recovery procedure to map local noise into correctable collective-spin errors.</description>

      <title>Convergent Discovery of Critical Phenomena Mathematics Across Disciplines: A Cross-Domain Analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.22389</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.22389v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Techniques for detecting critical phenomena -- phase transitions where correlation length diverges and small perturbations have large effects -- have been developed across at least eight fields of application over nine decades. We document this convergence pattern. The physicist's correlation length $\xi$, the cardiologist's DFA scaling exponent $\alpha$, the financial analyst's Hurst exponent $H$, and the machine learning engineer's spectral radius $\chi$ all measure correlation decay rate, detecting the same critical signatures under different notation. Citation analysis reveals minimal cross-domain awareness during the formative period (1987--2010): researchers in biomedicine, finance, machine learning, power systems, and traffic flow developed equivalent techniques independently, each with distinct notation and terminology. We present Metatron Dynamics, a framework derived from distributed systems engineering, as a candidate ninth independent discovery -- strengthening the convergence pattern while acknowledging that as authors of both the framework and this analysis, external validation would strengthen this claim. Correspondence testing on the 2D Ising model confirms that measures from multiple frameworks correctly identify the critical regime at $T_c = 2.269$. We argue that repeated independent discovery establishes criticality mathematics as fundamental public knowledge, with implications for cross-disciplinary education and research accessibility. Because these findings affect fields beyond mathematics and physics, we include a plain-language summary in Appendix B for non-specialist readers.</description>
