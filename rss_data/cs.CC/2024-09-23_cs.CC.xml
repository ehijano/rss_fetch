      <title>Fast decision tree learning solves hard coding-theoretic problems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.13096</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.13096v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We connect the problem of properly PAC learning decision trees to the parameterized Nearest Codeword Problem ($k$-NCP). Despite significant effort by the respective communities, algorithmic progress on both problems has been stuck: the fastest known algorithm for the former runs in quasipolynomial time (Ehrenfeucht and Haussler 1989) and the best known approximation ratio for the latter is $O(n/\log n)$ (Berman and Karpinsky 2002; Alon, Panigrahy, and Yekhanin 2009). Research on both problems has thus far proceeded independently with no known connections.
  We show that $\textit{any}$ improvement of Ehrenfeucht and Haussler's algorithm will yield $O(\log n)$-approximation algorithms for $k$-NCP, an exponential improvement of the current state of the art. This can be interpreted either as a new avenue for designing algorithms for $k$-NCP, or as one for establishing the optimality of Ehrenfeucht and Haussler's algorithm. Furthermore, our reduction along with existing inapproximability results for $k$-NCP already rule out polynomial-time algorithms for properly learning decision trees. A notable aspect of our hardness results is that they hold even in the setting of $\textit{weak}$ learning whereas prior ones were limited to the setting of strong learning.</description>

      <title>Parameterized Local Search for Max $c$-Cut</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.13380</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.13380v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the NP-hard Max $c$-Cut problem, one is given an undirected edge-weighted graph $G$ and aims to color the vertices of $G$ with $c$ colors such that the total weight of edges with distinctly colored endpoints is maximal. The case with $c=2$ is the famous Max Cut problem. To deal with the NP-hardness of this problem, we study parameterized local search algorithms. More precisely, we study LS Max $c$-Cut where we are also given a vertex coloring and an integer $k$ and the task is to find a better coloring that changes the color of at most $k$ vertices, if such a coloring exists; otherwise, the given coloring is $k$-optimal. We show that, for all $c\ge 2$, LS Max $c$-Cut presumably cannot be solved in $f(k)\cdot n^{\mathcal{O}(1)}$ time even on bipartite graphs. We then present an algorithm for LS Max $c$-Cut with running time $\mathcal{O}((3e\Delta)^k\cdot c\cdot k^3\cdot\Delta\cdot n)$, where $\Delta$ is the maximum degree of the input graph. Finally, we evaluate the practical performance of this algorithm in a hill-climbing approach as a post-processing for a state-of-the-art heuristic for Max $c$-Cut. We show that using parameterized local search, the results of this state-of-the-art heuristic can be further improved on a set of standard benchmark instances.</description>

      <title>Parameterised Holant Problems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.13579</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.13579v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the complexity of parameterised holant problems $\textsc{p-Holant}(\mathcal{S})$ for families of signatures~$\mathcal{S}$. The parameterised holant framework was introduced by Curticapean in 2015 as a counter-part to the classical theory of holographic reductions and algorithms and it constitutes an extensive family of coloured and weighted counting constraint satisfaction problems on graph-like structures, encoding as special cases various well-studied counting problems in parameterised and fine-grained complexity theory such as counting edge-colourful $k$-matchings, graph-factors, Eulerian orientations or, subgraphs with weighted degree constraints. We establish an exhaustive complexity trichotomy along the set of signatures $\mathcal{S}$: Depending on $\mathcal{S}$, $\textsc{p-Holant}(\mathcal{S})$ is: (1) solvable in FPT-near-linear time (i.e. $f(k)\cdot \tilde{\mathcal{O}}(|x|)$); (2) solvable in "FPT-matrix-multiplication time" (i.e. $f(k)\cdot {\mathcal{O}}(n^{\omega})$) but not solvable in FPT-near-linear time unless the Triangle Conjecture fails; or (3) #W[1]-complete and no significant improvement over brute force is possible unless ETH fails. This classification reveals a significant and surprising gap in the complexity landscape of parameterised Holants: Not only is every instance either fixed-parameter tractable or #W[1]-complete, but additionally, every FPT instance is solvable in time $f(k)\cdot {\mathcal{O}}(n^{\omega})$.
  We also establish a complete classification for a natural uncoloured version of parameterised holant problem $\textsc{p-UnColHolant}(\mathcal{S})$, which encodes as special cases the non-coloured analogues of the aforementioned examples. We show that the complexity of $\textsc{p-UnColHolant}(\mathcal{S})$ is different: Depending on $\mathcal{S}$ all instances are either solvable in FPT-near-linear time, or #W[1]-complete.</description>

      <title>Transformers in Uniform TC$^0$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.13629</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.13629v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Previous work has shown that the languages recognized by average-hard attention transformers (AHATs) and softmax-attention transformers (SMATs) are within the circuit complexity class TC$^0$. However, these results assume limited-precision arithmetic: using floating-point numbers with O(log n) bits (where n is the length of the input string), Strobl showed that AHATs can be approximated in L-uniform TC$^0$, and Merrill and Sabharwal showed that SMATs can be approximated in DLOGTIME-uniform TC$^0$. Here, we improve these results, showing that AHATs with no approximation, SMATs with O(poly(n)) bits of floating-point precision, and SMATs with at most $2^{-O(poly(n))}$ absolute error are all in DLOGTIME-uniform TC$^0$.</description>

      <title>EF1 and EFX Orientations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.13616</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.13616v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the problem of finding fair allocations -- EF1 and EFX -- of indivisible goods with orientations. In an orientation, every agent gets items from their own predetermined set. For EF1, we show that EF1 orientations always exist when agents have monotone valuations, via a pseudopolynomial-time algorithm. This surprisingly positive result is the main contribution of our paper. We complement this result with a comprehensive set of scenarios where our algorithm, or a slight modification of it, finds an EF1 orientation in polynomial time. For EFX, we focus on the recently proposed graph instances, where every agent corresponds to a vertex on a graph and their allowed set of items consists of the edges incident to their vertex. It was shown that finding an EFX orientation is NP-complete in general. We prove that it remains intractable even when the graph has a vertex cover of size 8, or when we have a multigraph with only 10 vertices. We essentially match these strong negative results with a fixed-parameter tractable algorithm that is virtually the best someone could hope for.</description>

      <title>Reachability of Fair Allocations via Sequential Exchanges</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.07241</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.07241v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In the allocation of indivisible goods, a prominent fairness notion is envy-freeness up to one good (EF1). We initiate the study of reachability problems in fair division by investigating the problem of whether one EF1 allocation can be reached from another EF1 allocation via a sequence of exchanges such that every intermediate allocation is also EF1. We show that two EF1 allocations may not be reachable from each other even in the case of two agents, and deciding their reachability is PSPACE-complete in general. On the other hand, we prove that reachability is guaranteed for two agents with identical or binary utilities as well as for any number of agents with identical binary utilities. We also examine the complexity of deciding whether there is an EF1 exchange sequence that is optimal in the number of exchanges required.</description>
