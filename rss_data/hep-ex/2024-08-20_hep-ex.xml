      <title>Vision Calorimeter for Anti-neutron Reconstruction: A Baseline</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.10599</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.10599v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In high-energy physics, anti-neutrons ($\bar{n}$) are fundamental particles that frequently appear as final-state particles, and the reconstruction of their kinematic properties provides an important probe for understanding the governing principles. However, this confronts significant challenges instrumentally with the electromagnetic calorimeter (EMC), a typical experimental sensor but recovering the information of incident $\bar{n}$ insufficiently. In this study, we introduce Vision Calorimeter (ViC), a baseline method for anti-neutron reconstruction that leverages deep learning detectors to analyze the implicit relationships between EMC responses and incident $\bar{n}$ characteristics. Our motivation lies in that energy distributions of $\bar{n}$ samples deposited in the EMC cell arrays embody rich contextual information. Converted to 2-D images, such contextual energy distributions can be used to predict the status of $\bar{n}$ ($i.e.$, incident position and momentum) through a deep learning detector along with pseudo bounding boxes and a specified training objective. Experimental results demonstrate that ViC substantially outperforms the conventional reconstruction approach, reducing the prediction error of incident position by 42.81% (from 17.31$^{\circ}$ to 9.90$^{\circ}$). More importantly, this study for the first time realizes the measurement of incident $\bar{n}$ momentum, underscoring the potential of deep learning detectors for particle reconstruction.

      <title>The $\rho$ meson magnetic dipole moment from BaBar $e^+e^- \to \pi^+ \pi^-\pi^0 \pi^0 $ cross section measurement</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.14676</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.14676v2 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We obtain the value of the magnetic dipole moment of the $\rho$ meson, using data from the BaBar Collaboration for the $e^{+} e^{-} \to \pi^+ \pi^- 2 \pi^0$ process. The considered center of mass energy range is from 0.9 to 1.8 GeV. We describe the $\gamma^* \to 4\pi$ vertex using a vector meson dominance model, including the intermediate resonant contributions relevant at these energies. We find $\mu_\rho = 2.7 \pm 0.3 $ in $e/2 m_\rho$ units. We improve on the previous extracted value, where preliminary data from the same collaboration was used, by considering definite data, better grounded values of the parameters involved and explicit gauge invariant description of the process.</description>

      <title>Star Shearing Season -- Transient Signals in Wave-like Dark Matter Experiments from Black Hole Formation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.10296</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.10296v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Ordinary matter coupled to light weakly interacting bosons can lead to the formation of a macroscopic bosonic field in the vicinity of large matter concentrations such as ordinary or neutron stars. When these objects are turned into black holes due to a supernova or a binary merger this ''hair'' could be ''shorn'' off. Part of the field configuration would then be released leading to an outgoing field wave. For small masses this field transient remains rather compact and can induce a transient signal in experiments, in particular those that look for wave-like dark matter. This signal can be correlated with the corresponding astrophysical signal of the event. In this note, we consider a variety of couplings and the associated signals and estimate the corresponding sensitivities.</description>

      <title>Progress of Inorganic Scintillators for Future HEP Experiments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.10466</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.10466v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Caltech HEP Crystal Lab has been actively investigating novel inorganic scintillators along the following three directions. Fast and radiation hard inorganic scintillators to face the challenge of severe radiation environment expected by future HEP experiments at hadron colliders, such as the high luminosity LHC and FCC hh. Ultrafast inorganic scintillators to face the challenge of unprecedented event rate expected by future HEP experiments searching for rare decays, such as Mu2e II, and ultrafast time of flight system at hadron colliders. Cost effective inorganic scintillators for the homogeneous hadron calorimeter concept to face the challenge of both electromagnetic and jet mass resolutions required by the proposed Higgs factory. We report novel materials along all directions: LuAG:Ce ceramic fibers for the HL LHC, Lu2O3:Yb ceramic scintillators for ultrafast applications, and ABS:Ce and DSB:Ce glass scintillators for the proposed Higgs factory. The result of this investigation may also benefit nuclear physics experiments, GHz hard X ray imaging, medical imaging, and homeland security applications.</description>

      <title>QCD corrections to the Golden decay channel of the Higgs boson</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.10780</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.10780v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Precision studies within the Higgs sector of the Standard Model are crucial to deepen our understanding of the fundamental interactions and uncovering new physics phenomena beyond the Standard Model. To fully leverage the potential of future precision machines aiming to provide highly precise experimental measurements of the Higgs properties, it is crucial to minimize theoretical errors in the Higgs sector observables, such as production and decay rates.
  In this thesis, we focus on providing precise predictions for observables associated with the Golden decay channel of the Higgs boson. We improve theoretical predictions for the partial decay width of this channel, specifically $H \to Z^{(*)}Z^{(*)} \to e^+ e^- \mu^+ \mu^-$, by incorporating NNLO mixed QCD-electroweak corrections in perturbation theory. We also describe the full analytical evaluation of the two-loop master integrals appearing in the $\mathcal{O}(\alpha \alpha_s)$ corrections to the $HZZ$ vertex with both $Z$-bosons being off-shell, employing the method of differential equations retaining full mass dependence. The analytic results for all the master integrals are obtained in terms of Chen's iterated integrals with logarithmic kernels order-by-order in the dimensional regularization parameter $\epsilon$, along with analytic boundary constants.
  This thesis also presents a phenomenological study of the $H \to e^+ e^- \mu^+ \mu^-$ decay at $\mathcal{O}(\alpha \alpha_s)$ by implementing the entire calculation of the decay amplitude in the public code Hto4l to perform the phase space integration over final state leptons. We study the impact of these mixed QCD-electroweak corrections on the invariant mass distribution of the final-state leptons and angular variables, specifically the angle between the decay planes of the intermediate $Z$-bosons relative to leading-order predictions and NLO electroweak corrections.</description>

      <title>Optimised neutron yield calculations from ($\alpha,n$) reactions with the modified SOURCES4 code</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.10910</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.10910v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The sensitivity of underground experiments searching for rare events such as dark matter, neutrino interactions or several beyond the standard model phenomena is often limited by the background caused by neutrons from spontaneous fission and ($\alpha,n$) reactions. A number of codes exist to calculate neutron yields and energy spectra due to these processes. In this paper we present new calculations of neutron production using the modified SOURCES4A code with recently updated cross-sections for ($\alpha,n$) reactions and the comparison of the results with available experimental data. The cross-sections for ($\alpha,n$) reactions in SOURCES4 have been taken from reliable experimental data where possible, complemented by the calculations with EMPIRE 2.19/3.2.3, TALYS 1.96 or evaluated data library JENDL-5 where the data were scarce or unavailable.</description>

      <title>GRANDlib: A simulation pipeline for the Giant Radio Array for Neutrino Detection (GRAND)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.10926</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.10926v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The operation of upcoming ultra-high-energy cosmic-ray, gamma-ray, and neutrino radio-detection experiments, like the Giant Radio Array for Neutrino Detection (GRAND), poses significant computational challenges involving the production of numerous simulations of particle showers and their detection, and a high data throughput. GRANDlib is an open-source software tool designed to meet these challenges. Its primary goal is to perform end-to-end simulations of the detector operation, from the interaction of ultra-high-energy particles, through -- by interfacing with external air-shower simulations -- the ensuing particle shower development and its radio emission, to its detection by antenna arrays and its processing by data-acquisition systems. Additionally, GRANDlib manages the visualization, storage, and retrieval of experimental and simulated data. We present an overview of GRANDlib to serve as the basis of future GRAND analyses.</description>

Abstract: A full detector simulation for projective, segmented geometries has been implemented in the key4hep software stack for future colliders. Calculations are presented for a fully parameterized geometry construction routine based on only a few input dimensions. Custom sensitive detector actions, filters, and data readout classes for dual-readout are implemented and their effects on optical photons in full detector simulation are studied for the first time. New sources of uncorrelated handles for AI/ML reconstruction algorithms are presented. A lightweight, portable custom event display using a JavaScript-based plotting library is implemented and run in a python notebook.</description>

      <title>Search for magnetic monopole pair production in ultraperipheral Pb+Pb collisions at $\sqrt{s_{_\textrm{NN}}}=5.36$ TeV with the ATLAS detector at the LHC</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.11035v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This Letter presents a search for highly ionizing magnetic monopoles in 262$~\mu$b$^{-1}$ of ultraperipheral Pb+Pb collision data at $\sqrt{s_{_\textrm{NN}}}=5.36$ TeV collected by the ATLAS detector at the LHC. A new methodology that exploits the properties of clusters of hits reconstructed in the innermost silicon detector layers is introduced to study highly ionizing particles in heavy-ion data. No significant excess above the background, which is estimated using a data-driven technique, is observed. Using a nonperturbative semiclassical model, upper limits at 95% confidence level are set on the cross-section for pair production of monopoles with a single Dirac magnetic charge in the mass range of 20-150 GeV. The search significantly improves on the previous cross-section limits for production of low-mass monopoles in ultraperipheral Pb+Pb collisions.</description>

      <title>Search for a sub-eV sterile neutrino using Daya Bay's full dataset</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.01687</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.01687v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This Letter presents results of a search for the mixing of a sub-eV sterile neutrino with three active neutrinos based on the full data sample of the Daya Bay Reactor Neutrino Experiment, collected during 3158 days of detector operation, which contains $5.55 \times 10^{6}$ reactor \anue candidates identified as inverse beta-decay interactions followed by neutron-capture on gadolinium. The analysis benefits from a doubling of the statistics of our previous result and from improvements of several important systematic uncertainties.
  No significant oscillation due to mixing of a sub-eV sterile neutrino with active neutrinos was found. Exclusion limits are set by both Feldman-Cousins and CLs methods.
  Light sterile neutrino mixing with $\sin^2 2\theta_{14} \gtrsim 0.01$ can be excluded at 95\% confidence level in the region of $0.01$ eV$^2 \lesssim |\Delta m^{2}_{41}| \lesssim 0.1 $ eV$^2$. This result represents the world-leading constraints in the region of $2 \times 10^{-4}$ eV$^2 \lesssim |\Delta m^{2}_{41}| \lesssim 0.2 $ eV$^2$.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.08720</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.08720v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The T2K neutrino oscillation experiment has gone through a period of renewal over the last couple of years, with several upgrades designed to improve sensitivity to leptonic CP violation. The change that most affects future analyses is the ND280 upgrade, which will constrain interaction models in new ways. At the same time the analysis continues to be developed, both by combining with the Super-Kamiokande atmospheric measurements and with refinements to the T2K-only analysis. This proceedings describes the highlights of these analyses, and the status of the various T2K upgrades.</description>

      <title>Doubly-Charged $T_{cc}^{++}$ States in the Dynamical Diquark Model</title>

Abstract: One of the celebrated tools in explaining the Hydrogen atom is Born-Oppenheimer approximation. The resemblance of $QQ\bar{q}\bar{q}$ tetraquarks to Hydrogen atom within Quantum chromodynamics (QCD) implies usage of Born-Oppenheimer approximation for these multiquark states. In this work, we use dynamical diquark model to calculate mass spectra and sizes of doubly charmed and charged tetraquark states denoted as $T_{cc}^{++}$. Our results for mass spectra indicate some bound state candidates with respect to corresponding two-meson thresholds. Calculation of expectation values of $\sqrt{\langle r^2 \rangle}$ reflects that doubly charmed and charged tetraquark states are compact.</description>

      <title>Equivariant, Safe and Sensitive -- Graph Networks for New Physics</title>

Abstract: This study introduces a novel Graph Neural Network (GNN) architecture that leverages infrared and collinear (IRC) safety and equivariance to enhance the analysis of collider data for Beyond the Standard Model (BSM) discoveries. By integrating equivariance in the rapidity-azimuth plane with IRC-safe principles, our model significantly reduces computational overhead while ensuring theoretical consistency in identifying BSM scenarios amidst Quantum Chromodynamics backgrounds. The proposed GNN architecture demonstrates superior performance in tagging semi-visible jets, highlighting its potential as a robust tool for advancing BSM search strategies at high-energy colliders.</description>

      <title>No massive black holes in the Milky Way halo</title>

Abstract: The gravitational wave detectors have unveiled a population of massive black holes that do not resemble those observed in the Milky Way. They may have formed due to the evolution of massive low-metallicity stars, dynamical interactions in dense stellar environments, or density fluctuations in the very early Universe (primordial black holes). If the latter hypothesis is correct, primordial black holes should comprise from several to 100% of dark matter to explain the black hole merger rates observed by gravitational wave detectors. If such black holes existed in the Milky Way dark matter halo, they would cause long-timescale gravitational microlensing events lasting years. Here, we present the results of the search for the long-timescale microlensing events among the light curves of 78.7 million stars located in the Large Magellanic Cloud (LMC) that were monitored for 20 years (2001-2020) by the Optical Gravitational Lensing Experiment (OGLE) survey. We did not find any events with timescales longer than one year. The properties of all thirteen microlensing events with timescales shorter than one year detected by OGLE toward the LMC can be explained by astrophysical objects located either in the LMC itself or in the Milky Way disk, without the need to invoke dark matter in the form of compact objects. We find that compact objects in the mass range from $1.8 \times 10^{-4}\,M_{\odot}$ to $6.3\,M_{\odot}$ cannot compose more than 1% of dark matter, and compact objects in the mass range from $1.3 \times 10^{-5}\,M_{\odot}$ to $860\,M_{\odot}$ cannot make up more than 10% of dark matter. This conclusively rules out primordial black hole mergers as a dominant source of gravitational waves.</description>

      <title>Beam-induced backgrounds measured in the ATLAS detector during local gas injection into the LHC beam vacuum</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.05054</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.05054v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Inelastic beam-gas collisions at the Large Hadron Collider (LHC), within a few hundred metres of the ATLAS experiment, are known to give the dominant contribution to beam backgrounds. These are monitored by ATLAS with a dedicated Beam Conditions Monitor (BCM) and with the rate of fake jets in the calorimeters. These two methods are complementary since the BCM probes backgrounds just around the beam pipe while fake jets are observed at radii of up to several metres. In order to quantify the correlation between the residual gas density in the LHC beam vacuum and the experimental backgrounds recorded by ATLAS, several dedicated tests were performed during LHC Run 2. Local pressure bumps, with a gas density several orders of magnitude higher than during normal operation, were introduced at different locations. The changes of beam-related backgrounds, seen in ATLAS, are correlated with the local pressure variation. In addition the rates of beam-gas events are estimated from the pressure measurements and pressure bump profiles obtained from calculations. Using these rates, the efficiency of the ATLAS beam background monitors to detect beam-gas events is derived as a function of distance from the interaction point. These efficiencies and characteristic distributions of fake jets from the beam backgrounds are found to be in good agreement with results of beam-gas simulations performed with the FLUKA Monte Carlo programme.</description>

      <title>Searching for light long-lived particles at SHiNESS</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.05995</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.05995v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recently Soleti et al. [JHEP03(2024)148] proposed a new experiment called SHiNESS at the upcoming European Spallation Source (ESS) facility, making use of the 2-GeV proton beam there impinging on a fixed target, in order to search for hidden sterile neutrinos that could lie in different mass ranges and arise with distinct signatures. Such signatures include excesses in electron-positron pairs that may originate from displaced decays of long-lived particles (LLPs). At the ESS, the dominant sources of such LLPs are decays at rest of $\pi^+$ mesons and $\mu^+$ leptons. We choose to investigate theoretical scenarios of long-lived light binos in the R-parity-violating supersymmetry and long-lived weak-violating electrophilic axionlike particles, as these LLPs can be produced from decays of $\pi^+$ and $\mu^+$. Since the $\pi^+$'s and $\mu^+$'s decay at rest at the ESS, we compute the spectra of the therefrom produced LLPs, and thus estimate the expected sensitivity reach of SHiNESS to the LLPs in these two scenarios. Our calculation shows that in most of the relevant benchmark scenarios, SHiNESS can probe large parameter regions of these models beyond the existing bounds, in just a couple of years of data-collection time.</description>
