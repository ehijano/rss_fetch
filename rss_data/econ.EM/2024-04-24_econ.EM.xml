      <title>Quantifying the Internal Validity of Weighted Estimands</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.14603</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.14603v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper we study a class of weighted estimands, which we define as parameters that can be expressed as weighted averages of the underlying heterogeneous treatment effects. The popular ordinary least squares (OLS), two-stage least squares (2SLS), and two-way fixed effects (TWFE) estimands are all special cases within our framework. Our focus is on answering two questions concerning weighted estimands. First, under what conditions can they be interpreted as the average treatment effect for some (possibly latent) subpopulation? Second, when these conditions are satisfied, what is the upper bound on the size of that subpopulation, either in absolute terms or relative to a target population of interest? We argue that this upper bound provides a valuable diagnostic for empirical research. When a given weighted estimand corresponds to the average treatment effect for a small subset of the population of interest, we say its internal validity is low. Our paper develops practical tools to quantify the internal validity of weighted estimands.</description>

      <title>The Power of Tests for Detecting $p$-Hacking</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2205.07950</link>
      <description>arXiv:2205.07950v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: $p$-Hacking undermines the validity of empirical studies. A flourishing empirical literature investigates the prevalence of $p$-hacking based on the distribution of $p$-values across studies. Interpreting results in this literature requires a careful understanding of the power of methods for detecting $p$-hacking. We theoretically study the implications of likely forms of $p$-hacking on the distribution of $p$-values to understand the power of tests for detecting it. Power depends crucially on the $p$-hacking strategy and the distribution of true effects. Publication bias can enhance the power for testing the joint null of no $p$-hacking and no publication bias.</description>

      <title>From Reactive to Proactive Volatility Modeling with Hemisphere Neural Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.16333</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.16333v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We reinvigorate maximum likelihood estimation (MLE) for macroeconomic density forecasting through a novel neural network architecture with dedicated mean and variance hemispheres. Our architecture features several key ingredients making MLE work in this context. First, the hemispheres share a common core at the entrance of the network which accommodates for various forms of time variation in the error variance. Second, we introduce a volatility emphasis constraint that breaks mean/variance indeterminacy in this class of overparametrized nonlinear models. Third, we conduct a blocked out-of-bag reality check to curb overfitting in both conditional moments. Fourth, the algorithm utilizes standard deep learning software and thus handles large data sets - both computationally and statistically. Ergo, our Hemisphere Neural Network (HNN) provides proactive volatility forecasts based on leading indicators when it can, and reactive volatility based on the magnitude of previous prediction errors when it must. We evaluate point and density forecasts with an extensive out-of-sample experiment and benchmark against a suite of models ranging from classics to more modern machine learning-based offerings. In all cases, HNN fares well by consistently providing accurate mean/variance forecasts for all targets and horizons. Studying the resulting volatility paths reveals its versatility, while probabilistic forecasting evaluation metrics showcase its enviable reliability. Finally, we also demonstrate how this machinery can be merged with other structured deep learning models by revisiting Goulet Coulombe (2022)'s Neural Phillips Curve.</description>

      <title>Estimation and Uniform Inference in Sparse High-Dimensional Additive Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2004.01623</link>
      <description>arXiv:2004.01623v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We develop a novel method to construct uniformly valid confidence bands for a nonparametric component $f_1$ in the sparse additive model $Y=f_1(X_1)+\ldots + f_p(X_p) + \varepsilon$ in a high-dimensional setting. Our method integrates sieve estimation into a high-dimensional Z-estimation framework, facilitating the construction of uniformly valid confidence bands for the target component $f_1$. To form these confidence bands, we employ a multiplier bootstrap procedure. Additionally, we provide rates for the uniform lasso estimation in high dimensions, which may be of independent interest. Through simulation studies, we demonstrate that our proposed method delivers reliable results in terms of estimation and coverage, even in small samples.</description>
