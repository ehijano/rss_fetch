      <title>Model discovery on the fly using continuous data assimilation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.13561</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.13561v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We review an algorithm developed for parameter estimation within the Continuous Data Assimilation (CDA) approach. We present an alternative derivation for the algorithm presented in a paper by Carlson, Hudson, and Larios (CHL, 2021). This derivation relies on the same assumptions as the previous derivation but frames the problem as a finite dimensional root-finding problem. Within the approach we develop, the algorithm developed in (CHL, 2021) is simply a realization of Newton's method. We then consider implementing other derivative based optimization algorithms; we show that the Levenberg Maqrquardt algorithm has similar performance to the CHL algorithm in the single parameter estimation case and generalizes much better to fitting multiple parameters. We then implement these methods in three example systems: the Lorenz '63 model, the two-layer Lorenz '96 model, and the Kuramoto-Sivashinsky equation.</description>

      <title>Unconditionally stable symplectic integrators for the Navier-Stokes equations and other dissipative systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.13569</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.13569v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Symplectic integrators offer vastly superior performance over traditional numerical techniques for conservative dynamical systems, but their application to \emph{dissipative} systems is inherently difficult due to dissipative systems' lack of symplectic structure. Leveraging the intrinsic variational structure of higher-order dynamics, this paper presents a general technique for applying existing symplectic integration schemes to dissipative systems, with particular emphasis on viscous fluids modeled by the Navier-Stokes equations. Two very simple such schemes are developed here. Not only are these schemes unconditionally stable for dissipative systems, they also outperform traditional methods with a similar degree of complexity in terms of accuracy for a given time step. For example, in the case of viscous flow between two infinite, flat plates, one of the schemes developed here is found to outperform both the implicit Euler method and the explicit fourth-order Runge-Kutta method in predicting the velocity profile. To the authors' knowledge, this is the very first time that a symplectic integration scheme has been applied successfully to the Navier-Stokes equations. We interpret the present success as direct empirical validation of the canonical Hamiltonian formulation of the Navier-Stokes problem recently published by Sanders~\emph{et al.} More sophisticated symplectic integration schemes are expected to exhibit even greater performance. It is hoped that these results will lead to improved numerical methods in computational fluid dynamics.</description>

      <title>A low-rank balanced truncation approach for large-scale RLCk model order reduction based on extended Krylov subspace and a frequency-aware convergence criterion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.13571</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.13571v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Model order reduction (MOR) is essential in integrated circuit design, particularly when dealing with large-scale electromagnetic models extracted from complex designs. The numerous passive elements introduced in these models pose significant challenges in the simulation process. MOR methods based on balanced truncation (BT) help address these challenges by producing compact reduced-order models (ROMs) that preserve the original model's input-output port behavior. In this work, we present an extended Krylov subspace-based BT approach with a frequency-aware convergence criterion and efficient implementation techniques for reducing large-scale models. Experimental results indicate that our method generates accurate and compact ROMs while achieving up to x22 smaller ROMs with similar accuracy compared to ANSYS RaptorX ROMs for large-scale benchmarks.</description>

      <title>Higher-Order Spectral Element Methods for Electromagnetic Modeling of Complex Anisotropic Waveguides</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.13573</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.13573v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This research thesis presents a novel higher-order spectral element method (SEM) formulated in cylindrical coordinates for analyzing electromagnetic fields in waveguides filled with complex anisotropic media. In this study, we consider a large class of cylindrical waveguides: radially-bounded and radially-unbounded domains; homogeneous and inhomogeneous waveguides; concentric and non-concentric geometries; Hermitian and non-Hermitian anisotropic media tensors. This work explores different wave equation formulations for one-layer eccentric and multilayer cylindrical waveguides. For the first case, we can define a new normalized scalar Helmholtz equation for decoupling TM and TE modes, and for the second, a vectorial Helmholtz equation for hybrid modes in multilayered anisotropic structures. Additionally, we formulate a transformation optics (TO) framework to include non-symmetric and non-Hermitian media tensors for non-concentric multilayer waveguides. Lastly, we model excitation sources for logging sensors applied in geophysical problems using the fields obtained by SEM. We validate the proposed approach against analytical solutions, perturbation-based and mode-matching-based methods, finite-elements, and finite-integration numerical methods. Our technique obtains accurate results with fewer elements and degrees of freedom (DoF) than Cartesian-based SEM and ordinary finite-element approaches. To this end, we use higher-order two-dimensional basis functions associated with the zeros of the completed Lobatto polynomial to model the fields in each reference element. The convergence analysis demonstrates the absence of the Runge effect as the expansion order increases. Numerical results show that our formulation is efficient and accurate for modeling cylindrical waveguided geometries filled with complex media.</description>

      <title>Maximum-norm a posteriori error bounds for parabolic equations discretised by the extrapolated Euler method in time and FEM in space</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.13617</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.13617v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A class of linear parabolic equations is considered. We derive a framework for the a posteriori error analysis of time discretisations by Richardson extrapolation of arbitrary order combined with finite element discretisations in space. We use the idea of elliptic reconstructions and certain bounds for the Green's function of the parabolic operator. The crucial point in the analysis is the design of suitable polynomial reconstructions in time from approximations that are given only in the mesh points.</description>

      <title>A Characteristic Mapping Method with Source Terms: Applications to Ideal Magnetohydrodynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.13772</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.13772v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This work introduces a generalized characteristic mapping method designed to handle non-linear advection with source terms. The semi-Lagrangian approach advances the flow map, incorporating the source term via the Duhamel integral. We derive a recursive formula for the time decomposition of the map and the source term integral, enhancing computational efficiency. Benchmark computations are presented for a test case with an exact solution and for two-dimensional ideal incompressible magnetohydrodynamics (MHD). Results demonstrate third-order accuracy in both space and time. The submap decomposition method achieves exceptionally high resolution, as illustrated by zooming into fine-scale current sheets. An error estimate is performed and suggests third order convergence in space and time.</description>

      <title>Structure-preserving model reduction of Hamiltonian systems by learning a symplectic autoencoder</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.13906</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.13906v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Evolutionary partial differential equations play a crucial role in many areas of science and engineering. Spatial discretization of these equations leads to a system of ordinary differential equations which can then be solved by numerical time integration. Such a system is often of very high dimension, making the simulation very time consuming. One way to reduce the computational cost is to approximate the large system by a low-dimensional model using a model reduction approach. This master thesis deals with structure-preserving model reduction of Hamiltonian systems by using machine learning techniques. We discuss a nonlinear approach based on the construction of an encoder-decoder pair that minimizes the approximation error and satisfies symplectic constraints to guarantee the preservation of the structure inherent in Hamiltonian systems. More specifically, we study an autoencoder network that learns a symplectic encoder-decoder pair. Symplecticity poses some additional difficulties, as we need to ensure this structure in each network layer. Since these symplectic constraints are described by the (symplectic) Stiefel manifold, we use manifold optimization techniques to ensure the symplecticity of the encoder and decoder. A particular challenge is to adapt the ADAM optimizer to the manifold structure. We present a modified ADAM optimizer that works directly on the Stiefel manifold and compare it to the existing approach based on homogeneous spaces. In addition, we propose several modifications to the network and training setup that significantly improve the performance and accuracy of the autoencoder. Finally, we numerically validate the modified optimizer and different learning configurations on two Hamiltonian systems, the 1D wave equation and the sine-Gordon equation, and demonstrate the improved accuracy and computational efficiency of the presented learning algorithms.</description>

      <title>Generalizing subdiffusive Black-Scholes model by variable exponent: Model transformation and numerical approximation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.13913</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.13913v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This work generalizes the subdiffusive Black-Scholes model by introducing the variable exponent in order to provide adequate descriptions for the option pricing, where the variable exponent may account for the variation of the memory property. In addition to standard nonlinear-to-linear transformation, we apply a further spatial-temporal transformation to convert the model to a more tractable form in order to circumvent the difficulties caused by the ``non-positive, non-monotonic'' variable-exponent memory kernel. An interesting phenomenon is that the spatial transformation not only eliminates the advection term but naturally turns the original noncoercive spatial operator into a coercive one due to the specific structure of the Black-Scholes model, which thus avoids imposing constraints on coefficients. Then we perform numerical analysis for both the semi-discrete and fully discrete schemes to support numerical simulation. Numerical experiments are carried out to substantiate the theoretical results.</description>

      <title>Variational Multiscale Evolve and Filter Strategies for Convection-Dominated Flows</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.13957</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.13957v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The evolve-filter (EF) model is a filter-based numerical stabilization for under-resolved convection-dominated flows. EF is a simple, modular, and effective strategy for both full-order models (FOMs) and reduced-order models (ROMs). It is well-known, however, that when the filter radius is too large, EF can be overdiffusive and yield inaccurate results. To alleviate this, EF is usually supplemented with a relaxation step. The relaxation parameter, however, is very sensitive with respect to the model parameters. In this paper, we propose a novel strategy to alleviate the EF overdiffusivity for a large filter radius. Specifically, we leverage the variational multiscale (VMS) framework to separate the large resolved scales from the small resolved scales in the evolved velocity, and we use the filtered small scales to correct the large scales. Furthermore, in the new VMS-EF strategy, we use two different ways to decompose the evolved velocity: the VMS Evolve-Filter-Filter-Correct (VMS-EFFC) and the VMS Evolve-Postprocess-Filter-Correct (VMS-EPFC) algorithms. The new VMS-based algorithms yield significantly more accurate results than the standard EF in both the FOM and the ROM simulations of a flow past a cylinder at Reynolds number Re = 1000.</description>

      <title>Neural numerical homogenization based on Deep Ritz corrections</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.14084</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.14084v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Numerical homogenization methods aim at providing appropriate coarse-scale approximations of solutions to (elliptic) partial differential equations that involve highly oscillatory coefficients. The localized orthogonal decomposition (LOD) method is an effective way of dealing with such coefficients, especially if they are non-periodic and non-smooth. It modifies classical finite element basis functions by suitable fine-scale corrections. In this paper, we make use of the structure of the LOD method, but we propose to calculate the corrections based on a Deep Ritz approach involving a parametrization of the coefficients to tackle temporal variations or uncertainties. Numerical examples for a parabolic model problem are presented to assess the performance of the approach.</description>

      <title>Differentiable SVD based on Moore-Penrose Pseudoinverse for Inverse Imaging Problems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.14141</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.14141v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Low-rank regularization-based deep unrolling networks have achieved remarkable success in various inverse imaging problems (IIPs). However, the singular value decomposition (SVD) is non-differentiable when duplicated singular values occur, leading to severe numerical instability during training. In this paper, we propose a differentiable SVD based on the Moore-Penrose pseudoinverse to address this issue. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work to provide a comprehensive analysis of the differentiability of the trivial SVD. Specifically, we show that the non-differentiability of SVD is essentially due to an underdetermined system of linear equations arising in the derivation process. We utilize the Moore-Penrose pseudoinverse to solve the system, thereby proposing a differentiable SVD. A numerical stability analysis in the context of IIPs is provided. Experimental results in color image compressed sensing and dynamic MRI reconstruction show that our proposed differentiable SVD can effectively address the numerical instability issue while ensuring computational precision.

      <title>Error Analysis of the Deep Mixed Residual Method for High-order Elliptic Equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.14151</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.14151v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper presents an a priori error analysis of the Deep Mixed Residual method (MIM) for solving high-order elliptic equations with non-homogeneous boundary conditions, including Dirichlet, Neumann, and Robin conditions. We examine MIM with two types of loss functions, referred to as first-order and second-order least squares systems. By providing boundedness and coercivity analysis, we leverage C\'{e}a's Lemma to decompose the total error into the approximation, generalization, and optimization errors. Utilizing the Barron space theory and Rademacher complexity, an a priori error is derived regarding the training samples and network size that are exempt from the curse of dimensionality. Our results reveal that MIM significantly reduces the regularity requirements for activation functions compared to the deep Ritz method, implying the effectiveness of MIM in solving high-order equations.</description>

      <title>Regularization and passivity-preserving model reduction of quasilinear magneto-quasistatic coupled problems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.14226</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.14226v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider the quasilinear magneto-quasistatic field equations that arise in the simulation of low-frequency electromagnetic devices coupled to electrical circuits. Spatial discretization of these equations on 3D domains using the finite element method results in a singular system of differential-algebraic equations (DAEs). First, we analyze the structural properties of this system and present a novel regularization approach based on projecting out the singular state components. Next, we explore the passivity of the variational magneto-quasistatic problem and its discretization by defining suitable storage functions. For model reduction of the magneto-quasistatic system, we employ the proper orthogonal decomposition (POD) technique combined with the discrete empirical interpolation method (DEIM), to facilitate efficient evaluation of the system's nonlinearities. Our model reduction approach involves the transformation of the regularized DAE into a system of ordinary differential equations, leveraging a special block structure inherent in the problem, followed by applying standard model reduction techniques to the transformed system. We prove that the POD-reduced model preserves passivity, and for the POD-DEIM-reduced model, we propose to enforce passivity by perturbing the output in a way that accounts for DEIM errors. Numerical experiments illustrate the effectiveness of the presented model reduction methods and the passivity enforcement technique.</description>

      <title>Accelerating Construction of Non-Intrusive Nonlinear Structural Dynamics Reduced Order Models through Hyperreduction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.14262</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.14262v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a novel technique to significantly reduce the offline cost associated to non-intrusive nonlinear tensors identification in reduced order models (ROMs) of geometrically nonlinear, finite elements (FE)-discretized structural dynamics problems. The ROM is obtained by Galerkin-projection of the governing equations on a reduction basis (RB) of Vibration Modes (VMs) and Static Modal Derivatives (SMDs), resulting in reduced internal forces that are cubic polynomial in the reduced coordinates. The unknown coefficients of the nonlinear tensors associated with this polynomial representation are identified using a modified version of Enhanced Enforced Displacement (EED) method which leverages Energy Conserving Sampling and Weighting (ECSW) as hyperreduction technique for efficiency improvement. Specifically, ECSW is employed to accelerate the evaluations of the nonlinear reduced tangent stiffness matrix that are required within EED. Simulation-free training sets of forces for ECSW are obtained from displacements corresponding to quasi-random samples of a nonlinear second order static displacement manifold. The proposed approach is beneficial for the investigation of the dynamic response of structures subjected to acoustic loading, where multiple VMs must be added in the RB, resulting in expensive nonlinear tensor identification. Superiority of the novel method over standard EED is demonstrated on FE models of a shallow curved clamped panel and of a nine-bay aeronautical reinforced panel modelled, using the commercial finite element program Abaqus.</description>

      <title>Introducing a Harmonic Balance Navier-Stokes Finite Element Solver to Accelerate Cardiovascular Simulations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.14315</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.14315v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The adoption of cardiovascular simulations for diagnosis and surgical planning on a patient-specific basis requires the development of faster methods than the existing state-of-the-art techniques. To address this need, we leverage the periodic nature of these flows to accurately capture their time-dependence using spectral discretization. Owing to the reduced size of the discrete problem, the resulting approach, known as the harmonic balance method, significantly lowers the solution cost when compared against the conventional time marching methods. This study describes a stabilized finite element implementation of the harmonic balanced method that targets the simulation of physically-stable time-periodic flows. That stabilized method is based on the Galerkin/least-squares formulation that permits stable solution in convection-dominant flows and convenient use of the same interpolation functions for velocity and pressure. We test this solver against its equivalent time marching method using three common physiological cases where blood flow is modeled in a Glenn operation, a cerebral artery, and a left main coronary artery. Using the conventional time marching solver, simulating these cases takes more than ten hours. That cost is reduced by up to two orders of magnitude when the proposed harmonic balance solver is utilized, where a solution is produced in approximately 30 minutes. We show that that solution is in excellent agreement with the conventional solvers when the number of modes is sufficiently large to accurately represent the imposed boundary conditions.</description>

      <title>Continuous nonlinear adaptive experimental design with gradient flow</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.14332</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.14332v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Identifying valuable measurements is one of the main challenges in computational inverse problems, often framed as the optimal experimental design (OED) problem. In this paper, we investigate nonlinear OED within a continuously-indexed design space. This is in contrast to the traditional approaches on selecting experiments from a finite measurement set. This formulation better reflects practical scenarios where measurements are taken continuously across spatial or temporal domains. However, optimizing over a continuously-indexed space introduces computational challenges. To address these, we employ gradient flow and optimal transport techniques, complemented by adaptive strategy for interactive optimization. Numerical results on the Lorenz 63 system and Schr\"odinger equation demonstrate that our solver identifies valuable measurements and achieves improved reconstruction of unknown parameters in inverse problems.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.14333v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Stochastic diffusion equations are crucial for modeling a range of physical phenomena influenced by uncertainties. We introduce the generalized finite difference method for solving these equations. Then, we examine its consistency, stability and convergence in mean-square, showing that the proposed method preserves stability and demonstrates favorable convergence characteristics under suitable assumptions. In order to validate the methodology, we present numerical results in one-, two-, and three-dimensional space domains.</description>

      <title>Inexact Generalized Golub-Kahan Methods for Large-Scale Bayesian Inverse Problems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.14409</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.14409v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Solving large-scale Bayesian inverse problems presents significant challenges, particularly when the exact (discretized) forward operator is unavailable. These challenges often arise in image processing tasks due to unknown defects in the forward process that may result in varying degrees of inexactness in the forward model. Moreover, for many large-scale problems, computing the square root or inverse of the prior covariance matrix is infeasible such as when the covariance kernel is defined on irregular grids or is accessible only through matrix-vector products. This paper introduces an efficient approach by developing an inexact generalized Golub-Kahan decomposition that can incorporate varying degrees of inexactness in the forward model to solve large-scale generalized Tikhonov regularized problems. Further, a hybrid iterative projection scheme is developed to automatically select Tikhonov regularization parameters. Numerical experiments on simulated tomography reconstructions demonstrate the stability and effectiveness of this novel hybrid approach.</description>

      <title>Why the p-norms $p{=}1$, $p{=}2$ and $p{=}\infty$ are so special? An answer based on spatial uniformity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.13567</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.13567v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Among all metrics based on p-norms, the Manhattan (p=1), euclidean (p=2) and Chebyshev distances (p=infinity) are the most widely used for their interpretability, simplicity and technical convenience. But these are not the only arguments for the ubiquity of these three p-norms. This article proves that there is a volume-surface correspondence property that is unique to them. More precisely, it is shown that sampling uniformly from the volume of an n-dimensional p-ball and projecting to its surface is equivalent to directly sampling uniformly from its surface if and only if p is 1, 2 or infinity. Sampling algorithms and their implementations in Python are also provided.</description>

      <title>Exact and approximate error bounds for physics-informed neural networks</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.13848v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The use of neural networks to solve differential equations, as an alternative to traditional numerical solvers, has increased recently. However, error bounds for the obtained solutions have only been developed for certain equations. In this work, we report important progress in calculating error bounds of physics-informed neural networks (PINNs) solutions of nonlinear first-order ODEs. We give a general expression that describes the error of the solution that the PINN-based method provides for a nonlinear first-order ODE. In addition, we propose a technique to calculate an approximate bound for the general case and an exact bound for a particular case. The error bounds are computed using only the residual information and the equation structure. We apply the proposed methods to particular cases and show that they can successfully provide error bounds without relying on the numerical solution.</description>

      <title>Numerical null controllability of parabolic PDEs using Lagrangian methods</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.14031</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.14031v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we study several theoretical and numerical questions concerning the null controllability problems for linear parabolic equations and systems for several dimensions. The control is distributed and acts on a small subset of the domain. The main goal is to compute numerically a control that drives a numerical approximation of the state from prescribed initial data exactly to zero. We introduce a methodology for solving numerical controllability problems that is new in some sense. The main idea is to apply classical Lagrangian and Augmented Lagrangian techniques to suitable constrained extremal formulations that involve unbounded weights in time that make global Carleman inequalities possible. The theoretical results are validated by satisfactory numerical experiments for spatially 2D and 3D problems.</description>

      <title>Desingularization of bounded-rank tensor sets</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.14093v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Low-rank tensors appear to be prosperous in many applications. However, the sets of bounded-rank tensors are non-smooth and non-convex algebraic varieties, rendering the low-rank optimization problems to be challenging. To this end, we delve into the geometry of bounded-rank tensor sets, including Tucker and tensor train formats. We propose a desingularization approach for bounded-rank tensor sets by introducing slack variables, resulting in a low-dimensional smooth manifold embedded in a higher-dimensional space while preserving the structure of low-rank tensor formats. Subsequently, optimization on tensor varieties can be reformulated to optimization on smooth manifolds, where the methods and convergence are well explored. We reveal the relationship between the landscape of optimization on varieties and that of optimization on manifolds. Numerical experiments on tensor completion illustrate that the proposed methods are in favor of others under different rank parameters.</description>

Abstract: We study a coloured operad involving rooted trees and directed cycles of rooted trees that generalizes the operad of rooted trees of Chapoton and Livernet. We describe all the relations between the generators of a certain suboperad of that operad, and compute the Chevalley-Eilenberg homology of two naturally arising differential graded Lie algebras. This allows us to give short and conceptual new proofs of two important results on Butcher series methods of numerical solution of ODEs: absence of volume-preserving integration schemes and the acyclicity of the aromatic bicomplex, the key step in a complete classification of volume-preserving integration schemes using the so called aromatic Butcher series.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2307.11229v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the Landau-de Gennes Q-tensor model of liquid crystals subjected to an electric field and develop a fully discrete numerical scheme for its solution. The scheme uses a convex splitting of the bulk potential, and we introduce a truncation operator for the Q-tensors to ensure well-posedness of the problem. We prove the stability and well-posedness of the scheme. Finally, making a restriction on the admissible parameters of the scheme, we show that up to a subsequence, solutions to the fully discrete scheme converge to weak solutions of the Q-tensor model as the time step and mesh are refined. We then present numerical results computed by the numerical scheme, among which we show that it is possible to simulate the Fr\'eedericksz transition with this scheme.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.16583v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We provide in this work an algorithm for approximating a very broad class of symmetric Toeplitz matrices to machine precision in $\mathcal{O}(n \log n)$ time with applications to fitting time series models. In particular, for a symmetric Toeplitz matrix $\mathbf{\Sigma}$ with values $\mathbf{\Sigma}_{j,k} = h_{|j-k|} = \int_{-1/2}^{1/2} e^{2 \pi i |j-k| \omega} S(\omega) \mathrm{d} \omega$ where $S(\omega)$ is piecewise smooth, we give an approximation $\mathbf{\mathcal{F}} \mathbf{\Sigma} \mathbf{\mathcal{F}}^H \approx \mathbf{D} + \mathbf{U} \mathbf{V}^H$, where $\mathbf{\mathcal{F}}$ is the DFT matrix, $\mathbf{D}$ is diagonal, and the matrices $\mathbf{U}$ and $\mathbf{V}$ are in $\mathbb{C}^{n \times r}$ with $r \ll n$. Studying these matrices in the context of time series, we offer a theoretical explanation of this structure and connect it to existing spectral-domain approximation frameworks. We then give a complete discussion of the numerical method for assembling the approximation and demonstrate its efficiency for improving Whittle-type likelihood approximations, including dramatic examples where a correction of rank $r = 2$ to the standard Whittle approximation increases the accuracy of the log-likelihood approximation from $3$ to $14$ digits for a matrix $\mathbf{\Sigma} \in \mathbb{R}^{10^5 \times 10^5}$. The method and analysis of this work applies well beyond time series analysis, providing an algorithm for extremely accurate solutions to linear systems with a wide variety of symmetric Toeplitz matrices whose entries are generated by a piecewise smooth $S(\omega)$. The analysis employed here largely depends on asymptotic expansions of oscillatory integrals, and also provides a new perspective on when existing spectral-domain approximation methods for Gaussian log-likelihoods can be particularly problematic.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.06375v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This work investigates the accuracy and numerical stability of CUR decompositions with oversampling. The CUR decomposition approximates a matrix using a subset of columns and rows of the matrix. When the number of columns and the rows are the same, the CUR decomposition can become unstable and less accurate due to the presence of the matrix inverse in the core matrix. Nevertheless, we demonstrate that the CUR decomposition can be implemented in a numerical stable manner and illustrate that oversampling, which increases either the number of columns or rows in the CUR decomposition, can enhance its accuracy and stability. Additionally, this work devises an algorithm for oversampling motivated by the theory of the CUR decomposition and the cosine-sine decomposition, whose competitiveness is illustrated through experiments.</description>

      <title>DiscoTEX 1.0: Discontinuous collocation and implicit-turned-explicit (IMTEX) integration symplectic, symmetric numerical algorithms with higher order jumps for differential equations I: numerical black hole perturbation theory applications</title>

      <description>arXiv:2401.08758v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Dirac $\delta-$ distributionally sourced differential equations emerge in many dynamical physical systems from machine learning, finance, neuroscience, and seismology to black hole perturbation theory. These systems lack exact analytical solutions and are thus best tackled numerically. We describe a generic numerical algorithm which constructs discontinuous spatial and temporal discretisations by operating on discontinuous Lagrange and Hermite interpolation formulae, respectively. By solving the distributionally sourced wave equation, possessing analytical solutions, we demonstrate that numerical weak-form solutions can be recovered to high-order accuracy by solving a first-order reduced system of ODEs. The method-of-lines framework is applied to the \texttt{DiscoTEX} algorithm i.e. through \underline{dis}continuous \underline{co}llocation with implicit\underline{-turned-explicit} integration methods which are symmetric and conserve symplectic structure. Furthermore, the main application of the algorithm is proved by calculating the amplitude at any desired location within the numerical grid, including at the position (and at its right and left limit) where the wave- (or wave-like) equation is discontinuous via interpolation using \texttt{DiscoTEX}. This is demonstrated, firstly by solving the wave- (or wave-like) equation and comparing the numerical weak-form solution to the exact solution. We further demonstrate how to reconstruct the gravitational metric perturbations from weak-form numerical solutions of a non-rotating black hole, which do not have known exact analytical solutions, and compare them against state-of-the-art frequency domain results. We conclude by motivating how \texttt{DiscoTEX}, and related numerical algorithms, both open a promising new alternative waveform generation route for modelling highly asymmetric binaries and complement current frequency domain methods.</description>

      <title>Integrating Physics of the Problem into Data-Driven Methods to Enhance Elastic Full-Waveform Inversion with Uncertainty Quantification</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.05153</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.05153v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Full-Waveform Inversion (FWI) is a nonlinear iterative seismic imaging technique that, by reducing the misfit between recorded and predicted seismic waveforms, can produce detailed estimates of subsurface geophysical properties. Nevertheless, the strong nonlinearity of FWI can trap the optimization in local minima. This issue arises due to factors such as improper initial values, the absence of low frequencies in the measurements, noise, and other related considerations. To address this challenge and with the advent of advanced machine-learning techniques, data-driven methods, such as deep learning, have attracted significantly increasing attention in the geophysical community. Furthermore, the elastic wave equation should be included in FWI to represent elastic effects accurately. The intersection of data-driven techniques and elastic scattering theories presents opportunities and challenges. In this paper, by using the knowledge of elastic scattering (physics of the problem) and integrating it with machine learning techniques, we propose methods for the solution of time-harmonic FWI to enhance accuracy compared to pure data-driven and physics-based approaches. Moreover, to address uncertainty quantification, by modifying the structure of the Variational Autoencoder, we introduce a probabilistic deep learning method based on the physics of the problem that enables us to explore the uncertainties of the solution. According to the limited availability of datasets in this field and to assess the performance and accuracy of the proposed methods, we create a comprehensive dataset close to reality and conduct a comparative analysis of the presented approaches to it.</description>
