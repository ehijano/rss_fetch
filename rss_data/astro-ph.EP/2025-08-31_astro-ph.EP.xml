      <title>Stringent Upper Bounds on Atmospheric Mass Loss from Three Neptune-Sized Planets in the TOI-4010 System</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.21166</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.21166v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Photoevaporative models predict that the lower edge of the Neptune desert is sculpted by atmospheric mass loss. However, the stellar high energy fluxes that power hydrodynamic escape and set predicted mass loss rates can be uncertain by multiple orders of magnitude. These uncertainties can be bypassed by studying mass loss for planets within the same system, as they have effectively undergone scaled versions of the same irradiation history. The TOI-4010 system is an ideal test case for mass loss models, as it contains three Neptune-sized planets with planet b located in the `Neptune desert', planet c in the `Neptune ridge', and planet d in the `Neptune savanna'. Using Keck/NIRSPEC, we measured the metastable helium transit depths of all three planets in order to search for evidence of atmospheric escape. We place upper bounds on the excess helium absorption of 1.23\%, 0.81\%, and 0.87\% at 95\% confidence for TOI-4010~b, c and d respectively. We fit our transmission spectra with Parker wind models and find that this corresponds to 95th-percentile upper limits of $10^{10.17}$g~s$^{-1}$, $10^{10.53}$g~s$^{-1}$, and $10^{10.50}$g~s$^{-1}$ on the mass loss rates of TOI-4010~b, c, and d respectively. Our non-detections are inconsistent with expectations from one-dimensional hydrodynamic models for solar composition atmospheres. We consider potential reductions in signal from a decreased host star XUV luminosity, planetary magnetic fields, enhanced atmospheric metallicities, and fractionation, and explore the implications of our measurements for the past evaporation histories of all three planets.</description>

      <title>TOI-1438: A rare system with two short-period sub-Neptunes and a tentative long-period Jupiter-like planet orbiting a K0V star</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.21533</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.21533v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present the detection and characterisation of the TOI-1438 multi-planet system discovered by TESS. We collected a series of follow-up observations including high-spectral resolution observations with HARPS-N over a period of five years. Our modelling shows that the K0V star hosts two transiting sub-Neptunes with Rb = 3.04 +/- 0.19 RE, Rc = 2.75 +/- 0.14 RE, Mb = 9.4 +/- 1.8 ME, and Mc = 10.6 +/- 2.1 ME. The orbital periods of planets b and c are 5.1 and 9.4 days, respectively, corresponding to instellations of 145 +/- 10 and 65 +/- 4 FE. The bulk densities are 1.8 +/- 0.5 and 2.9 +/- 0.7 g cm-3, respectively, suggesting a volatile-rich interior composition. We computed a set of planet interior structure models. Planet b presents a high-metallicity envelope that can accommodate up to 2.5 % in H/He in mass, while planet c cannot have more than 0.2 % as H/He in mass. For any composition of the core considered (Fe-rock or ice-rock), both planets would require a volatile-rich envelope. In addition to the two planets, the radial velocity (RV) data clearly reveal a third signal, likely coming from a non-transiting planet, with an orbital period of 7.6 +1.6 -2.4 years and a radial velocity semi-amplitude of 35+3-5 m s-1. Our best fit model finds a minimum mass of 2.1 +/- 0.3 MJ and an eccentricity of 0.25+0.08-0.11. However, several RV activity indicators also show strong signals at similar periods, suggesting this signal might (partly) originate from stellar activity. More data over a longer period of time are needed to conclusively determine the nature of this signal. If it is confirmed as a triple-planet system, TOI-1438 would be one of the few detected systems to date characterised by an architecture with two small, short-period planets and one massive, long-period planet, where the inner and outer systems are separated by an orbital period ratio of the order of a few hundred.</description>

      <title>How stellar mass and disc size shape the formation and migration of super-Earths</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.21627</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.21627v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The occurrence rate of close-in super-Earths is higher around M-dwarfs compared to stars of higher masses. In this work we aim to understand how the super-Earth population is affected by both the stellar mass, the size of the protoplanetary disc, and viscous heating. We utilise a standard protoplanetary disc model with both irradiated and viscous heating together with a pebble accretion model to simulate the formation and migration of planets. We find that if the disc is heated purely through stellar irradiation, inwards migration of super-Earths is very efficient, resulting in the close-in super-Earth fraction increasing with increasing stellar mass. In contrast, when viscous heating is included, planets can undergo outwards migration, delaying migration to the inner edge of the protoplanetary disc, which causes a fraction of super-Earth planets to grow to become giant planets instead. This results in a significant reduction of inner super-Earths around high-mass stars and an increase in the number of giant planets, both of which mirror observed features of the planet population around high-mass stars. This effect is most pronounced when the protoplanetary disc is large, since such discs evolve over a longer time-scale. We also test a model when we inject protoplanets at a fixed time early on in the disc lifetime. In this case, the fraction of close-in super-Earths decreases with increasing stellar mass in both the irradiated case and viscous case, since longer disc lifetimes around high-mass stars allows for planets to grow into giants instead of super-Earths for most injection locations.</description>

      <title>The Impact of Enhanced EUV Flux on the Upper Atmosphere of Earth-like Exoplanets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.21745</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.21745v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Identifying Earth-like planets outside out solar system is a leading research goal in astronomy, but determining if candidate planets have atmospheres, and more importantly if they can retain atmospheres, is still out of reach. In this paper, we present our study on the impact of enhanced EUV flux on the stability and escape of the upper atmosphere of an Earth-like exoplanet using the Global Ionosphere and Thermosphere Model (GITM). We also investigate the differences between one- and three-dimensional solutions. We use a baseline case of EUV flux experienced at the Earth, and multiplying this flux by a constant factor going up to 50. Our results show a clear evidence of an inflated and elevated ionosphere due to enhanced EUV flux, and they provide a detailed picture of how different heating and cooling rates, as well as the conductivity are changing at each EUV flux level. Our results also demonstrate that one-dimensional solutions are limited in their ability to capture a global atmosphere that are not uniform. We find that a threshold EUV flux level for a stable atmosphere occurs around a factor of 10 times the baseline level, where EUV fluxes above this level indicate a rapidly escaping atmosphere. This threshold EUV flux translates to about 0.3AU for a planet orbiting the Sun. Thus, our findings indicate that an Earth-like exoplanet orbiting its host star in a close-in orbit is likely to lose its atmosphere quickly.</description>

      <title>The Uranus Flagship: Investigating New Paradigms for Outer Solar System Exploration Workshop Summary Report</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.21074</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.21074v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This white paper is a summary of the Uranus Flagship Workshop that took place 21 to 23 May 2024 at NASA's Goddard Space Flight Center. Co-led by Goddard and Johns Hopkins Applied Physics Lab conveners, we had a broad, international, Science Organizing Committee, and a largely early career Local Organizing Committee from APL and GSFC. From prior workshops, it was apparent that the community was wildly enthusiastic about starting a mission, but lacked focus on what was possible or where to begin. Thus, the purpose of our workshop was to discuss practical aspects of the next planetary flagship and how we can employ new paradigms to better enable robust outer planet exploration. To enable this goal, we introduced the community to the best practices and lessons learned from previous missions and NASA-commissioned studies, and discussed the challenges involved with a mission so far from the Earth/Sun. The underlying workshop purpose was to steward the community towards a more practical mission design approach that will enable the development of this mission, as well as future missions, on a shorter cadence by setting expectations and having difficult discussions early in development. Because of the time scales involved in this mission, special effort was made towards early career inclusion and participation.</description>

      <title>Response of Ionospheric Total Electron Content to the Impulsive and Late Phases of X-Class Solar Flares with Various Center-to-Limb Locations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.21668</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.21668v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: During a solar flare, the fluxes in various lines and continua of the solar spectrum increase, leading to enhanced ionization of the illuminated part of the Earth's ionosphere and an increase in the total electron content (TEC). It has been previously shown that nearly 50% of X-class solar flares exhibit a second peak in warm coronal lines, such as FeXV and FeXVI (called the 'EUV late phase'), the effect of which on the ionosphere remains largely unexplored. This study presents an analysis of the ionospheric response to 14 X-class flares with pronounced late phases. For the first time, empirical relationships between the increase in TEC and the solar flux enhancement during the impulsive and late phases of the flare are derived. Additionally, we demonstrate the influence of flare location on the intensity of geoeffective solar spectral lines and the ratio of the ionospheric responses to the impulsive and late phases of solar flares.</description>

      <title>A Comprehensive Reanalysis of K2-18 b's JWST NIRISS+NIRSpec Transmission Spectrum</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.18477</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.18477v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Sub-Neptunes are the most common type of planet in our galaxy. Interior structure models suggest that the coldest sub-Neptunes could host liquid water oceans underneath their hydrogen envelopes -- sometimes called ``hycean'' planets. JWST transmission spectra of the $\sim$ 250 K sub-Neptune K2-18 b were recently used to report detections of CH$_4$ and CO$_2$, alongside weaker evidence of (CH$_3$)$_2$S (dimethyl sulfide, or DMS). Atmospheric CO$_2$ was interpreted as evidence for a liquid water ocean, while DMS was highlighted as a potential biomarker. However, these notable claims were derived using a single data reduction and retrieval modeling framework, which did not allow for standard robustness tests. Here we present a comprehensive reanalysis of K2-18 b's JWST NIRISS SOSS and NIRSpec G395H transmission spectra, including the first analysis of the second-order NIRISS SOSS data. We incorporate multiple well-tested data reduction pipelines and retrieval codes, spanning 60 different data treatments and over 250 atmospheric retrievals. We confirm the detection of CH$_4$ ($\approx 4\sigma$), with a volume mixing ratio range $-2.14 \leq \log_{10} \mathrm{CH_4} \leq -0.53$, but we find no statistically significant or reliable evidence for CO$_2$ or DMS. Finally, we assess the retrieved atmospheric composition using photochemical-climate and interior models, demonstrating that our revised composition of K2-18\,b can be explained by an oxygen-poor mini-Neptune without requiring a liquid water surface or life.</description>

      <title>Sub-Neptunes Are Drier Than They Seem: Rethinking the Origins of Water-Rich Worlds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.00765</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.00765v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Recent claims of biosignature gases in sub-Neptune atmospheres have renewed interest in water-rich sub-Neptunes with surface oceans, often referred to as Hycean planets. These planets are hypothesized to form beyond the snow line, accreting large amounts of H$_2$O (&gt;10 wt%) before migrating inward. However, current interior models often neglect chemical equilibration between primordial atmospheres and molten interiors. Here, we compute global chemical equilibrium states for a synthetic population of sub-Neptunes with magma oceans. Although many initially accrete 5-30 wt% water, interior-atmosphere interactions destroy most of it, reducing final H$_2$O mass fractions to below 1.5 wt%. As a result, none meet the threshold for Hycean planets. Despite that, we find H$_2$O-dominated atmospheres exclusively on planets that accreted the least ice. These planets form inside the snow line, are depleted in carbon and hydrogen, and develop small envelopes with envelope mass fractions below 1%, dominated by endogenic water. In contrast, planets formed beyond the snow line accrete more volatiles, but their water is largely converted to H$_2$ gas or sequestered into the interior, resulting in low atmospheric H$_2$O mass fractions. Most H$_2$O-rich envelopes are also fully miscible with H$_2$, making a separate water layer unlikely. Our results topple the conventional link between ice accretion and water-rich atmospheres, showing instead that H$_2$O-dominated envelopes emerge through chemical equilibration in hydrogen-poor planets formed inside the snow line.</description>

      <title>Dissociation and destruction of PAHs and PAH clusters induced by absorption of X-rays in protoplanetary discs around T Tauri stars</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.17847</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.17847v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Only 8% of the protoplanetary discs orbiting a T Tauri star show emission features of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs). As PAHs are strong absorbers of UV radiation, they contribute to the heating of the discs photosphere, shielding of UV radiation that drives photo-chemistry in the disc, and their abundance is a key parameter to determine the strength of photo-evaporative disc winds. We want to understand the photochemical evolution of PAHs in protoplanetary discs around T Tauri stars and thus explain the absence of PAH features. We want to determine whether PAHs are destroyed because of the X-ray emission from their host stars or whether PAHs can withstand these conditions. We developed a model for the absorption of X-rays by PAHs. X-rays with more energy than the K edge of carbon will double ionise PAHs and will vibrationally excite them by ~ 15-35 eV. With a Monte Carlo model, we modelled the dissociation of H, H2, and C2H2 from PAH monomers. Furthermore, we modelled the dissociation of PAH clusters and the desorption of PAH clusters from dust grains caused by X-ray excitation. We find that small PAH clusters will quickly desorb and dissociate into individual molecules. PAH molecules experience rapid loss of H and acetylene C2H2 by the high excitation and will lose C2H2 on average after three X-ray excitations. However, large PAH clusters can stay intact and frozen out on dust grains. Based on our results, we expect a gas-phase PAH abundance that is lower than 0.01 times the ISM abundance and will rapidly decrease over time due to the dissociation of small clusters that are subsequently destroyed. To maintain a higher abundance, replenishment processes must exist such as vertical mixing. Large PAH clusters remain in the disc, frozen out on dust grains, but barely emit PAH features because of their strong thermal coupling to dust grains.</description>

      <title>JWST detection of a carbon dioxide dominated gas coma surrounding interstellar object 3I/ATLAS</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.18209</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.18209v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: 3I/ATLAS is the third confirmed interstellar object to visit our Solar System, and only the second to display a clear coma. Infrared spectroscopy with the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) provides the opportunity to measure its coma composition and determine the primary activity drivers. We report the first results from our JWST NIRSpec campaign for 3I/ATLAS, at an inbound heliocentric distance of $r_H=3.32$ au. The spectral images (spanning 0.6-5.3 $\mu$m) reveal a CO2 dominated coma, with enhanced outgassing in the sunward direction, and the presence of H2O, CO, OCS, water ice and dust. The coma CO2/H2O mixing ratio of $8.0\pm1.0$ is among the highest ever observed in a comet, and is 4.4-sigma above the trend as a function of heliocentric distance for long-period and Jupiter-family comets (excluding the outlier C/2016 R2). Our observations are compatible with an intrinsically CO2-rich nucleus, which may indicate that 3I/ATLAS contains ices exposed to higher levels of radiation than Solar System comets, or that it formed close to the CO2 ice line in its parent protoplanetary disk. A low coma H2O gas abundance may also be implied, for example, due to inhibited heat penetration into the nucleus, which could suppress the H2O sublimation rate relative to CO2 and CO.</description>

      <title>Modelling magnetic star-planet interaction in the iconic M dwarfs Proxima Centauri, YZ Ceti and GJ 1151</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.20891</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.20891v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The unambiguous detection of magnetic star-planet interaction (SPI) via radio observations would provide a novel method for detecting exoplanets and probing their magnetic fields. Although direct radio detection of sub-Jovian planets is hindered by the low frequencies involved, models of sub-Alfv\'enic SPI predict that Earth-like planets in close-in orbits around M dwarfs may induce detectable emission. Here, we revisit the modelling of the expected radio emission from magnetic star-planet interaction in the iconic M-dwarf systems Proxima Centauri, YZ Ceti, and GJ 1151, where claims of SPI-related radio detections have been made. For this, we use SIRIO (Star-planet Interaction and Radio Induced Observations), a public Python code that models radio emission from sub-Alfv\'enic SPI. We benchmark SIRIO results against those paradigmatic systems, whose SPI modeling has been previously discussed in the literature. Our results support previous findings that Proxima b, YZ Cet b, and the putative planet GJ 1151 b are most likely in the sub-Alfv\'enic regime (assuming a hybrid PFSS geometry), so SPI should be at work in all of them. We find that the Alfv\'en wing model generally predicts a very low level of radio emission, while if magnetic reconnection takes place, prospects for detection are significantly better. We also find that free-free absorption may play a relevant role, in particular in YZ Ceti. Our SIRIO code can also be used to evaluate the feasibility of radio proposals aimed at detecting SPI, and to constrain the stellar wind mass-loss rate or planetary magnetic field.</description>
