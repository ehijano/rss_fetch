      <title>CAMLD: Contrast-Agnostic Medical Landmark Detection with Consistency-Based Regularization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.17845</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.17845v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Anatomical landmark detection in medical images is essential for various clinical and research applications, including disease diagnosis and surgical planning. However, manual landmark annotation is time-consuming and requires significant expertise. Existing deep learning (DL) methods often require large amounts of well-annotated data, which are costly to acquire. In this paper, we introduce CAMLD, a novel self-supervised DL framework for anatomical landmark detection in unlabeled scans with varying contrasts by using only a single reference example. To achieve this, we employed an inter-subject landmark consistency loss with an image registration loss while introducing a 3D convolution-based contrast augmentation strategy to promote model generalization to new contrasts. Additionally, we utilize an adaptive mixed loss function to schedule the contributions of different sub-tasks for optimal outcomes. We demonstrate the proposed method with the intricate task of MRI-based 3D brain landmark detection. With comprehensive experiments on four diverse clinical and public datasets, including both T1w and T2w MRI scans at different MRI field strengths, we demonstrate that CAMLD outperforms the state-of-the-art methods in terms of mean radial errors (MREs) and success detection rates (SDRs). Our framework provides a robust and accurate solution for anatomical landmark detection, reducing the need for extensively annotated datasets and generalizing well across different imaging contrasts. Our code will be publicly available at: https://github.com/HealthX-Lab/CAMLD.</description>

      <title>Reliability of deep learning models for anatomical landmark detection: The role of inter-rater variability</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.17850</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.17850v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Automated detection of anatomical landmarks plays a crucial role in many diagnostic and surgical applications. Progresses in deep learning (DL) methods have resulted in significant performance enhancement in tasks related to anatomical landmark detection. While current research focuses on accurately localizing these landmarks in medical scans, the importance of inter-rater annotation variability in building DL models is often overlooked. Understanding how inter-rater variability impacts the performance and reliability of the resulting DL algorithms, which are crucial for clinical deployment, can inform the improvement of training data construction and boost DL models' outcomes. In this paper, we conducted a thorough study of different annotation-fusion strategies to preserve inter-rater variability in DL models for anatomical landmark detection, aiming to boost the performance and reliability of the resulting algorithms. Additionally, we explored the characteristics and reliability of four metrics, including a novel Weighted Coordinate Variance metric to quantify landmark detection uncertainty/inter-rater variability. Our research highlights the crucial connection between inter-rater variability, DL-models performances, and uncertainty, revealing how different approaches for multi-rater landmark annotation fusion can influence these factors.</description>

      <title>Breast Tumor Classification Using EfficientNet Deep Learning Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.17870</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.17870v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Precise breast cancer classification on histopathological images has the potential to greatly improve the diagnosis and patient outcome in oncology. The data imbalance problem largely stems from the inherent imbalance within medical image datasets, where certain tumor subtypes may appear much less frequently. This constitutes a considerable limitation in biased model predictions that can overlook critical but rare classes. In this work, we adopted EfficientNet, a state-of-the-art convolutional neural network (CNN) model that balances high accuracy with computational cost efficiency. To address data imbalance, we introduce an intensive data augmentation pipeline and cost-sensitive learning, improving representation and ensuring that the model does not overly favor majority classes. This approach provides the ability to learn effectively from rare tumor types, improving its robustness. Additionally, we fine-tuned the model using transfer learning, where weights in the beginning trained on a binary classification task were adopted to multi-class classification, improving the capability to detect complex patterns within the BreakHis dataset. Our results underscore significant improvements in the binary classification performance, achieving an exceptional recall increase for benign cases from 0.92 to 0.95, alongside an accuracy enhancement from 97.35 % to 98.23%. Our approach improved the performance of multi-class tasks from 91.27% with regular augmentation to 94.54% with intensive augmentation, reaching 95.04% with transfer learning. This framework demonstrated substantial gains in precision in the minority classes, such as Mucinous carcinoma and Papillary carcinoma, while maintaining high recall consistently across these critical subtypes, as further confirmed by confusion matrix analysis.</description>

      <title>Graph Neural Network for Cerebral Blood Flow Prediction With Clinical Datasets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.17971</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.17971v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Accurate prediction of cerebral blood flow is essential for the diagnosis and treatment of cerebrovascular diseases. Traditional computational methods, however, often incur significant computational costs, limiting their practicality in real-time clinical applications. This paper proposes a graph neural network (GNN) to predict blood flow and pressure in previously unseen cerebral vascular network structures that were not included in training data. The GNN was developed using clinical datasets from patients with stenosis, featuring complex and abnormal vascular geometries. Additionally, the GNN model was trained on data incorporating a wide range of inflow conditions, vessel topologies, and network connectivities to enhance its generalization capability. The approach achieved Pearson's correlation coefficients of 0.727 for pressure and 0.824 for flow rate, with sufficient training data. These findings demonstrate the potential of the GNN for real-time cerebrovascular diagnostics, particularly in handling intricate and pathological vascular networks.</description>

      <title>HAAT: Hybrid Attention Aggregation Transformer for Image Super-Resolution</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.18003</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.18003v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the research area of image super-resolution, Swin-transformer-based models are favored for their global spatial modeling and shifting window attention mechanism. However, existing methods often limit self-attention to non overlapping windows to cut costs and ignore the useful information that exists across channels. To address this issue, this paper introduces a novel model, the Hybrid Attention Aggregation Transformer (HAAT), designed to better leverage feature information. HAAT is constructed by integrating Swin-Dense-Residual-Connected Blocks (SDRCB) with Hybrid Grid Attention Blocks (HGAB). SDRCB expands the receptive field while maintaining a streamlined architecture, resulting in enhanced performance. HGAB incorporates channel attention, sparse attention, and window attention to improve nonlocal feature fusion and achieve more visually compelling results. Experimental evaluations demonstrate that HAAT surpasses state-of-the-art methods on benchmark datasets.

      <title>Neural Finite-State Machines for Surgical Phase Recognition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.18018</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.18018v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Surgical phase recognition is essential for analyzing procedure-specific surgical videos. While recent transformer-based architectures have advanced sequence processing capabilities, they struggle with maintaining consistency across lengthy surgical procedures. Drawing inspiration from classical hidden Markov models' finite-state interpretations, we introduce the neural finite-state machine (NFSM) module, which bridges procedural understanding with deep learning approaches. NFSM combines procedure-level understanding with neural networks through global state embeddings, attention-based dynamic transition tables, and transition-aware training and inference mechanisms for offline and online applications. When integrated into our future-aware architecture, NFSM improves video-level accuracy, phase-level precision, recall, and Jaccard indices on Cholec80 datasets by 2.3, 3.2, 3.0, and 4.8 percentage points respectively. As an add-on module to existing state-of-the-art models like Surgformer, NFSM further enhances performance, demonstrating its complementary value. Extended experiments on non-surgical datasets validate NFSM's generalizability beyond surgical domains. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate that incorporating NSFM into deep learning frameworks enables more robust and consistent phase recognition across long procedural videos.</description>

      <title>Mortality Prediction of Pulmonary Embolism Patients with Deep Learning and XGBoost</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.18063</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.18063v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Pulmonary Embolism (PE) is a serious cardiovascular condition that remains a leading cause of mortality and critical illness, underscoring the need for enhanced diagnostic strategies. Conventional clinical methods have limited success in predicting 30-day in-hospital mortality of PE patients. In this study, we present a new algorithm, called PEP-Net, for 30-day mortality prediction of PE patients based on the initial imaging data (CT) that opportunistically integrates a 3D Residual Network (3DResNet) with Extreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost) algorithm with patient level binary labels without annotations of the emboli and its extent. Our proposed system offers a comprehensive prediction strategy by handling class imbalance problems, reducing overfitting via regularization, and reducing the prediction variance for more stable predictions. PEP-Net was tested in a cohort of 193 volumetric CT scans diagnosed with Acute PE, and it demonstrated a superior performance by significantly outperforming baseline models (76-78\%) with an accuracy of 94.5\% (+/-0.3) and 94.0\% (+/-0.7) when the input image is either lung region (Lung-ROI) or heart region (Cardiac-ROI). Our results advance PE prognostics by using only initial imaging data, setting a new benchmark in the field. While purely deep learning models have become the go-to for many medical classification (diagnostic) tasks, combined ResNet and XGBoost models herein outperform sole deep learning models due to a potential reason for having lack of enough data.</description>

      <title>Towards Lensless Image Deblurring with Prior-Embedded Implicit Neural Representations in the Low-Data Regime</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.18189</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.18189v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The field of computational imaging has witnessed a promising paradigm shift with the emergence of untrained neural networks, offering novel solutions to inverse computational imaging problems. While existing techniques have demonstrated impressive results, they often operate either in the high-data regime, leveraging Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) as image priors, or through untrained iterative reconstruction in a data-agnostic manner. This paper delves into lensless image reconstruction, a subset of computational imaging that replaces traditional lenses with computation, enabling the development of ultra-thin and lightweight imaging systems. To the best of our knowledge, we are the first to leverage implicit neural representations for lensless image deblurring, achieving reconstructions without the requirement of prior training. We perform prior-embedded untrained iterative optimization to enhance reconstruction performance and speed up convergence, effectively bridging the gap between the no-data and high-data regimes. Through a thorough comparative analysis encompassing various untrained and low-shot methods, including under-parameterized non-convolutional methods and domain-restricted low-shot methods, we showcase the superior performance of our approach by a significant margin.</description>

      <title>Deep End-to-end Adaptive k-Space Sampling, Reconstruction, and Registration for Dynamic MRI</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.18249</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.18249v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Dynamic MRI enables a range of clinical applications, including cardiac function assessment, organ motion tracking, and radiotherapy guidance. However, fully sampling the dynamic k-space data is often infeasible due to time constraints and physiological motion such as respiratory and cardiac motion. This necessitates undersampling, which degrades the quality of reconstructed images. Poor image quality not only hinders visualization but also impairs the estimation of deformation fields, crucial for registering dynamic (moving) images to a static reference image. This registration enables tasks such as motion correction, treatment planning, and quantitative analysis in applications like cardiac imaging and MR-guided radiotherapy. To overcome the challenges posed by undersampling and motion, we introduce an end-to-end deep learning (DL) framework that integrates adaptive dynamic k-space sampling, reconstruction, and registration. Our approach begins with a DL-based adaptive sampling strategy, optimizing dynamic k-space acquisition to capture the most relevant data for each specific case. This is followed by a DL-based reconstruction module that produces images optimized for accurate deformation field estimation from the undersampled moving data. Finally, a registration module estimates the deformation fields aligning the reconstructed dynamic images with a static reference. The proposed framework is independent of specific reconstruction and registration modules allowing for plug-and-play integration of these components. The entire framework is jointly trained using a combination of supervised and unsupervised loss functions, enabling end-to-end optimization for improved performance across all components. Through controlled experiments and ablation studies, we validate each component, demonstrating that each choice contributes to robust motion estimation from undersampled dynamic data.</description>

      <title>Leveraging Semantic Asymmetry for Precise Gross Tumor Volume Segmentation of Nasopharyngeal Carcinoma in Planning CT</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.18290</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.18290v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the radiation therapy of nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC), clinicians typically delineate the gross tumor volume (GTV) using non-contrast planning computed tomography to ensure accurate radiation dose delivery. However, the low contrast between tumors and adjacent normal tissues necessitates that radiation oncologists manually delineate the tumors, often relying on diagnostic MRI for guidance. % In this study, we propose a novel approach to directly segment NPC gross tumors on non-contrast planning CT images, circumventing potential registration errors when aligning MRI or MRI-derived tumor masks to planning CT. To address the low contrast issues between tumors and adjacent normal structures in planning CT, we introduce a 3D Semantic Asymmetry Tumor segmentation (SATs) method. Specifically, we posit that a healthy nasopharyngeal region is characteristically bilaterally symmetric, whereas the emergence of nasopharyngeal carcinoma disrupts this symmetry. Then, we propose a Siamese contrastive learning segmentation framework that minimizes the voxel-wise distance between original and flipped areas without tumor and encourages a larger distance between original and flipped areas with tumor. Thus, our approach enhances the sensitivity of features to semantic asymmetries. % Extensive experiments demonstrate that the proposed SATs achieves the leading NPC GTV segmentation performance in both internal and external testing, \emph{e.g.}, with at least 2\% absolute Dice score improvement and 12\% average distance error reduction when compared to other state-of-the-art methods in the external testing.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.18441</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.18441v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Full-field ultra-high-speed (UHS) x-ray imaging experiments have been well established to characterize various processes and phenomena. However, the potential of UHS experiments through the joint acquisition of x-ray videos with distinct configurations has not been fully exploited. In this paper, we investigate the use of a deep learning-based spatio-temporal fusion (STF) framework to fuse two complementary sequences of x-ray images and reconstruct the target image sequence with high spatial resolution, high frame rate, and high fidelity. We applied a transfer learning strategy to train the model and compared the peak signal-to-noise ratio (PSNR), average absolute difference (AAD), and structural similarity (SSIM) of the proposed framework on two independent x-ray datasets with those obtained from a baseline deep learning model, a Bayesian fusion framework, and the bicubic interpolation method. The proposed framework outperformed the other methods with various configurations of the input frame separations and image noise levels. With 3 subsequent images from the low resolution (LR) sequence of a 4-time lower spatial resolution and another 2 images from the high resolution (HR) sequence of a 20-time lower frame rate, the proposed approach achieved an average PSNR of 37.57 dB and 35.15 dB, respectively. When coupled with the appropriate combination of high-speed cameras, the proposed approach will enhance the performance and therefore scientific value of the UHS x-ray imaging experiments.</description>

      <title>Learning Optimal Linear Block Transform by Rate Distortion Minimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.18494</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.18494v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Linear block transform coding remains a fundamental component of image and video compression. Although the Discrete Cosine Transform (DCT) is widely employed in all current compression standards, its sub-optimality has sparked ongoing research into discovering more efficient alternative transforms even for fields where it represents a consolidated tool. In this paper, we introduce a novel linear block transform called the Rate Distortion Learned Transform (RDLT), a data-driven transform specifically designed to minimize the rate-distortion (RD) cost when approximating residual blocks. Our approach builds on the latest end-to-end learned compression frameworks, adopting back-propagation and stochastic gradient descent for optimization. However, unlike the nonlinear transforms used in variational autoencoder (VAE)-based methods, the goal is to create a simpler yet optimal linear block transform, ensuring practical integration into existing image and video compression standards. Differently from existing data-driven methods that design transforms based on sample covariance matrices, such as the Karhunen-Lo\`eve Transform (KLT), the proposed RDLT is directly optimized from an RD perspective. Experimental results show that this transform significantly outperforms the DCT or other existing data-driven transforms. Additionally, it is shown that when simulating the integration of our RDLT into a VVC-like image compression framework, the proposed transform brings substantial improvements. All the code used in our experiments has been made publicly available at [1].</description>

      <title>Evaluating and Improving the Effectiveness of Synthetic Chest X-Rays for Medical Image Analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.18602</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.18602v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Purpose: To explore best-practice approaches for generating synthetic chest X-ray images and augmenting medical imaging datasets to optimize the performance of deep learning models in downstream tasks like classification and segmentation. Materials and Methods: We utilized a latent diffusion model to condition the generation of synthetic chest X-rays on text prompts and/or segmentation masks. We explored methods like using a proxy model and using radiologist feedback to improve the quality of synthetic data. These synthetic images were then generated from relevant disease information or geometrically transformed segmentation masks and added to ground truth training set images from the CheXpert, CANDID-PTX, SIIM, and RSNA Pneumonia datasets to measure improvements in classification and segmentation model performance on the test sets. F1 and Dice scores were used to evaluate classification and segmentation respectively. One-tailed t-tests with Bonferroni correction assessed the statistical significance of performance improvements with synthetic data. Results: Across all experiments, the synthetic data we generated resulted in a maximum mean classification F1 score improvement of 0.150453 (CI: 0.099108-0.201798; P=0.0031) compared to using only real data. For segmentation, the maximum Dice score improvement was 0.14575 (CI: 0.108267-0.183233; P=0.0064). Conclusion: Best practices for generating synthetic chest X-ray images for downstream tasks include conditioning on single-disease labels or geometrically transformed segmentation masks, as well as potentially using proxy modeling for fine-tuning such generations.</description>

      <title>Generating CKM Using Others' Data: Cross-AP CKM Inference with Deep Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.17716</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.17716v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Channel knowledge map (CKM) is a promising paradigm shift towards environment-aware communication and sensing by providing location-specific prior channel knowledge before real-time communication. Although CKM is particularly appealing for dense networks such as cell-free networks, it remains a challenge to efficiently generate CKMs in dense networks. For a dense network with CKMs of existing access points (APs), it will be useful to efficiently generate CKMs of potentially new APs with only AP location information. The generation of inferred CKMs across APs can help dense networks achieve convenient initial CKM generation, environment-aware AP deployment, and cost-effective CKM updates. Considering that different APs in the same region share the same physical environment, there exists a natural correlation between the channel knowledge of different APs. Therefore, by mining the implicit correlation between location-specific channel knowledge, cross-AP CKM inference can be realized using data from other APs. This paper proposes a cross-AP inference method to generate CKMs of potentially new APs with deep learning. The location of the target AP is fed into the UNet model in combination with the channel knowledge of other existing APs, and supervised learning is performed based on the channel knowledge of the target AP. Based on the trained UNet and the channel knowledge of the existing APs, the CKM inference of the potentially new AP can be generated across APs. The generation results of the inferred CKM validate the feasibility and effectiveness of cross-AP CKM inference with other APs' channel knowledge.</description>

      <title>Individual Content and Motion Dynamics Preserved Pruning for Video Diffusion Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.18375</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.18375v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The high computational cost and slow inference time are major obstacles to deploying the video diffusion model (VDM) in practical applications. To overcome this, we introduce a new Video Diffusion Model Compression approach using individual content and motion dynamics preserved pruning and consistency loss. First, we empirically observe that deeper VDM layers are crucial for maintaining the quality of \textbf{motion dynamics} e.g., coherence of the entire video, while shallower layers are more focused on \textbf{individual content} e.g., individual frames. Therefore, we prune redundant blocks from the shallower layers while preserving more of the deeper layers, resulting in a lightweight VDM variant called VDMini. Additionally, we propose an \textbf{Individual Content and Motion Dynamics (ICMD)} Consistency Loss to gain comparable generation performance as larger VDM, i.e., the teacher to VDMini i.e., the student. Particularly, we first use the Individual Content Distillation (ICD) Loss to ensure consistency in the features of each generated frame between the teacher and student models. Next, we introduce a Multi-frame Content Adversarial (MCA) Loss to enhance the motion dynamics across the generated video as a whole. This method significantly accelerates inference time while maintaining high-quality video generation. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of our VDMini on two important video generation tasks, Text-to-Video (T2V) and Image-to-Video (I2V), where we respectively achieve an average 2.5 $\times$ and 1.4 $\times$ speed up for the I2V method SF-V and the T2V method T2V-Turbo-v2, while maintaining the quality of the generated videos on two benchmarks, i.e., UCF101 and VBench.</description>

      <title>Atlas-Based Interpretable Age Prediction In Whole-Body MR Images</title>

Abstract: Age prediction is an important part of medical assessments and research. It can aid in detecting diseases as well as abnormal ageing by highlighting potential discrepancies between chronological and biological age. To improve understanding of age-related changes in various body parts, we investigate the ageing of the human body on a large scale by using whole-body 3D images. We utilise the Grad-CAM method to determine the body areas most predictive of a person's age. In order to expand our analysis beyond individual subjects, we employ registration techniques to generate population-wide importance maps that show the most predictive areas in the body for a whole cohort of subjects. We show that the investigation of the full 3D volume of the whole body and the population-wide analysis can give important insights into which body parts play the most important roles in predicting a person's age. Our findings reveal three primary areas of interest: the spine, the autochthonous back muscles, and the cardiac region, which exhibits the highest importance. Finally, we investigate differences between subjects that show accelerated and decelerated ageing.</description>

      <title>A 3D deep learning classifier and its explainability when assessing coronary artery disease</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.00009</link>
      <description>arXiv:2308.00009v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Early detection and diagnosis of coronary artery disease (CAD) could save lives and reduce healthcare costs. The current clinical practice is to perform CAD diagnosis through analysing medical images from computed tomography coronary angiography (CTCA). Most current approaches utilise deep learning methods but require centerline extraction and multi-planar reconstruction. These indirect methods are not designed in a clinician-friendly manner, and they complicate the interventional procedure. Furthermore, the current deep learning methods do not provide exact explainability and limit the usefulness of these methods to be deployed in clinical settings. In this study, we first propose a 3D Resnet-50 deep learning model to directly classify normal subjects and CAD patients on CTCA images, then we demonstrate a 2D modified U-Net model can be subsequently employed to segment the coronary arteries. Our proposed approach outperforms the state-of-the-art models by 21.43% in terms of classification accuracy. The classification model with focal loss provides a better and more focused heat map, and the segmentation model provides better explainability than the classification-only model. The proposed holistic approach not only provides a simpler and clinician-friendly solution but also good classification accuracy and exact explainability for CAD diagnosis.</description>

      <title>Tree species classification at the pixel-level using deep learning and multispectral time series in an imbalanced context</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.08887</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.08887v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper investigates tree species classification using Sentinel-2 multispectral satellite image time-series. Despite their critical importance for many applications, such maps are often unavailable, outdated, or inaccurate for large areas. The interest of using remote sensing time series to produce these maps has been highlighted in many studies. However, many methods proposed in the literature still rely on a standard classification algorithm, usually the Random Forest (RF) algorithm with vegetation indices. This study shows that the use of deep learning models can lead to a significant improvement in classification results, especially in an imbalanced context where the RF algorithm tends to predict towards the majority class. In our use case in the center of France with 10 tree species, we obtain an overall accuracy (OA) around 95% and a F1-macro score around 80% using three different benchmark deep learning architectures. In contrast, using the RF algorithm yields an OA of 93% and an F1 of 60%, indicating that the minority classes are not classified with sufficient accuracy. Therefore, the proposed framework is a strong baseline that can be easily implemented in most scenarios, even with a limited amount of reference data. Our results highlight that standard multilayer perceptron can be competitive with batch normalization and a sufficient amount of parameters. Other architectures (convolutional or attention-based) can also achieve strong results when tuned properly. Furthermore, our results show that DL models are naturally robust to imbalanced data, although similar results can be obtained using dedicated techniques.</description>

      <title>EndoPerfect: A Hybrid NeRF-Stereo Vision Approach Pioneering Monocular Depth Estimation and 3D Reconstruction in Endoscopy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.04041</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.04041v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: 3D reconstruction in endoscopic sinus surgery (ESS) demands exceptional accuracy, with the mean error and standard deviation necessitating within the range of a single CT slice (0.625 mm), as the critical structures in the nasal cavity are situated within submillimeter distances from surgical instruments. This poses a formidable challenge when using conventional monocular endoscopes. Depth estimation is crucial for 3D reconstruction, yet existing depth estimation methodologies either suffer from inherent accuracy limitations or, in the case of learning-based approaches, perform poorly when applied to ESS despite succeeding on their original datasets. In this study, we present a novel, highly generalizable method that combines Neural Radiance Fields (NeRF) and stereo depth estimation for 3D reconstruction that can derive metric monocular depth. Our approach begins with an initial NeRF reconstruction yielding a coarse 3D scene, the subsequent creation of binocular pairs within coarse 3D scene, and generation of depth maps through stereo vision, These depth maps are used to supervise subsequent NeRF iteration, progressively refining NeRF and binocular depth, the refinement process continues until the depth maps converged. This recursive process generates high-accuracy depth maps from monocular endoscopic video. Evaluation in synthetic endoscopy shows a depth accuracy of 0.125 $\pm$ 0.443 mm, well within the 0.625 mm threshold. Further clinical experiments with real endoscopic data demonstrate a mean distance to CT mesh of 0.269 mm, representing the highest accuracy among monocular 3D reconstruction methods in ESS.</description>

Abstract: This manuscript summarizes work on the Capsule Vision Challenge 2024 by MISAHUB. To address the multi-class disease classification task, which is challenging due to the complexity and imbalance in the Capsule Vision challenge dataset, this paper proposes CASCRNet (Capsule endoscopy-Aspp-SCR-Network), a parameter-efficient and novel model that uses Shared Channel Residual (SCR) blocks and Atrous Spatial Pyramid Pooling (ASPP) blocks. Further, the performance of the proposed model is compared with other well-known approaches. The experimental results yield that proposed model provides better disease classification results. The proposed model was successful in classifying diseases with an F1 Score of 78.5% and a Mean AUC of 98.3%, which is promising given its compact architecture.</description>

      <title>DINO-LG: A Task-Specific DINO Model for Coronary Calcium Scoring</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.07976v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Coronary artery disease (CAD), one of the leading causes of mortality worldwide, necessitates effective risk assessment strategies, with coronary artery calcium (CAC) scoring via computed tomography (CT) being a key method for prevention. Traditional methods, primarily based on UNET architectures implemented on pre-built models, face challenges like the scarcity of annotated CT scans containing CAC and imbalanced datasets, leading to reduced performance in segmentation and scoring tasks. In this study, we address these limitations by incorporating the self-supervised learning (SSL) technique of DINO (self-distillation with no labels), which trains without requiring CAC-specific annotations, enhancing its robustness in generating distinct features. The DINO-LG model, which leverages label guidance to focus on calcified areas, achieves significant improvements, with a sensitivity of 89% and specificity of 90% for detecting CAC-containing CT slices, compared to the standard DINO model's sensitivity of 79% and specificity of 77%. Additionally, false-negative and false-positive rates are reduced by 49% and 59%, respectively, instilling greater confidence in clinicians when ruling out calcification in low-risk patients and minimizing unnecessary imaging reviews by radiologists. Further, CAC scoring and segmentation tasks are conducted using a basic UNET architecture, applied specifically to CT slices identified by the DINO-LG model as containing calcified areas. This targeted approach enhances CAC scoring accuracy by feeding the UNET model with relevant slices, significantly improving diagnostic precision, reducing both false positives and false negatives, and ultimately lowering overall healthcare costs by minimizing unnecessary tests and treatments, presenting a valuable advancement in CAD risk assessment.</description>

Abstract: Real-time visual feedback is essential for tetherless control of remotely operated vehicles, particularly during inspection and manipulation tasks. Though acoustic communication is the preferred choice for medium-range communication underwater, its limited bandwidth renders it impractical to transmit images or videos in real-time. To address this, we propose a model-based image compression technique that leverages prior mission information. Our approach employs trained machine-learning based novel view synthesis models, and uses gradient descent optimization to refine latent representations to help generate compressible differences between camera images and rendered images. We evaluate the proposed compression technique using a dataset from an artificial ocean basin, demonstrating superior compression ratios and image quality over existing techniques. Moreover, our method exhibits robustness to introduction of new objects within the scene, highlighting its potential for advancing tetherless remotely operated vehicle operations.</description>

      <title>Intelligent Anomaly Detection for Lane Rendering Using Transformer with Self-Supervised Pre-Training and Customized Fine-Tuning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.04398</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.04398v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The burgeoning navigation services using digital maps provide great convenience to drivers. Nevertheless, the presence of anomalies in lane rendering map images occasionally introduces potential hazards, as such anomalies can be misleading to human drivers and consequently contribute to unsafe driving conditions. In response to this concern and to accurately and effectively detect the anomalies, this paper transforms lane rendering image anomaly detection into a classification problem and proposes a four-phase pipeline consisting of data pre-processing, self-supervised pre-training with the masked image modeling (MiM) method, customized fine-tuning using cross-entropy based loss with label smoothing, and post-processing to tackle it leveraging state-of-the-art deep learning techniques, especially those involving Transformer models. Various experiments verify the effectiveness of the proposed pipeline. Results indicate that the proposed pipeline exhibits superior performance in lane rendering image anomaly detection, and notably, the self-supervised pre-training with MiM can greatly enhance the detection accuracy while significantly reducing the total training time. For instance, employing the Swin Transformer with Uniform Masking as self-supervised pretraining (Swin-Trans-UM) yielded a heightened accuracy at 94.77% and an improved Area Under The Curve (AUC) score of 0.9743 compared with the pure Swin Transformer without pre-training (Swin-Trans) with an accuracy of 94.01% and an AUC of 0.9498. The fine-tuning epochs were dramatically reduced to 41 from the original 280. In conclusion, the proposed pipeline, with its incorporation of self-supervised pre-training using MiM and other advanced deep learning techniques, emerges as a robust solution for enhancing the accuracy and efficiency of lane rendering image anomaly detection in digital navigation systems.</description>

      <title>Biometric Authentication Based on Enhanced Remote Photoplethysmography Signal Morphology</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.04127v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Remote photoplethysmography (rPPG) is a non-contact method for measuring cardiac signals from facial videos, offering a convenient alternative to contact photoplethysmography (cPPG) obtained from contact sensors. Recent studies have shown that each individual possesses a unique cPPG signal morphology that can be utilized as a biometric identifier, which has inspired us to utilize the morphology of rPPG signals extracted from facial videos for person authentication. Since the facial appearance and rPPG are mixed in the facial videos, we first de-identify facial videos to remove facial appearance while preserving the rPPG information, which protects facial privacy and guarantees that only rPPG is used for authentication. The de-identified videos are fed into an rPPG model to get the rPPG signal morphology for authentication. In the first training stage, unsupervised rPPG training is performed to get coarse rPPG signals. In the second training stage, an rPPG-cPPG hybrid training is performed by incorporating external cPPG datasets to achieve rPPG biometric authentication and enhance rPPG signal morphology. Our approach needs only de-identified facial videos with subject IDs to train rPPG authentication models. The experimental results demonstrate that rPPG signal morphology hidden in facial videos can be used for biometric authentication.

      <title>Goal-Oriented Semantic Communication for Wireless Visual Question Answering</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.02452</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.02452v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The rapid progress of artificial intelligence (AI) and computer vision (CV) has facilitated the development of computation-intensive applications like Visual Question Answering (VQA), which integrates visual perception and natural language processing to generate answers. To overcome the limitations of traditional VQA constrained by local computation resources, edge computing has been incorporated to provide extra computation capability at the edge side. Meanwhile, this brings new communication challenges between the local and edge, including limited bandwidth, channel noise, and multipath effects, which degrade VQA performance and user quality of experience (QoE), particularly during the transmission of large high-resolution images. To overcome these bottlenecks, we propose a goal-oriented semantic communication (GSC) framework that focuses on effectively extracting and transmitting semantic information most relevant to the VQA goals, improving the answering accuracy and enhancing the effectiveness and efficiency. The objective is to maximize the answering accuracy, and we propose a bounding box (BBox)-based image semantic extraction and ranking approach to prioritize the semantic information based on the goal of questions. We then extend it by incorporating a scene graphs (SG)-based approach to handle questions with complex relationships. Experimental results demonstrate that our GSC framework improves answering accuracy by up to 49% under AWGN channels and 59% under Rayleigh channels while reducing total latency by up to 65% compared to traditional bit-oriented transmission.</description>
