      <title>The joint probability distribution function of global interaction complex systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.19552</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.19552v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Based on the relationship that the interaction energy between any two subsystems is equal to their internal energy multiplied by the interaction coefficient, we have derived a series correlated expressions of statistical physical quantities, such as the interactional average energy, the probability distribution function of internal energy, and so on. It should be noted that the probability distribution function we obtained is existing in many complex systems involving long-range interactions. Further, based on the zeroth law of thermodynamics, we have also obtained the joint probability distribution function of two coupled complex systems. It must be note that the joint probability distribution function we obtained no longer satisfies the common independent multiplication relationship in the previous researches. Finally, we selected several representative foreign exchange high-frequency trading data for verification and found that the theory is consistent with the reality.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2507.19648v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Urban morphology has long been recognized as a factor shaping human mobility, yet comparative and formal classifications of urban form across metropolitan areas remain limited. Building on theoretical principles of urban structure and advances in unsupervised learning, we systematically classified the built environment of nine U.S. metropolitan areas using structural indicators such as density, connectivity, and spatial configuration. The resulting morphological types were linked to mobility patterns through descriptive statistics, marginal effects estimation, and post hoc statistical testing. Here we show that distinct urban forms are systematically associated with different mobility behaviors, such as reticular morphologies being linked to significantly higher public transport use (marginal effect = 0.49) and reduced car dependence (-0.41), while organic forms are associated with increased car usage (0.44), and substantial declines in public transport (-0.47) and active mobility (-0.30). These effects are statistically robust (p &lt; 1e-19), highlighting that the spatial configuration of urban areas plays a fundamental role in shaping transportation choices. Our findings extend previous work by offering a reproducible framework for classifying urban form and demonstrate the added value of morphological analysis in comparative urban research. These results suggest that urban form should be treated as a key variable in mobility planning and provide empirical support for incorporating spatial typologies into sustainable urban policy design.</description>

      <title>Diversity in Axelrod's social adaptation model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.19757</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.19757v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we study Axelrod's model of social dynamics, introducing the concept of Cultural Diversity ($D$), defined as the variety of sizes of clusters or cultural domains formed, which measures the complexity of the system. We find that the maximum of $D$ agrees with the critical point where the monocultural/multicultural phase transition occurs, tending to a minimum value when the system's degrees of freedom, cultural traits $q$, are far from the critical point $q_c$. We show that at $q_c$ the entropy also reaches its maximum value, that is, the phase transition for this model is of the order-order type. Thus, multiculturalism is not synonymous with cultural diversity, as is commonly assumed in the literature.</description>

      <title>DynamiX: Large-Scale Dynamic Social Network Simulator</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.19929</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.19929v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Understanding the intrinsic mechanisms of social platforms is an urgent demand to maintain social stability. The rise of large language models provides significant potential for social network simulations to capture attitude dynamics and reproduce collective behaviors. However, existing studies mainly focus on scaling up agent populations, neglecting the dynamic evolution of social relationships. To address this gap, we introduce DynamiX, a novel large-scale social network simulator dedicated to dynamic social network modeling. DynamiX uses a dynamic hierarchy module for selecting core agents with key characteristics at each timestep, enabling accurate alignment of real-world adaptive switching of user roles. Furthermore, we design distinct dynamic social relationship modeling strategies for different user types. For opinion leaders, we propose an information-stream-based link prediction method recommending potential users with similar stances, simulating homogeneous connections, and autonomous behavior decisions. For ordinary users, we construct an inequality-oriented behavior decision-making module, effectively addressing unequal social interactions and capturing the patterns of relationship adjustments driven by multi-dimensional factors. Experimental results demonstrate that DynamiX exhibits marked improvements in attitude evolution simulation and collective behavior analysis compared to static networks. Besides, DynamiX opens a new theoretical perspective on follower growth prediction, providing empirical evidence for opinion leaders cultivation.</description>

      <title>Greening Schoolyards and Urban Property Values: A Systematic Review of Geospatial and Statistical Evidence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.19934</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.19934v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: 1.1 Background Parks and the greening of schoolyards are examples of urban green spaces that have been praised for their environmental, social, and economic benefits in cities all over the world. More studies show that living near green spaces is good for property values. However, there is still disagreement about how strong and consistent these effects are in different cities (Browning et al., 2023; Grunewald et al., 2024; Teo et al., 2023). 1.2 Purpose This systematic review is the first to bring together a lot of geographical and statistical information that links greening schoolyards to higher property prices, as opposed to just green space in general. By focusing on schoolyard-specific interventions, we find complex spatial, economic, and social effects that are often missed in larger studies of green space. 1.3 Methods This review followed the PRISMA guidelines and did a systematic search and review of papers that were published in well-known journals for urban studies, the environment, and real estate. The criteria for inclusion stressed the use of hedonic pricing or spatial econometric models to look at the relationship between urban green space and home values in a quantitative way. Fifteen studies from North America, Europe, and Asia met the requirements for inclusion (Anthamatten et al., 2022; Wen et al., 2019; Li et al., 2019; Mansur &amp; Yusuf, 2022).</description>

      <title>Hypo-paradoxical Linkages: Linkages That Should Move-But Don't</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.20371</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.20371v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: While paradoxical linkages famously violate the Chebyshev-Grubler-Kutzbach criterion by exhibiting unexpected mobility, we identify an opposing phenomenon: a class of linkages that appear mobile according to the same criterion, yet are in fact rigid. We refer to these as hypo-paradoxical linkages, and proceed to analyze and illustrate their behavior. We use the same tools to further explain the unexpected positive mobility of Bennet mechanism.</description>

      <title>Improvised Nuclear Weapons with 60%-Enriched Uranium</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.20390</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.20390v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work we show that as little as 40 kg of 60%-enriched uranium can be used to build a crude nuclear weapon with a kiloton yield. While too large to fit on a missile, such a weapon could be delivered by shipping container. This analysis is motivated by the June 2025 Israeli and US attacks on Iran, especially the bombings of the nuclear facilities at Natanz, Fordow, and Isfahan. The Iranian stockpile of approximately 408 kg of 60%-enriched uranium is, at the time of writing, inaccessible to IAEA inspectors and stored in secret. The rapid clandestine relocation of this material in June 2025 creates an opportunity for aspiring nuclear terrorists to divert an amount that could be used in the construction of an improvised gun-type nuclear weapon in the style of Little Boy.</description>

      <title>Scaling Pedestrian Crossing Analysis to 100 U.S. Cities via AI-based Segmentation of Satellite Imagery</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.20497</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.20497v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Accurately measuring street dimensions is essential to evaluating how their design influences both travel behavior and safety. However, gathering street-level information at city scale with precision is difficult given the quantity and complexity of urban intersections. To address this challenge in the context of pedestrian crossings - a crucial component of walkability - we introduce a scalable and accurate method for automatically measuring crossing distance at both marked and unmarked crosswalks, applied to America's 100 largest cities. First, OpenStreetMap coordinates were used to retrieve satellite imagery of intersections throughout each city, totaling roughly three million images. Next, Meta's Segment Anything Model was trained on a manually-labelled subset of these images to differentiate drivable from non-drivable surfaces (i.e., roads vs. sidewalks). Third, all available crossing edges from OpenStreetMap were extracted. Finally, crossing edges were overlaid on the segmented intersection images, and a grow-cut algorithm was applied to connect each edge to its adjacent non-drivable surface (e.g., sidewalk, private property, etc.), thus enabling the calculation of crossing distance. This achieved 93 percent accuracy in measuring crossing distance, with a median absolute error of 2 feet 3 inches (0.69 meters), when compared to manually-verified data for an entire city. Across the 100 largest US cities, median crossing distance ranges from 32 feet to 78 feet (9.8 to 23.8m), with detectable regional patterns. Median crossing distance also displays a positive relationship with cities' year of incorporation, illustrating in a novel way how American cities increasingly emphasize wider (and more car-centric) streets.</description>

      <title>Herd Immunity with Spatial Adaptation Based on Global Prevalence Information</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.20747</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.20747v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: During an epidemic outbreak, individuals often modify their behavior in response to global prevalence cues, using spatially mediated adaptations such as reduced mobility or transmission range. In this work, we investigate the impact of distance-based adaptive behaviors on epidemic dynamics, where a fraction of the population adjusts its transmission range and susceptibility to infection based on global prevalence. We consider three adaptation scenarios: a constant adaptive fraction, a power-law dependence and a sigmoidal dependence of adaptive fraction on global prevalence. In the spatially well-mixed regime, we analytically obtain critical adaptation thresholds necessary for epidemic mitigation and in the spatially static regime, we establish bounds for the thresholds using continuum percolation results. Our results indicate that a linear adaptive response to prevalence provides no additional advantage over a constant adaptive fraction in controlling outbreaks, and a highly super-linear response is required to suppress epidemic spread. For a sigmoidal adaptation, we identify conditions under which oscillations in prevalence can emerge, with peak prevalence exhibiting a non-monotonic dependence on the width of the sigmoidal function, suggesting an optimal parameter range that minimizes epidemic severity. We obtain prevalence, final epidemic size, and peak prevalence as functions of adaptation parameters in all adaptation scenarios considered, providing a comprehensive characterization of the effects of spatial adaptation based on global prevalence information in shaping adaptive epidemic dynamics.</description>

      <title>Beyond Classical Models: Statistical Physics Tools for the Analysis of Time Series in Modern Air Transport</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.20927</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.20927v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Within the continuous endeavour of improving the efficiency and resilience of air transport, the trend of using concepts and metrics from statistical physics has recently gained momentum. This scientific discipline, which integrates elements from physics and statistics, aims at extracting knowledge about the microscale rules governing a (potentially complex) system when only its macroscale is observable. Translated to air transport, this entails extracting information about how individual operations are managed, by only studying coarse-grained information, e.g. average delays. We here review some fundamental concepts of statistical physics, and explore how these have been applied to the analysis of time series representing different aspects of the air transport system. In order to overcome the abstractness and complexity of some of these concepts, intuitive definitions and explanations are provided whenever possible. We further conclude by discussing the main obstacles towards a more widespread adoption of statistical physics in air transport, and sketch topics that we believe may be relevant in the future.</description>

      <title>Projecting Multimorbidity and Mortality under Demographic Change and Preventive Interventions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.14296</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.14296v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: As populations age, the rise of multimorbidity poses a significant healthcare challenge. However, our ability to quantitatively forecast the progression of multimorbidity remains limited. Leveraging a nationwide dataset comprising approximately 45 million hospital stays spanning 17 years in Austria, we develop a new compartmental model for chronic disease trajectories across 132 distinct multimorbidity patterns (compartments). Each compartment represents a distinct constellation of co-occurring chronic conditions, with transitions modeled as age- and sex-dependent probabilities. We use the compartmental disease trajectory model (CDTM) to simulate disease trajectories to 2030, estimating the frequency of all empirically observed co-occurrence patterns among more than 100 diagnosis groups. We demonstrate the model's utility in identifying high-impact prevention targets. A 5% reduction in new cases of hypertensive disease (I10--I15) leads to a 0.57 (SD 0.06)% reduction in all-cause mortality over a 15-year period, and a 0.57 (SD 0.07)% reduction in mortality for malignant neoplasms (C00--C97). We also evaluate long-term impacts of SARS-CoV-2 sequelae, projecting earlier and more frequent hospitalizations across a range of diagnoses. Our fully data-driven modelling approach identifies leverage points for proactive preparation by physicians and policymakers to reduce the overall disease burden in the population, emphasizing patient-centered healthcare planning in aging societies.</description>
