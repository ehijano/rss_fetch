      <title>Economic Policy Challenges for the Age of AI</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.13168</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.13168v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper examines the profound challenges that transformative advances in AI towards Artificial General Intelligence (AGI) will pose for economists and economic policymakers. I examine how the Age of AI will revolutionize the basic structure of our economies by diminishing the role of labor, leading to unprecedented productivity gains but raising concerns about job disruption, income distribution, and the value of education and human capital. I explore what roles may remain for labor post-AGI, and which production factors will grow in importance. The paper then identifies eight key challenges for economic policy in the Age of AI: (1) inequality and income distribution, (2) education and skill development, (3) social and political stability, (4) macroeconomic policy, (5) antitrust and market regulation, (6) intellectual property, (7) environmental implications, and (8) global AI governance. It concludes by emphasizing how economists can contribute to a better understanding of these challenges.</description>

      <title>Why do we need to complement the European Union Regional Innovation Scoreboard with a cluster-neural network tool for what-if policy analysis?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.13316</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.13316v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The European Union Regional Innovation Scoreboard (EURIS) is currently and broadly used for the definition of regional innovation policies by European policymakers; it is a regional innovation measuring tool for the analysis of each specific innovation indicator, from which it is possible to analyze the overtime evolution of each regional innovation indicator; according to the importance of the European Union Regional Innovation Scoreboard for innovation policy purposes, we state that European regional policymakers need integrative and synergistic methodological tools, with respect to the EURIS one, for innovation policy purposes. Thus, we highlight the need to integrate the current methodology of the European Regional Innovation Scoreboard with a Factorial K-means (FKM) tool for clustering purposes, and with a neural network (NN) tool for performing what-if policy analyses. We claim that our proposed FKM-NN tool could be used, by regional innovation policymakers, as a very effective synergistic instrument of the European Union Regional Innovation Scoreboard.</description>

      <title>Pressure, Reference Points, and Risk-Taking Behavior: Evidence from Bench Press Competitions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.13333</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.13333v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study explores the impact of pressure and reference points on risk-taking behavior and success outcomes in competitive settings. Using a unique panel dataset from official bench press competitions, we decompose the effects of pressure from rivals on lifters' risk-taking decisions and realized outcomes. Our findings reveal that pressure from lower- and higher-ranked rivals drives more aggressive weight attempts, particularly in earlier stages, with the likelihood of success increasing as pressure intensifies. In third and final attempts, pressure from higher-ranked competitors leads to more conservative choices. Counterfactual analysis shows that in the absence of pressure, lifters adopt more conservative strategies in second attempts and take greater risks in third attempts, though with reduced success probabilities. These results underscore the importance of strategic focus on personal goals and the potential benefits of disregarding external pressures in the later stages of competition.</description>

      <title>Topological Components in a Community Currency Network</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.13674</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.13674v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Transaction data from digital payment systems can be used to study economic processes at such a detail that was not possible previously. Here, we analyse the data from Sarafu token network, a community inclusion currency in Kenya. During the COVID-19 emergency, the Sarafu was disbursed as part of a humanitarian aid project. In this work, the transactions are analysed using network science. A topological categorisation is defined to identify cyclic and acyclic components. Furthermore, temporal aspects of circulation taking place within these components are considered. The significant presence of different types of strongly connected components as compared to randomized null models shows the importance of cycles in this economic network. Especially, indicating their key role in currency recirculation. In some acyclic components, the most significant triad suggests the presence of a group of users collecting currency from accounts active only once, hinting at a misuse of the system. In some other acyclic components, small isolated groups of users were active only once, suggesting the presence of users only interested in trying out the system. The methods used in this paper can answer specific questions related to user activities, currency design, and assessment of monetary interventions. Our methodology provides a general quantitative tool for analysing the behaviour of users in a currency network.</description>
