      <title>Fair game: Urban free-ranging dogs balance resource use and risk aversion at seasonal fairs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.17004</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.17004v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Seasonal fairs, bustling with human activity, provide a unique environment for exploring the intricate interplay between humans and free-ranging dogs. This study investigated these interactions during seasonal fairs in Nadia and Bardhaman districts, West Bengal, India. Across 13 fairground sites, we explore how human footfall and resource availability impact dog behavior, with a particular emphasis on cognitive mechanisms. Data collection occurred from December to March, comprising three sessions - initial, middle, and end, each on three randomly selected days. Employing spot census and scan sampling methods, observers documented GPS locations, sex, and behaviors of free-ranging dogs. Videos captured interactions within the fair environment, revealing cognitive processes. Our analysis revealed a notable increase in human activity during the middle phase, coinciding with a rise in dog abundance. Dogs predominantly foraged, exhibited gait, and remained vigilant, their numbers positively associated with resource availability. Proximity to the fairground significantly shaped dog behavior, indicating cognitive processes in decision-making. Dogs closer to the fair demonstrated consistent behavior, likely due to immediate resource access, implying sophisticated cognitive mapping and resource utilization. Conversely, dogs from farther distances exhibited lower consistency and heightened aggression, intensifying foraging, gait, and vigilance activities, suggesting cognitive adaptations to resource scarcity and competition. These findings underscore the intricate relationship between human activity, resource availability, and the behavior and cognition of free-ranging dogs during seasonal fairs. They offer insights into the ecological dynamics of free-ranging dogs in human-influenced landscapes, emphasizing the necessity for comprehensive management strategies in urban and peri-urban environments.</description>

      <title>A Diffusion-Based Approach for Simulating Forward-in-Time State-Dependent Speciation and Extinction Dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.00246</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.00246v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We establish a general framework using a diffusion approximation to simulate forward-in-time state counts or frequencies for cladogenetic state-dependent speciation-extinction (ClaSSE) models. We apply the framework to various two- and three-region geographic-state speciation-extinction (GeoSSE) models. We show that the species range state dynamics simulated under tree-based and diffusion-based processes are comparable. We derive a method to infer rate parameters that are compatible with given observed stationary state frequencies and obtain an analytical result to compute stationary state frequencies for a given set of rate parameters. We also describe a procedure to find the time to reach the stationary frequencies of a ClaSSE model using our diffusion-based approach, which we demonstrate using a worked example for a two-region GeoSSE model. Finally, we discuss how the diffusion framework can be applied to formalize relationships between evolutionary patterns and processes under state-dependent diversification scenarios.</description>

      <title>Emergent predictability in microbial ecosystems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.19372</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.19372v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Microbial ecosystems carry out essential functions for global climate, human health, and industry. These complex communities exhibit a surprising amount of functionally relevant diversity at all levels of taxonomic resolution, presenting a significant challenge for most modeling frameworks. A long-standing hope of theoretical ecology is that some patterns might persist despite community complexity -- or perhaps even emerge because of it. A deeper understanding of such "emergent simplicity" could enable new approaches for predicting the behaviors of the complex ecosystems in nature. However, most examples described so far afford limited predictive power, as they focused on reproducibility rather than prediction. Here, we propose an information-theoretic framework for defining, nuancing and quantifying emergent simplicity in empirical data based on the ability of simple models to predict community-level functional properties. Applying this framework to two published datasets, we demonstrate that the majority of properties measured across both experiments exhibit robust evidence of emergent predictability: surprisingly, as community richness increases, simple compositional descriptions become more predictive. We show that this behavior is not typical within the standard modeling frameworks of theoretical ecology, and argue that improving our ability to predict and control natural microbial communities will require a shift of focus: away from complexity of _ecosystems_, and towards prediction complexity of _properties_ of ecosystems.</description>

      <title>Rate of epidemic spreading on complex networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.15449</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.15449v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The initial phase of an epidemic is often characterised by an exponential increase in the number of infected individuals. In a well-mixed population, this exponential increase is controlled by the basic reproduction number R0 and the distribution of times between consecutive infection along an infection chain. However, real populations are characterised by a complex network of interactions, and are thus far from being well mixed. Here, we derive an expression for the rate of exponential spread of an epidemic on a complex network. We find that this rate is affected by the degree distribution, the network assortativity, and the level of clustering. Our result holds for a broad range of networks, apart from networks with very broad degree distribution, where no clear exponential regime is present. The theory presented in this paper bridges the gap between classic epidemiology and the theory of complex network, with broad implications for model inference and policy making.</description>
