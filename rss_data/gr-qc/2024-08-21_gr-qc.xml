      <title>Dynamical Lensing Tomography of Black Hole Ringdown</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.10303</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.10303v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Strong gravitational lensing occurs when photons pass through the vicinity of a black hole. We investigate this phenomenon in the context of a gravitational-wave event, specifically when a black hole is settling into its final state. The deflection angle of photons mimics the ringdown pattern of the gravitational wave at intermediate times. At late times it has an inverse cubic dependence on observation time. The deviation angle increases exponentially as photons approach the photon ring orbit, reflecting its unstable nature. Our findings are directly applicable to imaging scenarios involving stars against the background of compact binaries, or circumbinary accretion disks, particularly during the merger of two black holes.</description>

      <title>Charging the Love numbers: Charged scalar response coefficients of Kerr-Newman black holes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.10352</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.10352v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the electrically-charged massless scalar response to the general Kerr-Newman black hole and obtain the exact (complex) response coefficients, whose real parts are the Love numbers. We find there is a curious discontinuity between the neutral and charged scalar. The Love numbers vanish for the neutral scalar, but are inversely proportional to the electric charge of the scalar in the small charge limit. We study the near-zone of the dynamical equation with non-vanishing frequency $\omega$, and show that the system have an $SL(2,\mathbb{R})$ Love-like symmetry. The symmetry selects a special frequency $\omega_{\rm cr}$, which vanishes in the neutral case, so that the real part of the response coefficient vanishes identically. We also generalize the results into higher dimensions to some extend.</description>

      <title>Tolerance to Astrophysical Model Uncertainty in Dark Siren Hubble Measurement with Third-generation Gravitational-wave Detectors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.10382</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.10382v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Gravitational-wave (GW) events can serve as standard sirens for cosmology, as the luminosity distance to source can be directly measured from the waveform amplitude. Specifically, the ``dark'' siren method involves inferring cosmological parameters, e.g. the Hubble constant, by comparing the luminosity distance distribution and that of the redshift, typically obtained through a combination of galaxy survey catalog and theoretical models. Especially with the prospect of third-generation GW detectors, the statistical uncertainty of the Hubble measurement can be suppressed to a percent level. However, incorrect assumption in galaxy population models can lead to systematic bias, which becomes increasingly relevant as third-generation GW detectors can detect large-redshift sources beyond the reach of currently available galaxy catalogs. In this work, we adopt a Fisher information formalism and study the maximum model error tolerance given specific total error budget. We find that, to achieve a total error budget of 1% in the Hubble constant, the galaxy mass function redshift evolution should be known to O(1%). We find that galaxy redshift uncertainty, survey magnitude limit and GW angular localization error are important factors. We find galaxy clustering also improves model error tolerance, thus our results provide a conservative benchmark to future analysis using real galaxy catalogs. We also investigate the effective bright siren scenario and highlight that the dark siren selection strategy should be catered to measurement uncertainty and the target total error budget. This work thus highlights the challenge in the dark siren method and quantifies requirements on both the galaxy catalog and GW measurement to contribute to constraining cosmology.</description>

      <title>Homogeneous solutions to the Einstein-matter equations with a magnetic field and a conformal gauge singularity</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.10736v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study massless solutions to the Einstein equations coupled to different matter models with a magnetic field and a conformal gauge singularity assuming spatial homogeneity with three commuting spatial translations. We show that there are no solutions in the case that the matter model is a radiation fluid. If the matter is described via kinetic theory we obtain that there exist unique solutions to the Einstein-Vlasov system and the Einstein-Boltzmann system for a certain range of soft potentials. For both the Vlasov and the Boltzmann case we also obtain asymptotic expansions close to the initial conformal gauge singularity.</description>

      <title>Gravitational effects on fluid dynamics in cosmological first-order phase transitions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.10770</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.10770v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Cosmological first-order phase transition (FOPT) sources the stochastic gravitational wave background (SWGB) through bubble collisions, sound waves, and turbulence. So far, most studies on the fluid profile of an expanding bubble are limited to transitions that complete in a much shorter time scale than the cosmic expansion. In this study, we investigate gravitational effects on the fluid profile beyond the self-similar regime. For this purpose we combine a hydrodynamic scheme in the presence of gravity with a fluid computation scheme under energy injection from the bubble wall. By performing (1+1)d simulations of spherical bubble for constant wall velocities, we find that the fluid generally develops a thinner shell in our cosmological setup, which qualitatively agrees with previous studies discussing the late-time behavior of fluid in expanding spacetime. We also observe reduction in the energy budget for the fluid kinetic energy. Furthermore, we find that the fluid profile develops sub-structure for accelerating bubble walls. We also comment on the possible broadening of the SGWB spectral plateau.</description>

      <title>The $C^3$-null gluing problem: linear and nonlinear analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.10859</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.10859v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we investigate the $C^3$-null gluing problem for the Einstein vacuum equations, that is, we consider the null gluing of up to and including third-order derivatives of the metric. In the regime where the characteristic data is close to Minkowski data, we show that this $C^3$-null gluing problem is solvable up to a $20$-dimensional space of obstructions. The obstructions correspond to $20$ linearly conserved quantities: $10$ of which are already present in the $C^2$-null gluing problem analysed by Aretakis, Czimek and Rodnianski, and $10$ are novel obstructions inherent to the $C^3$-null gluing problem. The $10$ novel obstructions are linearly conserved charges calculated from third-order derivatives of the metric.</description>

      <title>Signature of hadron-quark crossover in binary-neutron-star mergers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.10298</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.10298v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study observational signatures of the hadron-quark crossover in binary-neutron-star mergers by systematic numerical-relativity simulations. We employ two equations of state (EoSs) for matter consistent with inference from the observational data. In the crossover scenario the EoS is softened in a density realized in binary-neutron-star mergers and is smoothly continued to quark matter. In the phase transition scenario without crossover, the EoS remains stiff and a first-order phase transition takes place in a density out of reach of mergers. A GW170817-like system forms a remnant massive neutron star in both scenarios, and only the crossover scenario makes it collapse into a black hole due to the softening while gravitational-wave emission is strong. This difference is clearly reflected in the sudden shutdown of gravitational waves. For a given EoS, the lifetime of the merger remnant is determined primarily by the total mass of the system. These features pave the way for clarifying details of hadron-quark transition by compiling a wide variety of events observed with future gravitational-wave detectors. The mass of the accretion disk surrounding the remnant black hole is affected not only by the lifetime of the remnant but also by the mass ratio of the system. Electromagnetic emission associated with the disk outflow will also be useful for detailed investigation of the hadron-quark transition.</description>

      <title>Big-Bang Nucleosynthesis on a bubble universe nucleated in Kerr-AdS$_5$ Black Hole</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.10315v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present the Big-Bang Nucleosynthesis (BBN) simulation with a bubble universe scenario around a rotating black hole (BH) in Kerr-AdS$_5$ spacetime to explain recently updated observations of light elements such as the primordial helium abundance. In this scenario, the geometry of the 4D- early Universe is described as a vacuum bubble that undergoes quasi-de Sitter expansion in Kerr- AdS$_5$ spacetime. We find that the BH mass and spin parameter, which show an anti-correlation against the total radiation, are important to resolve the ${}^4$He anomaly. The present results provide clues to finding a connection between the observed results of light-element nucleosynthesis and the scenario of the 4D-bubble universe in AdS$_5$ spacetimes</description>

      <title>Theoretical Foundation of Black Hole Image Reconstruction using PRIMO</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.10322</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.10322v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A new image-reconstruction algorithm, PRIMO, applied to the interferometric data of the M87 black hole collected with the Event Horizon Telescope (EHT), resulted in an image that reached the native resolution of the telescope array. PRIMO is based on learning a compact set of image building blocks obtained from a large library of high-fidelity, physics-based simulations of black hole images. It uses these building blocks to fill the sparse Fourier coverage of the data that results from the small number of telescopes in the array. In this paper, we show that this approach is readily justified. Since the angular extent of the image of the black hole and of its inner accretion flow is finite, the Fourier space domain is heavily smoothed, with a correlation scale that is at most comparable to the sizes of the data gaps in the coverage of Fourier space with the EHT. Consequently, PRIMO or other machine-learning algorithms can faithfully reconstruct the images without the need to generate information that is unconstrained by the data within the resolution of the array. We also address the completeness of the eigenimages and the compactness of the resulting representation. We show that PRIMO provides a compact set of eigenimages that have sufficient complexity to recreate a broad set of images well beyond those in the training set.</description>

      <title>Yang-Mills extension of the Loop Quantum Gravity-corrected Maxwell equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.10366</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.10366v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we endeavour to build up a non-Abelian formulation to describe the self-interactions of massless vector bosons in the context of Loop Quantum Gravity (LQG). To accomplish this task, we start off from the modified Maxwell equations with the inclusion of LQG corrections and its corresponding local $U(1)$ gauge invariance. LQG effects in the electromagnetic interactions have significant importance, as they might be adopted to describe the flight time of cosmic photons coming from very high-energy explosions in the Universe, such as events of Gamma-Ray Bursts (GRBs). These photons have energy-dependent speeds, indicating that the velocity of light in the vacuum is not constant. To carry out the extension from the Abelian to the non-Abelian scenario, we shall follow the so-called Noether current procedure, which consists in recurrently introducing self-interactions into an initially free action for vector bosons by coupling the latter to the conserved currents of a global symmetry present in the action of departure. In the end of the non-Abelianization process, the initial global symmetry naturally becomes local. Once the Yang-Mills system includes LQG correction terms, it becomes possible to analyze how quantum-gravity induced contributions show up in both the electroweak and the QCD sectors of the Standard Model, providing a set-up for phenomenological investigations that may bring about new elements to discuss Physics beyond the Standard-Model.</description>

      <title>Constraining the Generalized Tolman-Oppenheimer-Volkoff (GTOV) equation with Bayesian analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.10425</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.10425v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this work, we constrain the values of the parameters of the Generalized Tolman-Oppenheimer-Volkoff (GTOV) equation through Bayesian inference. We use the mass and radius data from the Neutron Star Interior Composition Explorer (NICER) for PSR J0740+6620 and PSR J0030+0451, as well as the mass, radius, and dimensionless tidal deformability from the gravitational wave (GW) events GW190814 and GW170817. We use two distinct parameterizations of the extended non-linear Walecka model (eNLW) with and without hyperons. The GTOV employed for the study contains additional free parameters with different physical motivations. Two possible scenarios are considered in our analysis: conservative and speculative. In the first case, we take into account the most reliable neutron star (NS) data from NICER and the GW170817 event. In the second case, we consider the possibility that the compact object with a mass of $2.54 M_{\odot}$ in the GW190814 event is an NS. Our findings show significant improvements in the physical quantities analyzed, leading to better agreement with the observational data compared to the results obtained using the TOV equation.</description>

      <title>Probing Non-Thermal Gravitinos Through Large-Scale Structure Observations</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.10585v2 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the effects of non-thermally produced dark matter on large-scale structure formation, focusing on the gravitino dark matter. Our analysis shows that large-scale structure measurements from the SDSS LRG data offer a promising approach to probing non-thermally produced gravitinos. Specifically, if gravitinos resulting from neutralino decay constitute a fraction $F_\text{dec}=0.35~(0.1)$ of the dark matter component, the data exclude bino-like neutralino with a mass $m_{\chi_1^0}\lesssim25~(11)\text{ GeV}$. Furthermore, this constraint appears to be largely independent of the gravitino mass.</description>

      <title>A machine-learning classifier for the postmerger remnant of binary neutron stars</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.10678v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Knowing the kind of remnant produced after the merger of a binary neutron star system, e.g., if a black hole forms or not, would not only shed light on the equation of state describing the extremely dense matter inside neutron stars, but also help understand the physical processes involved in the postmerger phase. Moreover, in the event of a gravitational-wave detection, predicting the presence of a neutron star remnant is crucial in order to advise potential electromagnetic follow-up campaigns. In this work, we use Gradient Boosted Decision Trees and publicly available data from numerical-relativity simulations to construct a classifier that predicts the outcome of binary neutron star mergers, based on the binary's parameters inferred from gravitational-wave inspiral signals: total mass, mass-weighted tidal deformability, mass ratio, and effective inspiral spin. Employing parameters that can be estimated from the inspiral part of the signal only allows us to predict the remnant independently on the detection of a postmerger gravitational-wave signal. We build three different classifiers to distinguish between various potential scenarios, we estimate their accuracy and the confidence of their predictions. Finally, we apply the developed classifiers to real events data, finding that GW170817 most likely lead to the formation of a hypermassive neutron star, while GW190425 to a prompt collapse to a black hole.</description>

      <title>Average zero-expansion regions of the universe</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.10699v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Persistent tensions in the $\Lambda$CDM cosmological model underline the importance of tests of its basic assumptions. One such potential test arises from the fact that the surface of zero expansion around the collapsing object with spherical symmetry is strictly related to the object's mass and the value of the cosmological constant. We propose a complementary probe relating the averaged zero-expansion volume to the mass and the background cosmological Hubble parameter. Using the relativistic Zel'dovich approximation we are able to relax the spherical symmetry assumption and hence obtain a more general test of cosmological dynamics. Alternatively, our method can serve as a test of compatibility of relativistic N-body simulations and the scalar, averaged Einstein's equations with the relativistic Zel'dovich approximation serving as a closure condition.</description>

      <title>$\Lambda$CDM model against cosmography: A possible deviation after DESI 2024</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.10704</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.10704v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this study, we present an analysis of the standard flat-$\Lambda$CDM model using a cosmographic approach, incorporating recent DESI BAO observations and Supernovae Type Ia catalogues (SNIa), including the DES-SN5YR and Pantheon+ compilations. We find full consistency between the standard model and the cosmographic approach when considering DESI BAO and SNIa catalogues independently. When combining DESI BAO with SNIa data, we examine the impact of the Planck prior on the sound horizon at the drag epoch, $r_d$, and the Cepheid prior on the absolute magnitude, $M$. Applying the Planck prior on $r_d$ alone yields an $H_0$ value consistent with the Planck measurement, while applying the Cepheid prior on $M$ alone results in an $H_0$ value consistent with the SH0ES measurement. Without any priors, the $H_0$ value obtained has a large error margin, reconciling the Planck and SH0ES measurements. In all cases where individual priors are applied, we observe no significant tension between the flat-$\Lambda$CDM model and the cosmographic approach. However, when both Planck and Cepheid priors are applied simultaneously, significant tensions arise between the model and cosmography. This tension is even more pronounced when excluding LRG1 and LRG2 from the DESI measurements. These results suggest that the standard model cannot simultaneously align with both high-redshift Planck CMB observations and local Cepheid measurements.</description>

      <title>The H-graph with unequal masses in quantum field theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.10778</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.10778v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We compute the family of Feynman integrals related to the H-graph with unequal masses in relativistic quantum field theory. We present an $\varepsilon$-factorised differential equation for the 40 master integrals. The alphabet consists of 29 dlog-forms with algebraic arguments, involving six square roots. As these square roots are not simultaneously rationalizable, we express the master integrals in terms of iterated integrals. In addition, we express the H-graph with unit powers of the propagators up to weight four in terms of multiple polylogarithms in compact form.</description>

      <title>Gravitational waves from graviton Bremsstrahlung with kination phase</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.10786v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Gravitational waves (GWs) from gravitational three-body decay (graviton Bremsstrahlung process) can leave an indelible signal at ultrahigh frequencies. We focus on a scenario where superheavy particles are produced gravitationally at a transition between the inflationary and kination phases and analyze the detectability of the signal in the presence of GWs generated from the vacuum fluctuations during inflation. We find that, in many cases, GWs from the graviton Bremsstrahlung are buried in the stochastic gravitational wave background originating from inflation. However, if the superheavy particles are as heavy as the Planck scale, the graviton Bremsstrahlung can produce a sizable amount of GWs, surpassing the inflationary ones.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2408.10799v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Current cosmological constraints allow primordial black holes (PBHs) to constitute dark matter in the mass range of 10^{18}-10^{22}g. We show that a major portion of this logarithmic window can be ruled-out based on the Solar System ephemeris, given that the external mass enclosed within 50 au from the Sun did not change by more than ~5x10^{-14} solar masses per year in recent decades.</description>

      <title>CMB Implications of Multi-field Axio-dilaton Cosmology</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.10820</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.10820v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Axio-dilaton models are among the simplest scalar-tensor theories that contain the two-derivative interactions that naturally compete at low energies with the two-derivative inter-actions of General Relativity. Such models are well-motivated as the low energy fields arising from string theory compactification. We summarize these motivations and compute their cosmological evolution, in which the dilaton acts as dark energy and its evolution provides a framework for dynamically evolving particle masses. The derivative axion-dilaton couplings play an important role in the success of these cosmologies. We derive the equations for fluctuations needed to study their implications for the CMB anisotropy, matter spectra and structure growth. We use a modified Boltzmann code to study in detail four benchmark parameter choices, including the vanilla Yoga model, and identify couplings that give viable cosmologies, including some with surprisingly large matter-scalar interactions. The axion has negligible potential for most of the cosmologies we consider but we also examine a simplified model for which the axion potential plays a role, using axion-matter couplings motivated by phenomenological screening considerations. We find such choices can also lead to viable cosmologies.</description>

      <title>Search for the Hawking radiation of primordial black holes: prospective sensitivity of LHAASO</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.10897</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.10897v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Primordial black holes (PBHs) with initial mass $\sim5\times10^{14}$ g are evaporating due to Hawking radiation, leading to bursts of very-high-energy gamma rays. In this work, we investigate the prospective sensitivity of the Large High Altitude Air Shower Observatory (LHAASO) to measure the local burst rate density of PBHs. Our findings reveal that LHAASO is capable of searching for the PBH bursts within a distance $\sim0.1$ pc from the sun and thereby measure the local burst rate density $\sim$ 1164 (or 699)$\,\mathrm{pc}^{-3}\,\mathrm{yr}^{-1}$ at $99\%$ confidence level during a 3 (or 5) year observing run. This stands for a sensitivity that is one order of magnitude stronger than the strongest observational constraint from the High Altitude Water Cherenkov Observatory (HAWC). In addition, we further suggest an observing strategy to search for the PBH bursts during upcoming observing runs of LHAASO.</description>

      <title>Commutator technique for the heat kernel of minimal higher derivative operators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.10990</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.10990v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We suggest a new technique of the asymptotic heat kernel expansion for minimal higher derivative operators of a generic $2M$-th order, $F(\nabla)=(-\Box)^M+\cdots$, in the background field formalism of gauge theories and quantum gravity. This technique represents the conversion of the recently suggested Fourier integral method of generalized exponential functions [Phys. Rev. D105, 065013 (2022), arXiv:2112.03062] into the commutator algebra of special differential operators, which allows one to express expansion coefficients for $F(\nabla)$ in terms of the Schwinger-DeWitt coefficients of a minimal second order operator $H(\nabla)$. This procedure is based on special functorial properties of the formalism including the Mellin-Barnes representation of the complex operator power $H^M(\nabla)$ and naturally leads to the origin of generalized exponential functions without directly appealing to the Fourier integral method. The algorithm is essentially more straightforward than the Fourier method and consists of three steps ready for computer codification by symbolic manipulation programs. They begin with the decomposition of the operator into a power of some minimal second order operator $H(\nabla)$ and its lower derivative "perturbation part" $W(\nabla)$, $F(\nabla)=H^M(\nabla)+W(\nabla)$, followed by considering their multiple nested commutators. The second step is the construction of special local differential operators -- the perturbation theory in powers of the lower derivative part $W(\nabla)$. The final step is the so-called procedure of their {\em syngification} consisting in a special modification of the covariant derivative monomials in these operators by Synge world function $\sigma(x,x')$ with their subsequent action on the HaMiDeW coefficients of $H(\nabla)$.</description>

      <title>Hubble Tension or Distance Ladder Crisis?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.11031</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.11031v2 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present an up-to-date compilation of published Hubble constant ($H_0$) measurements that are independent of the CMB sound horizon scale. This compilation is categorized into two distinct groups: A. Distance Ladder Measurements: This group comprises 19 recent measurements, primarily from the past four years, utilizing various rung 2 calibrators and rung 3 cosmic distance indicators. B.One-Step Measurements: This category includes 31 measurements of $H_0$ that are independent of both the CMB sound horizon scale and the distance ladder approach. These are derived from diverse probes such as Cosmic Chronometers, gamma-ray attenuation, time-delay strong lensing, megamasers etc. Statistical analysis reveals a significant distinction between these two groups. The distance ladder-based measurements yield a weighted mean $H_0 = 72.76 \pm 0.50$ km s$^{-1}$ Mpc$^{-1}$, while the one-step measurements result in a weighted mean $H_0 = 69.01 \pm 0.49$ km s$^{-1}$ Mpc$^{-1}$. To quantify the statistical significance of this difference, we implemented a Kolmogorov-Smirnov (KS) test, which yielded a p-value of 0.000102. This extremely low p-value strongly indicates that the two samples are fundamentally distinct, with a probability of less than 0.01\% that they are drawn from the same underlying distribution. These findings suggest that late-time one-step measurements of $H_0$ are more consistent with early-time measurements, indicating that the core of the Hubble tension lies not between early-time and late-time measurements per se, but specifically between distance ladder measurements and all other $H_0$ determinations. This discrepancy points to either a systematic effect influencing all distance ladder measurements or a fundamental physics anomaly affecting at least one rung of the distance ladder.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2211.09344v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider the light emitters moving freely along the geodesics on the equatorial plane near a Kerr black hole and study the observability of these emitters. To do so, we assume these emitters emit the photons isotropically and monochromatically, and we compute the photon escaping probability (PEP) and the maximum observable blueshift (MOB) of the photons that reach infinity. We obtain numerical results of PEP and MOB for the emitters along various geodesic orbits, which exhibit distinct features for the trajectories of different classes. We exhaustively investigate the effects of the emitters' motion on the PEP and MOB. In particular, we find that the plunging emitters approaching the unstable circular orbits could have very good observability, before fading away suddenly. This interesting observational feature becomes more significant for the high-energy emitters near a high-spin black hole. As the radiatively-inefficient accretion flow may consist of such plunging emitters, the present work could be of great relevance to the astrophysical observations.</description>

Abstract: The quantum geometry arising in Loop Quantum Gravity has been known to semi-classically lead to generalizations of length-geometries. There have been several attempts to interpret these so called twisted geometries and understand their role and fate in the continuum limit of the spin foam approach to quantum gravity. In this paper we offer a new perspective on this issue by showing that the twisted geometry of a 4-simplex can be understood as arising from an area-metric (in contrast to the more particular length-metric). Such equivalence allows us to define notions like signature, generalized triangle inequalities and parallel transport for twisted geometries (now understood in a 4-dimensional setting), exemplifying how it provides a new handle to understand them. Furthermore, it offers a new microscopic understanding of spin foam geometries which is notably supported by recent studies of the continuum effective dynamics of spin foams.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2306.06012v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Effective spin foams provide the computationally most efficient spin foam models yet and are therefore ideally suited for applications e.g. to quantum cosmology. We provide here the first effective spin foam computations of a finite time evolution step in a Lorentzian quantum de Sitter universe. We will consider a set-up which computes the no-boundary wave function, as well as a set-up describing the transition between two finite scale factors. A key property of spin foams is that they implement discrete spectra for the areas. We therefore study the effects that are induced by the discrete spectra.
  To perform these computations we had to identify a technique to deal with highly oscillating and slowly converging, or even diverging sums. We illustrate here that high order Shanks transformation work very well and are a promising tool for the evaluation of Lorentzian (gravitational) path integrals and spin foam sums.</description>

      <title>Induced Cosmological Anisotropies and CMB Anomalies by a non-Abelian Gauge-Gravity Interaction</title>

      <description>arXiv:2312.14513v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present a non-abelian cousin of the model presented in \cite{Lee:2022rtz} which induces cosmological anisotropies on top of standard FLRW geometry. This is in some sense doing a cosmological mean field approximation, where the mean field cosmological model under consideration would be the standard FLRW, and the induced anisotropies are small perturbative corrections on top of it. Here we mostly focus on the non-abelian $SU(2)$ gauge fields coupled to the gravity to generate the anisotropies, which can be a viable model for the axion-like particle (ALP) dark sector. The induced anisotropies are consequences of the non-trivial back-reaction of the gauge fields on the gravity sector, and by a clever choice of the parametrization, one can generate the Bianchi model we have studied in this note. We also show that the anisotropies influence the Sachs-Wolfe effect and we discuss the implications.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.02119v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The dimension of the Hilbert space of a quantum gravitational system can be written formally as a path integral partition function over Lorentzian metrics. We implement this in a 2+1 dimensional simplicial minisuperspace model in which the system is a spatial topological disc, and recover by contour deformation through a Euclidean saddle the entropy of the de Sitter static patch, up to discretization artifacts. The model illustrates the importance of integration over both positive and negative lapse to enforce the gravitational constraints, and of restriction to complex metrics for which the fluctuation integrals would converge. Although a strictly Lorentzian path integral is oscillatory, an exponentially large partition function results from unavoidable imaginary contributions to the action. These arise from analytic continuation of the simplicial (Regge) action for configurations with codimension-2 simplices where the metric fails to be Lorentzian. In particular, the dominant contribution comes from configurations with contractible closed timelike curves that encircle the boundary of the disc, in close correspondence with recent continuum results.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.08024v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Chae's analyses on GAIA observations of wide binary stars have fortified the paradigm of extended gravity with particular attention to MOND-like theories. We recall that, starting from the origin of Einstein's general relativity, the request of Mach on the structure of the theory has been the core of the foundational debate. This issue is strictly connected with the nature of the mass-energy equivalence. This was exactly the key point that Einstein used to derive the same general relativity. On the other hand, the current requirements of particle physics and the open questions within extended gravity theories, which have recently been further strengthened by analyses of GAIA observations, request a better understanding of the Equivalence Principle. By considering a direct coupling between the Ricci curvature scalar and the matter Lagrangian a non geodesic ratio between the inertial and the gravitational mass can be fixed and MOND-like theories are retrieved at low energies.</description>

Abstract: The Wheeler-DeWitt equation does not describe any explicit time evolution of the wave function, and somehow related to this issue, there is no natural way of defining an invariant inner product that provides a viable probability interpretation. We show that both of these difficulties are solved in a covariant canonical formulation of general relativity where the configuration space is extended by introducing the embedding coordinates as dynamical variables. The formalism describes the evolution of the wave function from one spacelike slice to another, but as in the case of spatial diffeomorphisms this is simply implemented by a coordinate change in the wave function. We demonstrate how the time equation disappears after gauge fixing that removes the embedding coordinates. These findings indicate that the time evolution is trivial in a background independent formulation of quantum gravity.</description>

      <title>MOND equivalence of $f(R)$ gravity theory in solar system and cosmological scalarons</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.00351v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Since last two decades $f(R)$ gravity theory has been extensively used as a serious alternative of general relativity to mimic the effects of dark energy. The theory presents a Yukawa correction to Newtonian gravitational potential, acting as a fifth force of Nature. Generally speaking, this new force is mediated by a scalar field known as scalaron. It affects orbital dynamics of test bodies around a central mass. When the scalaron becomes extremely massive $f(R)$ gravity reduces to Newtonian theory in the weak field limit. In this paper we test $f(R)$ gravity theory in the solar system by constraining scalaron mass through existing measurements of perihelion shift of planets, cassini's measurement of the Parameterised Post Newtonian parameter and measurement of the Brans-Dicke coupling constant. We calculate acceleration due to gravity in the theory for planets, Trans Neptunian Objects (TNOs), Centaurs, Scattered Disk Objects (SDOs) and Oort cloud objects and compare it with the values predicted by Newtonian and Modified Newtonian Dynamics (MOND). It is found that the theory reproduces to MOND like acceleration in the outer solar system ($r_p \sim 2000$ au - $3000$ au) for available interpolating functions of the MOND paradigm. From its MOND equivalence we constrain the parameters of the theory. Our results are consistent with existing constraints on the theory arising from the environment of the Galactic Centre black hole. Scalarons realized in the solar system are reproduced in the radiation era of the universe with a time varying mass.</description>

Abstract: In this article, we investigate a coupled phantom dark-energy cosmological model in which the coupling term between a phantom scalar field with an exponential potential and a pressureless dark-matter fluid is motivated by the warm inflationary paradigm. Using methods of qualitative analysis of dynamical systems, complemented by numerical solutions of the evolution equations, we study the late-time behavior of our model. We show that contrary to the uncoupled scenario, the coupled phantom model admits accelerated scaling solutions. However, they do not correspond to a final state of the universe's evolution and, therefore, cannot be used to solve the cosmological coincidence problem. Furthermore, we show that, for certain coupling parameter values, the total equation-of-state parameter's asymptotic behavior is significantly changed when compared to the uncoupled scenario, allowing for solutions less phantom even for steeper potentials of the phantom scalar field.</description>

We constrain the E\"otv\"os parameter with 95%-confidence to $\eta_{\text{Nb*-Cu}}~\leq~2.0\times10^{-9}$ and $\eta_{\text{CP-ee}}\leq9.2\times10^{-4}$ for superconducting niobium and Cooper pairs, respectively.</description>

      <title>Eccentric features in the gravitational wave phase of dynamically formed black hole binaries</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.04603</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.04603v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the gravitational wave (GW) phase shift arising from center-of-mass accelerations of binary black hole mergers formed dynamically in three-body systems, where both the inner orbit of the merging binary and the outer orbit are eccentric. We provide a semi-analytical model and several analytical approximations that allow for fast evaluation of both the temporal evolution and the maximum value of the phase shift. The highest phase shifts occur when the binary merges close to the pericentre of the outer orbit, and can in this case be orders-of-magnitude larger compared to the circular limit. At high outer orbit eccentricities, the orbital curvature leaves distinct imprints onto the phase shift if the binary passes the outer pericentre during its inspiral. By comparing with phase shifts measured in numerical chaotic 3-body scatterings, we show that our model accurately describes the observed phase of dynamically assembled binary systems in realistic astrophysical scenarios, providing a way to directly determine their formation channel via single GW observations.</description>

Abstract: We survey elementary features of Lovelock gravity and its maximally symmetric vacuum solutions. The latter is solely determined by the real roots of a dimension-dependent polynomial. We also recover the static spherically symmetric (black hole) solutions of Lovelock gravity using Palais' symmetric criticality principle. We show how to linearize the generic field equations of Lovelock models about a given maximally symmetric vacuum, which turns out to factorize into the product of yet another dimension-dependent polynomial and the linearized Einstein tensor about the relevant background. We also describe how to compute conserved charges using linearized field equations along with the relevant background Killing isometries. We further describe and discuss the special vacua which are defined by the simultaneous vanishing of the aforementioned polynomials.</description>

Abstract: The initial phase of the inspiral process of a binary system producing gravitational waves can be described by perturbation theory. At the third post-Minkowskian order a two-loop double box graph, known as H-graph contributes. We consider the case where the two objects making up the binary system have equal masses. We express all master integrals related to the equal-mass H-graph up to weight four in terms of multiple polylogarithms. We provide a numerical program which evaluates all master integrals up to weight four in the physical regions with arbitrary precision.</description>

Abstract: This review is a contribution to a book dedicated to the memory of Michael E. Fisher. The first example of a quantum many body system not expected to have any quasiparticle excitations was the Wilson-Fisher conformal field theory. The absence of quasiparticles can be established in the compressible, metallic state of the Sachdev-Ye-Kitaev model of fermions with random interactions. The solvability of the latter model has enabled numerous computations of the non-quasiparticle dynamics of chaotic many-body states, such as those expected to describe quantum black holes. We review thermodynamic properties of the SYK model, and describe how they have led to an understanding of the universal structure of the low energy density of states of charged black holes without low energy supersymmetry.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2311.12113v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Asymptotically massless towers of species are ubiquitous in the string landscape when infinite-distance limits are approached. Due to the remarkable properties of string dualities, they always comprise Kaluza-Klein states or higher-spin excitations of weakly coupled, asymptotically tensionless critical strings. The connection between towers of light species and small black holes warrants seeking a bottom-up rationale for this dichotomoy, dubbed emergent string conjecture. In this paper we move a first step in this direction, exploring bottom-up constraints on towers of light species motivated purely from the consistency of the corresponding thermodynamic picture for small black holes. These constraints shed light on the allowed towers in quantum gravity, and, upon combining them with unitarity and causality constraints from perturbative graviton scattering, they provide evidence for the emergent string scenario with no reference to a specific ultraviolet completion.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2312.14913v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We construct a candidate tree-level gravitational Compton amplitude for a rotating Kerr black hole, for any quantum spin s=0,1/2,1,...,$\infty$, from which we extract the corresponding classical amplitude to all orders in the spin vector $S^\mu$. We use multiple insights from massive higher-spin quantum field theory, such as massive gauge invariance and improved behavior in the massless limit. A chiral-field approach is particularly helpful in ensuring correct degrees of freedom, and for writing down compact off-shell interactions for general spin. The simplicity of the interactions is echoed in the structure of the spin-s Compton amplitude, for which we use homogeneous symmetric polynomials of the spin variables. Where possible, we compare to the general-relativity results in the literature, available up to eighth order in spin.</description>

Abstract: The gravitational wave detectors have unveiled a population of massive black holes that do not resemble those observed in the Milky Way. They may have formed due to the evolution of massive low-metallicity stars, dynamical interactions in dense stellar environments, or density fluctuations in the very early Universe (primordial black holes). If the latter hypothesis is correct, primordial black holes should comprise from several to 100% of dark matter to explain the black hole merger rates observed by gravitational wave detectors. If such black holes existed in the Milky Way dark matter halo, they would cause long-timescale gravitational microlensing events lasting years. Here, we present the results of the search for the long-timescale microlensing events among the light curves of 78.7 million stars located in the Large Magellanic Cloud (LMC) that were monitored for 20 years (2001-2020) by the Optical Gravitational Lensing Experiment (OGLE) survey. We did not find any events with timescales longer than one year. The properties of all thirteen microlensing events with timescales shorter than one year detected by OGLE toward the LMC can be explained by astrophysical objects located either in the LMC itself or in the Milky Way disk, without the need to invoke dark matter in the form of compact objects. We find that compact objects in the mass range from $1.8 \times 10^{-4}\,M_{\odot}$ to $6.3\,M_{\odot}$ cannot compose more than 1% of dark matter, and compact objects in the mass range from $1.3 \times 10^{-5}\,M_{\odot}$ to $860\,M_{\odot}$ cannot make up more than 10% of dark matter. This conclusively rules out primordial black hole mergers as a dominant source of gravitational waves.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.16022v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We revisit the properties of total time-derivative terms as well as terms proportional to the free equation of motion (EOM) in a Schwinger-Keldysh formalism. They are relevant to the correct calculation of correlation functions of curvature perturbations in the context of inflationary Universe. We show that these two contributions to the action play different roles in the operator or the path-integral formalism, but they give the same correlation functions as each other. As a concrete example, we confirm that the Maldacena's consistency relations for the three-point correlation function in the slow-roll inflationary scenario driven by a minimally coupled canonical scalar field hold in both the operator and path-integral formalisms. We also give some comments on loop calculations.</description>

      <title>Detecting gravitational-wave bursts from black hole binaries in the Galactic Center with LISA</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.12571v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Stellar-mass black hole binaries (BHBs) in galactic nuclei are gravitationally perturbed by the central supermassive black hole (SMBH) of the host galaxy, potentially inducing strong eccentricity oscillations through the eccentric Kozai-Lidov (EKL) mechanism. These highly eccentric binaries emit a train of gravitational-wave (GW) bursts detectable by the Laser Interferometer Space Antenna (LISA) -- a planned space-based GW detector -- with signal-to-noise ratios (SNRs) up to ${\sim}100$ per burst. In this work, we study the GW signature of BHBs orbiting our galaxy's SMBH, Sgr A$^*$, which are consequently driven to very high eccentricities. We demonstrate that an unmodeled approach using a wavelet decomposition of the data effectively yields the time-frequency properties of each burst, provided that the GW frequency peaks between $10^{-3}\,\,\mathrm{Hz}$--$10^{-1}\,\,\mathrm{Hz}$. The wavelet parameters may be used to infer the eccentricity of the binary, measuring $\log_{10}(1-e)$ within an error of $20\%$. Our proposed search method can thus constrain the parameter space to be sampled by complementary Bayesian inference methods, which use waveform templates or orthogonal wavelets to reconstruct and subtract the signal from LISA data.</description>

      <title>Exponential Quintessence: curved, steep and stringy?</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.09323v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We explore the possibility that our universe's current accelerated expansion is explained by a quintessence model with an exponential scalar potential, $V =V_0\, e^{-\lambda\, \phi}$, keeping an eye towards $\lambda \geq \sqrt{2}$ and an open universe, favorable to a string theory realisation and with no cosmological horizon. We work out the full cosmology of the model, including matter, radiation, and optionally negative spatial curvature, for all $\lambda&gt;0$, performing an extensive analysis of the dynamical system and its phase space. The minimal physical requirements of a past epoch of radiation domination and an accelerated expansion today lead to an upper bound $\lambda \lesssim \sqrt{3}$, which is driven slightly up in the presence of observationally allowed spatial curvature. Cosmological solutions start universally in a kination epoch, go through radiation and matter dominated phases and enter an epoch of acceleration, which is only transient for $\lambda&gt;\sqrt{2}$. Field distances traversed between BBN and today are sub-Planckian. We discuss possible string theory origins and phenomenological challenges, such as time variation of fundamental constants. We provide theoretical predictions for the model parameters to be fitted to data, most notably the varying dark energy equation of state parameter, in light of recent results from DES-Y5 and DESI.</description>

      <title>Every Poincar\'e gauge theory is conformal: a compelling case for dynamical vector torsion</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.12826v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The Poincar\'e gauge theory (PGT) of gravity provides a viable formulation of general relativity (Einstein-Cartan theory), and a popular model-building framework for modified gravity with torsion. Notoriously, however, the PGT terms which propagate vector torsion lead to strongly-coupled ghosts: the modern view is that only scalar torsion can propagate. To fix this, we revisit the concept of embedding explicit mass scales in scale-invariant theories, showing how the Klein-Gordon theory naturally leads to a slowly-rolling inflaton. We then show that the unique scale-invariant embedding of PGT leads to two new terms, one of which is the Maxwell term for vector torsion. We provide the full spectrum of quantum particles in the resulting theory. Our result means that every PGT is conformal and - after a two-decade hiatus - vector torsion is back on the menu.</description>

      <title>Exploring pathways to forming twin stars</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.15544v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A viable model for the dense matter equation of state above the nuclear saturation density includes a hadron-to-quark phase transition at densities relevant to compact objects. In this case, stable hybrid hadron-quark stars can arise. An even more interesting scenario is one where the hadron-to-quark phase transition results in the emergence of a third branch of stable compact objects (in addition to white dwarfs and neutron stars). Inherent to the presence of a third family of compact stars is the existence of twin stars - hybrid stars with the same mass as the corresponding neutron stars, but with smaller radii. Interestingly, the neutron star-twin star scenario is consistent with GW170817. If twin stars exist in nature, it raises a question about the mechanism that leads to their formation. Here, we explore gravitational collapse as a pathway to the formation of low-mass twin stars. We perform fully general relativistic simulations of the collapse of a stellar iron core, modeled as a cold degenerate gas, to investigate whether the end product is a neutron star or a twin star. Our simulations show that even with unrealistically large perturbations in the initial conditions, the core bounces well below the hadron-to-quark phase transition density, if the initial total rest mass is in the twin star range. Following cooling, these configurations produce neutron stars. We find that twin stars can potentially form due to mass loss, e.g., through winds, from a slightly more massive hybrid star that was initially produced in the collapse of a more massive core or if the maximum neutron star mass is below the Chandrasekhar mass limit. The challenge in producing twin stars in gravitational collapse, in conjunction with the fine-tuning required because of their narrow mass range, suggests the rarity of twin stars in nature.</description>

Abstract: We study the holographic thermodynamics of $4-D$ Kerr-Newman AdS black holes. We consider the conformal thermal states dual to KN AdS black holes and work out the corresponding thermodynamics in 10 ensembles. These ensembles are: fixed $(\mathcal{Q},\mathcal{J},\mathcal{V},C)$, fixed $(\mathcal{Q},\Omega,\mathcal{V},C)$, fixed $(\varphi,\Omega,\mathcal{V},C)$, fixed $(\varphi,\mathcal{J},\mathcal{V},C)$, fixed $(\mathcal{Q},\mathcal{J},p,C)$, fixed $(\mathcal{Q},\Omega,p,C)$,fixed $(\varphi,\mathcal{J},p,C)$,fixed $(\mathcal{Q},\mathcal{J},p,\mu)$ and fixed $(\varphi,\Omega,p,\mu)$ ensembles. Here $\varphi$, $\mathcal{Q}$, $\Omega$, $\mathcal{J}$, $p$, $\mathcal{V}$, $C$ and $\mu$ denotes the electric potential, electric charge, angular velocity, angular momentum, CFT pressure, CFT volume, central charge, and chemical potential respectively. In the fixed $(\mathcal{Q},\mathcal{J},\mathcal{V},C)$ ensemble, we observe a first order phase transition for $\mathcal{Q}&lt;\mathcal{Q}_{crit}$, $\mathcal{J}&lt;\mathcal{J}_{crit}$ and $C&gt;C_{crit}$. In the fixed $(\mathcal{Q},\Omega,\mathcal{V}, C)$ ensemble, we again find a first-order phase transition for $\mathcal{Q}&lt;\mathcal{Q}_{crit}$, $\Omega&lt;\Omega_{crit}$ and $C&gt;C_{crit}$. The fixed $(\varphi,\Omega,\mathcal{V}, C)$ ensemble is characterized by a confinement/de-confinement phase transition. In the fixed $(\varphi,\mathcal{J},\mathcal{V},C)$ ensemble, we see a first order phase transition for $\mathcal{J}&lt;\mathcal{J}_{crit}$, $\varphi&lt;\varphi_{crit}$ and $C&gt;C_{crit}$. Finally, in the fixed $(\mathcal{Q},\mathcal{J},p, C)$,$(\mathcal{Q},\Omega,p, C)$,$(\varphi,\mathcal{J},p, C)$,$(\mathcal{Q},\mathcal{J},p,\mu)$,$(\varphi,\Omega,p,\mu)$ ensembles, we do not observe any critical behavior or phase transition.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.09122v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Utilizing the holographic dictionary from the proposal that treats Newton's constant as a thermodynamic variable, we establish a thermodynamic topological equivalence between the AdS black holes in the bulk and the thermal states in the dual CFT. The findings further reveal that the thermodynamic topological characteristics of the RegMax AdS black holes are strongly influenced by the characteristic parameter of the regularized Maxwell theory. Additionally, we investigate the phase transition between low and high entropy thermal states within a canonical ensemble in the dual CFT. Our observations indicate that the phase transition behavior of the thermal states mirrors that of the black holes. By modeling the phase transition process as a stochastic process, we are able to calculate the rates of phase transition between the thermal states. This result enhances our understanding of the dominant processes involved in the phase transition of the thermal states in the dual CFT.</description>

      <title>The mass effect -- Variations of masses and their impact on cosmology</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.16845</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.16845v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We summarize and explain the current status of variations of fundamental masses in cosmology, with a particular focus on variations of the electron mass. We show that electron mass variations not only allow for significant easing of the Hubble tension but are also preferred at a decent level of significance using the latest DESI data (between $2\sigma$ and $3.6\sigma$ depending on the model and the data). This extreme success of the model is neither tightly constrained from light element abundances generated during big bang nucleosynthesis nor from post-recombination observations using quasars and atomic clocks, though future data is expected to give strong evidence in favor of or against this model. Models of baryon mass variations, on the other hand, are shown to generally not be cosmologically interesting.</description>

      <title>A Heuristic Philosophical Discourse on Various Applications of Abstract Differential Geometry in Quantum Gravity Research</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.07725</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.07725v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In the present paper, we outline and expound the fundamental and novel qualitative-cum-philosophical premises, principles, ideas, concepts, constructions and results that originate from our ongoing research project of applying the conceptual panoply and the technical machinery of Abstract Differential Geometry (ADG) to various persistently outstanding issues in Quantum Gravity (QG) research. At the end of the paper, we discuss the potential philosophical repercussions of two possible future research routes that the main stream of our applications of ADG to QG may bifurcate towards in view of three independent, but overlapping, research papers that are currently under development.</description>
