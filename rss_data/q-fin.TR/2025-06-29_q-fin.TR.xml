      <title>On the hidden costs of passive investing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.21775</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.21775v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Passive investing has gained immense popularity due to its low fees and the perceived simplicity of focusing on zero tracking error, rather than security selection. However, our analysis shows that the passive (zero tracking error) approach of waiting until the market close on the day of index reconstitution to purchase a stock (that was announced days earlier as an upcoming addition) results in costs amounting to hundreds of basis points compared to strategies that involve gradually acquiring a small portion of the required shares in advance with minimal additional tracking errors. In addition, we show that under all scenarios analyzed, a trader who builds a small inventory post-announcement and provides liquidity at the reconstitution event can consistently earn several hundreds of basis points in profit and often much more, assuming minimal risk.</description>

      <title>Optimal Benchmark Design under Costly Manipulation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.22142</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.22142v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Price benchmarks are used to incorporate market price trends into contracts, but their use can create opportunities for manipulation by parties involved in the contract. This paper examines this issue using a realistic and tractable model inspired by smart contracts on blockchains like Ethereum. In our model, manipulation costs depend on two factors: the magnitude of adjustments to individual prices (variable costs) and the number of prices adjusted (fixed costs). We find that a weighted mean is the optimal benchmark when fixed costs are negligible, while the median is optimal when variable costs are negligible. In cases where both fixed and variable costs are significant, the optimal benchmark can be implemented as a trimmed mean, with the degree of trimming increasing as fixed costs become more important relative to variable costs. Furthermore, we show that the optimal weights for a mean-based benchmark are proportional to the marginal manipulation costs, whereas the median remains optimal without weighting, even when fixed costs differ across prices.</description>
