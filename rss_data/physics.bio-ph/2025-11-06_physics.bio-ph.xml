      <title>Digitizing Spermatogenesis Lineage at Nanoscale Resolution In Tissue-Level Electron Microscopy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.02860</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.02860v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent advances in 2D large-scale and 3D volume electron microscopy have stimulated the rapid development of nanoscale functional analysis at the tissue and organ levels. Digitizing the cell by mapping the intricate organellar networks into its physiological and pathological textures will revolutionarize the contents of cell atlases. To meet the requirements of characterizing intracellular organelles and their interactions within defined cellular cohorts at tissue level, we have developed DeepOrganelle. It adopts a lightweighted Mask2Former frameworks as a universal segmentor and is capable of segmenting and extracting organelles within different cell types, performing statistical quantitative analysis, as well as visualizing and quantifying the spatial distribution of organelle morphologies and interactions across different cell types at tissue scales. Using DeepOrganelle, we systemically perform cross-scale quantification of membrane contact sites(MCSs) dynamics across the progression of the seminiferous epithelial cycle, covering 12 distinct developmental stages and 24 statuses of germ cells. DeepOrganelle uncovers the spatiotemporal gradient of the germ cell differentiation atlas according to different types of organelles and their interactions. Noticeably, it discovers a waved pattern of mitochondria(Mito)-endoplasmic reticulum(ER) contact with a significant increase specifically at Stage X pachytene preceding the transition to diplotene, which aligns well with a newly reported experiment that mitochondrial metabolic proteins like PDHA2 are essential for this transition by maintaining ATP supply for double-strand break(DSB) repair. DeepOrganelle also observes a dynamic restructuring of the blood-testis barrier and stage-specific reorganization of organelle topography in Sertoli cells from preleptotene to leptotene phases of prophase I.</description>

      <title>Exchange controls coarsening of surface condensates</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.03619</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.03619v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Biological membranes often exhibit heterogeneous protein patterns, which cells control. Strong patterns, like the polarity spot in budding yeast, can be described as surface condensates, formed by physical interactions between constituents. However, it is unclear how these interactions affect the material exchange with the bulk. To study this, we analyze a thermodynamically consistent model, which reveals that passive exchange generally accelerates the coarsening of surface condensates. Active exchange can further accelerate coarsening, although it can also fully arrest it and induce complex patterns involving various length scales. We reveal how these behaviors are related to non-local transport via diffusion through the bulk, rationalizing the various scaling laws we observe and allowing us to interpret biologically relevant scenarios.</description>

      <title>Emergent tuning heterogeneity in cortical circuits is sensitive to cellular neuronal dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.03502</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.03502v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Cortical circuits exhibit high levels of response diversity, even across apparently uniform neuronal populations. While emerging data-driven approaches exploit this heterogeneity to infer effective models of cortical circuit computation (e.g. Genkin et al. Nature 2025), the power of response diversity to enable inference of mechanistic circuit models is largely unexplored. Within the landscape of cortical circuit models, spiking neuron networks in the balanced state naturally exhibit high levels of response and tuning diversity emerging from their internal dynamics. A statistical theory for this emergent tuning heterogeneity, however, has only been formulated for binary spin models (Vreeswijk &amp; Sompolinsky, 2005). Here we present a formulation of feature-tuned balanced state networks that allows for arbitrary and diverse dynamics of postsynaptic currents and variable levels of heterogeneity in cellular excitability but nevertheless is analytically exactly tractable with respect to the emergent tuning curve heterogeneity. Using this framework, we present a case study demonstrating that, for a wide range of parameters even the population mean response is non-universal and sensitive to mechanistic circuit details. As our theory enables exactly and analytically obtaining the likelihood-function of tuning heterogeneity given circuit parameters, we argue that it forms a powerful and rigorous basis for neural circuit inference.</description>

      <title>Final state sensitivity and fractal basin boundaries from coupled Chialvo neurons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.03671</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.03671v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate and quantify the basin geometry and extreme final state uncertainty of two identical electrically asymmetrically coupled Chialvo neurons. The system's diverse behaviors are presented, along with the mathematical reasoning behind its chaotic and nonchaotic dynamics as determined by the structure of the coupled equations. The system is found to be multistable with two qualitatively different attractors. Although each neuron is individually nonchaotic, the chaotic basin takes up the vast majority of the coupled system's state space, but the nonchaotic basin stretches to infinity due to chance synchronization. The boundary between the basins is found to be fractal, leading to extreme final state sensitivity. This uncertainty and its potential effect on the synchronization of biological neurons may have significant implications for understanding human behavior and neurological disease.</description>

      <title>Intracellular phagosome shell is rigid enough to transfer outside torque to the inner spherical particle</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.08498</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.08498v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Intracellular phagosomes have a lipid bilayer encapsulated fluidic shell outside the particle, on the outer side of which, molecular motors are attached. An optically trapped spherical birefringent particle phagosome provides an ideal platform to probe fluidity of the shell, as the inner particle is optically confined both in translation and in rotation. Using a recently reported method to calibrate the translation and pitch rotations - yielding a spatial resolution of about 2 nm and angular resolution of 0.1 degrees - we report novel roto-translational coupled dynamics. We also suggest a new technique where we explore the correlation between the translation and pitch rotation to study extent of activity. Given that a spherical birefringent particle phagosome is almost a sphere, the fact that it turns due to the activity of the motors is not obvious, even implying high rigidity of shell. Applying a minimal model for the roto-translational coupling, we further show that this coupling manifests itself as sustained fluxes in phase space, a signature of broken detailed balance.</description>

      <title>Hydrodynamics of thermal active matter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.11023</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.11023v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Active matter concerns many-body systems comprised of living or self-driven agents that collectively exhibit macroscopic phenomena distinct from conventional passive matter. Using Schwinger-Keldysh effective field theory, we develop a novel hydrodynamic framework for thermal active matter that accounts for energy balance, local temperature variations, and the ensuing stochastic effects. By modelling active matter as a driven open system, we show that the source of active contributions to hydrodynamics, violations of fluctuation-dissipation theorems, and detailed balance is rooted in the breaking of time-translation symmetry due to the presence of fuel consumption and an external environmental bath. In addition, our framework allows for non-equilibrium steady states that produce entropy, with a well-defined notion of steady-state temperature. We use our framework of active hydrodynamics to develop effective field theory actions for active superfluids and active nematics that offer a first-principle derivation of various active transport coefficients and feature activity-induced phase transitions. We also show how to incorporate temperature, energy and noise in fluctuating hydrodynamics for active matter. Our work suggests a broader perspective on active matter that can leave an imprint across scales.</description>

      <title>Fragmentation and aggregation of cyanobacterial colonies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.21115</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.21115v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Fluid flow has a major effect on the aggregation and fragmentation of bacterial colonies. Yet, a generic framework to understand and predict how hydrodynamics affects colony size remains elusive. This study investigates how fluid flow affects the formation and maintenance of large colonial structures in cyanobacteria, using an experimental technique that precisely controls hydrodynamic conditions. We performed experiments on laboratory cultures and lake samples of the cyanobacterium Microcystis, while their colony size distribution was measured simultaneously by direct microscopic imaging. We demonstrate that EPS-embedded cells formed by cell division exhibit significant mechanical resistance to shear forces. However, at elevated hydrodynamic stress levels (exceeding those typically generated by surface wind mixing) these colonies experience fragmentation through an erosion process. We also show that single cells can aggregate into small colonies due to fluid flow. However, the structural integrity of these flow-induced colonies is weaker than that of colonies formed by cell division. We provide a mathematical analysis to support the experiments and demonstrate that a population model with two categories of colonies describes the measured size distributions. Our results shed light on the specific conditions wherein flow-induced fragmentation and aggregation of cyanobacteria are decisive and indicate that colony formation under natural conditions is mainly driven by cell division, although flow-induced aggregation could play a role in dense bloom events. These findings can be used to improve prediction models and mitigation strategies for toxic cyanobacterial blooms and also offer potential applications in other areas such as algal biotechnology or medical settings where the dynamics of biological aggregates play a significant role.</description>

      <title>Uncovering flow and deformation regimes in the coupled fluid-solid vestibular system</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.06394</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.06394v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we showcase how flow obstruction by a deformable object can lead to symmetry breaking in curved domains subject to angular acceleration. Our analysis is motivated by the deflection of the cupula, a soft tissue located in the inner ear that is used to perceive rotational motion as part of the vestibular system. The cupula is understood to block the rotation-induced flow in a toroidal region with the flow-induced deformation of the cupula used by the brain to infer motion. By asymptotically solving the governing equations for this flow, we characterise regimes for which the sensory system is sensitive to either angular velocity or angular acceleration. Moreover, we show the fluid flow is not symmetric in the latter case. Finally, we extend our analysis of symmetry breaking to understand the formation of vortical flow in cavernous regions within channels. We discuss the implications of our results for the sensing of rotation by mammals.</description>

      <title>Excitonic Coupling and Photon Antibunching in Venus Yellow Fluorescent Protein Dimers: A Lindblad Master Equation Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.14233</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.14233v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Strong excitonic coupling and photon antibunching (AB) have been observed together in Venus yellow fluorescent protein dimers and currently lack a cohesive theoretical explanation. In 2019, Kim et al. demonstrated Davydov splitting in circular dichroism spectra, revealing strong J-like coupling, while antibunched fluorescence emission was confirmed by combined antibunching--fluorescence correlation spectroscopy (AB/FCS fingerprinting). To investigate the implications of this coexistence, Venus yellow fluorescent protein (YFP) dimer population dynamics are modeled within a Lindblad master equation framework, testing its ability to cope with typical, data-informed, Venus YFP dimer time and energy values. Simulations predict multiple-femtosecond (fs) decoherence, yielding bright/dark state mixtures consistent with antibunched fluorescence emission at room temperature. Thus, excitonic coupling and photon AB in Venus YFP dimers are reconciled without invoking long-lived quantum coherence. However, clear violations of several Lindblad approximation validity conditions appear imminent, calling for careful modifications to choices of standard system and bath definitions and parameter values.</description>

      <title>Learning noisy tissue dynamics across time scales</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.19090</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.19090v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Tissue dynamics play a crucial role in biological processes ranging from inflammation to morphogenesis. However, these noisy multicellular dynamics are notoriously hard to predict. Here, we introduce a biomimetic machine learning framework capable of inferring noisy multicellular dynamics directly from experimental movies. This generative model combines graph neural networks, normalizing flows and WaveNet algorithms to represent tissues as neural stochastic differential equations where cells are edges of an evolving graph. Cell interactions are encoded in a dual signaling graph capable of handling signaling cascades. The dual graph architecture of our neural networks reflects the architecture of the underlying biological tissues, substantially reducing the amount of data needed for training, compared to convolutional or fully-connected neural networks. Taking epithelial tissue experiments as a case study, we show that our model not only captures stochastic cell motion but also predicts the evolution of cell states in their division cycle. Finally, we demonstrate that our method can accurately generate the experimental dynamics of developmental systems, such as the fly wing, and cell signaling processes mediated by stochastic ERK waves, paving the way for its use as a digital twin in bioengineering and clinical contexts.</description>
