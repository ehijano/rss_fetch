      <title>Secure ISAC Systems Empowered by Compound Reconfigurable Antenna Arrays</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.16055</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.16055v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) systems, the use of dual-functional signals inherently exposes confidential communication information during radar sensing, particularly when the sensing target itself acts as an eavesdropper. Conventional physical-layer security solutions rely on directional beamforming or artificial noise injection implemented via signal processing in the baseband (BB) domain. However, these BB-domain approaches are constrained by insufficient spatial resolution and the adverse effects of spatially correlated channels. To overcome these limitations, this paper proposes a novel secure ISAC framework empowered by compound reconfigurable antenna (CRA) arrays, which offer simultaneous reconfigurability of radiation patterns and polarization states in the electromagnetic (EM) domain. Specifically, we develop a comprehensive channel model incorporating virtual angular domain, spatial domain, and depolarization effects, and formulate a mixed-integer nonlinear programming (MINLP) problem to jointly design EM-domain and BB-domain precoders and combiners. To efficiently solve this complex optimization problem, we propose an iterative decomposition-based algorithm leveraging fractional programming (FP), majorization-minimization (MM), second-order cone programming (SOCP), and penalty methods. Extensive simulation results demonstrate that the CRA array architecture with proposed joint EM-and BB-domain design achieves significant performance improvements in secure ISAC systems. In particular, radar sensing gains of up to 12dB are observed over conventional beamforming, while robust communication security is maintained. These results highlight the considerable benefits attainable by jointly leveraging additional degrees of freedom (DoFs) in the EM domain for secure ISAC system design.</description>

      <title>FM OFDM Unifying High Mobility Communications and Sensing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.16107</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.16107v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Integrated Sensing and Communication (ISAC) is foundational to future sixth generation (6G) systems, demanding waveform co-design that supports both high throughput data transmission and accurate environmental perception. While Orthogonal Frequency Division Multiplexing (OFDM) offers flexibility and backward compatibility, its high Peak to Average Power Ratio (PAPR) poses significant challenges at higher frequency bands. To address this, we investigate Frequency Modulated Orthogonal Frequency Division Multiplexing (FM OFDM) a constant envelope waveform that facilitates robust joint sensing and communication under highly mobile, doubly dispersive channel conditions. We derive a comprehensive input output relationship for FM OFDM in time varying multipath channels, including analytical expressions for Inter Carrier Interference (ICI), Doppler effects, and effective channel gains. Extensive simulations comparing FM OFDM with conventional Cyclic Prefix Orthogonal Frequency Division Multiplexing (CP OFDM) and Constant Envelope Orthogonal Frequency Division Multiplexing (CE OFDM) demonstrate superior range and velocity estimation accuracy of FM-OFDM, particularly at high Signal to Noise Ratios (SNRs) and under high mobility, highlighting its suitability as a unified waveform for high frequency ISAC applications in 6G.</description>

      <title>A Scalable Hybrid Track-Before-Detect Tracking System: Application to Coastal Maritime Radar Surveillance</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.16169</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.16169v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Despite their theoretical advantages, track-before-detect (TBD) methods remain largely absent from real-world multi-target tracking applications due to their computational complexity and limited scalability. This paper presents a scalable hybrid tracking framework that combines a TBD multi-target tracking algorithm with a detection-based multi-target tracking algorithm for coastal radar surveillance. In particular, the approach uses an integrated existence Poisson histogram-probabilistic multi-hypothesis tracking (IE-PHPMHT)-based TBD module with a conventional Poisson multi-Bernoulli Mixture (PMBM) point tracker. The system processes raw radar data through land clutter suppression, cell-wise detection, and clustering-based feature extraction. High-threshold detections are used to track strong targets via the point tracker, while low-threshold detections are employed for adaptive birth in the TBD module, enabling early initiation and sustained tracking of weak or ambiguous targets. Validated using real X-band radar data from the Trondheim Fjord, Norway, the approach demonstrates robust multi-target tracking performance in a full-scale application with a large observation area under resource constraints, highlighting its suitability for operational deployment in complex maritime environments needed for coastal surveillance and to support autonomy.</description>

      <title>Hybrid Precoding Revisited: Low-Dimensional Subspace Perspective for MU-MIMO Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.16218</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.16218v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This letter presents a low-complexity hybrid precoding framework for multiuser multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) systems by leveraging a low-dimensional subspace property. Under the low-dimensional subspace perspective, we first identify an unconstrained optimal radio-frequency (RF) precoder. We then optimize a hybrid precoder via a reduced-complexity precoding method. We further extend the proposed framework to (i) a dynamic-subarray antenna partitioning algorithm that adaptively allocates subsets of antennas associated with RF chains, and (ii) a channel covariance-based approach to exploit statistical channel state information at a transmitter (CSIT), ensuring robustness with partial CSIT. Simulations validate that our proposed algorithms achieve superior performance while significantly reducing complexity compared to existing methods.</description>

      <title>Parameter-Free Logit Distillation via Sorting Mechanism</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.16544</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.16544v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Knowledge distillation (KD) aims to distill the knowledge from the teacher (larger) to the student (smaller) model via soft-label for the efficient neural network. In general, the performance of a model is determined by accuracy, which is measured with labels. However, existing KD approaches usually use the teacher with its original distribution, neglecting the potential of incorrect prediction. This may contradict the motivation of hard-label learning through cross-entropy loss, which may lead to sub-optimal knowledge distillation on certain samples. To address this issue, we propose a novel logit processing scheme via a sorting mechanism. Specifically, our method has a two-fold goal: (1) fixing the incorrect prediction of the teacher based on the labels and (2) reordering the distribution in a natural way according to priority rank at once. As an easy-to-use, plug-and-play pre-processing, our sort method can be effectively applied to existing logit-based KD methods. Extensive experiments on the CIFAR-100 and ImageNet datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of our method.</description>

      <title>Task Offloading and Resource Allocation for MEC-assisted Consumer Internet of Vehicle Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.15795</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.15795v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Mobile edge computing (MEC)-assisted internet of vehicle (IoV) is emerging as a promising paradigm to provide computing services for vehicles. However, meeting the computing-sensitive and computation-intensive demands of vehicles poses several challenges, including the discrepancy between the limited resource provision and stringent computing requirement, the difficulty in capturing and integrating the intricate features of the MEC-assisted IoV system into the problem formulation, and the need for real-time processing and efficient resource management in the dynamic environment. In this work, we explore the AI-enabled task offloading and resource allocation for MEC-assisted consumer IoV systems. Specifically, we first present a multi-MEC-assisted consumer IoV architecture that leverages the computational resources of MEC servers to provide offloading services close to vehicles. Subsequently, we formulate a system cost minimization optimization problem (SCMOP) by integrating the service delay and energy consumption. To efficiently solve this problem, we design a joint task offloading and computing resource allocation approach (JTOCRA) by applying the multi-agent deep deterministic policy gradient (MADDPG) algorithm. Finally, simulation results demonstrate that the proposed JTOCRA can achieve superior system performances and exhibits better scalability compared to other alternative approaches.</description>

      <title>Turbo Spin Echo Imaging at 7T with Bilateral Orthogonality Generative Acquisitions Method for Homogeneous T_1, T_2 and Proton Density Contrasts</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.15867</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.15867v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Purpose: Bilateral Orthogonality Generative Acquisitions (BOGA) method, which was initially implemented for T_2^* contrast via gradient echo acquisitions, is adapted for TSE imaging at 7T using parallel transmission (pTx) system for obtaining homogeneous T_1, T_2 and proton density weighted images. Theory and Methods: Multiple TSE images with complimentary RF modes and scan parameters are acquired as input images for the BOGA method where RF modes have complimentary transmit and receive field inhomogeneity patterns and scan parameters have varying echo and repetition times. With the application of the BOGA method using different subsets of the data acquisitions for each contrast, homogeneous T_1, T_2 and proton density contrast in the final images obtained. Furthermore, to demonstrate the effect of the TSE factor, two TSE factors are used individually. Normalized intensity profiles and signal to noise ratio maps are utilized for the comparison of the CP mode images and the TSE factors respectively.
  Results: Homogeneous T_1, T_2 and proton density weighted images are obtained with the TSE implementation of the BOGA method without the transmit and receive field inhomogeneity effects. Furthermore, mixed contrast effects of the TSE acquisition are simultaneously resolved independently of the TSE factor.
  Conclusion: TSE application of BOGA method results in homogeneous T_1, T_2 and proton density contrasts at 7T, as the inhomogeneity effects are removed from the final contrast without any prior data acquisitions.</description>

      <title>Konzepte zur Effizienzsteigerung von Traktionsmotoren in batterieelektrischen Fahrzeugen durch den Einsatz neuartiger teillastoptimierbarer Motor- und Invertertopologien</title>

Abstract: To increase the efficiency of future electric vehicles, it is crucial to reduce drivetrain losses in battery-powered vehicles. This enables either an increase in driving range or overall cost savings by reducing battery capacity while maintaining the same range. Harmonic motor losses account for an avoidable share of more than 30% of the total eDrive losses in standard B6-2L 300 kW iPMSM configurations. These losses result from high-frequency voltage distortion across the motor windings, which can be reduced through various approaches. Of great importance is the classification of cost-neutral and low-cost concepts for loss reduction. The following presents and categorizes approaches to loss reduction that have been developed by research and industry in recent years. In particular, novel part-load-capable motor and inverter concepts are introduced, which enable motor switching or multilevel operation to reduce harmonic losses in the part-load range.</description>

      <title>Tri-Hybrid Beamforming for Radiation-Center Reconfigurable Antenna Array: Spectral Efficiency and Energy Efficiency</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.15924</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.15924v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we propose a tri-hybrid beamforming (THBF) architecture based on the radiation-center (RC) reconfigurable antenna array (RCRAA), including the digital beamforming, analog beamforming, and electromagnetic (EM) beamforming, where the EM beamformer design is modeled as RC selection. Aiming at spectral efficiency (SE) maximization subject to the hardware and power consumption constraints, we propose a tri-loop alternating optimization (TLAO) scheme for the THBF design, where the digital and analog beamformers are optimized based on the penalty dual decomposition in the inner and middle loops, and the RC selection is determined through the coordinate descent method in the outer loop. Aiming at energy-efficiency (EE) maximization, we develop a dual quadratic transform-based fractional programming (DQTFP) scheme, where the TLAO scheme is readily used for the THBF design. To reduce the computational complexity, we propose the Lagrange dual transform-based fractional programming (LDTFP) scheme, where each iteration has a closed-form solution. Simulation results demonstrate the great potential of the RCRAA in improving both SE and EE. Compared to the DQTFP scheme, the LDTFP scheme significantly reduces the computational complexity with only minor performance loss.</description>

      <title>Advancing rail safety: An onboard measurement system of rolling stock wheel flange wear based on dynamic machine learning algorithms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.15963</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.15963v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Rail and wheel interaction functionality is pivotal to the railway system safety, requiring accurate measurement systems for optimal safety monitoring operation. This paper introduces an innovative onboard measurement system for monitoring wheel flange wear depth, utilizing displacement and temperature sensors. Laboratory experiments are conducted to emulate wheel flange wear depth and surrounding temperature fluctuations in different periods of time. Employing collected data, the training of machine learning algorithms that are based on regression models, is dynamically automated. Further experimentation results, using standards procedures, validate the system's efficacy. To enhance accuracy, an infinite impulse response filter (IIR) that mitigates vehicle dynamics and sensor noise is designed. Filter parameters were computed based on specifications derived from a Fast Fourier Transform analysis of locomotive simulations and emulation experiments data. The results show that the dynamic machine learning algorithm effectively counter sensor nonlinear response to temperature effects, achieving an accuracy of 96.5 %, with a minimal runtime. The real-time noise reduction via IIR filter enhances the accuracy up to 98.2 %. Integrated with railway communication embedded systems such as Internet of Things devices, this advanced monitoring system offers unparalleled real-time insights into wheel flange wear and track irregular conditions that cause it, ensuring heightened safety and efficiency in railway systems operations.</description>

      <title>CoFE: A Framework Generating Counterfactual ECG for Explainable Cardiac AI-Diagnostics</title>

      <description>arXiv:2508.16033v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recognizing the need for explainable AI (XAI) approaches to enable the successful integration of AI-based ECG prediction models (AI-ECG) into clinical practice, we introduce a framework generating \textbf{Co}unter\textbf{F}actual \textbf{E}CGs (i,e., named CoFE) to illustrate how specific features, such as amplitudes and intervals, influence the model's predictive decisions. To demonstrate the applicability of the CoFE, we present two case studies: atrial fibrillation classification and potassium level regression models. The CoFE reveals feature changes in ECG signals that align with the established clinical knowledge. By clarifying both \textbf{where valid features appear} in the ECG and \textbf{how they influence the model's predictions}, we anticipate that our framework will enhance the interpretability of AI-ECG models and support more effective clinical decision-making.

      <title>Motor Imagery EEG Signal Classification Using Minimally Random Convolutional Kernel Transform and Hybrid Deep Learning</title>

      <description>arXiv:2508.16179v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The brain-computer interface (BCI) establishes a non-muscle channel that enables direct communication between the human body and an external device. Electroencephalography (EEG) is a popular non-invasive technique for recording brain signals. It is critical to process and comprehend the hidden patterns linked to a specific cognitive or motor task, for instance, measured through the motor imagery brain-computer interface (MI-BCI). A significant challenge is presented by classifying motor imagery-based electroencephalogram (MI-EEG) tasks, given that EEG signals exhibit nonstationarity, time-variance, and individual diversity. Obtaining good classification accuracy is also very difficult due to the growing number of classes and the natural variability among individuals. To overcome these issues, this paper proposes a novel method for classifying EEG motor imagery signals that extracts features efficiently with Minimally Random Convolutional Kernel Transform (MiniRocket), a linear classifier then uses the extracted features for activity recognition. Furthermore, a novel deep learning based on Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) and Long Short Term Memory (LSTM) architecture to serve as a baseline was proposed and demonstrated that classification via MiniRocket's features achieves higher performance than the best deep learning models at lower computational cost. The PhysioNet dataset was used to evaluate the performance of the proposed approaches. The proposed models achieved mean accuracy values of 98.63% and 98.06% for the MiniRocket and CNN-LSTM, respectively. The findings demonstrate that the proposed approach can significantly enhance motor imagery EEG accuracy and provide new insights into the feature extraction and classification of MI-EEG.</description>

      <title>A XAI-based Framework for Frequency Subband Characterization of Cough Spectrograms in Chronic Respiratory Disease</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.16237</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.16237v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper presents an explainable artificial intelligence (XAI)-based framework for the spectral analysis of cough sounds associated with chronic respiratory diseases, with a particular focus on Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD). A Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) is trained on time-frequency representations of cough signals, and occlusion maps are used to identify diagnostically relevant regions within the spectrograms. These highlighted areas are subsequently decomposed into five frequency subbands, enabling targeted spectral feature extraction and analysis. The results reveal that spectral patterns differ across subbands and disease groups, uncovering complementary and compensatory trends across the frequency spectrum. Noteworthy, the approach distinguishes COPD from other respiratory conditions, and chronic from non-chronic patient groups, based on interpretable spectral markers. These findings provide insight into the underlying pathophysiological characteristics of cough acoustics and demonstrate the value of frequency-resolved, XAI-enhanced analysis for biomedical signal interpretation and translational respiratory disease diagnostics.</description>

Abstract: This paper tackles the challenging problem of detecting methane plumes, a potent greenhouse gas, using Sentinel-2 imagery. This contributes to the mitigation of rapid climate change. We propose a novel deep learning solution based on U-Net with a ResNet34 encoder, integrating dual spectral enhancement techniques (Varon ratio and Sanchez regression) to optimise input features for heightened sensitivity. A key achievement is the ability to detect small plumes down to 400 m2 (i.e., for a single pixel at 20 m resolution), surpassing traditional methods limited to larger plumes. Experiments show our approach achieves a 78.39% F1-score on the validation set, demonstrating superior performance in sensitivity and precision over existing remote sensing techniques for automated methane monitoring, especially for small plumes.</description>

      <title>Causal Beam Selection for Reliable Initial Access in AI-driven Beam Management</title>

Abstract: Efficient and reliable beam alignment is a critical requirement for mmWave multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) systems, especially in 6G and beyond, where communication must be fast, adaptive, and resilient to real-world uncertainties. Existing deep learning (DL)-based beam alignment methods often neglect the underlying causal relationships between inputs and outputs, leading to limited interpretability, poor generalization, and unnecessary beam sweeping overhead. In this work, we propose a causally-aware DL framework that integrates causal discovery into beam management pipeline. Particularly, we propose a novel two-stage causal beam selection algorithm to identify a minimal set of relevant inputs for beam prediction. First, causal discovery learns a Bayesian graph capturing dependencies between received power inputs and the optimal beam. Then, this graph guides causal feature selection for the DL-based classifier. Simulation results reveal that the proposed causal beam selection matches the performance of conventional methods while drastically reducing input selection time by 94.4% and beam sweeping overhead by 59.4% by focusing only on causally relevant features.</description>

      <title>Terrain Classification for the Spot Quadrupedal Mobile Robot Using Only Proprioceptive Sensing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.16504</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.16504v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Quadrupedal mobile robots can traverse a wider range of terrain types than their wheeled counterparts but do not perform the same on all terrain types. These robots are prone to undesirable behaviours like sinking and slipping on challenging terrains. To combat this issue, we propose a terrain classifier that provides information on terrain type that can be used in robotic systems to create a traversability map to plan safer paths for the robot to navigate. The work presented here is a terrain classifier developed for a Boston Dynamics Spot robot. Spot provides over 100 measured proprioceptive signals describing the motions of the robot and its four legs (e.g., foot penetration, forces, joint angles, etc.). The developed terrain classifier combines dimensionality reduction techniques to extract relevant information from the signals and then applies a classification technique to differentiate terrain based on traversability. In representative field testing, the resulting terrain classifier was able to identify three different terrain types with an accuracy of approximately 97%</description>

      <title>TinyML Towards Industry 4.0: Resource-Efficient Process Monitoring of a Milling Machine</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.16553</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.16553v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In the context of industry 4.0, long-serving industrial machines can be retrofitted with process monitoring capabilities for future use in a smart factory. One possible approach is the deployment of wireless monitoring systems, which can benefit substantially from the TinyML paradigm. This work presents a complete TinyML flow from dataset generation, to machine learning model development, up to implementation and evaluation of a full preprocessing and classification pipeline on a microcontroller. After a short review on TinyML in industrial process monitoring, the creation of the novel MillingVibes dataset is described. The feasibility of a TinyML system for structure-integrated process quality monitoring could be shown by the development of an 8-bit-quantized convolutional neural network (CNN) model with 12.59kiB parameter storage. A test accuracy of 100.0% could be reached at 15.4ms inference time and 1.462mJ per quantized CNN inference on an ARM Cortex M4F microcontroller, serving as a reference for future TinyML process monitoring solutions.</description>

      <title>Adaptive Transmit Beamforming for DoA Estimation in Dynamic and Resource-Constrained DFRC Systems</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.16661v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Dual-function radar communication (DFRC) systems incorporate both radar and communication functions by sharing spectrum, hardware and radio frequency (RF) chains. Future technologies, such as 6G, are envisioned to support multiple communication platforms along with radar sensing, thus leading to competition for the available resources and variability in their allocation. If communication takes precedence over sensing, the RF chains and antennas allocated to sensing are less and potentially changing for every communication frame. Consequently, sensing over the entire field-of-view (FOV) within a frame with varying resources requires real-time adaptive beamforming strategy. Existing sensing techniques such as time-division multiplexing, sequential scan over the FOV and beam redesign using optimization approaches are impractical in such scenarios due to high latency and execution overheads. We propose a resource-aware technique for transmit analog beamformer design to sense the entire FOV within the communication frame. The proposed technique leverages time-sliced beam allocation along with adaptive windowing to result in a balanced cumulative array factor over the FOV thereby ensuring better direction-of-arrival (DoA) estimation reliability. Extensive simulation studies show that the proposed technique has consistent target detection and angle estimation performance in all directions and adapts to varying resource availability with time.</description>

      <title>QoS-Aware NOMA Design for Downlink Pinching-Antenna Systems</title>

Abstract: Pinching antennas, implemented by applying small dielectric particles on a waveguide, have emerged as a promising flexible-antenna technology ideal for next-generation wireless communications systems. Unlike conventional flexible-antenna systems, pinching antennas offer the advantage of creating line-of-sight links by enabling antennas to be activated on the waveguide at a location close to the user. This paper investigates a typical two-user non-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA) downlink scenario, where multiple pinching antennas are activated on a single dielectric waveguide to assist NOMA transmission. We formulate the problem of maximizing the data rate of one user subject to the quality-of-service requirement of the other user by jointly optimizing the antenna locations and power allocation coefficients. The formulated problem is nonconvex and difficult to solve due to the impact of antenna locations on large-scale path loss and two types of phase shifts, namely in-waveguide phase shifts and free space propagation phase shifts. To this end, we propose an iterative algorithm based on block coordinate descent and successive convex approximation techniques. Moreover, we consider the special case with a single pinching antenna, which is a simplified version of the multi-antenna case. Although the formulated problem is still nonconvex, by using the inherent features of the formulated problem, we derive the global optimal solution in closed-form, which offers important insights on the performance of pinching-antenna systems. Simulation results demonstrate that the pinching-antenna system significantly outperforms conventional fixed-position antenna systems, and the proposed algorithm achieves performance comparable to the computationally intensive exhaustive search based approach.</description>

      <title>Bayesian-Driven Graph Reasoning for Active Radio Map Construction</title>

      <description>arXiv:2508.09142v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: With the emergence of the low-altitude economy, radio maps have become essential for ensuring reliable wireless connectivity to aerial platforms. Autonomous aerial agents are commonly deployed for data collection using waypoint-based navigation; however, their limited battery capacity significantly constrains coverage and efficiency. To address this, we propose an uncertainty-aware radio map (URAM) reconstruction framework that explicitly leverages graph-based reasoning tailored for waypoint navigation. Our approach integrates two key deep learning components: (1) a Bayesian neural network that estimates spatial uncertainty in real time, and (2) an attention-based reinforcement learning policy that performs global reasoning over a probabilistic roadmap, using uncertainty estimates to plan informative and energy-efficient trajectories. This graph-based reasoning enables intelligent, non-myopic trajectory planning, guiding agents toward the most informative regions while satisfying safety constraints. Experimental results show that URAM improves reconstruction accuracy by up to 34% over existing baselines.</description>

      <title>Joint Optimization of Energy Consumption and Completion Time in Federated Learning</title>

      <description>arXiv:2209.14900v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Federated Learning (FL) is an intriguing distributed machine learning approach due to its privacy-preserving characteristics. To balance the trade-off between energy and execution latency, and thus accommodate different demands and application scenarios, we formulate an optimization problem to minimize a weighted sum of total energy consumption and completion time through two weight parameters. The optimization variables include bandwidth, transmission power and CPU frequency of each device in the FL system, where all devices are linked to a base station and train a global model collaboratively. Through decomposing the non-convex optimization problem into two subproblems, we devise a resource allocation algorithm to determine the bandwidth allocation, transmission power, and CPU frequency for each participating device. We further present the convergence analysis and computational complexity of the proposed algorithm. Numerical results show that our proposed algorithm not only has better performance at different weight parameters (i.e., different demands) but also outperforms the state of the art.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2501.08306v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Wireless communications rely on path loss modeling, which is most effective when it includes the physical details of the propagation environment. Acquiring this data has historically been challenging, but geographic information systems data is becoming increasingly available with higher resolution and accuracy. Access to such details enables propagation models to more accurately predict coverage and account for interference in wireless deployments. Machine learning-based modeling can significantly support this effort, with feature based approaches allowing for accurate, efficient, and scalable propagation modeling. Building on previous work, we introduce an extended set of features that improves prediction accuracy while, most importantly, proving model generalization through rigorous statistical assessment and the use of test set holdouts.</description>

      <title>Partially Decentralized Multi-Agent Q-Learning via Digital Cousins for Wireless Networks</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.05970v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Q-learning is a widely used reinforcement learning (RL) algorithm for optimizing wireless networks, but faces challenges with large state-spaces. Recently proposed multi-environment mixed Q-learning (MEMQ) algorithm addresses these challenges by employing multiple Q-learning algorithms across multiple synthetically generated, distinct but structurally related environments, so-called digital cousins. In this paper, we propose a novel multi-agent MEMQ (M-MEMQ) for cooperative decentralized wireless networks with multiple networked transmitters (TXs) and base stations (BSs). TXs do not have access to global information (joint state and actions). The new concept of coordinated and uncoordinated states is introduced. In uncoordinated states, TXs act independently to minimize their individual costs and update local Q-functions. In coordinated states, TXs use a Bayesian approach to estimate the joint state and update the joint Q-functions. The cost of information-sharing scales linearly with the number of TXs and is independent of the joint state-action space size. Several theoretical guarantees, including deterministic and probabilistic convergence, bounds on estimation error variance, and the probability of misdetecting the joint states, are given. Numerical simulations show that M-MEMQ outperforms several decentralized and centralized training with decentralized execution (CTDE) multi-agent RL algorithms by achieving 60% lower average policy error (APE), 40% faster convergence, 45% reduced runtime complexity, and 40% less sample complexity. Furthermore, M-MEMQ achieves comparable APE with significantly lower complexity than centralized methods. Simulations validate the theoretical analyses.</description>

      <title>Contrastive-KAN: A Semi-Supervised Intrusion Detection Framework for Cybersecurity with scarce Labeled Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.10808</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.10808v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In the era of the Fourth Industrial Revolution, cybersecurity and intrusion detection systems are vital for the secure and reliable operation of IoT and IIoT environments. A key challenge in this domain is the scarcity of labeled cyberattack data, as most industrial systems operate under normal conditions. This data imbalance, combined with the high cost of annotation, hinders the effective training of machine learning models. Moreover, the rapid detection of attacks is essential, especially in critical infrastructure, to prevent large-scale disruptions. To address these challenges, we propose a real-time intrusion detection system based on a semi-supervised contrastive learning framework using the Kolmogorov-Arnold Network (KAN). Our method leverages abundant unlabeled data to effectively distinguish between normal and attack behaviors. We validate our approach on three benchmark datasets, UNSW-NB15, BoT-IoT, and Gas Pipeline, using only 2.20%, 1.28%, and 8% of labeled samples, respectively, to simulate real-world conditions. Experimental results show that our method outperforms existing contrastive learning-based approaches. We further compare KAN with a traditional multilayer perceptron (MLP), demonstrating KAN's superior performance in both detection accuracy and robustness under limited supervision. KAN's ability to model complex relationships, along with its learnable activation functions, is also explored and visualized, offering interpretability and the potential for rule extraction. The method supports multi-class classification and proves effective in safety, critical environments where reliability is paramount.</description>
