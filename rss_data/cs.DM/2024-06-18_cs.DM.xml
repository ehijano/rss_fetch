      <title>On the maximal L1 influence of real-valued boolean functions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.10772</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.10772v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We show that any sequence of well-behaved (e.g. bounded and non-constant) real-valued functions of $n$ boolean variables $\{f_n\}$ admits a sequence of coordinates whose $L^1$ influence under the $p$-biased distribution, for any $p\in(0,1)$, is $\Omega(\text{var}(f_n) \frac{\ln n}{n})$.</description>

      <title>A comprehensive generalization of the Friendship Paradox to weights and attributes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.10423</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.10423v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Friendship Paradox is a simple and powerful statement about node degrees in a graph (Feld 1991). However, it only applies to undirected graphs with no edge weights, and the only node characteristic it concerns is degree. Since many social networks are more complex than that, it is useful to generalize this phenomenon, if possible, and a number of papers have proposed different generalizations. Here, we unify these generalizations in a common framework, retaining the focus on undirected graphs and allowing for weighted edges and for numeric node attributes other than degree to be considered, since this extension allows for a clean characterization and links to the original concepts most naturally. While the original Friendship Paradox and the Weighted Friendship Paradox hold for all graphs, considering non-degree attributes actually makes the extensions fail around 50% of the time, given random attribute assignment. We provide simple correlation-based rules to see whether an attribute-based version of the paradox holds. In addition to theory, our simulation and data results show how all the concepts can be applied to synthetic and real networks. Where applicable, we draw connections to prior work to make this an accessible and comprehensive paper that lets one understand the math behind the Friendship Paradox and its basic extensions.</description>

      <title>Optimizing alphabet reduction pairs of arrays</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.10930</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.10930v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In [1], we introduced a family of combinatorial designs, which we call "alphabet reduction pairs of arrays", ARPAs for short. These designs depend on three integer parameters $q, p \leq q, k\leq p$: $q$ is the size of the symbol set $\{0, 1 ,\ldots, q -1\}$ in which the coefficients of the arrays take their values; $p$ is the maximum number of distinct symbols allowed in a row of the second array of the pair; $k$ is the larger integer for which the two arrays of the pair coincide -- up to the order of their rows -- on any $k$-ary subset of their columns. The first array must contain at least one occurrence of the word $0\ 1\ \ldots\ q -1$. Intuitively, the idea is to cover "as many as possible" occurrences of this word of $q$ symbols with "as few as possible" words of at most $p$ different symbols.
  These designs are related to the approximability of "Constraint Satisfaction Problems with bounded constraint arity", known as $k\,$CSPs. In this context, we are particularly interested in ARPAs in which the frequency of the word $0\ 1\ \ldots\ q -1$ is maximal.
  We introduce a seemingly simpler family of combinatorial designs as "Cover pairs of arrays" (CPAs). The arrays of a CPA take Boolean coefficients, and must still coincide on any $k$-ary subset of their columns. The purpose is, as it were, to cover "as many as possible" occurrences of the word of $q$ ones using "as few as possible" $q$-length Boolean words of weight at most $p$. We show that, when it comes to maximizing the frequency of the words $0\ 1\ \ldots\ q -1$ in ARPAs and $1\ 1\ \ldots\ 1$ in CPAs, ARPAs and CPAs are equivalent. We prove the optimality of the ARPAs given in [1] for the case $p =k$. In addition, we provide optimal ARPAs for the cases $k =1$ and $k =2$. We emphasize the fact that both families of combinatorial designs are related to the approximability of $k\,$CSPs.</description>

      <title>Treewidth Inapproximability and Tight ETH Lower Bound</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.11628</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.11628v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a simple, self-contained, linear reduction from 3-SAT to Treewidth. Specifically, it shows that 1.00005-approximating Treewidth is NP-hard, and solving Treewidth exactly requires $2^{\Omega(n)}$ time, unless the Exponential-Time Hypothesis fails. We further derive, under the latter assumption, that there is some constant $\delta &gt; 1$ such that $\delta$-approximating Treewidth requires time $2^{n^{1-o(1)}}$.</description>

      <title>Variants of the Gy\`arf\`as-Sumner Conjecture: Oriented Trees and Rainbow Paths</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2111.13115</link>
      <description>arXiv:2111.13115v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Given a finite family $\mathcal{F}$ of graphs, we say that a graph $G$ is "$\mathcal{F}$-free" if $G$ does not contain any graph in $\mathcal{F}$ as a subgraph. A vertex-colored graph $H$ is called "rainbow" if no two vertices of $H$ have the same color. Given an integer $s$ and a finite family of graphs $\mathcal{F}$, let $\ell(s,\mathcal{F})$ denote the smallest integer such that any properly vertex-colored $\mathcal{F}$-free graph $G$ having $\chi(G)\geq\ell(s,\mathcal{F})$ contains an induced rainbow path on $s$ vertices. Scott and Seymour showed that $\ell(s,K)$ exists for every complete graph $K$. A conjecture of N. R. Aravind states that $\ell(s,C_3)=s$. The upper bound on $\ell(s,C_3)$ that can be obtained using the methods of Scott and Seymour setting $K=C_3$ are, however, super-exponential. Gy\'arf\'as and S\'ark\"ozy showed that $\ell(s,\{C_3,C_4\})=\mathcal{O}\big((2s)^{2s}\big)$. For $r\geq 2$, we show that $\ell(s,K_{2,r})\leq (r-1)(s-1)(s-2)/2+s$ and therefore, $\ell(s,C_4)\leq\frac{s^2-s+2}{2}$. This significantly improves Gy\'arf\'as and S\'ark\"ozy's bound and also covers a bigger class of graphs. We adapt our proof to achieve much stronger upper bounds for graphs of higher girth: we prove that $\ell(s,\{C_3,C_4,\ldots,C_{g-1}\})\leq s^{1+\frac{4}{g-4}}$, where $g\geq 5$. Moreover, in each case, our results imply the existence of at least $s!/2$ distinct induced rainbow paths on $s$ vertices. Along the way, we obtain some results on related problems on oriented graphs. For $r\geq 2$, let $\mathcal{B}_r$ denote the orientations of $K_{2,r}$ in which one vertex has out-degree or in-degree $r$. We show that every $\mathcal{B}_r$-free oriented graph $G$ having $\chi(G)\geq (r-1)(s-1)(s-2)+2s+1$ and every bikernel-perfect oriented graph $G$ with girth $g\geq 5$ having $\chi(G)\geq 2s^{1+\frac{4}{g-4}}$ contains every $s$ vertex oriented tree as an induced subgraph.</description>

      <title>Characterisation of the big Ramsey degrees of the generic partial order</title>

      <description>arXiv:2303.10088v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: As a result of 33 intercontinental Zoom calls, we characterise big Ramsey degrees of the generic partial order. This is an infinitary extension of the well known fact that finite partial orders endowed with linear extensions form a Ramsey class (this result was announced by Ne\v{s}et\v{r}il and R\"odl in 1984 with first published proof by Paoli, Trotter and Walker in 1985). Towards this, we refine earlier upper bounds obtained by Hubi\v{c}ka based on a new connection of big Ramsey degrees to the Carlson-Simpson theorem and we also introduce a new technique of giving lower bounds using an iterated application of the upper-bound theorem.</description>

      <title>Approximate Envy-Freeness in Graphical Cake Cutting</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.11659</link>
      <description>arXiv:2304.11659v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the problem of fairly allocating a divisible resource in the form of a graph, also known as graphical cake cutting. Unlike for the canonical interval cake, a connected envy-free allocation is not guaranteed to exist for a graphical cake. We focus on the existence and computation of connected allocations with low envy. For general graphs, we show that there is always a $1/2$-additive-envy-free allocation and, if the agents' valuations are identical, a $(2+\epsilon)$-multiplicative-envy-free allocation for any $\epsilon &gt; 0$. In the case of star graphs, we obtain a multiplicative factor of $3+\epsilon$ for arbitrary valuations and $2$ for identical valuations. We also derive guarantees when each agent can receive more than one connected piece. All of our results come with efficient algorithms for computing the respective allocations.</description>

      <title>A New and Faster Representation for Counting Integer Points in Parametric Polyhedra</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.13788</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.13788v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we consider the counting function $E_P(y) = |P_{y} \cap Z^{n_x}|$ for a parametric polyhedron $P_{y} = \{x \in R^{n_x} \colon A x \leq b + B y\}$, where $y \in R^{n_y}$. We give a new representation of $E_P(y)$, called a \emph{piece-wise step-polynomial with periodic coefficients}, which is a generalization of piece-wise step-polynomials and integer/rational Ehrhart's quasi-polynomials. It gives the fastest way to calculate $E_P(y)$ in certain scenarios. The most important cases are the following:
  1) We show that, for the parametric polyhedron $P_y$ defined by a standard-form system $A x = y,\, x \geq 0$ with a fixed number of equalities, the function $E_P(y)$ can be represented by a polynomial-time computable function. In turn, such a representation of $E_P(y)$ can be constructed by an $poly\bigl(n, \|A\|_{\infty}\bigr)$-time algorithm;
  2) Assuming again that the number of equalities is fixed, we show that integer/rational Ehrhart's quasi-polynomials of a polytope can be computed by FPT-algorithms, parameterized by sub-determinants of $A$ or its elements;
  3) Our representation of $E_P$ is more efficient than other known approaches, if $A$ has bounded elements, especially if it is sparse in addition.
  Additionally, we provide a discussion about possible applications in the area of compiler optimization. In some "natural" assumptions on a program code, our approach has the fastest complexity bounds.</description>

      <title>Automated Mathematical Discovery and Verification: Minimizing Pentagons in the Plane</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.03645</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.03645v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present a comprehensive demonstration of how automated reasoning can assist mathematical research, both in the discovery of conjectures and in their verification. Our focus is a discrete geometry problem: What is $\mu_{5}(n)$, the minimum number of convex pentagons induced by $n$ points in the plane? In the first stage toward tackling this problem, automated reasoning tools guide discovery and conjectures: we use SAT-based tools to find abstract configurations of points that would induce few pentagons. Afterward, we use Operations Research tools to find and visualize realizations of these configurations in the plane, if they exist. Mathematical thought and intuition are still vital parts of the process for turning the obtained visualizations into general constructions. A surprisingly simple upper bound follows from our constructions: $\mu_{5}(n) \leq \binom{\lfloor n/2 \rfloor}{5} + \binom{\lceil n/2 \rceil}{5}$, and we conjecture it is optimal. In the second stage, we turn our focus to verifying this conjecture. Using MaxSAT, we confirm that $\mu_5(n)$ matches the conjectured values for $n \leq 16$, thereby improving both the existing lower and upper bounds for $n \in [12, 16]$. Our MaxSAT results rely on two mathematical theorems with pen-and-paper proofs, highlighting once again the rich interplay between automated and traditional mathematics.</description>

      <title>Reward Generalization in RLHF: A Topological Perspective</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.10184</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.10184v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Existing alignment methods share a common topology of information flow, where reward information is collected from humans, modeled with preference learning, and used to tune language models. However, this shared topology has not been systematically characterized, nor have its alternatives been thoroughly explored, leaving the problems of low data efficiency and unreliable generalization unaddressed. As a solution, we introduce a theoretical framework for investigating reward generalization in reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF), focusing on the topology of information flow at both macro and micro levels. At the macro level, we portray the RLHF information flow as an autoencoding process over behavior distributions, formalizing the RLHF objective of distributional consistency between human preference and model behavior. At the micro level, we present induced Bayesian networks as a theory of reward generalization in RLHF, introducing fine-grained dataset topologies into generalization bounds. Combining analysis on both levels, we propose reward modeling from tree-structured preference information. It is shown to reduce reward uncertainty by up to $\Theta(\log n/\log\log n)$ times compared to baselines, where $n$ is the dataset size. Validation on three NLP tasks shows that our tree-based reward model achieves an average win rate of 65% against baseline methods, thus improving reward generalization for free via topology design.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.02369v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Using probabilistic methods, we obtain grid-drawings of graphs without crossings with low volume and small aspect ratio. We show that every $D$-degenerate graph on $n$ vertices can be drawn in $[m]^3$ where $m^3 = O(D^2 n\log n)$. In particular, every graph of bounded maximum degree can be drawn in a grid with volume $O(n \log n)$.</description>
