      <title>Thermodynamic uncertainty relations for three-terminal systems with broken time-reversal symmetry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.13851</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.13851v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the thermodynamic uncertainty relations (TURs) in steady-state transport for three-terminal systems within the linear response regime, specifically in the presence of broken time-reversal symmetry. To quantify the TUR, we introduce a dimensionless trade-off parameter $Q_J$, and derive new bounds of $Q_J$ for both particle and heat currents under a strong constraint on the Onsager coefficients. Furthermore, we determine a universal lower bound $Q_J^{bound}\geq1.5$ for three-terminal systems in the linear response regime when the time-reversal symmetry is broken.</description>

      <title>Autocatalysis due to combinatorial enhancement</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.13865</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.13865v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We demonstrate that autocatalytic reactions, where a product catalyzes its own formation, can be significantly accelerated when the product molecules are indistinguishable from each other. This ``combinatorial enhancement," analogous to the driving force of osmotic pressure, arises from the increased multiplicity of microscopic configurations. We quantify this effect with a free-energy gain, Fgain, and validate our theoretical predictions using molecular dynamics simulations. We also propose an experiment to directly test this phenomenon, potentially providing new insights into self-assembly, biomolecular binding, and other cooperative processes.</description>

      <title>Finite-time performance of a cyclic 2d quantum Ising heat engine</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.14089</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.14089v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We discuss the limit cycle regime of a finite-time quantum Otto cycle with a frictionless two-dimensional anisotropic Ising model as the working fluid. From Onsagers exact equilibrium solution, we first find optimal parameters for the operational modes of work extraction and cooling for infinitely slow cycles. The equilibrium points in these optimal cycles correspond to different phases of the model, such that the non-equilibrium dynamics during the cycle bypasses the phase transition. Finite-time cycles allow for finite power extraction or cooling currents, but for such cycles we point out that -- already within the regime of weak system-reservoir coupling -- energetic changes of the system during dissipative strokes may contain a significant portion of coupling and decoupling control work and should thus not be directly identified with heat. For ultrafast cycles, the required control work spoils performance, such that to maximize work extraction or cooling heat per cycle time, there is an optimal cycle duration. We also find that net zero-energy transitions may lead to undesired reservoir heating.</description>

      <title>Inverse thermodynamic uncertainty relation and entropy production</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.14204</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.14204v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Nonequilibrium current fluctuations represent one of the central topics in nonequilibrium physics. The thermodynamic uncertainty relation (TUR) is widely acclaimed for rigorously establishing a lower bound on current fluctuations, expressed in terms of the entropy production rate and the average current. In this study, we focus on an upper bound for the fluctuations, referred to as the inverse thermodynamic uncertainty relation (iTUR). We derive a universal iTUR expression in terms of the entropy production rate for continuous-variable systems governed by over-damped Langevin equations, as well as for discrete-variable systems described by Markov jump processes. The iTUR establishes a no-go theorem prohibiting perpetual superdiffusion in systems with a finite entropy production rate and a finite spectral gap. The divergence of the variance of any current becomes possible only when the spectral gap vanishes or the entropy production rate diverges. As a relevant experimental scenario, we apply the iTUR to the phenomenon of giant diffusion, emphasizing the pivotal roles of the spectral gap and entropy production.</description>

      <title>Localization and entanglement entropy in the Discrete Non-Linear Schr\"odinger Equation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.14364</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.14364v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work we perform an accurate numerical study of the very peculiar thermodynamic properties of the localized high-energy phase of the Discrete Non-Linear Schr\"odinger Equation (DNLSE). A numerical sampling of the microcanonical ensemble done by means of Hamiltonian dynamics reveals a new and subtle relation between the presence of the localized phase and a non-trivial behaviour of entanglement entropy. Our finding that the entanglement entropy grows as $S_{\text{ent}}(N) \sim \log(N)$ beautifully encodes the lack of additivity in the DNLSE non-thermal localized phase and reveals how a property so far believed peculiar of purely quantum systems may characterize even certain classical frameworks.</description>

      <title>Universal scaling in one-dimensional non-reciprocal matter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.14384</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.14384v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Unveiling universal non-equilibrium scaling laws has been a central theme in modern statistical physics, with recent attention increasingly directed toward nonequilibrium phases that exhibit rich dynamical phenomena. A striking example arises in nonreciprocal systems, where asymmetric interactions between components lead to inherently dynamic phases and unconventional criticality near a critical exceptional point (CEP), where the criticality arises from the coalescence of collective modes to the Nambu-Goldstone mode. However, the universal scaling behavior that should emerge in this system with full consideration of many-body effects and stochastic noise remains largely elusive. Here, we establish a dynamical scaling law in a generic one-dimensional stochastic nonreciprocal $O(2)$-symmetric system. Through large-scale simulations, we uncover a new nonequilibrium scaling in the vicinity of transition, distinct from any previously known equilibrium or nonequilibrium universality classes. In regimes where the system breaks into domains with opposite chirality, we demonstrate that fluctuations are strongly suppressed, leading to a logarithmic scaling as a function of system size $L$, in contrast to the conventional power-law scaling expected from dynamical scaling theory. This work elucidates the beyond-mean-field dynamics of non-reciprocal matter, thereby sheding light on the exploration of criticality in nonreciprocal phase transition across diverse physical contexts, from active matter and driven quantum systems to biological pattern formation and non-Hermitian physics.</description>

      <title>Inescapable anisotropy of non-reciprocal XY models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.14466</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.14466v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate non-reciprocal XY (NRXY) models defined on two-dimensional lattices in which the coupling strength of a spin with its neighbors varies with their position in the frame defined by the current spin orientation. As expected from the seminal work of Dadhichi et al., Phys. Rev. E 101, 052601 (2020), we first show that non-reciprocity is akin to a self-propulsion: we derive a mean-field continuous theory identical to that of constant-density flocks. Like the latter, NRXY models exhibit a long-range ordered phase that is metastable to the nucleation of topological defects, and their asymptotic state is a dynamic foam of asters. We then show that in the metastable ordered phase, the lattice always induces anisotropy on large scales, pinning the direction of order and imposing a finite correlation length. Crucially, we demonstrate that this anisotropy is inescapable since, even when not explicitly present in the model, it is generated by fluctuations. In short, the ordered phase of lattice NRXY models is that of active clock models.</description>

      <title>Stabilizer R\'enyi Entropy and Conformal Field Theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.13599</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.13599v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Understanding universal aspects of many-body systems is one of the central themes in modern physics. Recently, the stabilizer R\'{e}nyi entropy (SRE) has emerged as a computationally tractable measure of nonstabilizerness, a crucial resource for fault-tolerant universal quantum computation. While numerical results suggested that the SRE in critical states can exhibit universal behavior, its comprehensive theoretical understanding has remained elusive. In this work, we develop a field-theoretical framework for the SRE in a $(1+1)$-dimensional many-body system and elucidate its universal aspects using boundary conformal field theory. We demonstrate that the SRE is equivalent to a participation entropy in the Bell basis of a doubled Hilbert space, which can be calculated from the partition function of a replicated field theory with the interlayer line defect created by the Bell-state measurements. This identification allows us to characterize the universal contributions to the SRE on the basis of the data of conformal boundary conditions imposed on the replicated theory. We find that the SRE of the entire system contains a universal size-independent term determined by the noninteger ground-state degeneracy known as the g-factor. In contrast, we show that the mutual SRE exhibits the logarithmic scaling with a universal coefficient given by the scaling dimension of a boundary condition changing operator, which elucidates the origin of universality previously observed in numerical results. As a concrete demonstration, we present a detailed analysis of the Ising criticality, where we analytically derive the universal quantities at arbitrary R\'{e}nyi indices and numerically validate them with high accuracy by employing tensor network methods. These results establish a field-theoretical approach to understanding the universal features of nonstabilizerness in quantum many-body systems.</description>

      <title>Reshaping the Quantum Arrow of Time</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.13615</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.13615v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The microscopic laws of physics are symmetric under time reversal. Yet, most natural processes that we observe are not. The emergent asymmetry between typical and time-reversed processes is referred to as the arrow of time. In quantum physics, an arrow of time emerges when a sequence of measurements is performed on a system. We introduce quantum control tools that can yield dynamics more consistent with time flowing backward than forward. The control tools are based on the explicit construction of a Hamiltonian that can replicate the stochastic trajectories of a monitored quantum system. Such Hamiltonian can reverse the effect of monitoring and, via a feedback process, generate trajectories consistent with a reversed arrow of time. We show how to exploit the feedback process to design a continuous measurement engine that draws energy from the monitoring process, or to simulate the backward-in-time dynamics of an open quantum system.</description>

      <title>Dynamics of defects and interfaces for interacting quantum hard disks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.13664</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.13664v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Defects and interfaces are essential to understand the properties of matter. However, studying their dynamics in the quantum regime remains a challenge in particular concerning the regime of two spatial dimensions. Recently, it has been shown that a quantum counterpart of the hard-disk problem on a lattice yields defects and interfaces, which are stable just due to quantum effects while they delocalize and dissolve classically. Here, we study in more detail the properties of defects and interfaces in this quantum hard-disk problem with a particular emphasis on the stability of these quantum effects upon including perturbations. Specifically, we introduce short-range soft-core interactions between the hard disks. From both analytical arguments and numerical simulations we find that large classes of defects and interfaces remain stable even under such perturbations suggesting that the quantum nature of the dynamics exhibits a large range of robustness. Our findings demonstrate the stability and non-classical behavior of quantum interface dynamics, offering insights into the dynamics of two-dimensional quantum matter and establishing the quantum hard-disk model as a platform for studying unconventional constrained quantum dynamics.</description>

      <title>Macroscopic Particle Transport in Dissipative Long-Range Bosonic Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.13731</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.13731v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The inevitable loss of particles in quantum many-body systems provides a more general and experimentally realistic perspective on particle transport. In this work, we determine the maximal speed of macroscopic particle transport in dissipative bosonic systems featuring both long-range hopping and long-range interactions. By developing a generalized optimal transport theory for open quantum systems, we rigorously establish the relationship between the minimum transport time and the source-target distance, and investigate the maximal transportable distance of bosons. We demonstrate that optimal transport exhibits a fundamental distinction depending on whether the system experiences one-body loss or multi-body loss. Furthermore, we present the minimal transport time and the maximal transport distance for systems with both gain and loss. We observe that even an arbitrarily small gain rate enables transport over long distances if the lattice gas is dilute. Moreover, we generally reveal that the emergence of decoherence-free subspaces facilitates the long-distance and perfect transport process. We also derive an upper bound for the probability of transporting a given number of particles during a fixed period with one-body loss. Possible experimental protocols for observing our theoretical predictions are discussed.</description>

      <title>Carbonic anhydrase II simulated with a universal neural network potential</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.13789</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.13789v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The carbonic anhydrase II enzyme (CA II) is one of the most significant enzymes in nature, reversibly converting CO$_2$ to bicarbonate at a remarkable rate. The precise mechanism it uses to achieve this rapid turnover remains unclear due to our inability to directly observe or simulate the full process dynamically. Here, we use a recently developed universal neural network potential (Orb) to simulate the active site of CA II. We reproduce several known features of the reaction mechanism, including the proton relay that conducts protons out of the active site to the His64 residue. Additionally, we observe a new reaction pathway where CO$_2$ reacts with a water molecule in the active site, which donates a proton to the zinc-bound hydroxide. This differs from the established mechanism where CO$_2$ directly reacts with hydroxide. Existing experimental data and independent quantum chemistry calculations are used to support the plausibility of this new mechanism. This demonstrates the potential of Orb to efficiently generate novel insights into important molecular scale processes that can potentially be harnessed to improve CO$_2$ capture technologies and drug design.</description>

Abstract: Recently, Wang et al. [1] reported on an unusual violation of Wiedemann-Franz law in three semimetals. We compare their observations to our observations in a variety of systems, where the apparent WF law violations in the same temperature range arise as a consequence of electron-phonon decoupling. Given the empirical similarity of their data with these cases, the most plausible explanation for the reported violation is an experimental artefact.</description>

      <title>A Set of Tutorials for the LAMMPS Simulation Package</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.14020</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.14020v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The availability of open-source molecular simulation software packages allows scientists and engineers to focus on running and analyzing simulations without having to write, parallelize, and validate their own simulation software. While molecular simulations thus become accessible to a larger audience, the `black box' nature of such software packages and wide array of options and features can make it challenging to use them correctly, particularly for beginners in the topic of MD simulations. LAMMPS is one such versatile molecular simulation code, designed for modeling particle-based systems across a broad range of materials science and computational chemistry applications, including atomistic, coarse-grained, mesoscale, grid-free continuum, and discrete element models. LAMMPS is capable of efficiently running simulations of varying sizes from small desktop computers to large-scale supercomputing environments. Its flexibility and extensibility make it ideal for complex and extensive simulations of atomic and molecular systems, and beyond. This article introduces a suite of tutorials designed to make learning LAMMPS more accessible to new users. The first four tutorials cover the basics of running molecular simulations in LAMMPS with systems of varying complexities. The second four tutorials address more advanced molecular simulation techniques, specifically the use of a reactive force field, grand canonical Monte Carlo, enhanced sampling, and the REACTER protocol. In addition, we introduce LAMMPS-GUI, an enhanced cross-platform graphical text editor specifically designed for use with LAMMPS and able to run LAMMPS directly on the edited input. LAMMPS-GUI is used as the primary tool in the tutorials to edit inputs, run LAMMPS, extract data, and visualize the simulated systems.</description>

      <title>Beyond holography: the entropic quantum gravity foundations of image processing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.14048</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.14048v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recently, thanks to the development of artificial intelligence (AI) there is increasing scientific attention to establishing the connections between theoretical physics and AI. Traditionally, these connections have been focusing mostly on the relation between string theory and image processing and involve important theoretical paradigms such as holography. Recently G. Bianconi has proposed the entropic quantum gravity approach that proposes an action for gravity given by the quantum relative entropy between the metrics associated to a manifold. Here it is demonstrated that the famous Perona-Malik algorithm for image processing is the gradient flow of the entropic quantum gravity action. These results provide the geometrical and information theory foundations for the Perona-Malik algorithm and open new avenues for establishing fundamental relations between brain research, machine learning and entropic quantum gravity.</description>

      <title>Machine Learning-Integrated Modeling of Thermal Properties and Relaxation Dynamics in Metallic Glasses</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.14092</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.14092v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Metallic glasses are a promising class of materials celebrated for their exceptional thermal and mechanical properties. However, accurately predicting and understanding the melting temperature (T_m) and glass transition temperature (T_g) remains a significant challenge. In this study, we present a comprehensive approach that integrates machine learning (ML) models with theoretical methods to predict and analyze these key thermal properties in metallic glasses. Our ML models using distributional data derived from elemental composition-based features obtain high accuracy while minimizing data preprocessing complexity. Furthermore, we explore the correlation between T_m and T_g to elucidate their dependence on alloy composition and thermodynamic behavior. When the T_g value of metallic glasses is known, further analysis using the Elastically Collective Nonlinear Langevin Equation (ECNLE) theory provides a deeper understanding of structural relaxation dynamics. This integrated framework establishes a quantitative description consistent with experimental data and previous works and paves the way for the efficient design and discovery of advanced materials with tailored thermal properties.</description>

      <title>Quantum Strong-to-Weak Spontaneous Symmetry Breaking in Decohered Critical Spin Chain</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.14221</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.14221v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Symmetry breaking has been a central theme in classifying quantum phases and phase transitions. Recently, this concept has been extended to the mixed states of open systems, attracting considerable attention due to the emergence of novel physics beyond closed systems. In this Letter, we reveal a new type of phase transition in mixed states, termed \emph{quantum} strong-to-weak spontaneous symmetry breaking (SWSSB). Using a combination of field theory calculations and large-scale matrix product state simulations, we map out the global phase diagram of the XXZ critical spin chain under two-site XX decoherence, which features an SWSSB phase and a trivial Luttinger liquid phase, separated by a straight critical line that belongs to the boundary Berezinskii-Kosterlitz-Thouless universality class with a varying effective central charge. Remarkably, the SWSSB transition in our case is \emph{purely quantum} in the sense that it can only be driven by tuning the Hamiltonian parameter even under arbitrarily small decoherence strength, fundamentally distinguishing it from the decoherence-driven SWSSB transitions extensively discussed in previous literature. Conversely, no such phase transition occurs under ZZ decoherence. Finally, we also discuss the experimental relevance of our theory on quantum simulator platforms.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.14312v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We develop a general theory of frustration-free free-fermion systems and derive their necessary and sufficient conditions. Assuming locality and translation invariance, we find that the possible band touching between the valence bands and the conduction bands is always quadratic or softer, which rules out the possibility of describing Dirac and Weyl semimetals using frustration-free local Hamiltonians. We further construct a frustration-free free-fermion model on the honeycomb lattice and show that its density fluctuations acquire an anomalous gap originating from the diverging quantum metric associated with the quadratic band-touching points. Nevertheless, an $O(1/L^2)$ finite-size scaling of the charge-neutral excitation gap can be verified even in the presence of interactions, consistent with the more general results we derive in an accompany work [arXiv:2503.12879].</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.14370v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate an Otto thermodynamic cycle with a qubit Unruh-DeWitt detector as the working medium, coupled to a massless, conformally coupled scalar quantum field in the Hartle-Hawking vacuum in a (2+1)-dimensional BTZ black hole spacetime. We employ the thermal properties of the field to model heat and cold reservoirs between which the thermal machine operates. Treating the detector as an open quantum system, we employ a master equation to study its finite-time dynamics during each cycle stroke. We evaluate the output performance of the Otto heat engine and refrigerator by computing, respectively, the total work output and the cooling power for each of the Neumann, transparent, and Dirichlet boundary condition cases satisfied by the field at spatial infinity. Furthermore, we evaluate the optimal performance of the thermal machine by analyzing its efficiency at maximum power output and ecological impact. Our study presents a general framework for understanding the finite-time operation of relativistic quantum thermal machines, focusing on their energy optimization.</description>

      <title>Landscape Complexity for the Empirical Risk of Generalized Linear Models: Discrimination between Structured Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.14403</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.14403v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We use the Kac-Rice formula and results from random matrix theory to obtain the average number of critical points of a family of high-dimensional empirical loss functions, where the data are correlated $d$-dimensional Gaussian vectors, whose number has a fixed ratio with their dimension. The correlations are introduced to model the existence of structure in the data, as is common in current Machine-Learning systems. Under a technical hypothesis, our results are exact in the large-$d$ limit, and characterize the annealed landscape complexity, namely the logarithm of the expected number of critical points at a given value of the loss.
  We first address in detail the landscape of the loss function of a single perceptron and then generalize it to the case where two competing data sets with different covariance matrices are present, with the perceptron seeking to discriminate between them. The latter model can be applied to understand the interplay between adversity and non-trivial data structure. For completeness, we also treat the case of a loss function used in training Generalized Linear Models in the presence of correlated input data.</description>

      <title>Magnetotransport of tomographic electrons in a channel</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.14431v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Hydrodynamics is a new paradigm of electron transport in high-mobility devices, where frequent electron collisions give rise to a collective electron flow profile. However, conventional descriptions of these flows, which are based on the fluid equations for a classical gas extended to include impurity scattering, do not account for the distinct collisional relaxation in quantum-mechanical systems. In particular, by dint of Pauli blocking even modes of the distribution function relax over significantly shorter length scales than odd modes (dubbed the ``tomographic'' effect). We establish an analytical description of tomographic electron flow in a channel, and find four new distinguishing features: (i) Non-equilibrium effects from the boundaries penetrate significantly deeper into the flow domain; (ii) an additional velocity slip condition leads to a significant increase in the channel conductance; (iii) bulk rarefaction corrections decrease the curvature of the velocity profile in the channel center; and (iv) all these anomalous transport effects are rapidly suppressed with magnetic fields. The latter effect leads to a non-monotonic magneto-conductance, which can be used to measure both the even- and odd-mode mean free paths. Our asymptotic results unveil the underlying physics of tomographic flows and provide an alternative to numerical solutions of the Fermi-liquid equations.</description>

      <title>Tomographic electron flow in confined geometries: Beyond the dual-relaxation time approximation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.14461</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.14461v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Hydrodynamic-like electron flows are typically modeled using the Stokes-Ohm equation or a kinetic description that is based on a dual-relaxation time approximation. Such models assume a short intrinsic mean free path $\ell_e$ due to momentum-conserving electronic scattering and a large extrinsic mean free path $\ell_\text{MR}$ due to momentum-relaxing impurity scattering. This assumption, however, is overly simplistic and falls short at low temperatures, where it is known from exact diagonalization studies of the electronic collision integral that another large electronic mean free path $\ell_o$ emerges, which describes long-lived odd electron modes -- this is sometimes known as the tomographic effect. Here, using a matched asymptotic expansion of the Fermi liquid kinetic equation that includes different electron relaxation times, we derive a general asymptotic theory for tomographic flows in arbitrary smooth boundary geometries. Our key results are a set of governing equations for the electron density and electron current, their slip boundary conditions and boundary layer corrections near diffuse edges. We find that the tomographic effect strongly modifies previous hydrodynamic theories for electron flows: In particular, we find that (i) an equilibrium is established in the bulk, where the flow is governed by Stokes-Ohm like equations with significant finite-wavelength corrections, (ii) the velocity slip conditions for these equations are strongly modified from the widely-used hydrodynamic slip-length condition (iii) a large kinetic boundary layer arises near diffuse boundaries of width $\sim\sqrt{\ell_e \ell_o}$, and (iv) all these effects are strongly suppressed by an external magnetic field. We illustrate our findings for electron flow in a channel. The equations derived here represent the fundamental governing equations for tomographic electron flow in arbitrary smooth geometries.</description>

      <title>Non-Reciprocal Interactions Reshape Topological Defect Annihilation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2401.12637v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We show how non-reciprocal ferromagnetic interactions between neighbouring planar spins in two dimensions, affect the behaviour of topological defects. Non-reciprocity is introduced by weighting the coupling strength of the two-dimensional XY model by an anisotropic kernel. As a consequence, in addition to the topological charge $q$, the actual shape of the defects becomes crucial to faithfully describe their dynamics. Non-reciprocal coupling twists the spin field, selecting specific defect shapes, dramatically altering the pair annihilation process. Defect annihilation can either be enhanced or hindered, depending on the shape of the defects concerned and the degree of non-reciprocity in the system. We introduce a continuous description -- for which the phenomenological coefficients can be explicitly written in terms of the microscopic ones -- that captures the behaviour of the lattice model.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.01680v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The Onsager algebra, invented to solve the two-dimensional Ising model, can be used to construct conserved charges for a family of integrable $N$-state chiral clock models. We show how it naturally gives rise to a "pivot" procedure for this family of chiral Hamiltonians. These Hamiltonians have an anti-unitary CPT symmetry that when combined with the usual $\mathbb{Z}_N$ clock symmetry gives a non-abelian dihedral symmetry group $D_{2N}$. We show that this symmetry gives rise to symmetry-protected topological (SPT) order in this family for all even $N$, and representation-SPT (RSPT) physics for all odd $N$. The simplest such example is a next-nearest-neighbour chain generalising the spin-1/2 cluster model, an SPT phase of matter. We derive a matrix-product state representation of its fixed-point ground state along with the ensuing entanglement spectrum and symmetry fractionalisation. We analyse a rich phase diagram combining this model with the Onsager-integrable chiral Potts chain, and find trivial, symmetry-breaking and (R)SPT orders, as well as extended gapless regions. For odd $N$, the phase transitions are "unnecessarily" critical from the SPT point of view.</description>

      <title>Thermalization is typical in large classical and quantum harmonic systems</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.06489v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We establish an analytical criterion for dynamical thermalization within harmonic systems, applicable to both classical and quantum models. Specifically, we prove that thermalization of various observables, such as particle energies in physically relevant random quadratic Hamiltonians, is typical for large systems ($N \gg 1$) with initial conditions drawn from the microcanonical distribution. Moreover, we show that thermalization can also arise from non-typical initial conditions, where only a finite fraction of the normal modes is excited. A different choice of initial conditions, such as all the initial energy localized in a single particle, instead leads to energy equipartition without thermalization. Since the models we consider are integrable, our findings provide a general dynamical basis for an approach to thermalization that bypasses chaos and ergodicity, focusing instead on the physical requirement that thermodynamic observables depend on a large number of normal modes, and build a bridge between the classical and quantum theories of thermalization.</description>

Abstract: We present a quantum theory of Casimir forces between perfect electrical conductors, based on quantum electrodynamics and quantum statistical physics. This theory utilizes Kapusta's finite-temperature quantum field theory, combined with the Faddeev-Popov ghost formalism. This approach allows us to calculate Casimir forces at finite temperatures, providing both previously known and new physical insights from a unified perspective. Furthermore, our method enables us to compute the stress tensor associated with Casimir forces, in accordance with the Helmholtz free energy of an equilibrium quantum electromagnetic field. Using this methodology, we calculate the excess surface tension on the walls of slit-like pores due to the Casimir effect.</description>

      <title>Statistical Mechanics of Heteropolymers from Lattice Gauge Theory</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.11476v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Lattice models are valuable tools to gain insight into the statistical physics of heteropolymers. We rigorously map the partition function of these models into a vacuum expectation value of a $\mathbb{Z}_2$ lattice gauge theory (LGT), with both fermionic and bosonic degrees of freedom. Because the associated path integral expression is not affected by a sign problem, it is amenable to Monte Carlo (MC) sampling in both the sequence and structure space, unlike conventional polymer field theory. At the same time, since the LGT encoding relies on qubits, it provides a framework for future efforts to capitalize on the development of quantum computing hardware. We discuss two illustrative applications of our formalism: first, we use it to characterize the thermodynamically stable sequences and structures of small heteropolymers consisting of two types of residues. Next, we assess its efficiency to sample ensembles of compact structures, finding that the MC decorrelation time scales only linearly with the chain length.</description>

Abstract: Binding and unbinding of vortices drives Kosterlitz-Thouless phase transition in two-dimensional XY model. Here we investigate whether similar mechanism works in two-dimensional Heisenberg model, by using the fluctuation of skyrmion number inside a loop to characterize the nature of binding versus unbinding of defects. Through Monte Carlo simulations, we find that the fluctuation is proportional to the perimeter of the loop at low temperatures while it is proportional to the area of the loop at high temperatures, implying binding of the defects at low temperatures and unbinding at high temperatures.</description>

      <title>Critical relaxational dynamics at the continuous transitions of three-dimensional spin models with ${\mathbb Z}_2$ gauge symmetry</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.09575v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We characterize the dynamic universality classes of a relaxational dynamics under equilibrium conditions at the continuous transitions of three-dimensional (3D) spin systems with a ${\mathbb Z}_2$-gauge symmetry. In particular, we consider the pure lattice ${\mathbb Z}_2$-gauge model and the lattice ${\mathbb Z}_2$-gauge XY model, which present various types of transitions: topological transitions without a local order parameter and transitions characterized by both gauge-invariant and non-gauge-invariant XY order parameters. We consider a standard relaxational (locally reversible) Metropolis dynamics and determine the dynamic critical exponent $z$ that characterizes the critical slowing down of the dynamics as the continuous transition is approached. At the topological ${\mathbb Z}_2$-gauge transitions we find $z=2.55(6)$. Therefore, the dynamics is significantly slower than in Ising systems -- $z\approx 2.02$ for the 3D Ising universality class -- although 3D ${\mathbb Z}_2$-gauge systems and Ising systems have the same static critical behavior because of duality. As for the nontopological transitions in the 3D ${\mathbb Z}_2$-gauge XY model, we find that their critical dynamics belong to the same dynamic universality class as the relaxational dynamics in ungauged XY systems, independently of the gauge-invariant or nongauge-invariant nature of the order parameter at the transition.</description>

Abstract: The focus is on understanding the quantum thermodynamics of strongly coupled non-Markovian quantum systems. To this end, a non-trivial, non-Markovian model of a central spin surrounded by a spin bath is taken up, and its exact evolution is derived for arbitrary system-bath couplings. The fundamental quantum thermodynamic quantities, such as system and bath internal energies, work, heat, entropy production, and ergotropy, are calculated using the dynamics and original system (bath) Hamiltonian. An explicit expression for the work, a mismatch between the system and bath internal energies, is derived. The thermodynamic entropy of the system at thermal equilibrium is studied using the Hamiltonian of mean force in the strong coupling regime. The role of a canonical Hamiltonian in calculating the above thermodynamic quantities, a recently developed technique, is also investigated. Further, an interesting observation relevant to the spin bath acting as a charger is made in a scenario where the central spin is envisaged as a quantum battery.</description>

      <title>Spectral Density and Sum Rules for Second-Order Response Functions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.16144</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.16144v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Sum rules for linear response functions give powerful and experimentally-relevant relations between frequency moments of response functions and ground state properties. In particular, renewed interest has been drawn to optical conductivity and density-density sum rules and their connection to quantum geometry in topological materials. At the same time, recent work has also illustrated the connection between quantum geometry and second-order nonlinear response functions in quantum materials, motivating the search for exact sum rules for second-order response that can provide experimental probes and theoretical constraints for geometry and topology in these systems. Here we begin to address these questions by developing a general formalism for deriving sum rules for second-order response functions. Using generalized Kramers-Kronig relations, we show that the second-order Kubo formula can be expressed in terms of a spectral density that is a sum of Dirac delta functions in frequency. We show that moments of the spectral density can be expressed in terms of averages of equal-time commutators, yielding a family of generalized sum rules; furthermore, these sum rules constrain the large-frequency asymptotic behavior of the second harmonic generation rate. We apply our formalism to study generalized $f$-sum rules for the second-order density-density response function and the longitudinal nonlinear conductivity. We show that for noninteracting electrons in solids, the generalized $f$-sum rule can be written entirely in terms of matrix elements of the Bloch Hamiltonian. Finally, we derive a family of sum rules for rectification response, determining the large-frequency asymptotic behavior of the time-independent response to a harmonic perturbation.</description>

      <title>Ab initio machine learning simulation of calcium carbonate from aqueous solutions to the solid state</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.18562</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.18562v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A first principles machine learning model has been developed aimed at studying the formation of calcium carbonate from aqueous solution using molecular dynamics simulations. The model, dubbed SCAN-ML, reproduces accurately the potential energy surface derived from ab initio density-functional theory within the SCAN approximation for the exchange and correlation functional. A broad range of properties have been calculated relevant to ions in solution, solid phases, and the calcite/water interface. Careful comparison with results from experiments and semi-empirical force fields shows that SCAN-ML provides an excellent description of this system, surpassing state-of-the-art force fields for many properties, while providing a benchmark for many quantities that are currently beyond the reach of direct ab initio molecular dynamics. A key feature of SCAN-ML is its ability to capture chemical reactions, which reveals that calcium carbonate ion pair formation occurs predominantly via binding of calcium to bicarbonate, with the subsequent loss of a proton to water, rather than by direct association. Our model thus paves the way for the study of reactive crystallization pathways in calcium carbonate, which are currently poorly understood.</description>

      <title>Monte Carlo Simulation of Operator Dynamics and Entanglement in Dual-Unitary Circuits</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.00953</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.00953v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate operator dynamics and entanglement growth in dual-unitary circuits, a class of locally scrambled quantum systems that enables efficient simulation beyond the exponential complexity of the Hilbert space. By mapping the operator evolution to a classical Markov process,we perform Monte Carlo simulations to access the time evolution of local operator density and entanglement with polynomial computational cost. Our results reveal that the operator density converges exponentially to a steady-state value, with analytical bounds that match our simulations. Additionally, we observe a volume-law scaling of operator entanglement across different subregions,and identify a critical transition from maximal to sub-maximal entanglement growth, governed by the circuit's gate parameter. This transition, confirmed by both mean-field theory and Monte Carlo simulations, provides new insights into operator entanglement dynamics in quantum many-body systems. Our work offers a scalable computational framework for studying long-time operator evolution and entanglement, paving the way for deeper exploration of quantum information dynamics.</description>

      <title>Optimal Conversion from Classical to Quantum Randomness via Quantum Chaos</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.05181</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.05181v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Quantum many-body systems provide a unique platform for exploring the rich interplay between chaos, randomness, and complexity. In a recently proposed paradigm known as deep thermalization, random quantum states of system A are generated by performing projective measurements on system B following chaotic Hamiltonian evolution acting jointly on AB. In this scheme, the randomness of the projected state ensemble arises from the intrinsic randomness of the outcomes when B is measured. Here we propose a modified scheme, in which classical randomness injected during the protocol is converted by quantum chaos into quantum randomness of the resulting state ensemble. We show that for generic chaotic systems this conversion is optimal in that each bit of injected classical entropy generates as much additional quantum randomness as adding an extra qubit to B. This significantly enhances the randomness of the projected ensemble without imposing additional demands on the quantum hardware. Our scheme can be easily implemented on typical analog quantum simulators, providing a more scalable route for generating quantum randomness valuable for many applications. In particular, we demonstrate that the accuracy of a shadow tomography protocol can be substantially improved.</description>

      <title>The spectrum of perturbed (3, 10) minimal model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.18069</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.18069v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study RG flows between non-unitary minimal models and massive quantum theories using Truncated Conformal Space Approach (TCSA). We consider the integrable non-unitary Yang-Lee model perturbed by $i\phi$ and the $D$-series version of $M(3,10)$ which is a product of two Yang-Lee models, perturbing the latter by relevant operators $\phi_{1,3}$ and $i\phi^+_{1,5}$. Utilizing the quasi-primary fields we find, TCSA is performed up to the level $N=15$ for $M(2,5)+i\phi$. The conjecture about the $M(3,10)$ perturbed by $\phi_{1,3}$ is stated: this theory flows to a massive phase; its spectrum contains a kink and two breathers, whose masses we find. Our TCSA results support the conjecture.</description>

      <title>Geometric constructions of generalized dual-unitary circuits from biunitarity</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.07783v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present a general framework for constructing solvable lattice models of chaotic many-body quantum dynamics with multiple unitary directions using biunitary connections. We show that a network of biunitary connections on the Kagome lattice naturally defines a multi-unitary circuit, where three `arrows of time' directly reflect the lattice symmetry. These models unify various constructions of hierarchical dual-unitary and triunitary gates and present new families of models with solvable correlations and entanglement dynamics. Using multilayer constructions of biunitary connections, we additionally introduce multilayer circuits with monoclinic symmetry and higher level hierarchical dual-unitary solvability and discuss their (non-)ergodicity. Our work demonstrates how different classes of solvable models can be understood as arising from different geometric structures in spacetime.</description>

      <title>Devil's staircase inside shrimp-shaped regions reveals periodicity of plateau spikes and bursts</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.16373</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.16373v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Slow-fast dynamics are intrinsically related to complex phenomena and are responsible for many of the homeostatic dynamics that keep biological systems healthy functioning. We study a discrete-time membrane potential model that can generate a diverse set of spiking behavior depending on the choice of slow-fast time scales, from fast spiking to bursting, or plateau action potentials -- also known as cardiac spikes since they are characteristic in heart myocytes. The plateau of cardiac spikes can lose stability, generating early or delayed afterdepolarizations (EADs and DADs, respectively), both of which are related to cardiac arrhythmia. We show the periodicity changes along the transition from the healthy action potentials to these impaired oscillations. We show that while EADs are mainly periodic attractors, DADs usually come with chaos. EADs are found inside shrimp-shaped regions of the parameter space. However, in our system, multiple periodic attractors live within a shrimp-shaped region, giving it an internal structure made of infinite transitions between periodicities forming a complete devil's staircase. Understanding the periodicity of plateau attractors in slow-fast systems could be useful in unveiling the characteristics of heart myocyte behaviors that are linked to cardiac arrhythmias.</description>

      <title>Aging in coevolving voter models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.03597</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.03597v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Aging, understood as the tendency to remain in a given state the longer the persistence time in that state, plays a crucial role in the dynamics of complex systems. In this paper, we explore the influence of aging on coevolution models, that is, models in which the dynamics of the states of the nodes in a complex network is coupled to the dynamics of the structure of the network. In particular we consider the coevolving voter model, and we introduce two versions of this model that include aging effects: the Link Aging Model (LAM) and the Node Aging Model (NAM). In the LAM, aging is associated with the persistence time of a link in the evolving network, while in the NAM, aging is associated with the persistence time of a node in a given state. We show that aging significantly affects the absorbing phase transition of the coevolution voter model, shifting the transition point in opposite directions for the LAM and NAM. We also show that the generic absorbing phase transition can disappear due to aging effects.</description>

      <title>Superdiffusion, normal diffusion and chaos in semiclassical Bose-Hubbard chains</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.19584</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.19584v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the evolution of two-point correlation functions of one-dimensional Bose-Hubbard model in the semiclassical regime in the framework of Truncated Wigner Approximation (TWA) with quantum jumps as first-order corrections. At early times, the correlation functions show strong superdiffusion with universal integer exponents determined solely by the initial conditions and completely insensitive to system parameters and chaos. Only after a long time this regime crosses over to normal diffusion regime which is most robust when nonintegrability is strong. For strong nonintegrability, the system ends up in a homogeneous state while for weak nonintegrability the oscillations and inhomogeneities persist, despite the fact that chaos is nearly always strong and only weakly depends on nonintegrability parameter. We conclude that the superidiffusive regime is neither prethermalized nor a precursor to thermalization but a novel early-time phenomenon related to a special scaling symmetry of the Bose-Hubbard Hamiltonian.</description>

      <title>Probing non-equilibrium steady states of the Klein-Gordon field with Unruh-DeWitt detectors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.20328</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.20328v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We calculate the transition rate of an Unruh-DeWitt detector coupled to a non-equilibrium steady state (NESS) of a free massless scalar field on four-dimensional Minkowski spacetime. The NESS arises from bringing two semi-infinite heat baths into thermal contact along a hypersurface. The detector couples linearly to the field by a monopole interaction, and it moves inertially along the axis of the NESS heat flow. We contrast the resulting transition rates with the case of a detector that is coupled to an inertial thermal equilibrium state. The results illustrate that the monopole does not properly couple to the heat flow, resulting in the detector to merely register kinematical effects. Hence dynamical features of the NESS are hidden from this detector model.</description>
