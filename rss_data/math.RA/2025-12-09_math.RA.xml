      <title>Classification of Associative Algebras Satisfying Quadratic Polynomial Identities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.06125</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.06125v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In quantum mechanics, associative algebras play an important role in understanding symmetries and operator algebras, providing new algebraic frameworks for describing physical systems. This work classifies associative algebras over a field K that are generated by a finite set G and satisfy a polynomial identity of the form X^{2} = aX+b, where a and b are elements of K and X varies either over all elements of the algebra or over all elements of the multiplicative semigroup S generated by G. One of the results obtained in this work shows that algebras satisfying X^{2}=0 over fields of characteristics different from 2 are nilpotent of index 3.
  The results were computationally validated using the GAP system.</description>

      <title>Group graded algebras and varieties with quadratic codimension growth</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.06153</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.06153v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $A$ be an associative algebra graded by a finite group $G$ over a field ${F}$ of characteristic zero. One associates to $A$ the sequence of $G$-graded codimensions $c_n^G(A)$, $n=1,2,\ldots$, which measures the growth of the polynomial identities satisfied by $A$. It is known that this sequence is either polynomially bounded or grows exponentially. In this paper, we study unitary $G$-graded varieties of polynomial codimension growth. In particular, we classify the varieties generated by unitary algebras with quadratic codimension growth and show that these varieties can be described as a direct sums of algebras that generate minimal $G$-graded varieties.</description>

      <title>Minimal varieties of algebras with graded involution and quadratic growth</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.06160</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.06160v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Subalgebras of upper triangular matrix algebras have played a fundamental role in the classification of minimal varieties of polynomial growth. Such classification has become a source of study in recent years since it leads to the more general classification of varieties of polynomial growth $n^k$, as has already been proven in many contexts for several values of $k$. In this paper, we study the asymptotic behavior of the sequence of codimensions of algebras graded by a finite group $G$ and endowed with a graded involution $*$, also called $(G,*)$-algebras. We classify the minimal varieties generated by a finite-dimensional $(G,*)$-algebra with quadratic growth.</description>

      <title>On the colength sequence of algebras with graded involution</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.06164</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.06164v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In recent years, many results have been established regarding classifications of varieties whose colength sequences are bounded by a fixed constant. In this work, we explore this theme in the setting of algebras endowed with a graded involution, called $(G,*)$-algebras. We give an explicit description of the decomposition of the $\langle n \rangle$-cocharacter for some important $(G,*)$-algebras $A$, for every $\langle n \rangle=(n_1, \ldots, n_{2t})$. For each algebra $A$, the $n$th colength is defined as the number of irreducible components that appear in these decompositions. Our aim is to classify varieties whose $n$th colengths are bounded by a fixed constant.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2512.06340v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We suggest a definition of the twisted affine Yangian $TY_{\hbar,\varepsilon}(\widehat{\mathfrak{so}}(2n))$. We show that $TY_{\hbar,\varepsilon}(\widehat{\mathfrak{so}}(2n))$ coincides with the universal enveloping algebra of a subalgebra of the universal central extension of $\mathfrak{sl}(2n)[u^{\pm1},v]$ when we set two parameters $\hbar=\varepsilon=0$. We also construct a homomorphism from $TY_{\hbar,\varepsilon}(\widehat{\mathfrak{so}}(8))$ to the universal enveloping algebra of the rectangular $W$-algebra $\mathcal{W}^k(\mathfrak{sp}(16),(2^8))$.</description>

      <title>Weyl-Type Algebras over Exponential-Polynomial Rings: Structure, Representations, and Deformations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.06479</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.06479v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper introduces and studies a class of Weyl-type algebras \(A_{p,t,\cA} = \Weyl{e^{\pm x^{p} e^{t x}},\; e^{\cA x},\; x^{\cA}}\) constructed over exponential-polynomial rings, where \(\FF\) is a field of characteristic zero, \(\cA\) is a finitely generated additive subgroup of \(\FF\), and \(p \in \mathbb{N}^n\), \(t \in \FF\). We investigate their structural properties, proving simplicity, establishing faithful infinite-dimensional irreducible representations, and demonstrating the failure of the Noetherian property. A natural filtration by exponential order is introduced, with the associated graded algebra shown to be commutative. We also examine the corresponding Witt-type Lie algebra \(\mathfrak{g}_{p,t,\cA} = \Der_{\mathrm{gr}}(R_{p,t,\cA})\) and prove the vanishing of its second cohomology group with adjoint coefficients, implying rigidity under formal deformations. Furthermore, we construct explicit deformation quantizations of the underlying exponential-polynomial rings, compute Hochschild and cyclic homology groups, and relate them to the topology of the parameter space. The deformation rigidity of \(A_{p,t,\cA}\) is classified in terms of the rank of \(\cA\), and a Gerstenhaber algebra structure on the Hochschild cohomology is described. Several open problems concerning representation classification and geometric realization are proposed.</description>

      <title>Structure and Invariants of Weyl-Type Algebras with Exponential Generators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.06491</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.06491v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper introduces and systematically studies a class of Weyl-type algebras enriched with exponential and power generators over a field of characteristic zero, defined as $A_{p,t,\cA} = \Weyl{e^{\pm x^{p} e^{t}},\; e^{\cA x},\; x^{\cA}}$ in the associative setting and $\Nass{e^{\pm x^{p} e^{t}},\; e^{\cA x},\; x^{\cA}}$ in a non-associative framework. We establish fundamental structural properties, including the triviality of the center for the non-associative version and the explicit description $Z(A_{p,t,\cA}) = \FF[e^{\pm x^{p} e^{t}}]$ for the associative one, proving that $A_{p,t,\cA}$ is an Azumaya algebra over its center and represents a nontrivial class in the Brauer group $\Br(\FF(y))$. Furthermore, we compute the Gelfand--Kirillov dimension for relevant examples and demonstrate its key properties, such as additivity under tensor products and the growth dichotomy. We completely characterize the automorphism group of $A_{p,t,\cA}$ as a semidirect product of a torus with a discrete group, and provide a sharp isomorphism criterion showing that the parameter $t$ is a complete invariant in the family. The paper concludes with two open problems concerning the GK dimension of non-associative exponential algebras and the classification of their deformations, pointing toward future research directions in non-associative growth theory and deformation rigidity.</description>

      <title>Structural and Classification Theorems for Weyl-Type Algebras over Expolynomial Rings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.06497</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.06497v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper introduces and systematically studies Weyl-type, Witt-type, and non-associative algebras defined over expolynomial rings -- commutative rings generated by exponential functions $e^{\alpha x}$, exponentials of exponentials $e^{\pm x^p e^{t}}$, and power functions $x^{\alpha}$ for $\alpha$ in an additive subgroup $\cA$ of a characteristic zero field $\FF$. We establish several fundamental structural results: scalar extensions preserve both the algebraic structure and simplicity; intermediate subalgebras associated with subgroups $\ZZ \subseteq \cB \subseteq \cA$ remain simple; the algebra of graded derivations is isomorphic to a semidirect product $\Weyl{e^{\pm x^p e^{t}},\; e^{\cA x},\; x^{\cA}} \rtimes \FF^n$; tensor products over disjoint variable sets decompose naturally into larger algebras; and a complete isomorphism criterion is given, showing that isomorphism depends precisely on the orbit of the parameter $p$ under the automorphism group of $\cA$ and the equality of the deformation parameter $t$. These theorems generalize classical results on Weyl and Witt algebras, provide new families of simple algebras, and offer a foundation for further research in deformation theory, representation theory, and cohomology.</description>

      <title>Related Hom-rhizaform algebras and Rota-Baxter Operators, Hom-Rhizaform Family Algebras</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.06798</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.06798v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper explores the link between Hom-rhizaform algebras and Rota-Baxter operators. We define a new structure, the Hom-rhizaform family algebra, which is a more general version of the Hom-rhizaform algebra. The main finding is that Rota-Baxter operators can be used to construct new Hom-rhizaform algebras. This work expands the theory of Hom-algebras by showing a new way to apply Rota-Baxter operators. Finally, we establish the classification of these algebras as well as their corresponding cocycle cones.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2512.07087v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We report on the Equational Theories Project (ETP), an online collaborative pilot project to explore new ways to collaborate in mathematics with machine assistance. The project successfully determined all 22 028 942 edges of the implication graph between the 4694 simplest equational laws on magmas, by a combination of human-generated and automated proofs, all validated by the formal proof assistant language Lean. As a result of this project, several new constructions of magmas satisfying specific laws were discovered, and several auxiliary questions were also addressed, such as the effect of restricting attention to finite magmas.</description>

      <title>Automorphisms of Sedenions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.07210</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.07210v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper extends the seven-dimensional Fano plane to a 15-dimensional Fano volume, which is related to sedenions. The Fano plane visualises the octonions and their structure as seven quaternions and is derived from a calibration in differential geometry. Clifford algebra allows the Spin and Pin groups to fully analyse calibrations and a new calibration is created that derives the Fano volume, which provides a visualisation of the complete subalgebra structure of sedenions.
  This new 15-dimensional calibration, along with the existing one containing 35 quaternions, enables an explicit derivation of the automorphisms of sedenions matching Schafer's result and hence addresses a discrepancy in the literature. Also, Gresnigt has suggested extending Furey's work on quark and lepton families using octonions to three octonion subalgebras of sedenions. The Fano volume allows this process to avoid the power-associative subalgebras of sedenions. It is conjectured that Fano hyper-volumes will uncover the complete subalgebra structure of all Cayley-Dickson algebras.</description>

      <title>A Closed-form Solution to the Wahba Problem for Pairwise Similar Quaternions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.07597</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.07597v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a closed-form solution to Wahba's problem in the quaternion domain for the special case of two vector observations. Existing approaches, including Davenport's $q$-method, QUEST, Horn's method, and ESOQ algorithms, recover the optimal quaternion through the eigendecomposition of a $4\times4$ matrix or iterative numerical methods. Consequently, these methods do not reveal the analytic structure of the optimal quaternion.
  In this work, we derive an explicit analytical characterization of all quaternions that yield zero Wahba cost for the case $\ell=2$. Our approach builds on a connection between quaternion similarity, the singular Sylvester equation $aq=qb$, and quaternion square roots established in our previous work [1]. We provide (i) necessary and sufficient conditions under which the Wahba's cost function is zero and (ii) a closed-form parameterization of all such quaternions. This eliminates the need for eigenvalue computations and enables a direct algebraic understanding of the underlying geometry of Wahba's problem.</description>

      <title>Groupoid graded rings and their categories of graded modules</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.07722</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.07722v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $G$ be a groupoid acting on a set $X$ and let $R$ be a $G$-graded ring with graded local units. We study the main properties of the category $gr-(R,G,X)$ of $X$-graded $R$-modules and adjoint functors between categories of this kind. We characterize the latter in terms of tensor-like and hom-like functors. As an application we obtain a characterization of equivalences between such categories in the spirit of Morita theory. Then we introduce restriction and induction functors between categories of type $gr-(R,G,X)$ and show that many functors between such categories can be realized naturally as a restriction or induction functor. This includes the forgetful functor, the functor associating a $G$ graded $R$-module with the $H$-graded module formed by the sum of the homogeneous components of degree in subgroupoid $H$, and the one associating it with the collapsing of homogeneous components in cosets modulo $H$ for $H$ a wide subgrupoid. We characterize when a restriction or induction functor is an equivalence of categories. Finally, we prove that $gr-(R,G,X)$ is always equivalent to the category of modules over a ring with local units and, generalizing a result of Menini and N\u{a}st\u{a}sescu, we characterize when $gr-(R,G,X)$ is equivalent to the category of modules over a unital ring.</description>

KyFrog uses a larger dimension ($n = 1024$) and a small prime modulus $q = 1103$, together with narrow error distributions with standard deviations $\sigma_s = \sigma_e = 1.4$, to target approximately $2^{325}$ classical and quantum security against state-of-the-art lattice attacks under standard cost models, as estimated using the Lattice Estimator. The price paid for this security margin is an extremely large KEM ciphertext (about 0.5 MiB), while public and secret keys remain in the same ballpark as ML-KEM. We describe the design rationale, parameter search methodology, and implementation details of KyFrog, and we compare its asymptotic security and concrete parameter sizes with the ML-KEM standard. All code and data for this work are released as free and open-source software, with the full C++23 implementation and experimental scripts available at: https://github.com/victormeloasm/kyfrog</description>

      <title>Generalized Connes-Kreimer Hopf algebras on decorated rooted forests by weighted cocycles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.06538</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.06538v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Connes-Kreimer Hopf algebra of rooted trees is an operated Hopf algebra whose coproduct satisfies the classical Hochschild 1-cocycle condition. In this paper, we extend the setting from rooted trees to the space $H_{\rm RT}(X,\Omega)$ of $(X,\Omega)$-rooted trees, in which internal vertices are decorated by a set $\Omega$ and leafs are decorated by $X \cup \Omega$. We introduce a new coalgebra structure on $H_{\rm RT}(X,\Omega)$ whose coproduct satisfies a weighted Hochschild 1-cocycle condition involving multiple operators, thereby generalizing the classical condition. A combinatorial interpretation of this coproduct is also provided. We then endow $H_{\rm RT}(X,\Omega)$ with a Hopf algebra structure. Finally, we define weighted $\Omega$-cocycle Hopf algebras, characterized by a Hochschild 1-cocycle condition with weights, and show that $H_{\rm RT}(X,\Omega)$ is the free object in the category of $\Omega$-cocycle Hopf algebras.</description>

      <title>On Poisson superalgebras in characteristic 2</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.06680</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.06680v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper is devoted to the study of Poisson superalgebras over fields of characteristic $2$. We investigate their representations, semidirect products, cohomology, formal deformations, and universal enveloping algebras. We also introduce Lie-Rinehart superalgebras in characteristic $2$ and clarify their connections with Poisson superalgebras. In particular, we show that the universal enveloping algebra of a Poisson superalgebra coincides with the universal enveloping algebra of an associated Lie-Rinehart superalgebra. We also compute examples and initiate the study of pre-Poisson superalgebras.</description>

      <title>Circular Chromatic Numbers, Balanceability, Relation Algebras, and Network Satisfaction Problems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.06878</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.06878v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we characterize graphs with circular chromatic number less than 3 in terms of certain balancing labellings studied in the context of signed graphs. In fact, we construct a signed graph which is universal for all such labellings of graphs with circular chromatic number less than $3$, and is closely related to the generic circular triangle-free graph studied by Bodirsky and Guzm\'an-Pro. Moreover, our universal structure gives rise to a representation of the relation algebra $56_{65}$. We then use this representation to show that the network satisfaction problem described by this relation algebra belongs to NP. This concludes the full classification of the existence of a universal square representation, as well as the complexity of the corresponding network satisfaction problem, for relation algebras with at most four atoms.</description>

      <title>Dualities of dihedral and generalised quaternion codes and applications to quantum codes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.07354</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.07354v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Let $\mathbb{F}_q$ be a finite field of $q$ elements, for some prime power $q$, and let $G$ be a finite group. A (left) group code, or simply a $G$-code, is a (left) ideal of the group algebra $\mathbb{F}_q[G]$. In this paper, we provide a complete algebraic description for the hermitian dual code of any $D_n$-code over $\mathbb{F}_{q^2}$, where $D_n$ is a dihedral group of order $2n$ with $\gcd(q,n)=1$, through a suitable Wedderburn-Artin's decomposition of the group algebra $\mathbb{F}_{q^2}[D_n]$, and we determine all distinct hermitian self-orthogonal $D_n$-codes over $\mathbb{F}_{q^2}$. We also present a thorough representation of the euclidean dual code of any $Q_n$-code over $\mathbb{F}_q$, where $Q_n$ is a generalised quaternion group of order $4n$ with $\gcd(q,4n)=1$, via the Wedderburn-Artin's decomposition of the group algebra $\mathbb{F}_q[Q_n]$. In particular, since the semisimple group algebras $\mathbb{F}_{q^2}[Q_n]$ and $\mathbb{F}_{q^2}[D_{2n}]$ are isomorphic, then the hermitian dual code of any $Q_n$-code has also been fully described. As application of the hermitian dualities computed, we give a systematic construction, via the structure of the group algebra, to obtain quantum error-correcting codes, and in fact we rebuild some already known optimal quantum codes with this methodical approach.</description>

      <title>Left symmetric algebras from DNA insertion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/1605.03837</link>
      <description>arXiv:1605.03837v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: DNA recombination is a fundamental biological process that encodes genetic information for organism development and function. In this study, we construct the left symmetric algebras arising from the operation of DNA insertion. We define a new operation of insertion by modifying the simplified insertion $$x\Rightarrow y:=f(\mid x\mid,\ \mid y \mid)\sum\limits_{i=0}^{q} y_{1}y_{2}\cdots y_{i} x y_{i+1}\cdots y_{q},$$ where $x = x_{1}x_{2}\cdots x_{p}$, $y = y_{1}y_{2}\cdots y_{q}$, and $\mid x\mid, \mid y\mid$ denote the lengths of $x$ and $y$, respectively. We prove that the algebra $\mathbb{F}(R)$ (over a field $\mathbb{F}$ of characteristic $0$, with $R$ being an infinite free semigroup generated by DNA nucleotides $\{A, G, C, T\}$) forms a left symmetric algebra if and only if the function $f$ satisfies the condition $$f(m, n) f(m+n, p)=f(n, p) f(m, n+p)= f(m, p) f(n, m+p),$$ where $m, n, p\in \mathbb{N}$. A key example of such a function is $f(m, n)=\exp\{g(m, n)\}$, where $g(m, n)=k\cdot mn,$ and $k$ is a fixed positive number, which effectively models length-dependent DNA insertion dynamics. This work enriches the theory of non-associative algebras and provides a mathematical framework for quantitative analysis of DNA recombination processes.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.12410v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Tight and essentially tight modules generalize weakly injective modules. Essential tightness requires embeddings to be essential. This restriction makes the two notions totally different. In this note, we investigate cases when those two notions are the same. Moreover, we look at the cases when essentiallity is imposed only on one of the embeddings rather than both. This allows defining a special class of tight and essentially tight modules and a generalization of both.</description>

      <title>Generalized Homogeneous Derivations on Graded Rings</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.17187v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We introduce a notion of generalized homogeneous derivations on graded rings as a natural extension of the homogeneous derivations defined by Kanunnikov. We then define gr-generalized derivations, which preserve the degrees of homogeneous components. Several significant results originally established for prime rings are extended to the setting of gr-prime rings, and we characterize conditions under which gr-semiprime rings contain nontrivial central graded ideals. In addition, we investigate the algebraic and module-theoretic structures of these maps, establish their functorial properties, and develop categorical frameworks that describe their derivation structures in both ring and module contexts.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2507.07627v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate restricted Lie algebras arising as analogues of (twisted) right-angled Artin groups and right-angled Coxeter groups over fields of characteristic two. These algebras are defined via quadratic relations determined by decorated graphs. We compute their cohomology rings with trivial coefficients and uncover phenomena specific to characteristic two: unlike in zero/odd characteristics, where quadratically defined ordinary and restricted Lie algebras have equivalent cohomology theories, the characteristic two case exhibits dependence on the base field. In particular, we prove that the ground field being the prime field $\mathbb F_2$ characterizes when a Lie-theoretic analogue of the twisted Droms theorem holds. Generalizations of graph Lie algebras are also discussed.</description>

Abstract: We introduce a new point of view to present classical notions related to set-theoretic solutions of the Yang-Baxter equation: left skew braces, dirings, left skew rings. The idea is to replace the single multiplication on a left near-ring by two operations, one associative and the other left distributive. Two algebraic structures naturally appear: left skew rings and left weak rings, whose categories turn out to be canonically isomorphic.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2511.18073v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We examine the Hochschild cohomology for triangular algebras that capture some aspects of geometry and topology of the torus and of the quadric surface, and for deformations of these algebras. In particular, this shows that the cup product on the Hochschild cohomology of a triangular algebra does not generally follow the intuition coming from monomial algebras. Our examples also demonstrate that the Hochschild cohomology of a deformation of an algebra may not experience the dimension drop but still have a different cup product structure, and that the Hochschild cohomologies of deformations of two derived equivalent algebras may exhibit noticeably different behaviours.</description>

Abstract: Let $\phi\colon A\rightarrow B$ be an algebra extension. We prove that if $\phi$ is split, the derived-discreteness of $A$ implies the derived-discreteness of $B$; if $\phi$ is separable and the right $A$-module $B$ is projective, the converse holds. We prove an analogous statement for piecewise hereditary algebras.</description>

      <title>Infinitesimal $\mathcal{R}$-matrices for some families of Hopf algebras</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.02350v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Given a bialgebra $H$ such that the associated trivial topological bialgebra $H[[\hbar]]$ admits a quasitriangular structure $\tilde{\mathcal{R}}=\mathcal{R}(1\otimes 1+\hbar\chi+\mathcal{O}(\hbar^2))$, one gets a distinguished element $\chi \in H \otimes H$ which is an infinitesimal $\mathcal{R}$-matrix, according to the definition given in [1]. In this paper we classify infinitesimal $\mathcal{R}$-matrices for some families of well-known Hopf algebras, among which are the generalized Kac-Paljutkin Hopf algebras $H_{2n^2}$, the Radford Hopf algebras $H_{(r,n,q)}$, and the Hopf algebras $E(n)$.</description>
