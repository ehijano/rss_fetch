      <title>Enumeration of interval-closed sets via Motzkin paths and quarter-plane walks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.16368</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.16368v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We find a generating function for interval-closed sets of the product of two chains poset by constructing a bijection to certain bicolored Motzkin paths. We also find a functional equation for the generating function of interval-closed sets of truncated rectangle posets, including the type $A$ root poset, by constructing a bijection to certain quarter-plane walks.</description>

      <title>Wheel-like bricks and minimal matching covered graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.16465</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.16465v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A connected graph G with at least two vertices is matching covered if each of its edges lies in a perfect matching. We say that an edge e in a matching covered graph G is removable if G-e is matching covered. A pair {e; f} of edges of a matching covered graph G is a removable doubleton if G-e-f is matching covered, but neither G-e nor G-f is. Removable edges and removable doubletons are called removable classes, introduced by Lovasz and Plummer in connection with ear decompositions of matching covered graphs. A 3-connected graph is a brick if the removal of any two distinct vertices, the left graph has a perfect matching. A brick G is wheel-like if G has a vertex h, such that every removable class of G has an edge incident with h. Lucchesi and Murty proposed a problem of characterizing wheel-like bricks. We show that every wheel-like brick may be obtained by splicing graphs whose underlying simple graphs are odd wheels in a certain manner. A matching covered graph is minimal if the removal of any edge, the left graph is not matching covered. Lovasz and Plummer proved that the minimum degree of a minimal matching covered bipartite graph different from K2 is 2 by ear decompositions in 1977. By the properties of wheel-like bricks, we prove that the minimum degree of a minimal matching covered graph other than K2 is 2 or 3.</description>

      <title>Spectral conditions for spanning $k$-trees or $k$-ended-trees of graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.16505</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.16505v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $G$ be a connected graph of order $n$. a spanning $k$-tree of $G$ is a spanning tree with the maximum degree at most $k$ and a spanning $k$-ended-tree of $G$ is a spanning tree with at most $k$ leaves, where $k\geq2$ is an integer. In this paper, we prove some tight spectral conditions for the existence of a spanning $k$-tree in $t$-connected graphs. Some of our results generalize the result of Fan, Goryainov, Huang and Lin (2022) and improve the spectral condition for a Hamilton path of Fiedler and Nikiforov (2010). For whether $t$-connected graphs contain a spanning $k$-ended-tree, we present two spectral conditions which are improvements of the results of Ao, Liu and Yuan (2023).</description>

      <title>A generalisation of bent vectors for Butson Hadamard matrices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.16579</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.16579v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: An $n\times n$ complex matrix $M$ with entries in the $k^{\textrm{th}}$ roots of unity which satisfies $MM^{\ast} = nI_{n}$ is called a Butson Hadamard matrix. While a matrix with entries in the $k^{\textrm{th}}$ roots typically does not have an eigenvector with entries in the same set, such vectors and their generalisations turn out to have multiple applications. A bent vector for $M$ satisfies $M{\bf x} = \lambda {\bf y}$ where ${\bf x}$ and ${\bf y}$ have entries in the $k^{\textrm{th}}$ roots of unity. In this paper we study in particular the special case that ${\bf y} = \overline{\bf x}$, which we call a conjugate self-dual bent vector for $M$.
  Using techniques from algebraic number theory, we prove some order conditions and non-existence results for self-dual and conjugate self-dual bent vectors; using tensor constructions and Bush-type matrices we give explicit examples. We conclude with an application to the covering radius of certain non-linear codes generalising the Reed Muller codes.</description>

      <title>Genus embeddings of complete graphs minus a matching</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.16606</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.16606v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We show that for all $n \equiv 0 \pmod{6}$, $n \geq 18$, there is an orientable triangular embedding of the octahedral graph on $n$ vertices that can be augmented with handles to produce a genus embedding of the complete graph of the same order. For these values of $n$, the intermediate embeddings of the construction also determine some surface crossing numbers of the complete graph on $n$ vertices and the genus of all graphs on $n$ vertices and minimum degree $n-2$.</description>

      <title>Shameful Inequalities for List and DP Coloring of Graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.16790</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.16790v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The chromatic polynomial of a graph is an important notion in algebraic combinatorics that was introduced by Birkhoff in 1912; denoted $P(G,k)$, it equals the number of proper $k$-colorings of graph $G$. Enumerative analogues of the chromatic polynomial of a graph have been introduced for two well-studied generalizations of ordinary coloring, namely, list colorings: $P_{\ell}$, the list color function (1990); and DP colorings: $P_{DP}$, the DP color function (2019), and $P^*_{DP}$, the dual DP color function (2021). For any graph $G$ and $k \in \mathbb{N}$, $P_{DP}(G, k) \leq P_\ell(G,k) \leq P(G,k) \leq P_{DP}^*(G,k)$. In 2000, Dong settled a conjecture of Bartels and Welsh from 1995 known as the Shameful Conjecture by proving that for any $n$-vertex graph $G$, $P(G,k+1)/(k+1)^n \geq P(G,k)/k^n$ for all $k \in \mathbb{N}$ satisfying $k \geq n-1$. In contrast, for infinitely many positive integers $n$, Seymour (1997) gave an example of an $n$-vertex graph for which the above inequality does not hold for some $k = \Theta(n/ \log n)$. In this paper, we consider analogues of Dong's result for list and DP color functions. Specifically, in contrast to the chromatic polynomial, we prove that for any $n$-vertex graph $G$, $P_{\ell}(G,k+1)/(k+1)^n \geq P_{\ell}(G,k)/k^n$ and $P_{DP}(G,k+1)/(k+1)^n \geq P_{DP}(G,k)/k^n$ for all $k \in \mathbb{N}$. For the dual DP analogue of these inequalities, we show that there is a graph $G$ and $k \in \mathbb{N}$ such that $P_{DP}^*(G,k+1)/(k+1)^n &lt; P_{DP}^*(G,k)/k^n$, and we prove $P_{DP}^*(G,k+1)/(k+1)^n \geq P_{DP}^*(G,k)/k^n$ for all $k \in \mathbb{N}$ satisfying $k \geq n-1$ when $G$ is an $n$-vertex complete bipartite graph.</description>

      <title>Overpartitions with separated overlined parts and non-overlined parts</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.16941</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.16941v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recently, Andrews considered the partitions with parts separated by parity, in which parts of a given parity are all smaller than those of the other parity, and if the smaller parity is odd then odd parts must appear. Inspired from the partitions with parts separated by parity, we investigate the overpartitions with separated overlined parts and non-overlined parts, in which the size of overlined parts are greater than (resp. greater than or equal to) the size of non-overlined parts, or non-overlined parts must appear and the size of non-overlined parts are greater than (resp. greater than or equal to) the size of overlined parts.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.16966v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the relation between a coefficient of an element of the Jones--Wenzl projection in the Temperley--Lieb algebra of type $D$ and an enumeration of Dyck tilings. The coefficient can be non-recursively expressed as an enumerative generating function of Dyck tilings by considering the generalized Hermite histories, which we call bi-colored vertical Hermite histories, on the tilings.</description>

      <title>Geometric Variants of the Gale--Berlekamp Switching Game</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.16994</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.16994v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Gale-Berlekamp switching game is played on the following device:
  $G_n=\{1,2,\ldots,n\} \times \{1,2,\ldots,n\}$
  is an $n \times n$ array of lights is controlled by $2n$ switches, one for each row or column.
  Given an (arbitrary) initial configuration of the board, the objective is to have as many lights on as possible.
  Denoting the maximum difference (discrepancy)
  between the number of lights that are on minus the number of lights that are off
  by $F(n)$, it is known (Brown and Spencer, 1971) that
  $F(n)= \Theta(n^{3/2})$, and more precisely, that
  $F(n) \geq \left( 1+ o(1) \right) \sqrt{\frac{2}{\pi}} n^{3/2} \approx 0.797 \ldots n^{3/2}$.
  Here we extend the game to other playing boards. For example:
  (i)~For any constant $c&gt;1$, if $c n$ switches are conveniently chosen, then the maximum discrepancy
  for the square board is $\Omega(n^{3/2})$. From the other direction, suppose we fix any set of $a$ column switches, $b$ row switches, where $a \geq b$ and $a+b=n$.
  Then the maximum discrepancy is at most $-b (n-b)$.
  (ii) A board $H \subset \{1,\ldots,n\}^2$, with area $A=|H|$,
  is \emph{dense} if $A \geq c (u+v)^2$, for some constant $c&gt;0$, where
  $u= |\{x \colon (x,y) \in H\}|$ and $v=|\{y \colon (x,y) \in H\}|$.
  For a dense board of area $A$, we show that the maximum discrepancy is $\Theta(A^{3/4})$.
  This result is a generalization of the Brown and Spencer result for the original game.
  (iii) If $H$ consists of the elements of $G_n$ below the hyperbola $xy=n$, then its maximum discrepancy
  is $\Omega(n)$ and $O(n (\log n)^{1/2})$.</description>

      <title>Asymptotics of the number of lattice triangulations of rectangles of width 4 and 5</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.17065</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.17065v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $f(m,n)$ be the number of primitive lattice triangulations of an $m \times n$ rectangle. We express the limits $\lim_n f(m,n)^{1/n}$ for $m = 4$ and $m=5$ in terms of certain systems of Fredholm integral equations on generating functions (the case $m\le3$ was treated in a previous paper). Solving these equations numerically, we compute approximate values of these limits with a rather high precision.</description>

      <title>Interplay between the local metric dimension and the clique number of a graph</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.17074</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.17074v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The local metric dimension ${\rm dim}_l$ in relation to the clique number $\omega$ is investigated. It is proved that if $\omega(G)\leq n(G)-3$, then ${\rm dim}_l(G) \leq n(G)-3$ and the graphs attaining the bound classified. Moreover, the graphs $G$ with ${\rm dim}_l(G) = n(G)-3$ are listed (with no condition on the clique number). It is proved that if $\omega(G)=n(G)-2$, then $n(G)-4 \leq {\rm dim}_l(G)\leq n(G)-3$, and all graphs are divided into two groups depending on which of the options applies. The conjecture asserting that for any graph $G$ we have ${\rm dim}_l(G) \leq \left[(\omega(G)-2)/(\omega(G)-1)\right] \cdot n(G)$ is proved for all graphs with $\omega(G)\in\{n(G)-1,n(G)-2,n(G)-3\}$. A negative answer is given for the problem whether every planar graph fulfills the inequality ${\rm dim}_l(G) \leq \lceil (n(G)+1)/2 \rceil$.</description>

      <title>The number of dissociation sets in connected graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.17095</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.17095v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Extremal problems related to the enumeration of graph substructures, such as independent sets, matchings, and induced matchings, have become a prominent area of research with the advancement of graph theory. A subset of vertices is called a dissociation set if it induces a subgraph with vertex degree at most $1$, making it a natural generalization of these previously studied substructures.
  In this paper, we present efficient tools to strictly increase the number of dissociation sets in a connected graph. Furthermore, we establish that the maximum number of dissociation sets among all connected graphs of order $n$ is given by \begin{align*} \begin{cases} 2^{n-1}+(n+3)\cdot 2^{\frac{n-5}{2}}, &amp;~ {\rm if}~ n~{\rm is}~{\rm odd};\\ 2^{n-1}+(n+6)\cdot 2^{\frac{n-6}{2}}, &amp;~ {\rm if}~ n~{\rm is}~{\rm even}. \end{cases} \end{align*} Additionally, we determine the achievable upper bound on the number of dissociation sets in a tree of order $n$ and characterize the corresponding extremal graphs as an intermediate result. Finally, we identify the unicyclic graph that is the candidate for having the second largest number of dissociation sets among all connected graphs.</description>

The asymptotic case is studied, yielding new results over a broad range of parameters. Numerical results are presented, highlighting nontrivial relationships between the obtained bounds.

      <title>Slack-Pack algorithm for Meir-Moser packing problem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.17151</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.17151v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The well-known problem stated by A. Meir and L. Moser consists in tiling the unit square with rectangles (details), whose side lengths equal $\frac1n\times\frac1{n+1}$, where indices $n$ range from 1 to infinity. Recently, Terence Tao has proved that it is possible to tile with $\bigl(\frac1n\bigr)^t\times\bigl(\frac1{n+1}\bigr)^t$ rectangles (squares with the side length of $\bigl(\frac1n\bigr)^t$), $1/2&lt;t&lt;1$, the square, whose area equals the sum of areas of these details, provided that only those details, whose indices exceed certain $n_0$, are taken into consideration. We adduce arguments in favor of the assumption that the result obtained by T. Tao is also valid for $t=1$. We use a new tiling method (the Slack-Pack algorithm), which initially admits gaps between stacks of details. The algorithm uses a pre-fixed parameter $\gamma$, $\sqrt{3/2}&lt;\gamma&lt;3/2$, connected with the gap value. The new algorithm allows one to control the ratio of the area of the large rectangular part, which is free of details, to the whole area of the remaining empty space. This ratio (under certain natural assumptions) always exceeds $1-1/\gamma-\delta$, where $\delta$ tends to zero as $n_0$ increases.</description>

      <title>Totally positive skew-symmetric matrices</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.17233v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A matrix is totally positive if all of its minors are positive. This notion of positivity coincides with the type A version of Lusztig's more general total positivity in reductive real-split algebraic groups. Since skew-symmetric matrices always have nonpositive entries, they are not totally positive in the classical sense. The space of skew-symmetric matrices is an affine chart of the orthogonal Grassmannian $\mathrm{OGr}(n,2n)$. Thus, we define a skew-symmetric matrix to be totally positive if it lies in the totally positive orthogonal Grassmannian. We provide a positivity criterion for these matrices in terms of a fixed collection of minors, and show that their Pfaffians have a remarkable sign pattern. The totally positive orthogonal Grassmannian is a CW cell complex and is subdivided into Richardson cells. We introduce a method to determine which cell a given point belongs to in terms of its associated matroid.</description>

      <title>Hamiltonian Properties of Hybrid-Faulty Burnt Pancake Graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.17236</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.17236v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the combined occurrence of edge faults and vertex faults in the burnt pancake graph (\( BP_n \)). In this paper, we prove that \( BP_n - F \), where \( F \) includes pairs of end-vertices of matching edges and fault-tolerant edges, contains a Hamiltonian cycle when \( |F| \leq n-2 \) and a Hamiltonian path when \( |F| \leq n-3 \). This establishes that \( BP_n \) is \((n-2)\)-hybrid fault Hamiltonian and \((n-3)\)-hybrid fault Hamiltonian connected for \( n \geq 3 \). These results are demonstrated to be optimal under the given conditions, with all bounds shown to be tight.</description>

      <title>Translational Aperiodic Sets of 7 Polyominoes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.17382</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.17382v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recently, two extraordinary results on aperiodic monotiles have been obtained in two different settings. One is a family of aperiodic monotiles in the plane discovered by Smith, Myers, Kaplan and Goodman-Strauss in 2023, where rotation is allowed, breaking the 50-year-old record (aperiodic sets of two tiles found by Roger Penrose in the 1970s) on the minimum size of aperiodic sets in the plane. The other is the existence of an aperiodic monotile in the translational tiling of $\mathbb{Z}^n$ for some huge dimension $n$ proved by Greenfeld and Tao. This disproves the long-standing periodic tiling conjecture. However, it is known that there is no aperiodic monotile for translational tiling of the plane. The smallest size of known aperiodic sets for translational tilings of the plane is $8$, which was discovered more than $30$ years ago by Ammann. In this paper, we prove that translational tiling of the plane with a set of $7$ polyominoes is undecidable. As a consequence of the undecidability, we have constructed a family of aperiodic sets of size $7$ for the translational tiling of the plane. This breaks the 30-year-old record of Ammann.</description>

      <title>On lower bounds for cardinalities of several separating-dominating codes in graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.17469</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.17469v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the literature, several different identification problems in graphs have been studied, the most widely studied such problems are the ones based on dominating sets as a tool of identification. Hereby, the objective is to separate any two vertices of a graph by their unique neighborhoods in a suitably chosen dominating or total-dominating set. Such a (total-)dominating set endowed with a separation property is often referred to as a "code" of the graph. The problems of determining such codes of minimum cardinality are all shown to be NP-hard. A typical line to attack such problems is, therefore, to provide bounds on the cardinalities of the studied codes.
  In this paper, we are interested in extremal graphs for lower bounds in terms of the order of the graph. For some codes, logarithmic lower bounds are known from the literature. We provide for eight different identification problems a general construction of extremal graphs minimizing the cardinality of a minimum code compared to the order of the graph. This enables us to reprove the existing logarithmic lower bounds, to establish such bounds for further codes, and to characterize all graphs attaining these bounds.</description>

      <title>Oriented Ramsey numbers of some oriented graphs with one cycle</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.17500</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.17500v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The oriented Ramsey number of an oriented graph $H$, denoted by $\overrightarrow{r}(H)$, is the smallest integer $N$ such that every tournament on $N$ vertices contains a copy of $H$. Rosenfeld (JCT-B, 1974) conjectured that $\overrightarrow{r}(C_n)=n$ if $C_n$ is a nondirected oriented cycle of sufficiently large order $n$, which was confirmed for $n\geq 9$ by Zein recently. In this paper, we determine the oriented Ramsey number of an oriented graph obtained by identifying a vertex of an antidirected cycle with one end of a directed path. Some other oriented Ramsey numbers for oriented graphs with one cycle are also discussed.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.17502</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.17502v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We prove that single $G$-weighted $\mathfrak{b}$-Hurwitz numbers with internal faces are computed by refined topological recursion on a rational spectral curve, for certain rational weights $G$. Consequently, the $\mathfrak{b}$-Hurwitz generating function analytically continues to a rational curve. In particular, our results cover the cases of $\mathfrak{b}$-monotone Hurwitz numbers, and the enumeration of maps and bipartite maps (with internal faces) on non-oriented surfaces. As an application, we prove that the correlators of the Gaussian, Jacobi and Laguerre $\beta$-ensembles are computed by refined topological recursion.</description>

      <title>(Total) Perfect codes in (extended) subgroup sum graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.17509</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.17509v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Given a finite group $G$ with identity $e$ and a normal subgroup $H$ of $G$, the subgroup sum graph $\Gamma_{G,H}$ (resp. extended subgroup sum graph $\Gamma_{G,H}^+$) of $G$ with respect to $H$ is the graph with vertex set $G$, in which distinct vertices $x$ and $y$ are adjacent whenever $xy\in H\setminus \{e\}$ (resp. $xy\in H$). A group $G$ is said to be {\em code-perfect} if for any normal subgroup $H$ of $G$, $\Gamma_{G,H}$ admits a perfect code. In this paper, we give a necessary and sufficient condition for which normal subgroups $H$ of $G$ satisfy that a (extended) subgroup sum graph of $G$ with respect to $H$ admits a (total) perfect code, and classify all code-perfect Dedekind groups. As an application, we classify all normal subgroups such that the subgroup sum graph of a cyclic group, a dihedral group or a dicyclic group with respect to such a normal subgroup admits perfect codes, respectively. We also determine all abelian groups $A$ and subgroups $H$ of $A$ such that $\Gamma_{A,H}$ admits a total perfect code.</description>

      <title>Ordered Ramsey numbers of graphs with $m$ edges</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.17599v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Given a vertex-ordered graph $G$, the ordered Ramsey number $r_&lt;(G)$ is the minimum integer $N$ such that every $2$-coloring of the edges of the complete ordered graph $K_N$ contains a monochromatic ordered copy of $G$. Motivated by a similar question posed by Erd\H{o}s and Graham in the unordered setting, we study the problem of bounding the ordered Ramsey number of any ordered graph $G$ with $m$ edges and no isolated vertices. We prove that $r_&lt;(G) \leq e^{10^9 \sqrt{m} (\log \log m)^{3/2}}$ for any such $G$, which is tight up to the $(\log \log m)^{3/2}$ factor in the exponent. As a corollary, we obtain the corresponding bound for the oriented Ramsey number of a directed graph with $m$ edges.</description>

      <title>Multi-cyclic graphs in the random graph process with restricted budget</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.17620</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.17620v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Frieze, Krivelevich, and Michaeli recently introduced a controlled random graph process. In their model, the edges of a complete graph are randomly ordered and revealed sequentially to a builder. For each edge revealed, the builder must irrevocably decide whether to purchase it. The process is subject to two constraints: the number of observed edges $t$ and the builder's budget $b$. The goal of the builder is to construct, with high probability, a graph possessing a desired property. Previously, a tight result was established for constructing a graph containing a fixed tree or cycle, and the authors claimed that their proof could be extended to any unicyclic graph. The problem, however, remained open for graphs containing at least two cycles, the smallest of which is the graph $K_4^-$ (a clique of size four with one edge removed). In this paper, we provide a strategy to construct a copy of the graph $K_4^-$ if $b \gg \max\left\{n^6 / t^4, n^{4 / 3} / t^{2 / 3}\right\}$, and show that this bound is tight, answering the question posed by Frieze et al. concerning this graph. We also give a strategy to construct a copy of a graph consisting of $k$ triangles intersecting at a single vertex (the $k$-butterfly) if $b \gg \max\left\{n^{4k - 1} / t^{3k - 1}, n / \sqrt{t}\right\}$, and also show that this bound is tight. To the authors' knowledge, these are the first strategies for constructing a multi-cyclic graph in this random graph model.</description>

      <title>Characterization of Double-Arborescences and their Minimum-Word-Representants</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.17642</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.17642v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A double-arborescence is a treelike comparability graph with an all-adjacent vertex. In this paper, we first give a forbidden induced subgraph characterization of double-arborescences, where we prove that double-arborescences are precisely $P_4$-free treelike comparability graphs. Then, we characterize a more general class consisting of $P_4$-free distance-hereditary graphs using split-decomposition trees. Consequently, using split-decomposition trees, we characterize double-arborescences and one of its subclasses, viz., arborescences; a double-arborescence is an arborescence if its all-adjacent vertex is a source or a sink. In the context of word-representable graphs, it is an open problem to find the classes of word-representable graphs whose minimum-word-representants are of length $2n - k$, where $n$ is the number of vertices of the graph and $k$ is its clique number. Contributing to the open problem, we devise an algorithmic procedure and show that the class of double-arborescences is one such class. It seems the class of double-arborescences is the first example satisfying the criteria given in the open problem, for an arbitrary $k$.</description>

Abstract: In this work, we characterize the class of word-representable graphs with respect to the modular decomposition. Consequently, we determine the representation number of a word-representable graph in terms of the permutation-representation numbers of the modules and the representation number of the associated quotient graph. In this connection, we also obtain a complete answer to the open problem posed by Kitaev and Lozin on the word-representability of the lexicographical product of graphs.</description>

      <title>The Graph Coloring Game on $4\times n$-Grids</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.17668</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.17668v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The graph coloring game is a famous two-player game (re)introduced by Bodlaender in $1991$. Given a graph $G$ and $k \in \mathbb{N}$, Alice and Bob alternately (starting with Alice) color an uncolored vertex with some color in $\{1,\cdots,k\}$ such that no two adjacent vertices receive a same color. If eventually all vertices are colored, then Alice wins and Bob wins otherwise. The game chromatic number $\chi_g(G)$ is the smallest integer $k$ such that Alice has a winning strategy with $k$ colors in $G$. It has been recently (2020) shown that, given a graph $G$ and $k\in \mathbb{N}$, deciding whether $\chi_g(G)\leq k$ is PSPACE-complete. Surprisingly, this parameter is not well understood even in ``simple" graph classes. Let $P_n$ denote the path with $n\geq 1$ vertices. For instance, in the case of Cartesian grids, it is easy to show that $\chi_g(P_m \times P_n) \leq 5$ since $\chi_g(G)\leq \Delta+1$ for any graph $G$ with maximum degree $\Delta$. However, the exact value is only known for small values of $m$, namely $\chi_g(P_1\times P_n)=3$, $\chi_g(P_2\times P_n)=4$ and $\chi_g(P_3\times P_n) =4$ for $n\geq 4$ [Raspaud, Wu, 2009]. Here, we prove that, for every $n\geq 18$, $\chi_g(P_4\times P_n) =4$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.17679v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper studies three different ways to assign weights to the lattice points of a convex polytope and discusses the algebraic and combinatorial properties of the resulting weighted Ehrhart functions and their generating functions and associated rings. These will be called $q$-weighted, $r$-weighted, and $s$-weighted Ehrhart functions, respectively. The key questions we investigate are \emph{When are the weighted Ehrhart series rational functions and which classical Ehrhart theory properties are preserved? And, when are the abstract formal power series the Hilbert series of Ehrhart rings of some polytope?} We prove generalizations about weighted Ehrhart $h^*$-coefficients of $q$-weighted Ehrhart series, and show $q$- and $s$-weighted Ehrhart reciprocity theorems. Then, we show the $q$- and $r$-weighted Ehrhart rings are the (classical) Ehrhart rings of weight lifting polytopes.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.17697v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study aims to determine the algebraic structures of $\alpha$-constacyclic codes of length $3p^s$ over the finite commutative non-chain ring $\mathcal{R}=\frac{\mathbb{F}_{p^m}[u, v]}{\langle u^2, v^2, uv-vu\rangle}$, for a prime $p \neq 3.$ For the unit $\alpha$, we consider two different instances: when $\alpha$ is a cube in $\mathcal{R}$ and when it is not. Analyzing the first scenario is relatively easy. When $\alpha$ is not a unit in $\mathcal{R}$, we consider several subcases and determine the algebraic structures of constacyclic codes in those cases. Further, we also provide the number of codewords and the duals of $\alpha$-constacyclic codes.</description>

      <title>Colouring t-perfect graphs</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.17735v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Perfect graphs can be described as the graphs whose stable set polytopes are defined by their non-negativity and clique inequalities (including edge inequalities). In 1975, Chv\'{a}tal defined an analogous class of t-perfect graphs, which are the graphs whose stable set polytopes are defined by their non-negativity, edge inequalities, and odd circuit inequalities. We show that t-perfect graphs are $199053$-colourable. This is the first finite bound on the chromatic number of t-perfect graphs and answers a question of Shepherd from 1995. Our proof also shows that every h-perfect graph with clique number $\omega$ is $(\omega + 199050)$-colourable.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.17756v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The pathwidth of a graph $G$ is the smallest $w\in \mathbb{N}$ such that $G$ can be constructed from a sequence of graphs, each of size at most $w+1$, by gluing them together in a linear fashion. We provide a full classification of the unavoidable induced subgraphs of graphs with large pathwidth.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.16259v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Let ${\mathtt{k}}$ be an algebraically closed field of characteristic zero and $n, m$ coprime positive integers. Let ${\stackrel{{\rm o}}{{\mathfrak{g}}}}$ be the Lie superalgebra ${\mathfrak{gl}}(n|m)$ with root system $\Delta$. Using $\Delta$, Sergeev and Veselov, \cite{SV2} introduced an action of the Weyl groupoid ${\mathcal{W}}$, in connection with their study of the the Grothendieck group of finite dimensinonal graded $\mathfrak{g}$-modules. We denote the subgroupoid of ${\mathcal{W}}$ with morphisms corresponding to isotropic roots by $\mathfrak T_{iso}$.
  Later, \cite{SV101} the same authors defined an action of ${\mathcal{W}}$ on $X={\mathtt{k}}^{n|m}$ such that the invariant algebra ${\mathcal{O}}(X)^{\mathcal{W}}$ is isomorphic to the algebra of quantum integrals for the deformed Calogero-Moser system introduced in \cite{SV1}. This completely integrable system depends on a non-zero parameter $\kappa$. When $\kappa=-m/n$ we study a certain infinite $\mathfrak T_{iso}$-orbit {\bf O} for this action. %which appears in \cite{SV101} Equation (14). The Cayley graph for this orbit is isomorphic to the Cayley graphs for two other actions of $\mathfrak T_{iso}$ which were studied in \cite{M23}.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.16810v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Given a partition $\mu$ of $-2$, the stratum $\mathcal{H}(\mu)$ parametrizes meromorphic differential one-forms on $\mathbb{CP}^{1}$ with~$n$ zeros and $p$ poles of orders prescribed by $\mu$. The isoresidual fibration is defined by assigning to each differential in $\mathcal{H}(\mu)$ its configuration of residues at the poles. In the case of differentials with $n=2$ zeros, generic isoresidual fibers are complex curves endowed with a canonical translation structure, which we describe extensively in this paper. Quantitative characteristics of the translation structure on isoresidual fiber curves, including the orders of the singularities and a period central charge encapsulating the linear dependence of periods on the underlying configuration of residues, provide rich discrete invariants for these fibers. We also determine the Euler characteristic of generic isoresidual fiber curves from intersection-theoretic computations, relying on the multi-scale compactification of strata of differentials. In particular, we describe a wall and chamber structure for the Euler characteristic of generic isoresidual fiber curves in terms of the partition $\mu$. Additionally, we classify the connected components of generic isoresidual fibers for strata in genus zero with an arbitrary number of zeros.</description>

      <title>The support of Kostant's weight multiplicity formula is an order ideal in the weak Bruhat order</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.16820</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.16820v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: For integral weights $\lambda$ and $\mu$ of a classical simple Lie algebra $\mathfrak{g}$, Kostant's weight multiplicity formula gives the multiplicity of the weight $\mu$ in the irreducible representation with highest weight $\lambda$, which we denote by $m(\lambda,\mu)$. Kostant's weight multiplicity formula is an alternating sum over the Weyl group of the Lie algebra whose terms are determined via a vector partition function. The Weyl alternation set $\mathcal{A}(\lambda,\mu)$ is the set of Weyl group elements that contribute nontrivially to the multiplicity $m(\lambda,\mu)$. In this article, we prove that Weyl alternation sets are order ideals in the weak Bruhat order of the corresponding Weyl group. Specializing to the Lie algebra $\mathfrak{sl}_{r+1}(\mathbb{C})$, we give a complete characterization of the Weyl alternation sets $\mathcal{A}(\tilde{\alpha},\mu)$, where $\tilde{\alpha}$ is the highest root and $\mu$ is a negative root, answering a question of Harry posed in 2024. We also provide some enumerative results that pave the way for our future work where we aim to prove Harry's conjecture that the $q$-analog of Kostant's weight multiplicity formula $m_q(\tilde{\alpha},\mu)=q^{r+j-i+1}+q^{r+j-i}-q^{j-i+1}$ when $\mu=-(\alpha_i+\alpha_{i+1}+\cdots+\alpha_{j})$ is a negative root of $\mathfrak{sl}_{r+1}(\mathbb{C})$.</description>

      <title>Construction, Transformation and Structures of 2x2 Space-Filling Curves</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.16962</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.16962v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The 2x2 space-filling curve is a type of generalized space-filling curve characterized by a basic unit is in a "U-shape" that traverses a 2x2 grid. In this work, we propose a universal framework for constructing general 2x2 curves where self-similarity is not strictly required. The construction is based on a novel set of grammars that define the expansion of curves from level 0 (a single point) to level 1 (units in U-shapes), which ultimately determines all $36 \times 2^k$ possible forms of curves on any level $k$ initialized from single points. We further developed an encoding system in which each unique form of the curve is associated with a specific combination of an initial seed and a sequence of codes that sufficiently describes both the global and local structures of the curve. We demonstrated that this encoding system is a powerful tool for studying 2x2 curves and we established comprehensive theoretical foundations from the following three key perspectives: 1) We provided a determinstic encoding for any unit on any level and position on the curve, enabling the study of curve generation across arbitrary parts on the curve and ranges of iterations; 2) We gave determinstic encodings for various curve transformations, including rotations, reflections and reversals; 3) We provided deterministic forms of families of curves exhibiting specific structures, including homogeneous curves, curves with identical shapes, with partially identical shapes and with completely distinct shapes. We also explored families of recursive curves, subunit identically shaped curves, symmetric curves and closed curves. Finally, we proposed a method to calculate the location of any point on the curve arithmetically, within a time complexity linear to the level of the curve.</description>

      <title>Sparsest cut and eigenvalue multiplicities on low degree Abelian Cayley graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.17115</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.17115v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Whether or not the Sparsest Cut problem admits an efficient $O(1)$-approximation algorithm is a fundamental algorithmic question with connections to geometry and the Unique Games Conjecture. We design an $O(1)$-approximation algorithm to Sparsest Cut for the class of Cayley graphs over Abelian groups, running in time $n^{O(1)}\cdot \exp\{d^{O(d)}\}$ where $d$ is the degree of the graph.
  Previous work has centered on solving cut problems on graphs which are ``expander-like'' in various senses, such as being a small-set expander or having low threshold rank.
  In contrast, low-degree Abelian Cayley graphs are natural examples of non-expanding graphs far from these assumptions (e.g. the cycle). We demonstrate that spectral and semidefinite programming-based methods can still succeed in these graphs by analyzing an eigenspace enumeration algorithm which searches for a sparse cut among the low eigenspace of the Laplacian matrix. We dually interpret this algorithm as searching for a hyperplane cut in a low-dimensional embedding of the graph.
  In order to analyze the algorithm, we prove a bound of $d^{O(d)}$ on the number of eigenvalues ``near'' $\lambda_2$ for connected degree-$d$ Abelian Cayley graphs. We obtain a tight bound of $2^{\Theta(d)}$ on the multiplicity of $\lambda_2$ itself which improves on a previous bound of $2^{O(d^2)}$ by Lee and Makarychev.</description>

      <title>Online coloring of short interval graphs and two-count interval graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.17193</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.17193v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the online coloring of $\sigma$-interval graphs which are interval graphs where the interval lengths are between 1 and $\sigma$ and 2-count interval graphs which are interval graphs that require at most $2$ distinct interval lengths.
  For online $\sigma$-interval graph coloring, we focus on online algorithms that do not have knowledge of the interval representation. The Kierstead-Trotter algorithm has competitive ratio 3 for all $\sigma$ and no online algorithm has competitive ratio better than 2, even for $\sigma=1$. In this paper, we show that for every $\epsilon&gt;0$, there is a $\sigma&gt;1$ such that there is no online algorithm for $\sigma$-interval coloring with competitive ratio less than $3-\epsilon$. Our strategy also improves the best known lower bounds for the greedy algorithm First-Fit for many values of $\sigma$.
  For online 2-count interval graph coloring, we analyze the performance of First-Fit and algorithms under various scenarios. We consider algorithms that receive the interval representation as input and algorithms that do not. We also consider algorithms that have prior knowledge of the interval lengths and algorithms that do not. We provide non-trivial lower bounds for each of the four cases. In particular, we show that there is no online algorithm with competitive ratio less than $2.5$ when the interval lengths are known, there is no online algorithm with competitive ratio less than $2$ when the interval representation is known, and there is no online algorithm with competitive ratio less than $1.75$ when both the interval lengths and interval representation are known.</description>

Abstract: A tree is said to be even if for every pair of distinct leaves, the length of the unique path between them is even. In this paper we discuss the problem of determining whether an input graph has a spanning even tree. Hofmann and Walsh [Australas. J Comb. 35, 2006] proved that this problem can be solved in polynomial time on bipartite graphs. In contrast to this, we show that this problem is NP-complete even on planar graphs. We also give polynomial-time algorithms for several restricted classes of graphs, such as split graphs, cographs, cobipartite graphs, unit interval graphs, and block graphs.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.17320v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This semi-expository article presents an inductive method of computing initial ideals and Gr\"obner bases for families of ideals in a polynomial ring. This method starts from a given set of pairs $(I,J)$ where $I$ is any ideal and $J$ is a monomial ideal contained in the initial ideal of $I$. These containments become a system of equalities if one can establish a particular transition recurrence among the chosen ideals. We describe explicit constructions of such systems in two motivating cases -- namely, for the ideals of matrix Schubert varieties and their skew-symmetric analogues. Despite many formal similarities with these examples, for the symmetric versions of matrix Schubert varieties, it is an open problem to construct the same kind of transition system. We present several conjectures that would follow from such a construction, while also discussing the special obstructions arising in the symmetric case.</description>

      <title>On the number of $k$-mers admitting a given lexicographical minimizer</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.17492</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.17492v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The minimizer of a word of size $k$ (a $k$-mer) is defined as its smallest substring of size $m$ (with $m\leq k$), according to some ordering on $m$-mers. minimizers have been used in bioinformatics -- notably -- to partition sequencing datasets, binning together $k$-mers that share the same minimizer. It is folklore that using the lexicographical order lead to very unbalanced partitions, resulting in an abundant literature devoted to devising alternative orders for achieving better balanced partitions. To the best of our knowledge, the unbalanced-ness of lexicographical-based minimizer partitions has never been investigated from a theoretical point of view. In this article, we aim to fill this gap and determine, for a given minimizer, how many $k$-mers would admit the chosen minimizer -- i.e. what would be the size of the bucket associated to the chosen minimizer in the worst case, where all $k$-mers would be seen in the data. We show that this number can be computed in $O(km)$ space and $O(km^2)$ time. We further introduce approximations that can be computed in $O(k)$ space and $O(km)$ time. We also show on genomic datasets that the practical number of $k$-mers associated to a minimizer are closely correlated to the theoretical expected number. We introduce two conjectures that could help closely approximating the total number of $k$-mers sharing a minimizer. We believe that characterising the distribution of the number of $k$-mers per minimizer will help devise efficient lexicographic-based minimizer bucketting.</description>

      <title>Lattice 3-polytopes of lattice width 2 and corresponding toric hypersurfaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.17545</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.17545v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Kodaira dimension of a nondegenerate toric hypersurface can be computed from the dimension of the Fine interior of its Newton polytope according to recent work of Victor Batyrev, where the Fine interior of the Newton polytope is the subpolytope consisting of all points which have an integral distance of at least $1$ to all integral supporting hyperplanes. In particular, if we have a Fine interior of codimension $1$, then the hypersurface is of general type and the Newton polytope has lattice width $2$. In this article we study this situation for lattice $3$-polytopes and the corresponding surfaces of general type. In particular, we classify all $2$-dimensional Fine interiors of those lattice $3$-polytopes which have at most $40$ interior lattice points, thus obtaining many examples of surfaces of general type and genus at most $40$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.17694v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose and study a novel efficient algorithm for clustering and classification tasks based on the famous MBO scheme. On the one hand, inspired by Jacobs et al. [J. Comp. Phys. 2018], we introduce constraints on the size of clusters leading to a linear integer problem. We prove that the solution to this problem is induced by a novel order statistic. This viewpoint allows us to develop exact and highly efficient algorithms to solve such constrained integer problems. On the other hand, we prove an estimate of the computational complexity of our scheme, which is better than any available provable bounds for the state of the art. This rigorous analysis is based on a variational viewpoint that connects this scheme to volume-preserving mean curvature flow in the big data and small time-step limit.</description>

      <title>On additive bases in infinite abelian semigroups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2002.03919</link>
      <description>arXiv:2002.03919v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Building on previous work by Lambert, Plagne and the third author, we study various aspects of the behavior of additive bases in infinite abelian groups and semigroups. We show that, for every infinite abelian group $T$, the number of essential subsets of any additive basis is finite, and also that the number of essential subsets of cardinality $k$ contained in an additive basis of order at most $h$ can be bounded in terms of $h$ and $k$ alone. These results extend the reach of two theorems, one due to Deschamps and Farhi and the other to Hegarty, bearing upon $\mathbf{N}$. Also, using invariant means, we address a classical problem, initiated by Erd\H{o}s and Graham and then generalized by Nash and Nathanson both in the case of $\mathbf{N}$, of estimating the maximal order $X_T(h,k)$ that a basis of cocardinality $k$ contained in an additive basis of order at most $h$ can have. Among other results, we prove that $X_T(h,k)=O(h^{2k+1})$ for every integer $k \ge 1$. This result is new even in the case where $k=1$. Besides the maximal order $X_T(h,k)$, the typical order $S_T(h,k)$ is also studied. Our methods actually apply to a wider class of infinite abelian semigroups, thus unifying in a single axiomatic frame the theory of additive bases in $\mathbf{N}$ and in abelian groups.</description>

      <title>Involution factorizations of Ewens random permutations</title>

      <description>arXiv:2105.12695v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: An involution is a bijection that is its own inverse. Given a permutation $\sigma$ of $[n],$ let $\mathsf{invol}(\sigma)$ denote the number of ways $\sigma$ can be expressed as a composition of two involutions of $[n].$ We prove that the statistic $\mathsf{invol}$ is asymptotically lognormal when the symmetric groups $\mathfrak{S}_n$ are each equipped with Ewens Sampling Formula probability measures of some fixed positive parameter $\theta.$ This paper strengthens and generalizes previously determined results about the limiting distribution of $\log(\mathsf{invol})$ for uniform random permutations, i.e. the specific case of $\theta = 1$. We also investigate the first two moments of $\mathsf{invol}$ itself, detailing the phase transition in asymptotic behavior at $\theta = 1,$ and provide a functional refinement and a convergence rate for the Gaussian limit law which is demonstrably optimal when $\theta = 1.$</description>

      <title>Local Distance Antimagic Vertex Coloring of Graphs</title>

      <description>arXiv:2106.01833v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A bijective function $f:V\rightarrow\left\{1,2,3,...,|V| \right\}$ is said to be a local distance antimagic labeling of a graph $G=(V,E)$, if $w(u)\neq w(v)$ for any two adjacent vertices $u, v$ where the weight $w(v)=\sum_{z\in N(v)}f(z)$. The local distance antimagic labeling of $G$ induces a proper coloring in $G$, called local distance antimagic chromatic number denoted by $\chi_{ld}(G)$. In this article, we introduce the parameter $\chi_{ld}(G)$ and compute the local distance antimagic chromatic number of graphs.
  Keywords: Distance antimagic labeling, Local distance antimagic labeling, Local distance antimagic chromatic number.</description>

      <title>The chromatic symmetric function of a graph centred at a vertex</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2108.04850</link>
      <description>arXiv:2108.04850v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We discover new linear relations between the chromatic symmetric functions of certain sequences of graphs and apply these relations to find new families of e-positive unit interval graphs. Motivated by the results of Gebhard and Sagan, we revisit their ideas and reinterpret their equivalence relation in terms of a new quotient algebra of NCSym. We investigate the projection of the chromatic symmetric function $Y_G$ in noncommuting variables in this quotient algebra, which defines $y_{G : v}$, the chromatic symmetric function of a graph G centred at a vertex v. We then apply our methods to $y_{G :v}$ and find new families of unit interval graphs that are (e)-positive, a stronger condition than classical e-positivity, thus confirming new cases of the (3+1)-free conjecture of Stanley and Stembridge.
  In our study of $y_{G : v}$, we also describe methods of constructing new e-positive graphs from given $(e)$-positive graphs and classify the (e)-positivity of trees and cut vertices. We moreover construct a related quotient algebra of NCQSym to prove theorems relating the coefficients of $y_{G : v}$ to acyclic orientations of graphs, including a noncommutative refinement of Stanley's sink theorem.</description>

      <title>3D domino tilings: irregular disks and connected components under flips</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2209.03109</link>
      <description>arXiv:2209.03109v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider three-dimensional domino tilings of cylinders $\mathcal{R}_N = \mathcal{D} \times [0,N]$ where $\mathcal{D} \subset \mathbb{R}^2$ is a fixed quadriculated disk and $N \in \mathbb{N}$. A domino is a $2 \times 1 \times 1$ brick. A flip is a local move in the space of tilings $\mathcal{T}(\mathcal{R}_N)$: remove two adjacent dominoes and place them back after a rotation. The twist is a flip invariant which associates an integer number to each tiling. For some disks $\mathcal{D}$, called regular, two tilings of $\mathcal{R}_N$ with the same twist can be joined by a sequence of flips once we add vertical space to the cylinder. We have that if $\mathcal{D}$ is regular then the size of the largest connected component under flips of $\mathcal{T}(\mathcal{R}_N)$ is $\Theta(N^{-\frac{1}{2}}|\mathcal{T}(\mathcal{R}_N)|)$. The domino group $G_{\mathcal{D}}$ captures information of the space of tilings. A disk $\mathcal{D}$ is regular if and only if $G_{\mathcal{D}}$ is isomorphic to $\mathbb{Z} \oplus \mathbb{Z}/(2)$; sufficiently large rectangles are regular.
  We prove that certain families of disks are irregular. We show that the existence of a bottleneck in a disk $\mathcal{D}$ often implies irregularity. In many, but not all, of these cases, we also prove that $\mathcal{D}$ is strongly irregular, i.e., that there exists a surjective homomorphism from $G_{\mathcal{D}}^+$ (a subgroup of index two of $G_{\mathcal{D}}$) to the free group of rank two. Moreover, we show that if $\mathcal{D}$ is strongly irregular then the cardinality of the largest connected component under flips of $\mathcal{T}(\mathcal{R}_N)$ is $O(c^N |\mathcal{T}(\mathcal{R}_N)|)$ for some $c \in (0,1)$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2210.08370v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: An \emph{$(n,k,t)$-graph} is a graph on $n$ vertices in which every set of $k$ vertices contains a clique on $t$ vertices. Tur\'an's Theorem, rephrased in terms of graph complements, states that the unique minimum $(n,k,2)$-graph is an equitable disjoint union of cliques. We prove that minimum $(n,k,t)$-graphs are always disjoint unions of cliques for any $t$ (despite \allowbreak nonuniqueness of extremal examples), thereby generalizing Tur\'an's Theorem and confirming two conjectures of Hoffman et al.</description>

      <title>On off-diagonal Ramsey numbers for vector spaces over $\mathbb{F}_{2}$</title>

      <description>arXiv:2309.02424v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: For every positive integer $d$, we show that there must exist an absolute constant $c &gt; 0$ such that the following holds: for any integer $n \geq cd^{7}$ and any red-blue coloring of the one-dimensional subspaces of $\mathbb{F}_{2}^{n}$, there must exist either a $d$-dimensional subspace for which all of its one-dimensional subspaces get colored red or a $2$-dimensional subspace for which all of its one-dimensional subspaces get colored blue. This answers recent questions of Nelson and Nomoto, and confirms that for any even plane binary matroid $N$, the class of $N$-free, claw-free binary matroids is polynomially $\chi$-bounded.
  Our argument will proceed via a reduction to a well-studied additive combinatorics problem, originally posed by Green: given a set $A \subset \mathbb{F}_{2}^{n}$ with density $\alpha \in [0,1]$, what is the largest subspace that we can find in $A+A$? Our main contribution to the story is a new result for this problem in the regime where $1/\alpha$ is large with respect to $n$, which utilizes ideas from the recent breakthrough paper of Kelley and Meka on sets of integers without three-term arithmetic progressions.</description>

      <title>Building Hamiltonian Cycles in the Semi-Random Graph Process in Less Than $2n$ Rounds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.05533</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.05533v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The semi-random graph process is an adaptive random graph process in which an online algorithm is initially presented an empty graph on $n$ vertices. In each round, a vertex $u$ is presented to the algorithm independently and uniformly at random. The algorithm then adaptively selects a vertex $v$, and adds the edge $uv$ to the graph. For a given graph property, the objective of the algorithm is to force the graph to satisfy this property asymptotically almost surely in as few rounds as possible.
  We focus on the property of Hamiltonicity. We present an adaptive strategy which creates a Hamiltonian cycle in $\alpha n$ rounds, where $\alpha &lt; 1.81696$ is derived from the solution to a system of differential equations. We also show that achieving Hamiltonicity requires at least $\beta n$ rounds, where $\beta &gt; 1.26575$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2312.08405v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Luo, Tian and Wu [Discrete Math. 345 (4) (2022) 112788] conjectured that for any tree $T$ with bipartition $(X,Y)$, every $k$-connected bipartite graph $G$ with minimum degree at least $k+w$, where $w=\max\{|X|,|Y|\}$, contains a tree $T'\cong T$ such that $\kappa(G-V(T'))\geq k$. In the paper, we confirm the conjecture when $T$ is an odd path on $m$ vertices. We remind that Yang and Tian \cite{YT2} also prove the same result by a different way.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2401.14668v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: It is a longstanding open problem to find a bijection exchanging area and bounce statistics on Dyck paths. We settle this problem for an exponentially large subset of Dyck paths via an explicit bijection. Moreover, we prove that this bijection is natural by showing that it maps what we call bounce-minimal paths to area-minimal paths. As a consequence of the proof ideas, we show combinatorially that a path with area $a$ and bounce $b$ exists if and only if a path with area $b$ and bounce $a$ exists. We finally show that the number of distinct values of the sum of the area and bounce statistics is the number of nonzero coefficients in Johnson's $q$-Bell polynomial.</description>

      <title>Bender--Knuth Billiards in Coxeter Groups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.17360</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.17360v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Let $(W,S)$ be a Coxeter system, and write $S=\{s_i:i\in I\}$, where $I$ is a finite index set. Fix a nonempty convex subset $\mathscr{L}$ of $W$. If $W$ is of type $A$, then $\mathscr{L}$ is the set of linear extensions of a poset, and there are important Bender--Knuth involutions $\mathrm{BK}_i\colon\mathscr{L}\to\mathscr{L}$ indexed by elements of $I$. For arbitrary $W$ and for each $i\in I$, we introduce an operator $\tau_i\colon W\to W$ (depending on $\mathscr{L}$) that we call a noninvertible Bender--Knuth toggle; this operator restricts to an involution on $\mathscr{L}$ that coincides with $\mathrm{BK}_i$ in type $A$. Given a Coxeter element $c=s_{i_n}\cdots s_{i_1}$, we consider the operator $\mathrm{Pro}_c=\tau_{i_n}\cdots\tau_{i_1}$. We say $W$ is futuristic if for every nonempty finite convex set $\mathscr{L}$, every Coxeter element $c$, and every $u\in W$, there exists an integer $K\geq 0$ such that $\mathrm{Pro}_c^K(u)\in\mathscr{L}$. We prove that finite Coxeter groups, right-angled Coxeter groups, rank-3 Coxeter groups, affine Coxeter groups of types $\widetilde A$ and $\widetilde C$, and Coxeter groups whose Coxeter graphs are complete are all futuristic. When $W$ is finite, we actually prove that if $s_{i_N}\cdots s_{i_1}$ is a reduced expression for the long element of $W$, then $\tau_{i_N}\cdots\tau_{i_1}(W)=\mathscr{L}$; this allows us to determine the smallest integer $\mathrm{M}(c)$ such that $\mathrm{Pro}_c^{{\mathrm{M}}(c)}(W)=\mathscr{L}$ for all $\mathscr{L}$. We also exhibit infinitely many non-futuristic Coxeter groups, including all irreducible affine Coxeter groups that are not of type $\widetilde A$, $\widetilde C$, or $\widetilde G_2$.</description>

      <title>Fixed points and cycles of parking functions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.17110v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A parking function of length $n$ is a sequence $\pi=(\pi_1,\dots, \pi_n)$ of positive integers such that if $\lambda_1\leq\cdots\leq \lambda_n$ is the increasing rearrangement of $\pi_1,\dots,\pi_n$, then $\lambda_i\leq i$ for $1\leq i\leq n$. The index $i$ is a fixed point of the parking function $\pi$ if $\pi_i=i$. More generally, for $m\geq 1$, the indices $(i_1, \dots, i_m)$ where the $i_j$'s are all distinct constitute an $m$-cycle of the parking function $\pi$ if $\pi_{i_1}=i_2, \pi_{i_2}=i_3, \dots, \pi_{i_{m-1}}=i_m, \pi_{i_m}=i_1$. In this paper we obtain some exact results on the number of fixed points and cycles of parking functions. Our derivations are based on generalizations of Pollak's argument and the symmetry of parking coordinates. Extensions of our techniques are discussed.</description>

Abstract: We say a finite poset $P$ is a tree poset if its Hasse diagram is a tree. Let $k$ be the length of the largest chain contained in $P$. We show that when $P$ is a fixed tree poset, the number of $P$-free set systems in $2^{[n]}$ is $2^{(1+o(1))(k-1){n \choose \lfloor n/2\rfloor}}$. The proof uses a generalization of a theorem by Boris Bukh together with a variation of the multiphase graph container algorithm.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.04923v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The deduction game is a variation of the game of cops and robber on graphs in which searchers must capture an invisible evader in at most one move. Searchers know each others' initial locations, but can only communicate if they are on the same vertex. Thus, searchers must deduce other searchers' movement and move accordingly. We introduce the deduction number and study it for various classes of graphs. We provide upper bounds for the deduction number of the Cartesian product of graphs.</description>

      <title>A counterexample to conjecture "Catch 22"</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.14587</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.14587v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We construct a finite deterministic graphical (DG) game without Nash equilibria in pure stationary strategies. This game has 3 players $I=\{1,2,3\}$ and 5 outcomes: 2 terminal $a_1$ and $a_2$ and 3 cyclic. Furthermore, for 2 players a terminal outcome is the best: $a_1$ for player 3 and $a_2$ for player 1. Hence, the rank vector $r$ is at most $(1,2,1)$. Here $r_i$ is the number of terminal outcomes that are worse than some cyclic outcome for the player $i \in I$. This is a counterexample to conjecture ``Catch 22" from the paper ``On Nash-solvability of finite $n$-person DG games, Catch 22" (2021) arXiv:2111.06278, according to which, at least 2 entries of $r$ are at least 2 for any NE-free game. However, Catch 22 remains still open for the games with a unique cyclic outcome, not to mention a weaker (and more important) conjecture claiming that an $n$-person finite DG game has a Nash equilibrium (in pure stationary strategies) when $r = (0^n)$, that is, all $n$ entries of $r$ are 0; in other words, when the following condition holds:
  $\qquad\bullet$ ($C_0$) any terminal outcome is better than every cyclic one for each player.
  A game is play-once if each player controls a unique position. It is known that any play-once game satisfying ($C_0$) has a Nash equilibrium. We give a new and very short proof of this statement. Yet, not only conjunction but already disjunction of the above two conditions may be sufficient for Nash-solvability. This is still open.</description>

Abstract: A graph is Schur-positive if its chromatic symmetric function expands nonnegatively in the Schur basis. All claw-free graphs are conjectured to be Schur-positive. We introduce a combinatorial object corresponding to a graph G, called a special rim hook G-tabloid, which is a variation on the special rim hook tabloid. These objects can be employed to compute any Schur coefficient of the chromatic symmetric function of a graph. We construct sign-reversing maps on these special rim hook G-tabloids to obtain a recurrence relation for the Schur coefficients of a family of claw-free graphs called generalized nets, then we prove the entire family is Schur-positive. We subsequently determine an analogous recurrence relation for another, similar family of claw-free graphs. Thus, we demonstrate a new method for proving Schur-positivity of chromatic symmetric functions, which has the potential to be applied to make further progress toward the aforementioned conjecture.</description>

      <title>Polynomial and combinatorial analogues of Gauss congruence</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.05678v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The cyclic sieving phenomenon provides a link between a polynomial analogue of Gauss congruence known as $q$-Gauss congruence, and a combinatorial analogue of Gauss congruence based on sequences of cyclic group actions. We strengthen this link in two major ways: by characterising $q$-Gauss congruence via explicit formulae, and by developing a universal model for the combinatorics based on necklaces which allow beads to vary in both colour and length. This gives many novel examples of cyclic sieving involving necklaces, path walks, tubings and more. We extend the definition of Gauss congruence to sequences indexed by an arbitrary ranked semigroup, and synthesise known results into this theory.</description>

      <title>Generalizing the Bierbrauer-Friedman bound for orthogonal arrays</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.16559</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.16559v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We characterize mixed-level orthogonal arrays it terms of algebraic designs in a special multigraph. We prove a mixed-level analog of the Bierbrauer--Friedman (BF) bound for pure-level orthogonal arrays and show that arrays attaining it are radius-$1$ completely regular codes (equivalently, intriguing sets, equitable $2$-partitions, perfect $2$-colorings) in the corresponding multigraph. For the case when the numbers of levels are powers of the same prime number, we characterize, in terms of multispreads, additive mixed-level orthogonal arrays attaining the BF bound. For pure-level orthogonal arrays, we consider versions of the BF bound obtained by replacing the Hamming graph by its polynomial generalization and show that in some cases this gives a new bound.
  Keywords: orthogonal array, algebraic $t$-design, mixed orthogonal array, completely-regular code, equitable partition, intriguing set, Hamming graph, Bierbrauer-Friedman bound, additive code.</description>

      <title>Clique covers and decompositions of cliques of graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.05522</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.05522v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In 1966, Erd\H{o}s, Goodman, and P\'{o}sa showed that if $G$ is an $n$-vertex graph, then at most $\lfloor n^2/4 \rfloor$ cliques of $G$ are needed to cover the edges of $G$, and the bound is best possible as witnessed by the balanced complete bipartite graph. This was generalized independently by Gy\H{o}ri--Kostochka, Kahn, and Chung, who showed that every $n$-vertex graph admits an edge-decomposition into cliques of total `cost' at most $2 \lfloor n^2/4 \rfloor$, where an $i$-vertex clique has cost $i$. Erd\H{o}s suggested the following strengthening: every $n$-vertex graph admits an edge-decomposition into cliques of total cost at most $\lfloor n^2/4 \rfloor$, where now an $i$-vertex clique has cost $i-1$. We prove fractional relaxations and asymptotically optimal versions of both this conjecture and a conjecture of Dau, Milenkovic, and Puleo on covering the $t$-vertex cliques of a graph instead of the edges. Our proofs introduce a general framework for these problems using Zykov symmetrization, the Frankl-R\"odl nibble method, and the Szemer\'edi Regularity Lemma.</description>

      <title>Motif Estimation via Subgraph Sampling: The Fourth Moment Phenomenon</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2011.03026</link>
      <description>arXiv:2011.03026v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Network sampling is an indispensable tool for understanding features of large complex networks where it is practically impossible to search over the entire graph. In this paper, we develop a framework for statistical inference for counting network motifs, such as edges, triangles, and wedges, in the widely used subgraph sampling model, where each vertex is sampled independently, and the subgraph induced by the sampled vertices is observed. We derive necessary and sufficient conditions for the consistency and the asymptotic normality of the natural Horvitz-Thompson (HT) estimator, which can be used for constructing confidence intervals and hypothesis testing for the motif counts based on the sampled graph. In particular, we show that the asymptotic normality of the HT estimator exhibits an interesting fourth-moment phenomenon, which asserts that the HT estimator (appropriately centered and rescaled) converges in distribution to the standard normal whenever its fourth-moment converges to 3 (the fourth-moment of the standard normal distribution). As a consequence, we derive the exact thresholds for consistency and asymptotic normality of the HT estimator in various natural graph ensembles, such as sparse graphs with bounded degree, Erdos-Renyi random graphs, random regular graphs, and dense graphons.</description>

      <title>All Graphs with at most 8 nodes are 2-interval-PCGs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2202.13844</link>
      <description>arXiv:2202.13844v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A graph G is a multi-interval PCG if there exist an edge weighted tree T with non-negative real values and disjoint intervals of the non-negative real half-line such that each node of G is uniquely associated to a leaf of T and there is an edge between two nodes in G if and only if the weighted distance between their corresponding leaves in T lies within any such intervals. If the number of intervals is k, then we call the graph a k-interval-PCG; in symbols, G = k-interval-PCG (T, I1, . . . , Ik). It is known that 2-interval-PCGs do not contain all graphs and the smallest known graph outside this class has 135 nodes. Here we prove that all graphs with at most 8 nodes are 2-interval-PCGs, so doing one step towards the determination of the smallest value of n such that there exists an n node graph that is not a 2-interval-PCG.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2207.04775v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study a nonlinear recombination model from population genetics as a combinatorial version of the Kac-Boltzmann equation from kinetic theory. Following Kac's approach, the nonlinear model is approximated by a mean field linear evolution with a large number of particles. In our setting, the latter takes the form of a generalized random transposition dynamics. Our main results establish a uniform in time propagation of chaos with quantitative bounds, and a tight entropy production estimate for the generalized random transpositions, which holds uniformly in the number of particles. As a byproduct of our analysis we obtain sharp estimates on the speed of convergence to stationarity for the nonlinear equation, both in terms of relative entropy and total variation norm.</description>

      <title>Decomposition horizons and a characterization of stable hereditary classes of graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2209.11229</link>
      <description>arXiv:2209.11229v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The notions of bounded-size and quasibounded-size decompositions with bounded treedepth base classes are central to the structural theory of graph sparsity introduced by two of the authors years ago, and provide a characterization of both classes with bounded expansions and nowhere dense classes. Strong connections of this theory with model theory led to considering first-order transductions, which are logically defined graph transformations, and to initiate a comparative study of combinatorial and model theoretical properties of graph classes, with an emphasis on the model theoretical notions of dependence (or NIP) and stability. In this paper, we first prove that every hereditary class with quasibounded-size decompositions with dependent (resp.\ stable) base classes is itself dependent (resp.\ stable). This result is obtained in a more general study of ``decomposition horizons'', which are class properties compatible with quasibounded-size decompositions. We deduce that hereditary classes with quasibounded-size decompositions with bounded shrubdepth base classes are stable. In the second part of the paper, we prove the converse. Thus, we characterize stable hereditary classes of graphs as those hereditary classes that admit quasibounded-size decompositions with bounded shrubdepth base classes. This result is obtained by proving that every hereditary stable class of graphs admits almost nowhere dense quasi-bush representations, thus answering positively a conjecture of Dreier et al. These results have several consequences. For example, we show that every graph $G$ in a stable, hereditary class of graphs $\mathscr C$ has a clique or a stable set of size $\Omega_{\mathscr C,\epsilon}(|G|^{1/2-\epsilon})$, for every $\epsilon&gt;0$, which is tight in the sense that it cannot be improved to $\Omega_{\mathscr C}(|G|^{1/2})$.</description>

      <title>Exponential Mixing Via Additive Combinatorics</title>

      <description>arXiv:2305.00527v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We prove that the geodesic flow on a geometrically finite locally symmetric space of negative curvature is exponentially mixing with respect to the Bowen-Margulis-Sullivan measure. The approach is based on constructing a suitable anisotropic Banach space on which the infinitesimal generator of the flow admits an essential spectral gap. A key step in the proof involves estimating certain oscillatory integrals against the Patterson-Sullivan measure. For this purpose, we prove a general result of independent interest asserting that the Fourier transform of measures on $\mathbb{R}^d$ that do not concentrate near proper affine hyperplanes enjoy polynomial decay outside of a sparse set of frequencies. As an intermediate step, we show that the $L^q$-dimension ($1&lt;q\leq \infty$) of iterated self-convolutions of such measures tend towards that of the ambient space. Our analysis also yields that the Laplace transform of the correlation function of smooth observables extends meromorphically to the entire complex plane in the convex cocompact case and to a strip of explicit size beyond the imaginary axis in the case the manifold admits cusps.</description>

      <title>On the size of the Schur multiplier of finite groups</title>

      <description>arXiv:2309.02793v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We obtain bounds for the size of the Schur multiplier of finite $p$-groups and finite groups, which improve all existing bounds. Moreover, we obtain bounds for the size of the second cohomology group $H^2(G,\mathbb{Z}/p\mathbb{Z})$ of a $p$-group with coefficients in $\mathbb{Z}/p\mathbb{Z}$. Denoting the minimal number of generators of a $p$-group $G$ by $d(G)$, our bound depends on the parameters $|G|=p^n$, $|\gamma_2G|=p^k$, $d(G)=d$, $d(G/Z)=\delta$ and $d(\gamma_2G/\gamma_3G)=k'$. For special $p$-groups, we further improve our bound when $\delta-1 &gt; k'$. Moreover, given natural numbers $d$, $\delta$, $k$ and $k'$ satisfying $k=k'$ and $\delta-1 \leq k'$, we construct a capable $p$-group $H$ of nilpotency class two and exponent $p$ such that the size of the Schur multiplier attains our bound.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2312.07738v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Split Cayley hexagons of order two are distinguished finite geometries living in the three-qubit symplectic polar space in two different forms, called classical and skew. Although neither of the two yields observable-based contextual configurations of their own, {\it classically}-embedded copies are found to fully encode contextuality properties of the most prominent three-qubit contextual configurations in the following sense: for each set of unsatisfiable contexts of such a contextual configuration there exists some classically-embedded hexagon sharing with the configuration exactly this set of contexts and nothing else. We demonstrate this fascinating property first on the configuration comprising all 315 contexts of the space and then on doilies, both types of quadrics as well as on complements of skew-embedded hexagons. In connection with the last-mentioned case and elliptic quadrics we also conducted some experimental tests on a Noisy Intermediate Scale Quantum (NISQ) computer to substantiate our theoretical findings.</description>

Abstract: We consider optimal graphons associated with extreme and near-extreme constraints on the densities of edges and triangles. We prove that the optimizers for near-extreme constraints are unique and multipodal and are perturbations of the previously known unique optimzers for extreme constraints. This proves the existence of infinitely many phases. We determine the podal structures in these phases and prove the existence of phase transitions between them.</description>

      <title>Gapfree graphs and powers of edge ideals with linear quotients</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.06467</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.06467v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Let $I(G)$ be the edge ideal of a gapfree graph $G$. An open conjecture of Nevo and Peeva states that $I(G)^q$ has linear resolution for $q\gg 0$. We present a promising approach to this challenging conjecture by investigating the stronger property of linear quotients. Specifically, we make the conjecture that if $I(G)^q$ has linear quotients for some integer $q\geq 1$, then $I(G)^{s}$ has linear quotients for all $s\geq q$. We give a partial solution to this conjecture, and identify conditions under which only finitely many powers need to be checked. It is known that if $G$ does not contain a cricket, a diamond, or a $C_4$, then $I(G)^q$ has linear resolution for $q \geq 2$. We construct a family of gapfree graphs $G$ containing cricket, diamond, $C_4$ together with $C_5$ as induced subgraphs of $G$ for which $I(G)^q$ has linear quotients for $q \ge 2$.</description>

      <title>Euler-type recurrences for $t$-color and $t$-regular partition functions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.14344</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.14344v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We give Euler-like recursive formulas for the $t$-colored partition function when $t=2$ or $t=3,$ as well as for all $t$-regular partition functions. In particular, we derive an infinite family of ``triangular number" recurrences for the $3$-colored partition function. Our proofs are inspired by the recent work of Gomez, Ono, Saad, and Singh on the ordinary partition function and make extensive use of $q$-series identities for $(q;q)_{\infty}$ and $(q;q)_{\infty}^3.$</description>
