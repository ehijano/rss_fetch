      <title>SOLIDGEO: Measuring Multimodal Spatial Math Reasoning in Solid Geometry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.21177</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.21177v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Geometry is a fundamental branch of mathematics and plays a crucial role in evaluating the reasoning capabilities of multimodal large language models (MLLMs). However, existing multimodal mathematics benchmarks mainly focus on plane geometry and largely ignore solid geometry, which requires spatial reasoning and is more challenging than plane geometry. To address this critical gap, we introduce SolidGeo, the first large-scale benchmark specifically designed to evaluate the performance of MLLMs on mathematical reasoning tasks in solid geometry. SolidGeo consists of 3,113 real-world K-12 and competition-level problems, each paired with visual context and annotated with difficulty levels and fine-grained solid geometry categories. Our benchmark covers a wide range of 3D reasoning subjects such as projection, unfolding, spatial measurement, and spatial vector, offering a rigorous testbed for assessing solid geometry. Through extensive experiments, we observe that MLLMs encounter substantial challenges in solid geometry math tasks, with a considerable performance gap relative to human capabilities on SolidGeo. Moreover, we analyze the performance, inference efficiency and error patterns of various models, offering insights into the solid geometric mathematical reasoning capabilities of MLLMs. We hope SolidGeo serves as a catalyst for advancing MLLMs toward deeper geometric reasoning and spatial intelligence.</description>

      <title>Holes in Latent Space: Topological Signatures Under Adversarial Influence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.20435</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.20435v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Understanding how adversarial conditions affect language models requires techniques that capture both global structure and local detail within high-dimensional activation spaces. We propose persistent homology (PH), a tool from topological data analysis, to systematically characterize multiscale latent space dynamics in LLMs under two distinct attack modes -- backdoor fine-tuning and indirect prompt injection. By analyzing six state-of-the-art LLMs, we show that adversarial conditions consistently compress latent topologies, reducing structural diversity at smaller scales while amplifying dominant features at coarser ones. These topological signatures are statistically robust across layers, architectures, model sizes, and align with the emergence of adversarial effects deeper in the network. To capture finer-grained mechanisms underlying these shifts, we introduce a neuron-level PH framework that quantifies how information flows and transforms within and across layers. Together, our findings demonstrate that PH offers a principled and unifying approach to interpreting representational dynamics in LLMs, particularly under distributional shift.</description>

      <title>Polynomial 2D Green Coordinates for High-order Cages</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.06831</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.06831v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We propose conformal polynomial coordinates for 2D closed high-order cages, which consist of polynomial curves of any order. The coordinates enable the transformation of the input polynomial curves into polynomial curves of any order. We extend the classical 2D Green coordinates to define our coordinates, thereby leading to cage-aware conformal harmonic deformations. We extensively test our method on various 2D deformations, allowing users to manipulate the \Bezier control points to easily generate the desired deformation.</description>

      <title>Structure and generation of crossing-critical graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/1803.01931</link>
      <description>arXiv:1803.01931v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study c-crossing-critical graphs, which are the minimal graphs that require at least c edge-crossings when drawn in the plane. For c=1 there are only two such graphs without degree-2 vertices, K_5 and K_3,3, but for any fixed c&gt;1 there exist infinitely many c-crossing-critical graphs. It has been previously shown that c-crossing-critical graphs have bounded path-width and contain only a bounded number of internally disjoint paths between any two vertices. We expand on these results, providing a more detailed description of the structure of crossing-critical graphs. On the way towards this description, we prove a new structural characterisation of plane graphs of bounded path-width. Then we show that every c-crossing-critical graph can be obtained from a c-crossing-critical graph of bounded size by replicating bounded-size parts that already appear in narrow "bands" or "fans" in the graph. This also gives an algorithm to generate all the c-crossing-critical graphs of at most given order n in polynomial time per each generated graph.</description>
