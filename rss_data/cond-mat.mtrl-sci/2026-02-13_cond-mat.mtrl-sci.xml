      <title>Thermodynamics and kinetics of lithium at the silver-lithium battery interface</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.11430</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.11430v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Silver interlayers have been shown to enable smooth lithium deposition and cycling in anode-free solid-state batteries. Here, we report the atomic structure of the Ag and Li interface, showing that Li preferentially plates as FCC on both the (111) and (100) Ag surfaces. This forms an energetically favorable coherent interface with Ag, while the BCC phase forms a semi-coherent interface due to large lattice mismatch. We also calculate vacancy formation energies and migration energies for Li diffusion through the interface. We show that vacancy formation energies increase at the interface, leading to an energetic driving force for vacancies to diffuse away from the interface. Additionally, the migration barriers for vacancies from the Ag to the Li are small (29 meV), and therefore promote rapid alloying between Ag and Li. Rapid Li diffusion kinetics directly at the interface leads to smooth deposition of Li, reducing the onset of dendrites. However, diffusion in the 2nd and 3rd Li layers is slower compared to bulk FCC or BCC Li, leading to kinetically hindered alloying when multiple layers of pure Li form. The diffusion kinetics for Ag nanoparticles may be improved by alloying with Mg to expand the Ag lattice constant while forming a solid solution with both Ag and Li.</description>

      <title>Nanoscopic Imaging of Acoustic Dynamics in van der Waals Ferroelectric NbOI2</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.11504</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.11504v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Understanding how low-dimensional ferroelectrics respond to ultrafast excitation at nanoscales is essential for controlling energy flow and mechanical functionality in next-generation polar materials and devices. Here, we report spatiotemporally resolved structural dynamics in the van der Waals ferroelectric NbOI2 using combined ultrafast electron microscopy and diffraction. Above-band-gap photoexcitation rapidly screens the in-plane polarization and heats the lattice, launching three coherent acoustic phonons: two transverse shear modes and one longitudinal breathing mode. The transverse mode that shears the layers perpendicular to the in-plane polar axis dominates over that along the polar axis, reflecting anisotropic coupling between polarization and strain. Spatially resolved measurements further reveal spatially correlated heterogeneity in the mode amplitudes and lifetimes. Regions dominated by a single shear mode exhibit significantly longer lifetime of acoustic oscillations than that of multimode regions, suggesting that acoustic phonon-phonon scattering is a major source of decoherence. Our results provide a microscopic understanding of polarization-strain coupling and spatially heterogeneous energy dissipation in van der Waals ferroelectrics under ultrafast excitation.</description>

      <title>Nonmonotonic Magnetic Friction from Collective Rotor Dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.11526</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.11526v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Amontons' law postulates a monotonic relationship between frictional force and the normal load applied to a sliding contact. This empirical rule, however, fails in systems where internal degrees of freedom - such as structural or electronic order - play a central role. Here, we demonstrate that friction can emerge entirely from magnetically driven configurational dynamics in the absence of physical contact. Using a two-dimensional array of rotatable magnetic dipoles sliding over a commensurate magnetic substrate, we observe a pronounced non-monotonic dependence of friction on the interlayer separation, and thus on the effective load. The friction peaks at an intermediate distance where competing ferromagnetic and antiferromagnetic interactions induce dynamical frustration and hysteretic torque cycles during sliding. Molecular dynamics simulations and a simplified two-sublattice model confirm that energy dissipation is governed by collective magnetic reorientations and their hysteresis. Our results establish the occurrence of sliding-induced changes in collective magnetic order, which has a strong impact on friction, and thus open new possibilities for contactless friction control, magnetic sensing, and the design of reconfigurable, wear-free frictional interfaces and metamaterials.</description>

      <title>Efficient molecular dynamics simulation of 2D penta-silicene materials using machine learning potentials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.11548</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.11548v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Machine Learning Interatomic Potentials (MLIPs) are a modern computational method that allows achieving near-quantum mechanical accuracy (DFT) while still describing large-scale systems in molecular dynamics (MD) simulations. In this work, we use MLIP from DeepMD package and the classical Tersoff potential for SiC (Tersoff.SiC potential) to fully and accurately describe atomic interactions and apply them to molecular dynamics simulations of penta silicene sheet. The results show that the melting points (T$_g$) temperatures of the system in the canonical NVT and isobaric NPT sets are 632 K and 606 K, while the Tersoff.SiC potential have the high melting points, respectively. In addition, the radial distribution function exhibits characteristic peaks at interatomic distances of 2.275 \AA \text{} and 2.375 \AA, while the Tersoff.SiC potential only describe distance of 2.375 \AA. Furthermore, penta silicene was also simulated using on-the-fly machine learning for 10 ps to evaluate the structural stability of the system. This study investigates the thermodynamic properties of two-dimensional penta silicene sheets with pentagonal structures using a high-precision, cost-effective method, contributing further evidence to support experimental synthesis and opening up potential future applications of this material.</description>

      <title>How unconventional oxidation state Au$^{2+}$ is stabilized in halide perovskite Cs$_4$Au$_3$Cl$_{12}$: a first-principles study of its polaron crystal nature</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.11572</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.11572v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Gold in crystalline compounds is typically only stable in oxidation states Au1+ and Au3+. Even compounds with nominal Au2+ usually disproportionate into Au1+ and Au3+. Recently, Cs4Au3Cl12 was synthesized, where gold took the 2+ state in the bulk. Here, we investigate this compound using first-principles calculations and show that stabilization of the Au2+ ion is through the formation of a polaron crystal. The electronic and phononic structure suggest that the bonding network can be interpreted as a collection of [Au2+Cl4]2- and [Au3+Cl4]1- square planar motifs, and the crystal lacks a smooth pathway for Au2+ to disproportionate into Au1+ and Au3+. The electronic states of Au are contained within each [AuCl4] motif, which allows for the Au2+ state to be localized and isolated electronically. The Au2+-sites form an ordered structure, which is driven by a strong repulsive interaction between [Au2+Cl4]2- motifs due to their lattice distortion. The electron-phonon coupling between Au2+ and Cl explains the stability of Au2+, which suggests this material to be interpreted as a polaron crystal. By considering redox reaction, we show that Cs4Au3Cl12 has the maximal density of Au2+, and further oxidation will induce a delocalized state. Cs4Au3Cl12 has distinctive electronic structure, with a narrow gap, isolated HOMO and LUMO bands strongly localized at the Au-sites, and magnetization at the Au2+-sites making Cs4Au3Cl12 unique among quantum materials. Magnetism in gold is rare, and Cs4Au3Cl12 can be a testbed to explore novel gold chemistry as well as polaron crystal transport. The strategy to stabilize an unconventional oxidation state through engineering of lattice distortions is quite general; therefore, we propose that a similar approach will be applicable to a wide variety of transition metal compounds.</description>

      <title>Coupling Lattice Distortion and Cation Disorder to Control Li-ion Transport in Cation-Disordered Rocksalt Oxides</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.11579</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.11579v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Cation-disordered solids offer a rich chemical landscape where local coordination, lattice responses, and configurational disorder collectively, yet often implicitly, govern ion transport. In cation-disordered rocksalt oxides, Li+ diffusion has conventionally been rationalized by the static 0-transition-metal (0-TM) percolation rule, which assumes an ideal, passive lattice and thus fails to capture experimentally accessible capacities. Here, we show that lattice distortion is an essential, previously overlooked degree of freedom that actively reshapes Li+ percolation networks. By developing a lattice-responsive framework combining Monte Carlo sampling of cation configurations with machine-learning-accelerated molecular dynamics, we quantitatively predict Li+ percolation and electrochemical capacities within 5% of experiment. Our results reveal a causal coupling between lattice distortion and cation short-range order: enhanced local distortions precede and suppress short-range ordering, activating Li+ migration through nominally inaccessible 1-TM channels, fundamentally extending percolation beyond the 0-TM paradigm. Guided by this, we design and synthesize a high-entropy oxide, Li1.2Mn0.2Ti0.2V0.2Mo0.2O2, which exhibits enhanced distortion and achieves a 71.9% Li+ percolation network, surpassing 65.8% in Li1.2Mn0.4Ti0.4O2, delivering 256.3 mAh/g capacity, closely matching our prediction of 255.1 mAh/g. These findings establish lattice distortion as an active control parameter for ion transport, revising percolation concepts and offering a general design principle beyond metal-ion cathodes.</description>

      <title>Quantum Spin-1/2 Rings Built from [2]Triangulene Molecular Units</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.11593</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.11593v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum spin rings represent fundamental model systems that exhibit distinctive quantum phenomena-such as quantum critical behavior and quasiparticle excitations-arising from their periodic boundary conditions and enhanced quantum fluctuations. Here, we report the on-surface synthesis and atomic-scale characterization of antiferromagnetic S=1/2 quantum spin rings composed of pristine and unmodified [2]triangulene units on a Au(111) surface. Using stepwise on-surface synthesis followed by STM tip-induced dehydrogenation, we precisely constructed cyclic five- and six-membered spin rings and investigated their spin states via scanning probe microscopy and multireference calculations. Nc-AFM imaging reveals that the six-membered ring retains a planar geometry, whereas the five-membered ring exhibits pronounced structural distortion. The six-membered ring hosts a uniform excitation gap that can be accurately described by a Heisenberg spin model and multireference CASCI calculations. In contrast, the distorted five-membered ring displays spin ground states with asymmetric spatial distributions due to degeneracy lifting induced by structural distortion. Our findings establish a versatile molecular platform for exploring correlated magnetism and quantum spin phenomena in cyclic organic magnetic architectures with disorder.</description>

      <title>Strain-Driven Altermagnetic Spin Splitting Effect in RuO$_2$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.11602</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.11602v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The non-relativistic spin-momentum locking in altermagnets gives rise to a time-reversal-odd spin Hall effect, known as the altermagnetic spin-splitting effect (ASSE). Although ASSE was first reported in RuO$_2$, subsequent experiments have yielded inconsistent results, leaving its spin-transport mechanism unclear. Here, we systematically investigate how strain, crystal orientation, and the Hubbard $U$ parameter influence the magnetic ground state and spin Hall response of RuO$_2$. Guided by recent experimental observations, we find that $U$ is likely smaller than the value required to induce intrinsic magnetism, suggesting that bulk RuO$_2$ and (001)/(101) RuO$_2$ thin films grown on TiO$_2$ are nonmagnetic in the absence of extrinsic effects. In contrast, (100) and (110) films exhibit strain-induced altermagnetic spin splitting, leading to a strong ASSE even without Hubbard $U$ corrections. These results reconcile previous experimental discrepancies and provide design guidelines for RuO$_2$-based spintronic devices.</description>

      <title>Epitaxial Growth and Anomalous Hall Effect in High-Quality Altermagnetic $\alpha$-MnTe Thin Films</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.11645</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.11645v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The recent identification of $\alpha$-MnTe as a candidate altermagnet has attracted considerable interest, particularly for its potential application in magnetic random-access memory. However, the development of high-quality thin films - essential for practical implementation - has remained limited. Here, we report the epitaxial growth of centimeter-scale $\alpha$-MnTe thin films on InP(111) substrates via molecular beam epitaxy (MBE). Through X-ray diffraction (XRD) analysis, we construct a MnTe phase diagram that provides clear guidance for stabilizing the pure $\alpha$-MnTe phase, revealing that it is favored under high Te/Mn flux ratios and elevated growth temperatures. Cross-sectional electron microscopy confirms an atomically sharp film-substrate interface, consistent with a layer-by-layer epitaxial growth mode. Remarkably, these high-quality $\alpha$-MnTe films exhibit a pronounced anomalous Hall effect (AHE) originating from Berry curvature, despite a net magnetic moment approaching zero - a signature of robust altermagnetic character. Our work establishes a viable route for synthesizing wafer-scale $\alpha$-MnTe thin films and highlights their promise for altermagnet-based spintronics and magnetic sensing.</description>

      <title>Rust-accelerated powder X-ray diffraction simulation for high-throughput and machine-learning-driven materials science</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.11709</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.11709v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: High-throughput powder X-ray diffraction (XRD) simulations are a key prerequisite for generating large datasets used in the development of machine-learning models for XRD-based materials analysis. However, the widely used pymatgen powder XRD calculator, implemented entirely in Python, can be computationally inefficient for large-scale workloads, limiting throughput. We present XRD-Rust, a Rust-accelerated implementation of the pymatgen powder XRD calculator that maintains full compatibility with existing Python-based workflows. The method retains pymatgen for crystal structure handling and symmetry analysis while reimplementing the computationally intensive parts of the XRD calculation in Rust. Performance benchmarks were carried out on large crystallographic datasets from the Materials Cloud Three-Dimensional Structure Database (MC3D, 33 142 structures) and the Crystallography Open Database (COD 515 181). For the MC3D dataset, XRD-Rust achieves an average speedup of 4.7 +- 1.6 and a maximum speedup of 25, reducing computation from 34.9 s to 1.4 s. For the COD dataset, the average speedup is 6.1 +- 4.6 with a maximum speedup of 719 (1437 min to 2 min). These benchmarks demonstrate that XRD-Rust significantly accelerates powder XRD simulations, enabling efficient high-throughput dataset generation and improved performance in interactive diffraction analysis applications.</description>

      <title>Emergence of a spin Hall topological Hall effect in the non-collinear phase of the ferrimagnetic insulator terbium-iron garnet</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.11721</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.11721v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Magnetic compensation in rare-earth iron garnets (REIGs) offers a unique setting for which competing sublattice moments can give rise to non-collinear (canted) magnetic configurations, in which the sublattice magnetizations are not aligned with each other or with the external magnetic field. We show that this compensation regime can also host non-trivial magnetic textures. To explore this behavior, we investigated (111)-oriented epitaxial Tb$_3$Fe$_5$O$_{12}$/Pt heterostructures across the compensation temperature region using combined transverse magneto-transport and polar Kerr microscopy. Notably, we observe a topological Hall-like signal in the vicinity of the compensation temperature, a feature often interpreted as evidence for skyrmions in the absence of direct imaging. Here, in contrast, complementary Kerr microscopy reveals instead a non-collinear multidomain state which collapses outside the compensation regime, correlating directly with the appearance and disappearance of the spin Hall topological Hall effect (SH-THE) signal. These observations cannot be accounted for by a simple multi-anomalous-Hall-effect model, ruling out common artifacts as the origin, but indicate the presence of a topologically non-trivial contribution to the Hall response. These results establish strained REIG films as a tunable platform for exploring topological responses arising from compensation-driven non-collinear ferrimagnetic phases.</description>

      <title>Stacking-dependent magnetic ordering in bilayer ScI$_{2}$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.11781</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.11781v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Stacking-dependent magnetism in two-dimensional van der Waals materials offers an effective route for controlling magnetic order without chemical modification. Here, we present a combined first-principles and finite-temperature study of magnetic ordering in bilayer ScI$_{2}$ with different stacking configurations. Using density functional theory with Hubbard-U corrections, we investigate the structural, electronic, and magnetic properties of monolayer and bilayer ScI$_{2}$ in $AA$, $AB$, and $BA$ stackings. The electronic structure exhibits a spin-polarized ground state dominated by Sc-$d$ states near the Fermi level. Mapping total energies onto an effective Heisenberg spin Hamiltonian reveals strong intralayer ferromagnetic exchange that is largely insensitive to stacking, while the inter-layer exchange depends strongly on stacking geometry, favoring ferromagnetic coupling for $AA$ and $BA$ stackings and antiferromagnetic coupling for the $AB$ stacking. Spin-orbit coupling calculations show that both monolayer and bilayer ScI$_{2}$ possess a robust out-of-plane magnetic easy axis. Finite-temperature Monte Carlo simulations indicate that all bilayer configurations sustain magnetic ordering at and above room temperature, with ordering temperatures in the range $360-375$ K, as confirmed by Binder cumulant analysis and finite-size scaling. These results demonstrate that stacking geometry enables control of the magnetic ground state in bilayer ScI$_{2}$ without significantly affecting its thermal stability.</description>

      <title>Phaseless auxiliary-field quantum Monte Carlo method with spin-orbit coupling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.11866</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.11866v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Spin-orbit coupling (SOC) is incorporated into the phaseless plane-wave-based auxiliary-field quantum Monte Carlo (pw-AFQMC) method. This integration is implemented using optimized multiple-projector norm-conserving pseudopotentials, which are derived from the fully-relativistic (FR) atomic all-electron Dirac-like equation. The inclusion of SOC enables accurate phaseless pw-AFQMC calculations that capture both electronic correlation and SOC effects concurrently, greatly improving the method's applicability for studying systems containing heavy atoms. We discuss the form of FR pseudopotentials and detail the corresponding formulations of phaseless pw-AFQMC with a two-component Hamiltonian in the spinor basis. The accuracy of our approach is demonstrated by computing the dissociation energy of molecule I2 and the cohesive energy of bulk Pb, highlighting the large influence of SOC in both. Subsequently, we determine the transition pressure of the III-V compound InP from its zinc-blende to rock-salt phase by constructing and analyzing their respective equations of state.</description>

      <title>Thermodynamic Stability and Hydrogen Bonds in Mixed Halide Perovskites</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.12031</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.12031v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The stability of mixed halide perovskites against phase separation is crucial for their optoelectronic applications, yet difficult to rationalize due to the interplay of enthalpic, configurational, and dynamical effects. Here we present a simple thermodynamic framework for multicomponent halide perovskites of composition FA$_{1-x}$MA$_{x-y}$Cs$_y$Pb(I$_{1-z}$Br$_z$)$_3$, based on \textit{ab initio} molecular dynamics. By decomposing the free energy of mixing into enthalpic, configurational, and rotational entropic contributions, we show that although the enthalpy of mixing is generally positive, the solid solutions are thermodynamically stable against phase separation due to the large configurational entropy associated with random substitution on cation and halide sublattices. Mixing reduces the rotational entropy of the organic cations, partially offsetting the configurational stabilization. However, within our model, this rotational penalty is not sufficient to overcome the configurational driving force, and a curvature analysis within a regular-solution model does not predict a miscibility gap for any of the mixing channels considered. Analysis of hydrogen-bond dynamics shows that MA--Y (Y = I, Br) interactions are more persistent than FA--Y interactions, while the dominant FA-donated N$-$H$\cdots$I hydrogen bonds remain nearly composition-invariant. Cs-containing mixtures, in which Cs$^{+}$ forms no hydrogen bonds, can nevertheless be thermodynamically stable. These results demonstrate that hydrogen bonding does not control thermodynamic stability in mixed halide perovskites. Instead, phase stability is governed by the balance between strong configurational entropy and a smaller, systematically destabilizing rotational-entropy correction.</description>

      <title>Bond failure in peridynamics: Nonequivalence of critical stretch and critical energy density criteria</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.12061</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.12061v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper rigorously analyzes bond failure in the peridynamic theory of solid mechanics, which is a fundamental component of fracture modeling. We compare analytically and numerically two common bond-failure criteria:~{\em critical stretch} and~{\em critical energy density}. In the former, bonds fail when they stretch to a critical value, whereas in the latter, bonds fail when the bond energy density exceeds a threshold. By focusing the analysis on bond-based models, we prove mathematically that the critical stretch criterion and the critical energy density criterion are not equivalent in general and result in different bond-breaking and fracture phenomena. Numerical examples showcase the striking differences between the effect of the two criteria on crack dynamics, including the crack tip evolution, crack propagation, and crack branching.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2602.12068v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Two-dimensional unconventional magnetism has recently attracted growing interest due to its intriguing physical properties and promising applications in spintronics. However, existing studies on stacking-induced unconventional magnetism mainly focus on specific materials and stacking configurations. Here, we develop a general symmetry-based stacking theory for two-dimensional magnets. We first introduce spin layer groups as the fundamental symmetry framework, providing the essential magnetic symmetry information for the stacking theory. Based on this framework, we construct the complete set of 448 collinear spin layer groups for describing two-dimensional collinear magnets. Subsequently, we develop a general magnetic stacking theory applicable to arbitrary magnetic systems and derive its general solutions. Using CrF$_3$ as an illustrative example, we show how this theory enables designs of two-dimensional unconventional magnetism, as validated by first-principles calculations. We realize two-dimensional fully compensated ferrimagnetism through our stacking theory. Our work provides a general symmetry-guided platform for discovering and designing stacking-induced unconventional magnetism.</description>

      <title>A critical assessment of bonding descriptors for predicting materials properties</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.12109</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.12109v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Most machine learning models for materials science rely on descriptors based on materials compositions and structures, even though the chemical bond has been proven to be a valuable concept for predicting materials properties. Over the years, various theoretical frameworks have been developed to characterize bonding in solid-state materials. However, integrating bonding information from these frameworks into machine learning pipelines at scale has been limited by the lack of a systematically generated and validated database. Recent advances in high-throughput bonding analysis workflows have addressed this issue, and our previously computed Quantum-Chemical Bonding Database for Solid-State Materials was extended to include approximately 13,000 materials. This database is then used to derive a new set of quantum-chemical bonding descriptors. A systematic assessment is performed using statistical significance tests to evaluate how the inclusion of these descriptors influences the performance of machine-learning models that otherwise rely solely on structure- and composition-derived features. Models are built to predict elastic, vibrational, and thermodynamic properties typically associated with chemical bonding in materials. The results demonstrate that incorporating quantum-chemical bonding descriptors not only improves predictive performance but also helps identify intuitive expressions for properties such as the projected force constant and lattice thermal conductivity via symbolic regression.</description>

      <title>Kagome edge states under lattice termination, spin-orbit coupling, and magnetic order</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.12223</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.12223v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the edge state properties of a two-dimensional kagome lattice using a tight-binding approach, focusing on the role of lattice termination, spin-orbit coupling, and magnetic order. In the pristine limit, we show that the existence of localized edge states is highly sensitive to boundary geometry, with certain terminations completely suppressing edge modes. Kane-Mele spin-orbit coupling opens a bulk gap and stabilizes topologically protected helical edge states, yielding a robust $\mathbb{Z}_2$ insulating phase that is insensitive to termination details. In contrast, the combined effect of a Zeeman field and Rashba spin-orbit coupling drives the system into Chern insulating phases, with Chern numbers consistent with the number of chiral edge modes. We further demonstrate that non-coplanar magnetic textures generate multiple Chern phases through finite scalar spin chirality, with Kane-Mele coupling strongly tuning the topological gaps. Our results provide important insights into the tunability of edge states in the kagome lattice, which can be key to designing materials with novel electronic properties and topological phases.</description>

      <title>A Stochastic Cluster Expansion for Electronic Correlation in Large Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.12254</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.12254v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Accurate many-body treatments of condensed-phase systems are challenging because correlated solvers such as full configuration interaction (FCI) and the density matrix renormalization group (DMRG) scale exponentially with system size. Downfolding and embedding approaches mitigate this cost but typically require prior selection of a correlated subspace, which can be difficult to determine in heterogeneous or extended systems. Here, we introduce a stochastic cluster expansion framework for efficiently recovering the total correlation energy of large systems with near-DMRG accuracy, without the need to select an active space a priori. By combining correlation contributions from randomly sampled environment orbitals with an exactly treated subspace of interest, the method reproduces total energies for non-reacting and reactive systems while drastically reducing computational cost. The approach also provides a quantitative diagnostic for molecule-solvent correlation, guiding principled embedding decisions. This framework enables systematically improvable many-body calculations in extended systems, opening the door to high-accuracy studies of chemical processes in condensed phase environments.</description>

      <title>Revealing Exotic Nanophase Iron in Lunar Samples Through Impact-Driven Spatial Fingerprints</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.11317</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.11317v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Nanophase iron (npFe) plays a crucial role in controlling the optical, chemical, and physical evolution of lunar regolith grains. While in-situ formation of npFe via reduction of native Fe-bearing minerals has long been considered a dominant pathway, recent mineralogical evidence from X.Zeng et al. (2025) reveals that the source of a significant fraction of npFe may be delivered directly by exotic micrometeoroid impacts (exotic npFe). Yet the atomic-scale processes governing how exotic np-Fe forms and survives during hypervelocity impacts remain largely unknown. To quantitatively compare in-situ and exotic delivery and formation of npFe, we perform a series of innovative atomistic modeling of micrometeoroid impacts with distinct projectile target compositions: (1) SiO$_2$ projectiles on Fe$_2$SiO$_4$ targets (in-situ formation), (2) Fe$_2$SiO$_4$ projectiles on SiO$_2$ targets (exotic delivery). Our results reveal distinct mechanistic fingerprints: in-situ np-Fe forms diffusely and radially around the impact site, whereas exotic np-Fe is efficiently retained and concentrated in asymmetric, momentum-aligned clusters. These contrasting spatial signatures provide a potential diagnostic criterion for distinguishing exotic versus in-situ np-Fe in returned lunar soils. In agreement with Chang'e-5 observations, our simulations demonstrate that exotic np-Fe production can be substantial, particularly in Fe-poor terrains such as highland regions. These findings highlight the need to account for exotic np-Fe when interpreting space weathering processes and remote-sensing data for the Moon and other airless bodies.</description>

      <title>A physics-informed data-driven framework for modeling hyperelastic materials with progressive damage and failure</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.11414</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.11414v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This work presents a two-stage physics-informed, data-driven constitutive modeling framework for hyperelastic soft materials undergoing progressive damage and failure. The framework is grounded in the concept of hyperelasticity with energy limiters and employs Gaussian Process Regression (GPR) to separately learn the intact (undamaged) elastic response and damage evolution directly from data. In Stage I, GPR models learn the intact hyperelastic response through volumetric and isochoric response functions (or only the isochoric response under incompressibility), ensuring energetic consistency of the intact response and satisfaction of fundamental principles such as material frame indifference and balance of angular momentum. In Stage II, damage is modeled via a separate GPR model that learns the mapping between the intact strain energy density predicted by Stage I models and a stress-reduction factor governing damage and failure, with monotonicity, non-negativity, and complete-failure constraints enforced through penalty-based optimization to ensure thermodynamic admissibility. Validation on synthetic datasets, including benchmarking against analytical constitutive models and competing data-driven approaches, demonstrates high in-distribution accuracy under uniaxial tension and robust generalization from limited training data to compression and shear modes not used during training. Application to experimental brain tissue data demonstrates the practical applicability of the framework and enables inference of damage evolution and critical failure energy. Overall, the proposed framework combines the physical consistency, interpretability, and generalizability of analytical models with the flexibility, predictive accuracy, and automation of machine learning, offering a powerful approach for modeling failure in soft materials under limited experimental data.</description>

      <title>Structural control of two-level defect density revealed by high-throughput correlative measurements of Josephson junctions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2602.11469v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Materials defects in Josephson junctions (JJs), often referred to as two-level systems (TLS), couple to superconducting qubits and are a critical bottleneck for scalable quantum processors. Despite their importance, understanding the microscopic sources of TLS and how to mitigate them has remained a major challenge. Here, we demonstrate a high-throughput, correlated approach to trace the microstructural origins of strongly-coupled TLS in Josephson circuits. We assembled a massive dataset of TLS across 6,000 Al/AlOx/Al JJs and more than 600 atomic resolution transmission electron microscopy images. We statistically link fabrication, microstructure, and TLS occurrence, revealing a strong correlation between Al electrode thickness, Al grain size, and TLS density. Correspondingly, we find a two-thirds reduction in TLS prompted by a change in electrode fabrication parameters. These results demonstrate a robust, data-driven methodology to understand and control defects in quantum circuits and pave the way for significantly reducing TLS density.</description>

      <title>Charge density wave and superconductivity modulated by c-axis stacking in the TaSe2 polytypes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.11582</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.11582v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The layered transition metal dichalcogenide, TaSe2, exhibits rich electronic phenomena across its polymorphs, 1T, 2H, and 3R, largely driven by differences in atomic coordination and c-axis stacking. In the 1T phase, octahedral coordination and AA stacking promote strong interlayer coupling and stabilize a commensurate charge density wave (CDW) with star-of-David clusters that set in at high temperatures. The 2H phase exhibits trigonal prismatic coordination with AB stacking, and hosts both incommensurate and commensurate CDW phases and weak superconductivity at very low temperatures. The 3R phase, characterized by ABC stacking and trigonal prismatic coordination, exhibits enhanced superconductivity along with CDW order, attributed to modified interlayer hybridization and reduced CDW competition. These stacking-dependent variations in interlayer coupling are critical in tuning correlated states in the dichalcogenides.</description>

      <title>Emergence of a Helical Metal in Rippled Ultrathin Topological Insulator Sb\textsubscript{2}Te\textsubscript{3} on Graphene</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.11932</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.11932v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The integration of topological insulators (TIs) with graphene offers a pathway to engineer hybrid quantum states, yet the impact of strain at the 2D limit remains a critical open question. Here, we investigate the structural properties of ultrathin (1 quintuple layer) Sb$_2$Te$_3$ grown on single-layer graphene and, motivated by the structural modulations observed at the TI surface, explore theoretically how such nanoscale corrugations may influence the electronic behavior of the system. Using low-temperature scanning tunneling microscopy (LT-STM), we observe a periodic rippling of the heterostructure with a wavelength of ~$\sim8.7$ nm. Energetic analysis reveals that these ripples are not intrinsic but are driven by strain from the substrate during cooling. Density functional theory (DFT) calculations show that while the ideal flat heterostructure exhibits a hybridization gap of $\sim40$ meV, the ripple-induced structural modulation closes this gap, restoring a metallic state. This gapless phase is not a trivial metal. By combining an effective moir\'e ladder model with spin-resolved DFT, we find that the proximity-induced spin-orbit coupling is redistributed across a dense manifold of minibands. The resulting ``Helical Metal'' has a complex spin-texture beyond a simple Rashba splitting. Remarkably, while the flat system is effectively spinless in this ultrathin limit due to hybridization, the ripples actively restore the spin polarization. Our findings suggest that rippled TI/graphene heterostructures provide an interesting platform to develop spintronics, where geometric modulation unlocks dense helical states that are inaccessible in the pristine flat limit.</description>

      <title>Tuning Optical Properties of FTO via Carbonaceous Al2O3 Microdot Deposition by DC plasma sputtering</title>

      <description>arXiv:2602.11970v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Fluorine-doped tin oxide (FTO) is a key transparent conductive oxide for photovoltaic and optoelectronic devices, yet its high reflectance limits light-trapping efficiency. This work demonstrates a simple DC plasma sputtering approach to deposit carbonaceous Al2O3 microdots on FTO under controlled Ar, O2, and Ar-O2 atmospheres. For plasma discharge in the normal mode, with plasma density 10^-9 cm^-3 and temperature of 2 eV, Volmer-Weber growth produced discrete microdots whose size and distribution were tuned by gas composition: dense, uniform dots in Ar (approximately 0.89 um radius), agglomerated structures in O2, and intermediate morphologies in mixed atmospheres. Structural analysis confirmed gamma-Al2O3 formation with carbon incorporation, while SEM revealed morphology-driven optical behavior. UV-Vis measurements showed that Ar-O2 coatings achieved the lowest reflectance across the visible range, outperforming bare FTO and other conditions. These findings establish a clear link between sputtering parameters, surface morphology, and optical performance, offering a scalable route to anti-reflective, light-trapping coatings for next-generation solar cells and optoelectronic devices.</description>

      <title>Topological chiral random walker</title>

      <description>arXiv:2602.12020v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Understanding how biological and synthetic systems achieve robust function in noisy environments remains a fundamental challenge across the physical and life sciences. To connect robust behavior with non-trivial topological features present already in the dynamics of individual units, here we introduce the topological chiral random walker (TCRW) model. While exploring the system, a TCRW locates edges and boundaries in the system and develops topologically protected edge currents even in the presence of defects and disorder. Drawing on the bulk-boundary correspondence found in hard condensed matter systems allows us to rationalize the emergence of robust edge currents through topological features of the dynamic spectrum. We show that chiral motion and rotational noise with opposite chirality are two crucial components in our inherently non-Hermitian model. As proofs of principle, we first show that a topological walker outperforms diffusive motion to efficiently solve complex mazes due to its property of remaining on the edge with some rare detachments. Second, we use this model to design building blocks that can perform efficient self-assembly overcoming the timescale bottlenecks of diffusion-limited growth and reducing self-assembly times by approximately 80%.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2602.12168v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Topological boundary modes, a hallmark of quantum topological phases, remarkably occur in classical mechanical systems through an interesting correspondence with the quantum case. Here, we explore the Maxwell lattice frustrated Mott insulators and argue that the combination of the intrinsic spin-lattice coupling and the spin exchanges could induce the topological mechanics with topological boundary floppy modes in the phonon spectra. This mechanism and phenomena are dubbed magnetic topological mechanics, or, magnetopological mechanics in short. Focusing on a two-dimensional kagom\'e lattice spin model, we illustrate how strong spin-lattice coupling drives a spontaneous lattice distortion, resulting in the topological Maxwell lattice with the topological polarization and non-trivial phonon spectra. Moreover, the magnetic field, that directly changes the spin state, indirectly influences the lattice structure via the spin-lattice coupling, thereby providing a method to control the Maxwell lattice and the boundary modes.

      <title>Vision Transformer for Multi-Domain Phase Retrieval in Coherent Diffraction Imaging</title>

      <description>arXiv:2602.12255v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Bragg coherent diffraction imaging (BCDI) phase retrieval becomes rapidly difficult in the strong-phase regime, where a crystal contains distortions beyond half a lattice spacing. An important special case is the phase domain problem, where blocks of a crystal are displaced with sharp jumps at domain walls. The strong-phase, here defined as beyond $\pm \pi/2$, generates split Bragg peaks and dense fringe structure for which classical iterative solvers often stagnate or return different solutions from different initialisations. Here, we introduce an unsupervised Fourier Vision Transformer (Fourier ViT) to solve this block-phase, multi-domain phase-retrieval problem directly from measured 2D Bragg diffraction intensities. Fourier ViT couples reciprocal-space information globally through multiscale Fourier token mixing, while shallow convolutional front and back-ends provide local filtering and reconstruction. We validate the approach on large-scale synthetic datasets of Voronoi multi-domain crystals with strong-phase contrast under realistic noise corruptions, and on experimental diffraction from a $\mathrm{La}_{2-x}\mathrm{Ca}_x\mathrm{MnO}_4$ nanocrystal. Across the regimes considered, Fourier ViT achieves the lowest reciprocal-space mismatch ($\chi^2$) among the compared methods and preserves domain-resolved phase reconstructions for increasing numbers of domains. On experimental data, with the same real-space support, Fourier ViT matches the iterative benchmark $\chi^2$ while improving robustness to random initialisations, yielding a higher success rate of low-$\chi^2$ reconstructions than the complex convolutional neural network baseline.</description>

      <title>Altermagnetic Skyrmions in 2D Lattices Exhibiting Anisotropic Skyrmion Hall Effect</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.05154</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.05154v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Anisotropic skyrmion Hall effect (A-SkHE) in two-dimensional (2D) magnetic systems represents a captivating phenomenon in condensed-matter physics and materials science. While conventional antiferromagnetic systems inherently suppress this effect through parity-time symmetry-mediated cancellation of Magnus forces acting on skyrmions, A-SkHE is primarily confined to ferromagnetic platforms. Here, we present a paradigm-shifting demonstration of this phenomenon in spin-splitting 2D antiferromagnets through the investigation of altermagnetic skyrmions. Combining comprehensive symmetry analysis with theoretical modeling, we elucidate the mechanism governing A-SkHE realization in 2D altermagnetic systems and establish a quantitative relationship between the transverse velocity of altermagnetic skyrmions and applied current orientation. Using first-principles calculations and micromagnetic simulations, this mechanism is further illustrated in a prototypical altermagnetic monolayer V2SeTeO. Crucially, we identify that the [C2C4zt] symmetry-protected anisotropic field serves as the critical stabilizer for maintaining the A-SkHE in this system. Our results greatly enrich the research on 2D altermagnetism and skyrmions.</description>

      <title>Performance Improvement of Deorbitalized Exchange-Correlation Functionals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.00953</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.00953v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Deorbitalization of a conventional meta-generalized-gradient exchange-correlation approximation replaces its dependence upon the Kohn-Sham kinetic energy density with a dependence on the density gradient and Laplacian. In principle, that simplification should provide improved computational performance relative to the original meta-GGA form because of the shift from an orbital-dependent generalized Kohn-Sham potential to a true KS local potential. Often that prospective gain is lost because of problematic roughness in the density caused by the density Laplacian and consequent roughness in the exchange-correlation potential from the resulting higher-order spatial derivatives of the density in it. We address the problem by constructing a deorbitalizer based on the RPP deorbitalizer [Phys. Rev. Mater. 6, 083803 (2022)] with comparative smoothness of the potential along with retention of constraint satisfaction as design goals. Applied to the r^2SCAN exchange-correlation functional [J. Phys. Chem. Lett. 11, 8208 (2020)], we find substantial timing improvements for solid-state calculations over both r^2SCAN and its earlier deorbitalization for high precision calculations of structural properties, while improving upon the accuracy of RPP deorbitalization for both solids and molecules.</description>

      <title>Observation of Hexagonal Close-Packed Water Ice at Conditions in Ice Giant Planetary Interiors</title>

Abstract: Knowing the phase transformations in dense water ice is key to unraveling the peculiar geophysical properties of Uranus and Neptune, whose stratified interior models predict a thick ice layer beneath a convective ionic fluid layer. In the latter, water ice is currently assumed to adopt an fcc superionic structure, a phase that has recently been observed experimentally. Here, we report the observation of an hcp ice phase under such planetary conditions, using synchrotron x-ray diffraction in laser-heated diamond anvil cells. Between 80 and 200 GPa, we observe the coexistence of fcc and hcp ices, arising from stacking disorder developing within the fcc oxygen lattice upon temperature cycling. Above 200 GPa, the hcp phase dominates at high temperature, indicating increased thermodynamic stability upon entering a superionic state suggested by an anomalous thermal expansion. An anisotropic proton conductivity of superionic hcp ice, and the existence of a fcc-hcp martensitic transition may have planetary implications for dynamo models and for the dynamics of the ice mantle.</description>

      <title>Photoluminescence Quenching in WSe$_2$ via p-Doping Induced by Functionalized Rylene Dyes</title>

Abstract: Hybrid heterostructures combining transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDs) with light-harvesting dyes are promising materials for next-generation optoelectronics. Yet, controlling and understanding interfacial charge transfer mechanisms in these complex systems remains a major challenge. Here, we investigate the microscopic origin of photoluminescence (PL) quenching in $\text{WSe}_2$ functionalized with a novel, strongly electron-deficient perylene monoimide dye, $\text{CN}_4\text{PMI}$. Experimentally, the hybridization induces a $\sim$97\% PL quenching in $\text{WSe}_2$, confirming substantial static charge transfer and increased $p$-doping from the dye. To isolate the dominant electronic mechanism, we investigate from first principles various interface morphologies, including differing molecular orientations and layer thicknesses. Our density-functional theory results confirm that $\text{CN}_4\text{PMI}$ acts as a strong electron acceptor, inducing $p$-doping and forming a type-II level alignment with all considered configurations, giving rise to a small or vanishing band gap. Based on these findings, we attribute the observed PL suppression in $\text{WSe}_2$ to these strong electronic interactions with the dye. Our study provides a clear and validated strategy for tailoring the electronic structure of TMDs through targeted, electron-deficient organic functionalization.</description>

      <title>Parameter-free prediction of irradiation defect structures in tungsten at room temperature using stochastic cluster dynamics</title>

Abstract: The foundations of irradiation damage theory were laid in the 1950s and 60s within the framework of chemical reaction kinetics. While helpful to analyze qualitative aspects of irradiation damage, the theory contained gaps that delayed its implementation and applicability as a predictive tool. The advent of computer simulations with atomistic resolution in the 80s and 90s revealed a series of mechanisms that have proved essential to understand key aspects of irradiation damage in crystalline solids. However, we still lack a comprehensive model that can connect atomic-level defect physics with experimental measurements of quantitative features of the irradiated microstructure. In this work, we present a mesoscale model that draws from our improved understanding of irradiation damage processes collected over the last few decades, bridging knowledge gained from our most sophisticated atomistic simulations with defect kinetics taking place over time scales many orders of magnitude larger than atomic interaction times. Importantly, the model contains no adjustable parameters and combines several essential pieces of irradiation damage physics: each playing an irreplaceable role in the context of the full model but of limited utility if considered in isolation. Crucially, we carry out a set of experiments carefully designed to isolate the key irradiation damage variables and facilitate validation. Using tungsten as a model material, we find exceptionally good agreement between our numerical predictions and experimental measurements of defect densities and defect cluster sizes.</description>

      <title>Transition Metal Dichalcogenide MoS${}_2$: oxygen and fluorine functionalization for selective plasma processing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.11891</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.11891v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Low-temperature plasma processing is a promising technique for tailoring the properties of transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDs) because it allows for precise control of radical and ion energies and fluxes. For chalcogen substitution, a key challenge is to identify the ion energy window that enables selective chalcogen removal while preserving the metal lattice. Using ab-initio molecular dynamics (AIMD), we demonstrate that oxygen and fluorine functionalization through thermal chemisorption significantly lowers the sputtering energy threshold ($E_{sputt}$) of MoS${}_2$ from $\sim 35$ eV to $\sim 10$ eV. In addition, we find that a non-orthogonal impact angle $\sim 30{}^{\circ}$ reduces the sputtering energy threshold, while cryogenic-range TMD temperatures may increase. To explain the observed trends, a multi-step sputtering mechanism is proposed. Our results show that oxygen/fluorine functionalization, impact angle, and material temperature are key control parameters for selective, damage-free chalcogen removal in TMD processing.</description>

      <title>Tuning Terahertz Optomechanics of MoS2 Bilayers with Homogeneous In-plane Strain</title>

      <description>arXiv:2602.03996v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Homogeneous in-plane biaxial tensile strain strengthens the out-of-plane van der Waals interaction in \MoS\ bilayers (BLs) and can be used to fine-tune their terahertz (THz) oscillations. Using ultralow-frequency Raman spectroscopy on hexagonal (2H) and rhombohedral (2R) stacked BLs, we observe a hardening of the interlayer breathing modes originating from a strain-induced Poisson contraction of the vdW separation between the layers, and characterized by an effective out-of-plane Poisson's ratio of $\nu_\mathrm{eff} \approx 0.19\text{--}0.24$. Strikingly, this geometric contraction drives the system into a highly repulsive regime of the intermolecular potential, corresponding to a Gr\"uneisen parameter of $\gamma \approx 10\text{--}14$. This value surpasses even the `giant' one reported for phosphorene, establishing these van der Waals BLs as highly tunable nonlinear mechanical platforms that can be addressed at the THz regime, couple strongly with light, and do not need external pressure knobs.</description>

      <title>Distorted polyhedral architecture enabled high thermoelectric performance of columnar double halide perovskites Cs2AgPdCl5 and Cs2AgPtCl5</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.10789</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.10789v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate the thermoelectric properties of two newly synthesized columnar double halide perovskites Cs$_2$AgPdCl$_5$ and Cs$_2$AgPtCl$_5$. These materials accommodate a distorted local polyhedral architecture with tetrahedral symmetry compared to traditional double halide perovskites. By employing density functional theory along with the semiclassical transport model, we have analyzed the electronic and transport properties of these materials. Our results show that at 800 K, the largest figure of merit ($zT$) is 1.30 (0.86) for p-type (n-type) Cs$_2$AgPdCl$_5$ and 0.87 for n-type Cs$_2$AgPtCl$_5$ at doping concentrations of $1.94 \times 10^{20}$ ($3.76 \times 10^{19}$) cm$^{-3}$ and $3.52 \times 10^{19}$ cm$^{-3}$, respectively. Remarkably, a very low doping concentration is required to achieve a high $zT$, setting these materials apart from others in this field. Our calculations demonstrate that Cs$_2$AgPdCl$_5$ benefits from the presence of conduction and valence band valleys near the band edges; however, the flat bands present in the valence band of Cs$_2$AgPtCl$_5$ do not improve its thermoelectric performance. Among these systems, hole doping in Cs$_2$AgPdCl$_5$ has shown remarkable thermoelectric performance. Interestingly, the local octahedral distortions present in these perovskites contribute to a marked reduction in the lattice thermal conductivity to 0.27 W/mK in Cs$_2$AgPtCl$_5$ and 0.20 W/mK in Cs$_2$AgPdCl$_5$ by causing enhanced phonon scattering, further improving the thermoelectric figure of merit. This drop in thermal conductivity, combined with the favorable electronic properties, underscores the potential use of these materials for applications in highly efficient thermoelectric devices.</description>

Abstract: First principles real-time time dependent density functional theory (rt-TDDFT) calculations reveal the existence of ballistic photocurrents generated by Coulomb scattering, which has not previously been considered as a mechanism for the bulk photovoltaic effect. With monolayer GeS as an example, it is predicted that ballistic currents can be comparable to shift currents under experimentally accessible conditions.</description>
