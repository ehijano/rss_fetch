      <title>A mean field analysis of the role of indirect transmission in emergent infection events</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.09587</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.09587v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We developed a mathematical model to investigate the role of indirect transmission in the spread of infectious diseases, using the illustrative example of sarcoptic mange as a case study. This disease can be transmitted through direct contact between an infected host and a susceptible one, or indirectly when potential hosts encounter infectious mites and larvae deposited in the environment, commonly referred to as fomites. Our focus is on exploring the potential of these infectious reservoirs as triggers for emerging infection events and as stable reservoirs of the disease. To achieve this, our mean field compartmental model incorporates the epidemiological dynamics driven by indirect transmission via fomites. We identify different types of dynamics that the system can go into, controlled by different levels of direct and indirect transmission. Among these, we find a new regime where the disease can emerge and persist over time solely through fomites, without the necessity for direct transmission. This possibility of the system reveals an evolutionary pathway that could enable the parasite to enhance its fitness beyond host co-evolution. We also define a new threshold based on an effective reproductive number, that enables us to predict the conditions for disease persistence. Our model allows us to assess the potential effectiveness of various disease intervention measures by incorporating a feature observed in real systems. We hope this contributes to a better understanding of infectious disease outbreaks.</description>

      <title>A Study on Lampreys Population Based on Sex-Ratio-Related Growth-Balance Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.10411</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.10411v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Lampreys are one of the oldest species in the world, living longer than dinosaurs, which is related to the ability to change the sex ratio during their lifespan. In this paper, to understand how sex ratio and food quantity affect the population growth rate of lampreys, the researchers draw inspiration from the logistics model and established a model called EcoSexChange(ESC), which results in a population initially increasing and then stabilizing, a reasonable outcome that may apply to other organisms with significant differences in consumption between sexes. Subsequently, this paper develops the Sex Ratio Adaptation Eco Impact (SRAEI) model based on the ESC model using the ABM algorithm to simulate how the population of lampreys, whose lives are divided into seven stages, grows and stabilizes. Then introduces a sudden disaster factor in the middle of the simulation, while also comparing lampreys that cannot adjust their sex ratio. The results of this paper are of great reference significance for people to analyze the population changes of lampreys in different living environments, and they are also easy to apply to other species with large differences between males and females.</description>

      <title>Formation of human kinship structures depending on population size and cultural mutation rate</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.10553</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.10553v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: How does social complexity depend on population size and cultural transmission? Kinship structures in traditional societies provide a fundamental illustration, where cultural rules between clans determine people's marriage possibilities. Here we propose a simple model of kinship interactions that considers kin and in-law cooperation and sexual rivalry. In this model, multiple societies compete. Societies consist of multiple families with different cultural traits and mating preferences. These values determine interactions and hence the growth rate of families and are transmitted to offspring with mutations. Through a multilevel evolutionary simulation, family traits and preferences are grouped into multiple clans with inter-clan mating preferences. It illustrates the emergence of kinship structures as the spontaneous formation of interdependent cultural associations. Emergent kinship structures are characterized by the cycle length of marriage exchange and the number of cycles in society. We numerically and analytically clarify their parameter dependence. The relative importance of cooperation versus rivalry determines whether attraction or repulsion exists between families. Different structures evolve as locally stable attractors. The probabilities of formation and collapse of complex structures depend on the number of families and the mutation rate, showing characteristic scaling relationships. It is now possible to explore macroscopic kinship structures based on microscopic interactions, together with their environmental dependence and the historical causality of their evolution. We propose the basic causal mechanism of the formation of typical human social structures by referring to ethnographic observations and concepts from statistical physics and multilevel evolution. Such interdisciplinary collaboration will unveil universal features in human societies.</description>

      <title>Adaptive Dynamics of Diverging Fitness Optima</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.00829</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.00829v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We analyse a non-local parabolic integro-differential equation modelling the evolutionary dynamics of a phenotypically-structured population in a changing environment. Such models arise in a variety of contexts from climate change to chemotherapy to the ageing body. The main novelty is that there are two locally optimal traits, each of which shifts at a possibly different linear velocity. We determine sufficient conditions to guarantee extinction or persistence of the population in terms of associated eigenvalue problems. When it does not go extinct, we analyse the solution in the long time, small mutation limits. If the optimas have equal shift velocities, the solution concentrates on a point set of "lagged optima" which are strictly behind the true shifting optima. If the shift velocities are different, we determine that the solution in fact concentrates as a Dirac delta function on the positive lagged optimum with maximum lagged fitness, which depends on the true optimum and the rate of shift. Our results imply that for populations undergoing competition in temporally changing environments, both the true optimal fitness and the required rate of adaptation for each of the diverging optimal traits contribute to the eventual dominance of one trait.</description>

      <title>Smectic-like bundle formation of planktonic bacteria upon nutrient starvation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.05031</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.05031v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Bacteria aggregate through various intercellular interactions to build biofilms, but the effect of environmental changes thereupon remains largely unexplored. Here, by using an experimental device that overcomes past difficulties, we observed the collective response of Escherichia coli aggregates against dynamic changes in the growth condition. We discovered that nutrient starvation caused bacterial cells to arrange themselves into bundle-shaped clusters, developing a structure akin to that of smectic liquid crystal. The degree of the smectic-like bundle order was evaluated by a deep learning approach. Our experiments suggest that both the depletion attraction by extracellular polymeric substances and the growth arrest are essential for the bundle formation. Since these effects of nutrient starvation at the single-cell level are common to many bacterial species, bundle formation might also be common collective behavior that bacterial cells may exhibit under harsh environments.</description>
