      <title>Commonly Graded Algebras and Their Homological Properties</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.06068</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.06068v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this article, we study bounded-below locally finite $\mathbb{Z}$-graded algebras, which are referred to as commonly graded algebras in literature. Commonly graded algebras have almost similar theory as that of connected graded algebras, but sometimes the results need different methods of proof. We give several characterizations of commonly graded AS-Gorenstein algebras, and show that any noetherian commonly graded AS-Gorenstein algebra admits a balanced dualizing complex.
  We then study (skew) Calabi-Yau properties of commonly graded algebras, and give an example of graded algebra which is skew Calabi-Yau in ungraded sense but not in graded sense. We demonstrate that a noetherian commonly graded algebra is AS-regular if and only if the bounded derived category of its finite-dimensional graded modules constitutes a ``twisted" Calabi-Yau category. At the end of the article, we prove that the Auslander-Buchsbaum formula, along with the Bass theorem and the No-Hole theorem hold for commonly graded algebras under appropriate conditions.</description>

      <title>Extension Monads: Some Structure Theorems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.05828</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.05828v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the behavior of extension monads, introduced in the 1990s by the second author, in terms of structure results for infinitely many finitary operations and common constructions in varieties or categories of algebras. Specifically, we see that for finite collections of algebras of the same signature there the extension monad operation commutes with the direct product operation, and that the only retractions from an enlargement or extension monad are trivial.</description>

      <title>Complex structures on two-step nilpotent Lie groups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.05885</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.05885v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We give a characterization of the $2$-step nilpotent Lie algebras whose corresponding Lie groups admit a left invariant complex structure. This is done by considering separately the cases when the complex structure is 2-step or 3-step nilpotent in the sense of [Cordero-Fern\'andez-Gray-Ugarte, 2000]. We also study the Hermitian geometry 2-step nilpotent Lie groups. We show that if a left invariant Hermitian metric on such Lie group is pluriclosed, then the corresponding complex structure is 2-step nilpotent. Moreover, we obtain a necessary and sufficient condition for such a metric to be pluriclosed in case the complex structure is abelian. This allows us to show that pluriclosed metrics on nilpotent Lie algebras with one dimensional commutator ideal can only occur on trivial central extensions of the $3$-dimensional Heisenberg Lie algebra.
  We show that certain Hermitian nilmanifolds constructed from compact semisimple irreducible Hermitian symmetric pairs are pluriclosed with respect to a canonically defined abelian complex structure.
  Finally, we give necessary and sufficient conditions for a naturally reductive Riemannian metric on a nilmanifold to be Hermitian with respect to an abelian complex structure. We prove the analogue of this result in the hypercomplex case, thereby obtaining a distinguished family of hyper-K\"ahler with torsion metrics.</description>

      <title>Quasi-Whittaker modules</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.05917</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.05917v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, a general setting is proposed to define a class of modules over nonsemisimple Lie algebras $\mathfrak{g}$ induced by a nonperfect ideal $\mathfrak{p}$. This class of Lie algebras includes many well-known Lie algebras, and some of this class of modules are Whittaker modules and others are not. We call these modules quasi-Whittaker modules. By introducing a new concept: the Whittaker annihilator for universal quasi-Whittaker modules, we are able to determine the necessary and sufficient conditions for the irreducibility of the universal quasi-Whittaker modules. In the reducible case, we can obtain some maximal submodules. In particular, we classify the irreducible quasi-Whittaker modules for many Lie algebras, and obtain a lot of irreducible smooth $\mathcal{W}_n^+$-modules of height $2$.</description>

      <title>Two edge contractions for the affine super Yangian</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.15367</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.15367v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In the previous paper, we constructed two kinds of edge contractions for the affine super Yangian and a homomorphism from the affine super Yangian to the universal enveloping algebra of a $W$-superalgebra of type $A$. In this article, we show that these two edge contractions are commutative with each other. As an application, we give a homomorphism from the affine super Yangian to some centralizer algebras of the universal enveloping algebra of $W$-superalgebras of type $A$. Using the edge contraction, we also show the compatibility of the coproduct for the affine super Yangian with the parabolic induction for a $W$-superalgebra of type $A$ in some special cases.</description>

      <title>Additive properties and absorption laws for generalized inverses</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.04363</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.04363v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Let $a,~f$ be elements in a ring with pseudo core inverses $a^{\scriptsize\textcircled{\tiny D}}$, $f^{\scriptsize\textcircled{\tiny D}}$, and let $b=f-a$. We prove that the absorption law $a^{\scriptsize\textcircled{\tiny D}}(a+f)f^{\scriptsize\textcircled{\tiny D}}=a^{\scriptsize\textcircled{\tiny D}}+f^{\scriptsize\textcircled{\tiny D}}$ holds if and only if $1+a^{\scriptsize\textcircled{\tiny D}}b$ is invertible and the additive property $f^{\scriptsize\textcircled{\tiny D}}=(1+a^{\scriptsize\textcircled{\tiny D}}b)^{-1}a^{\scriptsize\textcircled{\tiny D}}$ is satisfied. We further characterize these properties and establish analogous results for other generalized inverses. Finally, we apply these results to the case of complex matrices.</description>

      <title>Regular $\mathbb{Z}$-graded local rings and Graded Isolated Singularities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.05667</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.05667v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this note we first study regular $\mathbb{Z}$-graded local rings. We characterize commutative noetherian regular $\mathbb{Z}$-graded local rings in similar ways as in the usual local case. Then, we characterize graded isolated singularity for a commutative $\mathbb{Z}$-graded semilocal algebra in terms of the global dimension of its associated noncommutative projective scheme. As a corollary, we obtain that a commutative affine $\mathbb{N}$-graded algebra generated in degree $1$ is a graded isolated singularity if and only if its associated noncommutative projective scheme is smooth; if and only if the category of coherent sheaves on its projective scheme has finite global dimension, which are known in literature.</description>
