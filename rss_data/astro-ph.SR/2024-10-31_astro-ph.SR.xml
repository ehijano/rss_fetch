      <title>The 10 pc Neighborhood of Habitable Zone Exoplanetary Systems: Threat Assessment from Stellar Encounters &amp; Supernovae</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.22396</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.22396v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The habitability of a planet is influenced by both its parent star and the properties of its local stellar neighborhood. Potential threats to habitability from the local stellar environment mainly arise from two factors: cataclysmic events such as powerful stellar explosions and orbital perturbations induced by close stellar encounters. Among the 4,500+ exoplanet-hosting stars, about 140+ are known to host planets in their habitable zones. In this study, we use \textit{Gaia DR3} data to investigate the 10~pc stellar neighborhood of the 84 habitable zone systems (HZS) closest to the Sun. We assess the possible risks that local stellar environment of these HZS pose to their habitability. In particular, we find that HD~165155 has a high stellar density around it, making it likely to experience at least one flyby encounter within a span of 5~Gyr. We also identified two high-mass stars ($M \geq 8 M_\odot$) as potential progenitors of supernovae, which could threaten the long-term survivability of habitable zone systems HD~48265 and TOI-1227. Further, to quantify the similarity between habitable zone stars and the Sun, as well as their respective 10~pc stellar environments, we employ various astrophysical parameters to define a Solar Similarity Index (SSI) and a Neighborhood Similarity Index (NSI). Our analysis suggests that HD~40307 exhibits the closest resemblance to the solar system, while HD~165155 shows the least resemblance.</description>

      <title>Stellar Expansion or Inflation?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.22403</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.22403v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: While stellar expansion after core-hydrogen exhaustion related to thermal imbalance has been documented for decades, the physical phenomenon of stellar inflation that occurs close to the Eddington limit has only come to the fore in recent years. We aim to elucidate the differences between these physical mechanisms for stellar radius enlargement, especially as additional terms such as `bloated' and `puffed-up' stars have been introduced in the recent massive star literature. We employ single and binary star MESA structure and evolution models for both constant mass, as well as models allowing for the mass to change, due to winds or binary interaction. We find cases that were previously attributed to stellar inflation in fact to be due to stellar expansion. We also highlight that while the opposite effect of expansion is contraction, the removal of an inflated zone should not be referred to as contraction but {\it deflation} as the star is still in thermal balance.</description>

      <title>Hints of auroral and magnetospheric polarized radio emission from the scallop-shell star 2MASS J05082729$-$2101444</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.22449</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.22449v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Scallop-shell stars, a recently discovered class of young M dwarfs, show complex optical light curves that are characterized by periodic dips as well as other features that are stable over tens to hundreds of rotation cycles. The origin of these features is not well-understood. 2MASS J05082729$-$2101444 is a $\sim$25 Myr old scallop-shell star that was identified using TESS data; it has a photometric period of 6.73h that has been attributed to rotation. Of the $\sim$50 recently confirmed scallop-shell stars, it is one of the few detected at radio frequencies between 1 and 8 GHz. We observed this rare system with the upgraded Giant Meterwave Radio Telescope at 575--720 MHz, covering 88% of the photometric period in each of the two observations scheduled almost a month apart in 2023. We detected $\sim$millijansky emission from the target in both epochs, with a significant circular polarization fraction: $|V/I|\sim$20--50%. The 3.5-min phase-folded light curves reveal unique variability in circular polarization, showing an $\sim$hour-long helicity reversal in both epochs, similar in amplitude, length, and (possibly) phase. These results suggest two emission components: The first is a persistent, moderately polarized component possibly ascribable to gyro-synchrotron emission driven by centrifugal breakout events. The second is a highly polarized, short burst-like component, likely due to an electron cyclotron maser (ECM), indicative of auroral emission and potentially responsible for the helicity reversal. To explain this, we discuss the different origins of the plasma responsible for the radio emission, including the possibility that the occulting material is acting as a plasma source. Future coordinated multifrequency radio and optical observations can further constrain the underlying scenario, as well as the magnetic geometry of the system, if we assume an ECM-like auroral emission.</description>

      <title>The impact of differential rotation on the stochastic excitation of acoustic modes in solar-like stars</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.22547</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.22547v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We model the stochastic excitation of acoustic modes in solar-like pulsators taking into account the action of differential rotation. We derive the theoretical formalism for the stochastic excitation with differential rotation and make use of rotating convection Mixing-Length Theory to assess how the convective velocity is modified by rotation. Finally, we use the stellar structure and evolution code MESA combined with the stellar pulsation code GYRE to compute acoustic modes amplitudes.</description>

      <title>Impact of uniform rotation on the stochastic excitation of acoustic modes in solar-like oscillators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.22550</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.22550v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We evaluate the impact of the rotation on the stochastic excitation of acoustic (p) modes in solar-like pulsators. First, we derive the forced wave equation taking rotation into account and we compute the source terms, which inject energy into the oscillations. We make use of the Rotating Mixing Length Theory (R-MLT) to assess how the convective root mean square velocities are modified by the Coriolis acceleration. Finally, we use the stellar structure and evolution code MESA combined with the stellar pulsation code GYRE to show that the resulting modes amplitudes are inhibited by rotation.</description>

      <title>Tracking an eruptive prominence using multiwavelength and multiview observations on 2023 March 7</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.22724</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.22724v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we carry out multiwavelength and multiview observations of the prominence eruption, which generates a C2.3 class flare and a coronal mass ejection (CME) on 2023 March 7. For the first time, we apply the revised cone model to three-dimension reconstruction and tracking of the eruptive prominence for ~4 hrs. The prominence propagates non-radially and makes a detour around the large-scale coronal loops in active region NOAA 13243. The northward deflection angle increases from ~36 degrees to ~47 degrees before returning to ~36 degrees and keeping up. There is no longitudinal deflection throughout the propagation. The angular width of the cone increases from ~30 degrees and reaches a plateau at ~37 degrees. The heliocentric distance of the prominence rises from ~1.1 to ~10.0 solar radii, and the prominence experiences continuous acceleration (~51 m/s^2) over two hours, which is probably related to the magnetic reconnection during the C-class flare. The true speed of CME front is estimated to be ~829 km/s, which is ~1.2 times larger than that of CME core (prominence). It is concluded that both acceleration and deflection of eruptive prominences in their early lives could be reproduced with the revised cone model.</description>

      <title>An interferometric search for SiO maser emission in planetary nebulae</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.22785</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.22785v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Maser emission of SiO, H$_2$O and, OH is widespread in Asymptotic Giant Branch (AGB) stars with oxygen(O)-rich envelopes. This emission quickly disappear during the post-AGB phase and is extremely rare in planetary nebulae (PN). So far, only eight PNe have been confirmed to show OH and/or H$_2$O maser emission, and none has ever been found to show SiO maser emission. We intend to obtain the first detection of a SiO maser from a PNe. Such a detection would provide us with a useful tool to probe mass-loss in PNe at a scales of a few AU from the central star, much shorter than the scales traced by H$_2$ or OH masers. We compiled two different samples. The first one comprises all known PNe with confirmed OH and/or H$_2$O maser emission, as well as two candidate PNe showing OH masers. For the second sample we compiled single-dish SiO maser detections in the literature, and compared them with catalogs of PNe and radio continuum emission (which could trace photoionized gas in a PNe). We identified five targets (either PN or radio continuum sources) within the beam of the single-dish SiO maser observations. We then carried out interferometric observations of both samples with the Australia Telescope Compact Array, to confirm the spatial association between continuum and SiO maser emission. We found no SiO maser emission associated with any confirmed or candidate PN. In all targets, except IRAS 17390$-$3014, there is no spatial coincidence between SiO masers and radio continuum emission. While in IRAS 17390$-$3014 we cannot completely rule out a possible association, it is unlikely that the radio continuum emission arises from a planetary nebula. The absence of SiO maser emission in PNe showing OH or H$_2$O masers is of special interest, since thermal SiO emission has been reported in at least one of these targets, indicating that SiO molecules can be present in gas phase.</description>

      <title>Sigmoid eruption associated with X9.3 flare from AR 12673 drives gradual SEP event on 2017 September 6</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.22814</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.22814v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large gradual solar energetic particle (SEP) events can pose a radiation risk to crewed spaceflight and a significant threat to near-Earth satellites however, the origin of the SEP seed particle population, how these particles are released, accelerated and transported into the heliosphere are not well understood. We analyse NOAA active region (AR) 12673, that was the source responsible for multiple large gradual SEP events during September 2017, and found that almost immediately after each significant eruptive event associated with SEPs an enhanced Si/S abundance ratio was measured by Wind, consistent with the previous work by Brooks et al. Hinode/EIS took data roughly 8~hours before the second SEP event on 2017 September 6 that allowed the regions of enhanced Si/S abundance ratio in the AR to be determined. We have shown that the AR contains plasma with elemental abundance values detected in situ by Wind. In particular, the plasma originates from the core of the AR, similar to Brooks et al., but in the moss (footpoints) associated with hot sigmoidal AR loops. The sigmoid, that contains highly fractionated plasma, erupts and propagates towards an Earth-connected magnetic null point, providing a direct channel for the highly fractionated plasma to escape and be detected in the near-Earth environment.</description>

      <title>Rediscussion of eclipsing binaries. Paper XXI. The totally-eclipsing B-type system IQ Persei</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.23010</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.23010v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: IQ Per is a totally-eclipsing binary system containing a B8 V star and an A6 V star in an orbit of period 1.744 d with eccentricity and apsidal motion. We use new light curves from the Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite (TESS) and published spectroscopy from Lacy &amp; Frueh (1985) to measure the physical properties of the component stars, finding masses of 3.516 +/- 0.050 Msun and 1.738 +/- 0.023 Msun, and radii of 2.476 +/- 0.015 Rsun and 1.503 +/- 0.016 Rsun. Our fit to the light curve is imperfect, with a small sinusoidal trend in the residuals versus orbital phase and a slight mismatch in the depth of secondary eclipse, but the total eclipses mean the system is still well-characterised. The distance to the system from its masses, temperatures, apparent magnitudes and bolometric corrections is in agreement with the parallax distance from Gaia DR3. Theoretical models cannot adequately match the measured properties of the system, and new spectroscopy to confirm the temperatures and determine the chemical compositions of the stars would be useful. A Fourier analysis of the residuals of the best fit to the light curve shows many peaks at multiples of the orbital frequency, and one significant peak at 1.33 c/d which is not. This pulsation and the properties of the primary component are consistent with it being a slowly-pulsating B star.</description>

      <title>Rediscussion of eclipsing binaries. Paper XXII. The B-type system MU Cassiopeiae</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.23011</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.23011v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: MU Cas is a detached eclipsing binary containing two B5 V stars in an orbit of period 9.653 d and eccentricity 0.192, which has been observed in seven sectors using the Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite (TESS). We use these new light curves together with published spectroscopic results to measure the physical properties of the component stars, finding masses of 4.67 +/- 0.09 Msun and 4.59 +/- 0.08 Msun, and radii of 4.12 +/- 0.04 Rsun and 3.65 +/- 0.05 Rsun. These values agree with previous results save for a change in which of the two stars is designated the primary component. The measured distance to the system, 1814 +/- 37 pc, is 1.8$\sigma$ shorter than the distance from the Gaia DR3 parallax. A detailed spectroscopic analysis of the system is needed to obtain improved temperature and radial velocity measurements for the component stars; a precise spectroscopic light ratio is also required for better measurement of the stellar radii. MU Cas matches the predictions of theoretical stellar evolutionary models for a solar chemical composition and an age of 87 +/- 5 Myr. No evidence for pulsations was found in the light curves.</description>

      <title>Global Simulation of the Solar Wind: A Comparison With Parker Solar Probe Observations During 2018-2022</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.23157</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.23157v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Global magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) models play an important role in the infrastructure of space weather forecasting. Validating such models commonly utilizes in situ solar wind measurements made near the orbit of the Earth. The purpose of this study is to test the performance of G3DMHD (a data driven, time-dependent, 3-D MHD model of the solar wind) with Parker Solar Probe (PSP) measurements. Since its launch in August 2018, PSP has traversed the inner heliosphere at different radial distances sunward of the Earth (the closest approach ~13.3 solar radii), thus providing a good opportunity to study evolution of the solar wind and to validate heliospheric models of the solar wind. The G3DMHD model simulation is driven by a sequence of maps of photospheric field extrapolated to the assumed source surface (2.5 Rs) using the potential field model from 2018 to 2022, which covers the first 15 PSP orbits. The Pearson correlation coefficient (cc) and the mean absolute squared error (MASE) are used as the metrics to evaluate the model performance. It is found that the model performs better for both magnetic intensity (cc = 0.75; MASE = 0.60) and the solar wind density (cc = 0.73; MASE = 0.50) than for the solar wind speed (cc = 0.15; MASE = 1.29) and temperature (cc = 0.28; MASE = 1.14). This is due primarily to lack of accurate boundary conditions. The well-known underestimate of the magnetic field in solar minimum years is also present. Assuming that the radial magnetic field becomes uniformly distributed with latitude at or below 18 Rs (the inner boundary of the computation do-main), the agreement in the magnetic intensity significantly improves (cc = 0.83; MASE = 0.49).</description>

      <title>Magnetic diagnostics of prominence eruptions through the Hanle effect of the He I 1083 nm line</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.23197</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.23197v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The magnetic field vector of the solar corona is not regularly and comprehensively being measured, because of the complexity and degeneracy inherently present in the types of observations currently available. To address some of the current limitations of coronal polarimetry, we present computations that demonstrate the possibility of magnetometry using the unsaturated Hanle effect of the He I 1083 nm line. The main purpose of this investigation is to show how the geometric properties of the linear polarization of this line can be used to routinely diagnose the orientation of the field in erupting prominences, thus providing an important constraint on the B$_z$ determination at 1 AU. For this work, we adopted a simplified magnetic model of a flux rope, consisting of a toroidal helical structure embedded in a hydrostatically stratified corona. Our results demonstrate the possibility to discern different orientations of the magnetic field vector in such structures under rather general and practicable viewing conditions. In particular, observations from the Sun-Earth Lagrange points are found to provide excellent locations for the deployment of synoptic instruments aiming at the estimation of the magnetic field of Earth-directed Coronal Mass Ejections. We complete our demonstration by showing how a small (~5 cm) space-borne coronagraph can achieve sufficient signal-to-noise ratios to make the coronal magnetometry goal outlined above feasible.</description>

      <title>Quantitative spectroscopy of multiple OB stars: I. The quadruple system HD 37061 at the centre of Messier 43</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.23229</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.23229v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The majority of massive stars are located in binary or multiple star systems. This poses additional challenges to quantitative analyses that use model atmospheres because little information is currently available on the chemical composition of such systems. The members of the quadruple star system HD 37061, which excites the H II region Messier 43 in Orion, are fully characterised. Accurate and precise abundances for all elements with lines traceable in the optical spectrum are derived for the first time. A hybrid non-local thermodynamic equilibrium (non-LTE) approach, using line-blanketed hydrostatic model atmospheres computed with the ATLAS12 code in combination with non-LTE line-formation calculations with DETAIL and SURFACE, was employed. A high-resolution composite spectrum was analysed for the atmospheric parameters and elemental abundances of the individual stars. Fundamental stellar parameters were derived based on stellar evolution tracks, and the interstellar reddening was characterised. We determined the fundamental parameters and chemical abundances for three stars in the HD 37061 system. The fourth and faintest star in the system shows no distinct spectral features, as a result of its fast rotation. However, this star has noticeable effects on the continuum. The derived element abundances and determined ages of the individual stars are consistent with each other, and the abundances coincide with the cosmic abundance standard. We find an excellent agreement between our spectroscopic distance and the Gaia Data Release 3 parallax distance.</description>

      <title>The Influence of a Shock on the Nucleosynthesis Developing during the Explosion of a Low-Mass Neutron Star</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.22510</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.22510v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The pattern of nucleosynthesis during the explosion of a low-mass neutron star formed in a close binary system in the stripping scenario is considered. In the scenario considered the shock arising during the explosion is shown to strongly heat the expanding neutron star matter. The heavy nuclei produced at the preceding stage of nucleosynthesis are partially destroyed as a result of a sharp increase in the role of photonuclear reactions. It is shown that even short-term heating of the matter by the shock can exert a noticeable influence on the results of the synthesis of elements in the r-process in the inner crust matter, while explosive nucleosynthesis gives rise to new elements in the outer crust matter with mass numbers A from 50 to 130.</description>

      <title>An anisotropic plasma model of the heliospheric interface</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.22589v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a pioneering model of the interaction between the solar wind and the surrounding interstellar medium that includes the possibility of different pressures in the directions parallel and perpendicular to the magnetic field. The outer heliosheath region is characterized by a low rate of turbulent scattering that would permit a development of pressure anisotropy. The effect is best seen on the interstellar side of the heliopause, where a narrow region is developed with an excessive perpendicular pressure resembling a plasma depletion layer typical of planetary magnetspheres. The magnitude of this effect is relatively small owing to the fact that proton-proton collisions don't permit the anisotropy to approach a stability threshold. We also show that if turbulence in the interstellar medium is weak, a much broader anisotropic boundary layer can exist, with a dominant perpendicular pressure in the southern hemisphere and a dominant parallel pressure in the north.</description>

      <title>The high-energy cyclotron line in 2S 1417-624 discovered with Insight-HXMT during the 2018 outburst</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.22859v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We report a detailed timing and spectral analysis of the X-ray pulsar 2S~1417-624 using the data from Insight-HXMT during the 2018 outburst. The pulse profiles are highly variable with respect to both unabsorbed flux and energy. A double-peaked pulse profile from the low flux evolved to a multi-peaked shape in the high-flux state. The pulse fraction is negatively correlated to the source flux in the range of $\sim$(1--6)$\ \times \ 10^{-9}$ erg cm$^{-2}$ s$^{-1}$, consistent with \textit{Rossi} X-ray Timing Explorer (RXTE) studies during the 2009 giant outburst. The energy-resolved pulse profiles around the peak outburst showed a four-peak shape in the low-energy bands and gradually evolved to triple peaks at higher energies. The continuum spectrum is well described by typical phenomenological models, such as the cut-off power law and the power law with high-energy cut-off models. Notably, we discovered high-energy cyclotron resonant scattering features (CRSFs) for the first time, which are around 100 keV with a statistical significance of $\sim$7$\sigma$ near the peak luminosity of the outburst. This CRSF line is significantly detected with different continuum models and provides very robust evidence for its presence. Furthermore, pulse-phase-resolved spectroscopy confirmed the presence of the line, whose energy varied from 97 to 107 keV over the pulse phase and appeared to have a maximum value at the narrow peak phase of the profiles.</description>

      <title>Machine learning based stellar classification with highly sparse photometry data</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.22869v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Identifying stars belonging to different classes is vital in order to build up statistical samples of different phases and pathways of stellar evolution. In the era of surveys covering billions of stars, an automated method of identifying these classes becomes necessary. Many classes of stars are identified based on their emitted spectra. In this paper, we use a combination of the multi-class multi-label Machine Learning (ML) method XGBoost and the PySSED spectral-energy-distribution fitting algorithm to classify stars into nine different classes, based on their photometric data. The classifier is trained on subsets of the SIMBAD database. Particular challenges are the very high sparsity (large fraction of missing values) of the underlying data as well as the high class imbalance. We discuss the different variables available, such as photometric measurements on the one hand, and indirect predictors such as Galactic position on the other hand. We show the difference in performance when excluding certain variables, and discuss in which contexts which of the variables should be used. Finally, we show that increasing the number of samples of a particular type of star significantly increases the performance of the model for that particular type, while having little to no impact on other types. The accuracy of the main classifier is ~0.7 with a macro F1 score of 0.61. While the current accuracy of the classifier is not high enough to be reliably used in stellar classification, this work is an initial proof of feasibility for using ML to classify stars based on photometry.</description>

      <title>Reactivity of chondritic meteorites under H2-rich atmospheres: Formation of H2S</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.23012</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.23012v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Current models of chemical evolution during star and planetary formation rely on the presence of dust grains to act as a third body. However, they generally ignore the reactivity of the dust grains themselves. Dust grains present in the protoplanetary phase will evolve as the solar system forms and, after protoplanets have appeared, they will be constantly delivered to their surfaces in the form of large aggregates or meteorites. Chondritic meteorites are mostly unaltered samples of the dust present in the first stages of the Solar System formation, that still arrive nowadays to the surface of Earth and allow us to study the properties of the materials forming the early Solar System. These materials contain, amongst others, transition metals that can potentially act as catalysts, as well as other phases that can potentially react in different astrophysical conditions, such as FeS. In this work, we present the reactivity of chondritic meteorites under \hydrogen-rich atmospheres, particularly towards the reduction of FeS for the formation of H2S and metallic Fe during the early phases of the planetary formation. We present the obtained results on the reaction rates and the percentage of FeS available to react in the materials. Additionally, we include a computational study of the reaction mechanism and the energetics. Finally, we discuss the implications of an early formation of H2S in planetary surfaces.</description>

      <title>High Precision Astrometry Science in the Context of Space Mission Prospectives</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.23019v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Astrometry is one of the oldest branches of astronomy which measures the position, the proper motion and parallax of celestial objects. Following the Hipparcos and Gaia missions that have measured several billions of them using global astrometry, we propose to increase astrometry precision on pointed objects using differential astrometry in a large field in order to unravel rocky planets in habitable zones of stars in the Sun vicinity and investigate the nature of dark matter in galactic environments as recommended by the ESA Senior Committee in the Voyager 2050 prospective. Substantial technology developments in a number of critical areas is needed in order to reach the highest required precision of sub-micro-arcsecond. One of them is CMOS image sensors using the stitching technique to merge the multiple design structures on the wafer and produce array with very large number of pixels. Another one is to calibrate the pixel positions using projecting modulating interferometric laser fringes on the array. Finally, the distortion of the optical system can be monitored and compensated using reference stars as metrology sources. The final precision depends on the diameter and the field of view of the telescope that is used as well as the time spent on each target. We present here the science goals that can be achieved with such missions either within the framework of an ESA Medium-class mission or even in the NASA most challenging Habitable Worlds Observatory, a large space telescope recommended by the American Astronomy and Astrophysics prospective for the 2020s and designed specifically to search for signs of life on planets orbiting other stars.</description>

      <title>Evidence for a Sharp CO Snowline Transition in a Protoplanetary Disk and Implications for Millimeter-wave Observations of CO Isotopologues</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.23036</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.23036v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Observations of CO isotopologue emission from protoplanetary disks at millimeter wavelengths are a powerful tool for probing the CO snowline, an important marker for disk chemistry, and also for estimating total disk gas mass, a key quantity for planet formation. We use simple models to demonstrate that the vertical thickness of an isothermal layer around the disk midplane has important effects on the CO column density radial profile, with a thick layer producing a sharp CO snowline transition. We simulate ngVLA and ALMA images to show that this sharp change in CO column density can be detected in the derivative of the radial profile of emission from optically thin CO isotopologue lines. We apply this method to archival ALMA observations of the disk around the Herbig Ae star HD 163296 in the C$^{17}$O and C$^{18}$O J=1-0 and J=2-1 lines to identify a sharp CO snowline transition near 80 au (0.8 arcsec at 101 pc), and show the CO column density decreases by more than a factor of 20. This finding is consistent with previous inferences from the steep rise of N$_2$H$^+$ emission, which marks the location where CO depletes. We also demonstrate that the disk's thermal structure introduces a significant systematic uncertainty to estimates of total disk gas mass derived from these lines. The substantial improvement in sensitivity envisioned for the ngVLA over ALMA for observations of ground state lines of CO isotopologues has the potential to extend this approach to a much larger population of disks.</description>

      <title>Massive star evolution models incorporating $\alpha$-enhanced composition -- I. BPASS Single star models</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.23167v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Stellar evolution modelling is fundamental to many areas of astrophysics including stellar populations in both nearby and distant galaxies. It is heavily influenced by chemical composition. Observations of distant galaxies and nucleosynthesis calculations show that $\alpha$-process elements are enriched faster than iron group elements. We present a dense grid of single-star models calculated using the BPASS stellar evolution code and covering masses ($0.1\le\mathrm{M/M}_\odot\le316$), metallicity mass fractions ($10^{-5} \le Z \le 0.04$) and $\alpha$-to-iron abundance ratios ($-0.2\le[\alpha/\mathrm{Fe}]\le+0.6$). By comparing Solar-scaled models to ones enriched in $\alpha$-process elements, we find that stellar radii, surface temperatures, Main Sequence lifetimes, supernova progenitor properties and supernova rates are all sensitive to changes in [$\alpha$/Fe]. Lifetimes of low-mass stars differ by up to 0.4 dex, while surface temperatures of massive stars at the end of the Main Sequence also differ by around 0.4 dex. Inferred supernova rates when [Fe/H] is unknown can be highly uncertain. Models with different [$\alpha$/Fe] but comparable iron abundances show smaller variations, indicating that while iron primarily defines the course of evolution; $\alpha$-enhancement nonetheless has an impact of up to 0.1 dex on stellar properties. Such changes are small for individual stars, but have a large cumulative effect when considering an entire stellar population as demonstrated by isochrone fitting to nearby clusters. Changes in radii and lifetimes have further consequences for a stellar population including binary stars, as they influence the timing, nature and occurrence rate of mass transfer events.</description>

Abstract: Knowledge of the composition of material that will form planets is crucial to understand planetary diversity and the occurrence of potentially habitable planets. Ultimately, it is the chemistry in circumstellar disks that determines the global make up of planetary systems, as the dust in these disks grows into giant planet cores and rocky planets, the gas becomes incorporated in giant planet atmospheres, and the ices can be delivered to rocky planets by comets and meteorites. With the advent of ALMA a decade ago and the recent launch of JWST, the composition of the disk gas and ice can now be studied in great detail. This review will provide an overview of our current knowledge of the disk chemical structure, focusing on the six elements essential to life on Earth: carbon (C), hydrogen (H), nitrogen (N), oxygen (O), phosphorus (P) and sulfur (S).</description>

      <title>Exact solutions for radiative transfer with partial frequency redistribution</title>

      <description>arXiv:2310.15621v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The construction of exact solutions for radiative transfer in a plane-parallel medium has been addressed by Hemsch and Ferziger in 1972 for a partial frequency redistribution model of the formation of spectral lines consisting in a linear combination of frequency coherent and fully incoherent scattering. The method of solution is based on an eigenfunction expansion of the radiation field, leading to two singular integral equations with a Cauchy-type kernel, that have to be solved one after the other. We reconsider this problem, using as starting point the integral formulation of the radiative transfer equation, where the terms involving the coupling between the two scattering mechanisms are clearly displayed, as well as the primary source of photons. With an inverse Laplace transform, we recover the singular integral equations previously established and with Hilbert transforms, as in the previous work, recast them as boundary value problems in the complex plane. Their solutions are presented in detail for an infinite and a semi-infinite medium. The coupling terms are carefully analyzed and consistency with either the coherent or the incoherent limit is systematically checked. We recover the important results of the previous work that an exact solution exists for an infinite medium, whereas for a semi-infinite medium, which requires the introduction of half-space auxiliary functions, the solution is given by a Fredholm integral equation to be solved numerically. The solutions of the singular integral equations are used to construct explicit expressions providing the radiation field for an arbitrary primary source and for the Green function. An explicit expression is given for the radiation field emerging from a semi-infinite medium.</description>

      <title>Magnetic field evolution for crystallization-driven dynamos in C/O white dwarfs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.01807</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.01807v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate the evolution of magnetic fields generated by the crystallization-driven dynamo in carbon-oxygen white dwarfs (WDs) with masses $\lesssim1.05\ M_{\odot}$. We use scalings for the dynamo to demonstrate that the initial magnetic field strength ($B_{0}$) has an upper limit that depends on the initial convection zone size ($R_{\mathrm{out},0}$) and the WD mass. We solve the induction equation to follow the magnetic field evolution after the dynamo phase ends. We show that the predicted surface magnetic field strength ($B_{\mathrm{surf}}$) differs from $B_{0}$ by at least a factor of $\sim$0.3. This reduction depends on $R_{\mathrm{out},0}$, where values smaller than half of the star radius give $B_{\mathrm{surf}}\lesssim0.01\ B_{0}$. We implement electrical conductivities that account for the solid phase effect on the Ohmic diffusion. We observe that the conductivity increases as the solid core grows, freezing in the magnetic field at a certain point of the evolution and slowing its outwards transport. We study the effect of turbulent magnetic diffusivity induced by the convection and find that for a small $R_{\mathrm{out},0}$, $B_{\mathrm{surf}}$ is stronger than the non-turbulent diffusion cases because of the more rapid transport, but still orders of magnitude smaller than $B_{0}$. Given these limitations, the crystallization-driven dynamo theory could explain only magnetic C/O WDs with field strengths less than a few MG for the mass range 0.45-1.05 $M_{\odot}$. Our results also suggest that a buried fossil field must be at least 100 times stronger than observed surface fields if crystallization-driven convection is responsible for its transport to the surface.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.14421v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We identify $240$ short-period ($P \lesssim 10$ days) binary systems in the TESS data, $180$ of which are heartbeat binaries (HB). The sample is mostly a mix of A and B-type stars and primarily includes eclipsing systems, where over $30\%$ of the sources with primary and secondary eclipses show a secular change in their inter-eclipse timings and relative eclipse depths over a multi-year timescale, likely due to orbital precession. The orbital parameters of the population are estimated by fitting a heartbeat model to their phase curves and Gaia magnitudes, where the model accounts for ellipsoidal variability, Doppler beaming, reflection effects, and eclipses. We construct the sample's period-eccentricity distribution and find an eccentricity cutoff (where $e \rightarrow 0$) at a period $1.7$ days. Additionally, we measure the periastron advance rate for the $12$ of the precessing sources and find that they all exhibit prograde apsidal precession, which is as high as $9^{\circ}$ yr$^{-1}$ for one of the systems. Using the inferred stellar parameters, we estimate the general relativistic precession rate of the argument of periastron for the population and expect over $30$ systems to show a precession in excess of $0.3^{\circ}$ yr$^{-1}$</description>

Abstract: Among massive stars, binary interaction is the rule rather than the exception. The closest binaries, those with periods of less than about 10 days, undergo mass transfer during core-hydrogen burning, with many of them experiencing a nuclear-timescale contact phase. Current binary population synthesis models predict the mass-ratio distribution of contact binaries to be heavily skewed toward a mass ratio of unity, which is inconsistent with observations. It has been shown that effects of tidal deformation due to the Roche potential, as well as energy transfer in the common layers of a contact binary, alter the internal structure of close binary components. However, previous population studies neglected these effects. We model a population of massive binary stars that undergo mass transfer during core-hydrogen burning, while consistently considering the effects of tidal deformation and energy transfer in contact phases. We use the MESA binary-evolution code to compute large grids of models with primary star masses of $8\,M_\odot$ to $70\,M_\odot$ at Solar metallicity. We then perform a population synthesis study to predict distribution functions of the observational properties of close binary systems, focusing in particular on the mass and luminosity ratio distribution. We find that the effects of tidal deformation and energy transfer have a limited effect on the predicted mass-ratio distribution of massive contact binaries. Only a small fraction of the population has their mass ratio significantly shifted toward a more unequal configuration. However, we suggest that orbital hardening could affect the evolution of contact binaries and their progenitors, and we advocate for a homogeneous set of observed contact binary parameters.</description>

      <title>Characterizing the Rapid Hydrogen Disappearance in SN2022crv: Evidence of a Continuum between Type Ib and IIb Supernova Properties</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.09433</link>

Abstract: We present optical and near-infrared observations of SN~2022crv, a stripped envelope supernova in NGC~3054, discovered within 12 hrs of explosion by the Distance Less Than 40 Mpc Survey. We suggest SN~2022crv is a transitional object on the continuum between SNe Ib and SNe IIb. A high-velocity hydrogen feature ($\sim$$-$20,000 -- $-$16,000 $\rm km\,s^{-1}$) was conspicuous in SN~2022crv at early phases, and then quickly disappeared around maximum light. By comparing with hydrodynamic modeling, we find that a hydrogen envelope of $\sim 10^{-3}$ \msun{} can reproduce the behaviour of the hydrogen feature observed in SN~2022crv. The early light curve of SN~2022crv did not show envelope cooling emission, implying that SN~2022crv had a compact progenitor with extremely low amount of hydrogen. The analysis of the nebular spectra shows that SN~2022crv is consistent with the explosion of a He star with a final mass of $\sim$4.5 -- 5.6 \msun{} that has evolved from a $\sim$16 -- 22 \msun{} zero-age main sequence star in a binary system with about 1.0 -- 1.7 \msun{} of oxygen finally synthesized in the core. The high metallicity at the supernova site indicates that the progenitor experienced a strong stellar wind mass loss. In order to retain a small amount of residual hydrogen at such a high metallicity, the initial orbital separation of the binary system is likely larger than $\sim$1000~$\rm R_{\odot}$. The near-infrared spectra of SN~2022crv show a unique absorption feature on the blue side of He I line at $\sim$1.005~$\mu$m. This is the first time that such a feature has been observed in a Type Ib/IIb, and could be due to \ion{Sr}{2}. Further detailed modelling on SN~2022crv can shed light on the progenitor and the origin of the mysterious absorption feature in the near infrared.</description>

      <title>A geometric distortion solution specifically for historical observations and its implementation</title>

Abstract: Geometric distortion (GD) critically constrains the precision of astrometry. Using well-established methods to correct GD requires calibration observations, which can only be obtained using a special dithering strategy during the observation period. Unfortunately, this special observation mode is not often used, especially for the historical observations before those GD correction methods presented. As a result, some telescopes have no GD calibration observations for a long period, making it impossible to accurately determine the GD effect. This limits the value of the telescope observations in certain astrometric scenarios, such as using historical observations of moving targets in the solar system to improve their orbits. We investigated a method for handling GD that does not rely on the calibration observations. With this advantage, it can be used to solve the GD models of telescopes which were intractable in the past. The method was implemented in Python and released on GitHub. It was then applied to solve GD in the observations taken with the 1-m and 2.4-m telescopes at Yunnan Observatory. The resulting GD models were compared with those obtained using well-established methods to demonstrate the accuracy. Furthermore, the method was applied in the reduction of observations for two targets, the moon of Jupiter (Himalia) and the binary GSC2038-0293, to show its effectiveness. After GD correction, the astrometric results for both targets show improvements. Notably, the mean residual between observed and computed position (O-C) for the binary GSC2038-0293 decreased from 36 mas to 5 mas.</description>

      <title>A Star Cluster Population of High Mass Black Hole Mergers in Gravitational Wave Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.19044</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.19044v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Stellar evolution theories predict a gap in the black hole birth mass spectrum as the result of pair instability processes in the cores of massive stars.This gap, however, is not seen in the binary black hole masses inferred from gravitational wave data. One explanation is that black holes form dynamically in dense star clusters where smaller black holes merge to form more massive black holes, populating the mass gap. We show that this model predicts a distribution of the effective and precessing spin parameters, $\chi_{\rm eff}$ and $\chi_{\rm p}$, within the mass gap that is insensitive to assumptions about black hole natal spins and other astrophysical parameters. We analyze the distribution of $\chi_{\rm eff}$ as a function of primary mass for the black hole binaries in the third gravitational wave transient catalog. We infer the presence of a high-mass and isotropically spinning population of black holes that is consistent with hierarchical formation in dense star clusters and a pair-instability mass gap with a lower edge at $44^{+6}_{-4} M_\odot$. We compute a Bayes factor $\mathcal{B}&gt;10^4$ relative to models that do not allow for a high-mass population with a distinct $\chi_{\rm eff}$ distribution.</description>
