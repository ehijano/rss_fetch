      <title>Ferroelectric Hysteresis in Superconducting Bilayers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.04251</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.04251v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recently, coexisting ferroelectricity and superconductivity were reported in bilayer T$_{\textrm{d}}$-MoTe$_2$ and twisted bilayer graphene. Importantly, it was observed that an applied displacement field switches the superconductivity with a ferroelectric hysteresis. Such direct coupling between the ferroelectricity and superconductivity offers promising pathways for developing low-power, non-volatile memory devices. However, the coupling mechanism between the ferroelectricity and superconductivity remains poorly understood. In this work, we demonstrate that in a superconducting bilayer, the hysteretic switching of superconductivity can arise from an interlayer pairing. By deriving the Landau Ginzburg free energy expansion for the interlayer pairing, we show that along the ferroelectric hysteresis loop, the hysteretic exceeding of the critical polarization $P_{\textrm{c}}$ that destroys the interlayer pairing leads to the hysteretic switching of superconductivity. The condition to have a ferroelectric hysteretic superconducting state is established to be $P_{\textrm{r}}&lt;P_{\textrm{c}}&lt;P_{\textrm{s}}$, where $P_{\textrm{r}}$ and $P_{\textrm{s}}$ denote the remanent and saturated polarization, respectively. Crucially, our scenario of interlayer pairing yields two predictions: (1) an enhancement of the upper critical displacement field with stronger interlayer coupling and (2) a pronounced, gate-tunable interlayer crossed Andreev reflection, both of which provide clear pathways for experimental verification.</description>

      <title>Superconductivity onset above 60 K in ambient-pressure nickelate films</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.04708</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.04708v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Ambient-pressure superconductivity in nickelates has been capped at an onset transition temperature (Tc) of ~40 K, a value that remains lower than the cuprate (~133 K) and iron-based (~55 K) counterparts, despite the promise shown under high pressure. Here, we report ambient-pressure superconductivity onset at ~63 K in epitaxial (La,Pr)3Ni2O7 thin films grown under compressive strain on SrLaAlO4 substrates. This Tc leap is enabled by pushing our gigantic-oxidative atomic-layer-by-layer epitaxy (GAE) method into an extreme non-equilibrium growth regime. It leverages powerful in situ oxidation to simultaneously enhance kinetics via higher temperatures and achieve full oxygenation without post-annealing. Synchrotron X-ray diffraction and scanning transmission electron microscopy confirm that this approach yields films of large-scale crystalline purity, overcoming the inherent metastability of the strained superconducting phase. These films exhibit a systematic evolution in their normal-state resistivity-temperature curve: the power-law exponent $\alpha$ evolves from Fermi-liquid-like ($\alpha$ ~2) at lower Tc to strange-metal-like ($\alpha$ ~1) in higher Tc samples, directly linking the enhanced superconductivity to non-Fermi liquid behavior. Mapping the vortex melting phase diagram by the mutual inductance technique further reveals 2D melting limit suppressed to near zero, which demonstrates significantly stronger interlayer coupling than that of cuprates. These results identify the nickelates as an anisotropic-3D high-Tc system exhibiting strange-metal behavior, presenting an alternative framework to the quasi-2D cuprate paradigm.</description>

      <title>Demonstration of surface-engineered oxidation-resistant Nb-Nb thermocompression bonding toward scalable superconducting quantum computing architectures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.04712</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.04712v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Scalable quantum computing currently requires a large array of qubit integration, but present two-dimensional interconnects face challenges such as wiring congestion, electromagnetic interference, and limited cryogenic space. To overcome this challenge, implementing three-dimensional (3D) vertical architectures becomes crucial. Niobium (Nb), due to its excellent superconducting characteristics and strong fabrication process compatibility, stands out as a prime material choice. The main challenge in Nb-Nb bonding is the presence of an oxide layer at the interface, even after post-bonding annealing across various bonding methods. The native Nb oxide forms rapidly in air, creating a resistive barrier to supercurrent flow and introducing two-level system losses that degrade qubit coherence while increasing the overall thermal budget. These issues show the need for effective surface engineering to suppress oxidation during bonding. This study introduces an ultrathin gold (Au) capping layer as a passivation strategy to prevent oxygen incorporation at the Nb surface. This approach enables low-temperature Nb-Nb thermocompression bonding at 350 {\deg}C under a reduced bonding pressure of 0.495 MPa. Detailed microstructural and interfacial analyses confirm that Au passivation effectively suppresses oxide formation and hence enhances bonding uniformity and strength with keeping the superconductivity, establishing a robust route toward low-temperature, low-pressure Nb-Nb bonding for scalable 3D superconducting quantum computing architectures.</description>

      <title>Evolution of Correlated Electrons in ${\rm La_3Ni_2O_7}$ at Ambient Pressure: a Study of Double-Counting Effect</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.04754</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.04754v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We employ cluster extension of dynamical mean-field theory (CDMFT) to systematically investigate the impact of double counting corrections on the correlated electronic structure of ${\rm La_3Ni_2O_7}$ under ambient pressure. By adjusting double-counting parameters, while maintaining a fixed Fermi surface, we observe a pronounced orbital-selective density of states change: the $d_{z^2}$ orbital undergoes significant variation near the Fermi level with increasing $E_{dc}^z$, while the $d_{x^2-y^2}$ orbital remains essentially unchanged throughout the entire range. Analysis of renormalization factor show the monotonic dependence with double counting in both $d_{z^2}$ and $d_{x^2-y^2}$ orbital, and it also identifies an optimal double counting window in $d_{z^2}$ orbital aligns with experimental values. We also find the interlayer Matsubara self energy exhibits non-monotonic dependence on $E_{dc}^z$, deviating from theoretical predictions. This anomaly is attributed to the metallization of oxygen-bridged pathways, which disrupts the prerequisite for charge transfer via apical oxygen. Our results establish $E_{dc}$ as a critical control parameter for correlated electronic structure in ${\rm La_3Ni_2O_7}$ and provide a computational framework for resolving orbital-dependent correlation effects in layered materials.</description>

      <title>Interplay between Superconductivity and Altermagnetism in Disordered Materials and Heterostructures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.04819</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.04819v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the interplay between superconductivity and altermagnetism in disordered systems using recently derived quantum kinetic transport equations. Starting from this framework, we derive the Ginzburg-Landau free energy and identify, in addition to the conventional pair-breaking term, a coupling between the spin and the spatial variation of the superconducting order parameter. Two distinct effects emerge from this coupling. The first is a magnetoelectric effect, in which a supercurrent (i.e., a phase gradient) induces a spin texture; this contribution is quadratic in the phase gradient. The second effect arises when the magnitude, rather than the phase, of the superconducting order parameter varies in space, likewise leading to a finite magnetization. We show that these two contributions compete in the case of an Abrikosov vortex, where both the amplitude and phase of the order parameter vary spatially. The effect associated with amplitude variations also gives rise to a proximity-induced magnetization (PIM) in hybrid structures composed of a superconductor (S) and an altermagnet (AM). Using quasiclassical theory, we analyze the PIM in diffusive S/AM bilayers and S/AM/S Josephson junctions, and determine the induced magnetization profiles. In Josephson junctions, where both the PIM and the magnetoelectric effect coexist, we further predict the occurrence of $0$-$\pi$ transitions.</description>

      <title>Comment on paper: Evidence for Dirac flat band superconductivity enabled by quantum geometry, Nature 614, 440 (2023)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.06054</link>
      <description>arXiv:2303.06054v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We demonstrate that an absolutely flat band retains the superconducting state at $T_c\to 0$. When $T_c&gt;0$ the flat band disappears, since it must be modified by the superconducting state. Thus, a number of the results on ultra-strong coupling superconductivity in flat band considered in the article ("Evidence for Dirac flat band superconductivity enabled by quantum geometry", Nature 614, 440 (2023)) were predicted and explained many years ago. One has to take into account that at $T_c&gt;0$ the flat band distorts, becoming tilted. As a result, the charge carriers' velocity $v_F\propto T_c$ becomes finite, rather than being extremely slow, as it is stated in the article. Thus, the statement "the charge carriers' group velocity $v_ F$ is extremely slow" is incorrect and leads the authors to the conceptional misunderstanding, confusing the reader.</description>

      <title>Altermagnetism-induced non-collinear superconducting diode effect and unidirectional superconducting transport</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.05543</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.05543v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Current studies of non-reciprocal superconducting (SC) transport have centered on the forward-backward asymmetry of the critical current measured along a single axis. In most realizations, this diode effect is achieved via introducing ferromagnetism or applying an external magnetic field, which drives system into an effective Fulde-Ferrell (FF) state but often at the cost of severely suppressing the SC gap and thus compromising device robustness. Here we propose and theoretically demonstrate that coupling a conventional $s$-wave SC thin film to a $d$-wave altermagnet offers a more resilient alternative. The momentum-dependent spin splitting inherent to altermagnets induces a non-collinear SC-diode effect in the BCS state, with the critical-current anisotropy exhibiting a fourfold ($C_4$) symmetry. Upon entering the FF state at large splitting, this anisotropy gradually evolves into a unidirectional ($C_1$) pattern. Crucially, the FF pairing momentum locks to the discrete crystal axes, eliminating the rotational Goldstone mode and preserving a sizable SC gap without any abrupt or significant suppression. These combined features make the altermagnetic proximity an appealing platform to engineer symmetry-protected, energy-efficient and programmable SC diodes for next-generation electronic devices.</description>

      <title>Scaling behavior of superconductors</title>

Abstract: In our brief review, we will consider the general universal scaling properties of superconductors. The physics of superconductors, represented by both conventional and unconventional superconductors, has been the main topic of high-$T_c$ superconductor physics for over thirty years, revealing some of the properties of high-$T_c$ (or unconventional) superconductors. Scaling relationships lead to the identification of fundamental laws of nature and reveal the essence of superconductor physics. Advances in experimental technology allow us to collect important data, which in turn allow us to make definitive statements about the physical processes underlying strongly correlated Fermi systems. Basing on this observation, we analyze experimental facts that reveal the general scaling properties of both high-$T_c$ and ordinary superconductors, and theoretically explain that the Homes' law $\rho_{s0}= (1/2\pi\lambda_D)^2= T_c\sigma(T_c)$ is applicable to the both types of superconductors. Here $\rho_{s0}$ is the superconducting electron density, $\lambda_D$ is the zero-$T$ penetration depth, $\sigma$ is the normal state conductivity, $T$ is temperature and $T_c$ is the temperature of superconducting phase transition. Overall, these scaling relationships lead to the identification of fundamental laws of nature and reveal the essence of superconductor physics. All these observations support the theory of fermion condensation. Our theoretical results agree well with a body of diverse and seemingly unrelated experimental facts. They show that the topological fermion condensation quantum phase transition, generating flat bands, is an intrinsic property of strongly correlated Fermi systems and can be considered as a universal agent explaining their basic physics.</description>

      <title>Highly Anisotropic Charge Dynamics and Spectral Weight Redistribution in the Trilayer Nickelate La$_{4}$Ni$_{3}$O$_{10}$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.03806</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.03806v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the $ab$-plane and $c$-axis charge dynamics of La$_{4}$Ni$_{3}$O$_{10}$ using optical spectroscopy. While a pronounced Drude profile, i.e. metallic response, is observed in the $ab$-plane optical conductivity $\sigma_{1}^{ab}(\omega)$, the $c$-axis optical spectra $\sigma_{1}^{c}(\omega)$ exhibit semiconducting behavior. The zero-frequency extrapolation of the optical conductivity $\sigma_{1}(\omega \rightarrow 0) \equiv 1/\rho_{\text{dc}}$ gives a resistivity anisotropy of $\rho_{c}/\rho_{ab} \simeq 366$ at 300~K for La$_{4}$Ni$_{3}$O$_{10}$, which is much larger than the values in iron-based superconductors but comparable to those in high-$T_{c}$ cuprates. The interband response is also highly anisotropic, showing salient orbital selectivity for light polarized in the $ab$ plane and along the $c$ axis. The interband-transition peaks in both $\sigma_{1}^{ab}(\omega)$ and $\sigma_{1}^{c}(\omega)$ are located at lower energies compared to density-functional-theory predictions, signifying considerable electronic correlations. By investigating the spectral weight transfer, we find that in the pristine phase, Coulomb correlations have a marked impact on the charge dynamics of \LNO, whereas in the density-wave state, a gap opens with the Ni-$d_{z^{2}}$ orbital being involved.</description>

      <title>Electronic modes induced by spin and charge perturbations in Mott and Kondo insulators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.07428</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.07428v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Electronic band structures usually remain unaffected by doping via a chemical-potential shift or by increasing the temperature in conventional band insulators. In contrast, it has been shown that those of Mott and Kondo insulators can be altered by doping or by increasing the temperature: electronic modes are induced within the band gap, exhibiting momentum-shifted magnetic dispersion relations from the band edges. Here, this study demonstrates that the underlying mechanism of the remarkable strong-correlation effects can be generalized to the emergence of electronic modes caused by various spin and charge perturbations, including magnetization of spin-gapped Mott and Kondo insulators. These emergent modes can alter the band structure if a macroscopic number of spins or charges are excited by the perturbations at a given moment. The origins and dispersion relations of these emergent modes, particularly why and how the dispersion relations depend on the momentum and energy of the perturbations, are elucidated by investigating the selection rules and using the Bethe ansatz and the effective theory for weak inter-unit-cell hopping. The validity and generality of the theoretical results across different models and spatial dimensions are verified by numerical calculations for the one- and two-dimensional Hubbard models, periodic Anderson models, Kondo lattice models, and ladder and bilayer Hubbard models. This study provides crucial insights into why and how spin and charge perturbations can alter the band structure in strongly correlated insulators, thereby paving the way for band-structure engineering in strong-correlation electronics, which enables previously unexplored functionalities by exploiting the unconventional characteristics revealed in this paper.</description>
