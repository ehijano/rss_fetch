      <title>Dark Matter in White Dwarfs: Implications for Their Structure</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.03801</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.03801v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: White Dwarfs (WDs), the final evolutionary stage of most stars, are frequently modeled considering only a dense plasma matter. However, their potential interaction with dark matter (DM), especially in galactic halos where DM is expected to be prevalent, may lead to significant consequences. This work proposes a novel EoS (EoS) that consistently incorporates both hot dense plasma and cold dark matter (CDM) contributions in hot WDs. The hot dense plasma EoS is extended to include thermal and radiative contributions. At the same time, the CDM component is modeled as a linear fluid, with the coupling constant $\alpha$ determined self-consistently within the star. A smooth phase transition between hot dense plasma and CDM regimes is introduced via a hyperbolic mixing function that depends on local energy density and stellar temperature. Our results show that the inclusion of CDM leads to an increase in the WD radius by approximately $12\%$ and a total mass enhancement of $0.7\%$, compared to standard hot WD models without lattice effects. These results highlight the importance of considering CDM in stellar modeling and suggest that WDs may serve as indirect probes for the astrophysical properties of dark matter.</description>

      <title>Effects of density stratification on Rossby waves in deep atmospheres</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.03832</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.03832v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Though Rossby waves have been observed on the Sun, their radial eigenfunctions remain a mystery. The prior theoretical work either considers quasi-2D systems, which do not apply to the solar interior, or only considers fully radiative or fully convective atmospheres. This project calculates the radial eigenfunctions for Rossby waves in a deep atmosphere for a general stratification. Here, we use the $\beta$-plane approximation to derive a vertical equation in terms of the Lagrangian pressure fluctuation $\delta P$, and we then calculate radial eigenfunctions for Rossby waves in a standard solar model, Model S. We find that working in the Lagrangian pressure fluctuation results in cleaner wave equations that lack internal singularities that have been encountered in prior work. The resulting radial wave equation makes it abundantly clear that there are two wave cavities in the solar interior, one in the radiative interior and another in the convection zone. Surprisingly, our calculated radial vorticity eigenfunctions for the radiative interior modes are nearly constant throughout the convection zone, raising the possibility that they may be observable at the solar surface.</description>

      <title>Do Planets Affect the Behavior of the Long-term Solar Activity?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.03889</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.03889v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Solar activity is a process driven by many independent but interconnected phenomena. Although the 11-year cycle is the result of operation of the dynamo mechanism, the cause of longer secular variations is not clear. In search of such a cause, it was proposed to take into account the influence of the planetary system. In order to verify the idea, we consider the action of all planets in the solar system reduced to the effect of a single barycenter. The tidal force is decomposed into radial and meridional components. The radial tidal force is too small compared to the powerful radial gravity of the Sun. The meridional force is not compensated for by solar gravity and depends on latitude. As the latitude of the barycenter changes quite slowly, the sign of this component changes over a characteristic time scale of about 5 years, during which the meridional acceleration constantly acts on the surface of the Sun. This could ultimately lead to speeds of several meters per second and, in principle, could significantly change the speeds of the meridional currents involved in generating the magnetic field. However, it turned out that the calculated speed variation does not agree with the observed periodicity of solar activity. Earlier, the relation was analyzed between the activity periods on solar-type stars and the rotation periods of exoplanets, and no correspondence was observed either. Thus, the planetary hypothesis as a cause of long-term modulation of solar activity is not confirmed.</description>

      <title>Energy-dependent SEP Fe/O abundances during the May 2024 superstorm</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.03905</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.03905v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: During mid-May 2024, active region (AR) 13664 produced a series of M- and X-class flares along with several coronal mass ejections (CMEs) that resulted in exceptionally strong aurora at Earth. This study presents in-situ solar energetic particle (SEP) ion composition data from Solar Terrestrial Relations Observatory Ahead (STA), Advanced Composition Explorer (ACE), and Parker Solar Probe (PSP) as their magnetic connectivity to AR 13664 varied throughout the event period. Between 08 to 24 May, STA was separated by 12{\deg} in longitude from ACE at 0.96 AU. SEP intensities rose gradually due to merged CMEs from AR 13664. On 13 May, an M6 flare was followed by a rapid-onset SEP event at STA, although velocity dispersion analysis yielded no clear path length or release time. PSP, 95{\deg} longitudinally separated from Earth at 0.74 AU, observed gradually increasing SEP intensities beginning 11 May, followed by a jump in both SEP intensity and magnetic field (&gt;100 nT) on 16 May. These early event intervals display stepwise SEP increases, consistent with the passage of successive CMEs. On 20 May, an X16.5 flare from AR 13664 produced an Fe-rich SEP event observed at all three spacecraft despite their wide longitudinal separations. Throughout the period, Fe/O ratios ranged from &lt;0.01 to &gt;0.8 and increased with energy between 1 to 100 MeV/nuc. This trend deviates from the typical energy-dependent decrease expected from diffusive shock acceleration and suggests more complex scenarios, possibly involving variable suprathermal seed populations or species-dependent transport.</description>

      <title>Non ideal Transport Processes in the Solar Atmosphere</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.03949</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.03949v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Transport coefficients are calculated for a partially ionized plasma consisting of approximately 90% hydrogen and 10\% helium, representative of a model solar atmosphere with an assumed magnetic field profile. The ion Hall parameter, defined as the ratio of ion cyclotron to ion collision frequency, is determined by considering dominant resonance charge exchange processes alongside less significant nonresonant ion neutral collisions. Based on these calculations, we derive profiles for various transport coefficients. Our results demonstrate that thermal conductivity in partially ionized media, both parallel and perpendicular to the ambient magnetic field, is dominated by neutral particles. The perpendicular thermal conductivity components show weak dependence on the ion Hall parameter and remain comparable in magnitude to their parallel counterparts. Wave damping through neutral thermal conductivity may contribute significantly to solar atmospheric heating. These findings indicate that perpendicular thermal conductivity components are essential for accurate modelling of partially ionized regions, including photosphere-chromosphere transition layers, spicules, and coronal prominences.</description>

      <title>TESS and ground-based observations of WZ Sge-type dwarf novae in outburst</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.04175</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.04175v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Dwarf nova (DN) superoutbursts are accompanied by superhumps, which change their periods and profiles over a superoutburst. We present the TESS and ground-based observations of nine WZ Sge-type DNe and candidates in superoutburst. In TCP J23580961$+$5502508, ASASSN-23ba, PNV J19030433$-$3102187, V748 Hya, and ASASSN-25ci, we confirmed double-peaked oscillations called early superhumps, which are regarded as the unambiguous feature of WZ Sge-type DNe. On the other hand, the superhump and outburst properties of MO Psc and V1676 Her suggest that they may not be a member of WZ Sge-type DNe. The 2022 superoutburst of a confirmed WZ Sge-type DN TCP J05515391$+$6504346, however, lacked an early superhump phase. We find superhumps in a WZ Sge-type DN ASASSN-20mq during its rebrightening outburst. Thanks to the continuous coverage of TESS, we find the broken-powerlaw rise of the outburst light curve in V748 Hya and PNV J19030433$-$3102187, previously found in only one WZ Sge-type DN observed by Kepler. Early superhumps appeared when the system reached $\simeq40$% of the outburst peak flux. No orbital modulation from a hot spot is detected before and after this. This non-detection of orbital humps on the early rise of V748 Hya constrains that the corresponding mass transfer rate should be below $\simeq1\times10^{16}$ g s$^{-1}$, disfavouring an enhancement of a mass transfer rate by an order of magnitude or larger, even if it occurs. The contentious TESS observations also confirm the coexistence of early and ordinary superhumps during their transition and $\leq$2-cycle duration of stage A--B superhump transition in V748 Hya.</description>

      <title>Partial Null Point Reconnection of an Eruptive Filament</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.04231</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.04231v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Solar filaments are cool and dense plasma structures suspended in the solar corona against gravity. We present observations of a quiescent filament eruption that occurs on 13 July 2015. The eruption is associated with a two-ribbon GOES B8.9 class flare. Photospheric magnetic flux cancellation is present below the filament during days. This builds up a flux rope which progressively rises until it gets unstable, first leading to a confined eruption and pre-flare brightenings, then to an ejection which starts $\approx$ 20 min later with the flare onset. An interesting feature of this event is the presence of a large circular brightening formed around the erupting region. This brightening is produced due to interchange reconnection of the ejected magnetic configuration with the surrounding open magnetic field. This null-point topology is confirmed by a potential-field extrapolation. The EUV loops located on the southern side of the filament eruption first contract during the null-point reconnection, then expand as the flux rope is ejected. The associated CME has both a classical flux rope shape and plasma ejected along open field lines on the flux rope side (a trace of interchange reconnection). Finally, we set all this disparate observations within a coherent framework where magnetic reconnection occurs both below and above the erupting filament.</description>

      <title>3D Non-LTE radiation transfer: theory and applications to stars, exoplanets, and kilonovae</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.04254</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.04254v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Most of the physical information about astrophysical objects is obtained via the analysis of their electromagnetic spectra. Observed data coupled with radiation transfer models in physical conditions representative of stars, planets, kilonovae, and ISM, yield constrains on their physical structure, gas flow dynamics at the surface, mass loss, and detailed chemical composition of the systems. All these core astrophysical parameters are just as reliable as the physical quality of the models that are employed for simulations of radiation transfer. Recent advances in multi-D transfer modeling with Non-Local Thermodynamic Equilibrium (NLTE) in inhomogeneous time-dependent systems revealed systematic shortcomings of canonical models. Owing to major complexities of solving coupled multi-frequency RT equations in 3D geometry, a number of approximations have been introduced. This review presents an overview of the physical problem, standard solutions, and recent methodological advances. We also provide an overview of main results in the area of 3D NLTE radiation transfer and its applications to modeling diverse astrophysical environments, including FGKM type- and OBA-type stars, multi-epoch spectra of kilonovae, and atmospheres of rocky and gaseous exoplanets.</description>

      <title>The Initial mass function of field stars with mass $\leq$ 1 $M_{\odot}$ varies with metallicity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.04280</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.04280v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigated a volume-limited sample of LAMOST main-sequence stars with masses from 0.25 to 1 $M_{\odot}$ and distances of 150-350 pc to explore how the stellar initial mass function (IMF) varies with metallicity. We corrected the spectroscopic selection function by comparing the stellar number densities with the photometric ones at the same colour and magnitude. From these corrected number density distributions, we derived IMFs for each metallicity sub-samples. Fitting a broken power-law function in each IMF with a fixed break point at 0.525 $M_{\odot}$, we found the power-law indices increase with [Fe/H] for both mass regimes: $\alpha_1$ (mass $\leq$ 0.525 $M_{\odot}$) rises from 0.54 $\pm$ 0.21 to 1.40 $\pm$ 0.07 and $\alpha_2$ (mass&gt;0.525 $M_{\odot}$) grows from 1.40 $\pm$ 0.16 to 1.86 $\pm$ 0.04 as [Fe/H] varies from -1 to +0.5 dex. It demonstrates that low-mass stars make up a larger fraction in metal-rich environments than in metal-poor ones. We performed simulations to assess the impact of unresolved binaries on the IMF power-law indices. After correction, the binary-adjusted $\alpha$ values retained a similar metallicity-dependent trend. Furthermore, by examining the IMF of the aggregate sample, we found the corrected indices ($\alpha_{\rm{1,corr}} = 1.48 \pm 0.03$ , $\alpha_{\rm{2,corr}} = 2.17 \pm 0.03$) are consistent with Kroupa's IMF values ($\alpha_1 = 1.3 \pm 0.5$ and $\alpha_2 = 2.3 \pm 0.3$). Finally, we verified the robustness of our results by testing different break points and mass bin sizes, confirming that the IMF's dependence on [Fe/H] remains consistent.</description>

      <title>Massive stars exploding in a He-rich circumstellar medium XII. SN 2024acyl: A fast, linearly declining Type Ibn supernova with early flash-ionisation features</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.04337</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.04337v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a photometric and spectroscopic analysis of the Type Ibn supernova (SN) 2024acyl. It rises to an absolute magnitude peak of about -17.58 mag in 10.6 days, and displays a rapid linear post-peak light-curve decline in all bands, similar to most SNe Ibn. The optical pseudobolometric light curve peaks at ($3.5\pm0.8) \times 10^{42}$ erg s$^{-1}$, with a total radiated energy of $(5.0\pm0.4) \times 10^{48}$ erg. The spectra are dominated by a blue continuum at early stages, with narrow P-Cygni \Hei~lines and flash-ionisation emission lines of C {\sc iii}, N {\sc iii}, and He {\sc ii}. The P-Cygni \Hei~features gradually evolve and become emission-dominated in late-time spectra. The \Ha~line is detected throughout the entire spectral evolution, which indicates that the CSM is helium-rich with some residual amount of H. Our multiband light-curve modelling yields estimates of the ejecta mass of $M_{ej}$ = $0.98^{+0.30}_{-0.20} \, \msun$, with a kinetic energy of $E_{k} = 0.13^{+0.03}_{-0.02} \times 10^{51}$ erg, and a $^{56}Ni$ mass of $M_{\mathrm{Ni}} = 0.017 \, \msun$. The inferred CSM properties are characterised by a mass of $M_{\rm{CSM}} = 0.39^{+0.04}_{-0.04}$ \msun, an inner radius of $R_0$=$15.6^{+1.9}_{-2.0}$ AU, and a density $\rho_{CSM} = (1.32\pm0.22)\times10^{-11} \, \mathrm{g\,cm^{-3}}$. The multi-epoch spectra are well reproduced by the CMFGEN/ \texttt{he4p0} model, corresponding to a He-ZAMS mass of 4~M$_\odot$. These findings are consistent with a scenario of an SN powered by ejecta-CSM interaction, originating from a low-mass helium star that evolved within an interacting binary system where the CSM with some residual hydrogen may originate from the mass-transfer process. In addition, a channel of core-collapse explosion of a late-type Wolf-Rayet star with H, or an Ofpe/WN9 star with fallback accretion, cannot be entirely ruled out.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2511.04346v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In our alternative theory, built around the coincidence of experimental and theoretical data, three "free" parameters -- the magnetic field in the tachocline of the order of ~10^7 G (see Fig.(A.1) and Eq.(A17) in V. D. Rusov et al. (2021)), the axion mass ma ~3.2*10^{-2} eV (see Eq. (11) in V. D. Rusov et al. (2021)), and the asymmetric dark matter (ADM) in the Universe with mADM ~5 GeV ((see V. D. Rusov et al. (2021); A. C. Vincent et al. (2016)) -- give a complete solution to the problem of the theory of magnetic flux tubes in strong fields with 11-year variations of axion-origin photons, which are caused by and anticorrelated to the 11-year variations in density of ADM, gravitationally captured on the Sun.</description>

      <title>2D unified atmosphere and wind simulations for a grid of O-type stars</title>

      <description>arXiv:2511.04542v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The atmospheres of massive O-type stars (O stars) are dynamic, turbulent environments resulting from radiatively driven instabilities over the iron bump, located slightly beneath the stellar surface. Here, complex radiation hydrodynamic processes affect the structure of the atmosphere as well as the formation of spectral lines. In quantitative spectroscopic analysis, the effects of these processes are often parametrized with ad hoc techniques and values. This work is aimed at exploring how variation of basic atmospheric parameters affects the dynamics within the subsurface turbulent zone. We also explore how this turbulence relates to absorption lines formed in the photosphere for a broad range of O stars at solar metallically. The work in this paper centers around a grid of 2D, radiation-hydrodynamic O-star atmosphere and wind simulations, where the turbulent region is an emergent property of the simulation. For each of the 36 models in the grid, we derived the turbulent properties and correlated them to an estimate of turbulent line broadening imposed by the models' velocity fields. Our work suggests that the subphotospheric turbulent velocity in O-stars scales approximately with the square of the Eddington arameter, $\Gamma_{\rm e}$. We also find a linear correlation between subphotospheric turbulent velocity and the line broadening of several synthetic photospheric absorption lines. Radiation carries more energy than advection throughout the atmosphere for all models in the grid; however, for O-type supergiants, the latter can account for up to 30 \% of the total flux at the peak of the iron bump.</description>

      <title>Automatic detection of CMEs using synthetically-trained Mask R-CNN</title>

      <description>arXiv:2511.04589v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Coronal mass ejections (CMEs) are a major driver of space weather. To assess CME geoeffectiveness, among other scientific goals, it is necessary to reliably identify and characterize their morphology and kinematics in coronagraph images. Current methods of CME identification are either subjected to human biases or perform a poor identification due to deficiencies in the automatic detection. In this approach, we have trained the deep convolutional neural model Mask R-CNN to automatically segment the outer envelope of one or multiple CMEs present in a single difference coronagraph image. The empirical training dataset is composed of 10^5 synthetic coronagraph images with known pixel-level CME segmentation masks. It is obtained by combining quiet coronagraph observations, with synthetic white-light CMEs produced using the GCS geometric model and ray-tracing technique. We found that our model-based trained Mask R-CNN infers segmentation masks that are smooth and topologically connected. While the inferred masks are not representative of the detailed outer envelope of complex CMEs, the neural model can better differentiate a CME from other radially moving background/foreground features, segment multiple simultaneous CMEs that are close to each other, and work with images from different instruments. This is accomplished without relying on kinematic information, i.e. only the included in the single input difference image. We obtain a median IoU=0.98 for 1.6*10^4 synthetic validation images, and IoU=0.77 when compared with two independent manual segmentations of 115 observations acquired by the COR2-A, COR2-B and LASCO C2 coronagraphs. The methodology presented in this work can be used with other CME models to produce more realistic synthetic brightness images while preserving desired morphological features, and obtain more robust and/or tailored segmentations.</description>

      <title>The Pre-Outburst Properties of the FU Ori Object HBC 722</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.04592</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.04592v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: FU Ori outbursts are thought to play an important role in stellar assembly and the evolution of protoplanetary disks. However, the progenitor young stellar objects are largely uncharacterized. We obtained a low-resolution optical spectrum of HBC 722 before its FU Ori outburst as part of a survey of young stellar objects in the North America Nebula. The spectrum yields a spectral type of M3.3$\pm$0.4, which when combined with archival photometry allows us to measure the stellar and accretion properties of a young star prior to its FU Ori outburst. The pre-outburst accretion rate of $7\times10^{-9}$ M$_\odot$ yr$^{-1}$ is high for a protoplanetary disk around an M3-M3.5 star, though about 15,000 times weaker than the accretion rate during the outburst. The pre-outburst variability, inferred from archival B-band photometry, is about a factor 5 with a standard deviation of 0.16 dex and is consistent with variable accretion onto young low-mass stars. The stellar radius is larger than the radius of accreting young stars of similar spectral type by a factor of two. The extinction to HBC 722 is $\sim 1.45\pm0.3$~mag, lower than the 2.5--3.7~mag extinction values measured during the outburst. The u-band photometry plays an especially important role in constraining the veiling at longer wavelengths and therefore also the extinction and photospheric luminosity.</description>

      <title>Peculiarities in the infrared emission of PAH-C$_{60}$ adducts</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.04606</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.04606v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The coexistence of PAHs and the C$_{60}$ fullerene in different astrophysical environments can give rise to the formation of new complex species denoted as PAH-C$_{60}$ adducts, which may contribute to the infrared (IR) emission observed. These PAH-C$_{60}$ adducts have been previously reported experimentally due to the high reactivity between PAHs and C$_{60}$. From the astrophysical point of view, however, they have not been considered in detail yet. Here we have performed a combined experimental and theoretical study in order to characterize the IR spectra of PAH-C$_{60}$ adducts, including multiple adducts. By using new advanced experimental techniques, we have been able to synthesize some specific PAH-C$_{60}$ adduct isomers, and measured their IR spectra. These experimental data are used to correct their harmonic scaled spectra, as obtained from quantum-chemistry calculations performed at the DFT level under the B3LYP-GD3/6-31+G(d) approach. This way, we simulate the IR ($\sim$3$-$25 $\mu$m) spectra of multiple PAH-C$_{60}$ adducts, composed by a different number of PAH units: mostly one or two units. In addition, the chemical kinetics data available in the literature are used to tentatively estimate the possible order of magnitude of the abundances of these PAH-C$_{60}$ adducts using the available observational data. Essentially, our results reveal a possible strong modification of the IR spectra when astronomically estimated abundances are considered. Several spectral peculiarities are observed, such as a broad $\sim$3.4-3.6 $\mu$m feature, and important modifications in the 6-10 and 12-16 $\mu$m spectral regions together with contributions to the C$_{60}$ features at 7.0 and 18.9 $\mu$m. Interestingly, these PAH-C$_{60}$ adducts lack aliphatic CH bonds, but they display IR features around 3.4 $\mu$m, challenging previous interpretations of this astronomical feature.</description>

      <title>Dynamical Masses of Young Stellar Multiple Systems with the VLBA (DYNAMO-VLBA)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.04642</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.04642v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Very Long Baseline Interferometry (VLBI) provides high angular resolution images and has been used for stellar astrometry for decades. The DYNAMO-VLBA project utilizes the Very Long Baseline Array (VLBA) to study tight binary and multiple pre-main sequence stars, whose components have detectable radio emission and typical separations on the order of milli-arcseconds. Such systems cannot be resolved by Gaia, making VLBI an essential tool for the study of their orbital parameters and, eventually, the determination of their mass. Here, we report VLBA dynamical mass measurements of the individual stars in the S1 system in Ophiuchus and EC\,95 in Serpens. S1 is the most luminous and massive stellar member of the nearby Ophiuchus star-forming region. We find that the primary component, S1A, has a mass of $4.11 \pm 0.10\,M_{\odot}$. This is significantly less than the value of $\sim6\,M_{\odot}$ expected from theoretical models given the location of S1A on the HR diagram. The secondary, S1B, has a mass of $0.831 \pm 0.014\,M_{\odot}$ and is most likely a T Tauri star. In the Serpens triple system EC\,95, we measure the masses of EC\,95A and EC\,95B, finding $2.15\pm0.10$ M$_\odot$ and $2.00\pm0.12$ M$_\odot$, respectively. In this case, the measured masses agree with the location of the stars in the HR diagram for very young 2 $M_\odot$ stars. For the first time, we also estimated the mass of tertiary, EC\,95C, to be 0.26 $^{+0.53}_{-0.46}$ M$_\odot$.</description>

      <title>Magnetic Field-Line Curvature and Its Role in Particle Acceleration by Magnetically Dominated Turbulence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.20628</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.20628v2 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We employ first-principles, fully kinetic particle-in-cell simulations to investigate magnetic field-line curvature in magnetically dominated turbulent plasmas and its role in particle acceleration through curvature-drift motion along the motional electric field. By varying the fluctuation-to-mean magnetic-field ratio $\delta B_0/B_0$, we examine curvature $\kappa$ statistics and their connection to particle acceleration. The curvature probability densities display broad power-law wings, scaling linearly in $\kappa$ below the peak and developing hard high-$\kappa$ tails for $\delta B_0/B_0 \gtrsim 1$. As the mean field strengthens, the high-$\kappa$ tails steepen, and large-curvature events are suppressed when $\delta B_0/B_0 \ll 1$. The probability density functions of magnetic field-line contraction, ${\bf v}_E \cdot {\bf \kappa}$, with ${\bf v}_E$ the field-line velocity, develop power-law tails well described by a symmetric Pareto distribution, characteristic of stochastic energy exchanges, with the tails becoming harder as $\delta B_0/B_0$ increases. Our guiding-center analysis shows that curvature-drift acceleration accounts for a substantial fraction of the energization via the motional electric field, and that it strengthens with increasing $\delta B_0/B_0$. For well-magnetized particles, curvature-drift acceleration typically exceeds ${\bf\nabla}B$ drift, polarization drift, and betatron contributions. These results identify curvature-drift acceleration as a principal pathway through which magnetized turbulence transfers energy to nonthermal particles in astrophysical plasmas.</description>

      <title>Stellar Evolution with Radiative Feedback in AGN Disks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.03904</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.03904v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Stars embedded in the inner pc region of an active galactic nucleus (AGN) experience extreme accretion conditions that significantly alter their evolution. We present one-dimensional MESA simulations of stars growing and decaying within AGN disks, implementing radiative-feedback-regulated accretion which limits stellar growth near the Eddington luminosity, as well as wind-driven mass loss. Unlike stand-alone stars in the field, these embedded stars follow unique evolutionary tracks with well-determined mass evolution and chemical yields. We distinguish two regimes: ``immortal" stars that indefinitely remain on the main sequence due to efficient hydrogen mixing; and ``metamorphic" stars that evolves off the main sequence, ultimately enriching the disk with heavy elements upon hydrogen and helium exhaustion in their cores. Results indicate that embedded stars in AGN disks can attain large masses, but gas retention and limited mixing likely render the ``immortal" track unsustainable. We show radiative feedback plays a critical role in preventing runaway growth, since it regulates the inflow to at most of order-unity the Eddington-limited mass-loss rate. Embedded metamorphic stars significantly enrich AGN disks with helium and $\alpha$-elements, potentially explaining the observed high metallicity in broad-line regions (BLR) without excessive helium enrichment. This study underscores the critical interplay between stellar feedback and accretion physics in shaping the stellar populations and chemical evolution within AGN disks.</description>

      <title>Spectral Diversity in Type Ibn Supernovae and the Large Host Offset of SN2024acyl</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.03926</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.03926v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we first present observations of SN~2024acyl, a normal Type Ibn supernova with a large projected offset ($\sim$35~kpc) from its host galaxy. The low star-formation rate measured at the explosion site raises the possibility that the progenitor of SN~2024acyl may not have been a massive star. We then examine, more broadly, the spectral diversity of Type Ibn supernovae around 20--35 days after peak brightness and identify two distinct groups: Group I, which shows bluer rest-frame optical color and narrower He~I emission lines; and Group II, which shows redder rest-frame optical color and broader He~I lines. Group~I also tends to show higher peak luminosities. The diversity we identify appears to be closely connected to the diversity observed around peak and to persist into late phases ($&gt;80$ days after peak). Given its redder color and broader He~I lines, we classify SN~2024acyl as belonging to Group II. Based on the current dataset, we find no clear connection between this spectral diversity and either the host environments of Type Ibn SNe or their pre-explosion activity. The observed diversity in Type Ibn SNe likely reflects differences in circumstellar material properties and/or explosion energetics. These differences could result from a range of progenitor properties, such as different helium star mass, orbital period and companion type if they are in binary systems, and may indicate fundamentally diverse progenitors. Whether a continuous distribution exists between the two groups remains to be determined and will require further data to explore.</description>

      <title>Limiting Eccentricity in Restricted Hierarchical Three-Body Systems with Short-Range Forces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.04146</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.04146v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A hierarchical three-body model can be widely applied to diverse astrophysical settings, from satellite-planet-star systems to binaries around supermassive black holes. The octupole-order perturbation on the inner binary from the tertiary can induce extreme eccentricities and cause orbital flips of the binary, but short-range forces such as those due to General Relativity (GR) may suppress extreme eccentricity excitations. In this paper, we consider restricted hierarchical three-body systems, where the inner binary has a test-mass component. We investigate the maximum possible eccentricity (called "limiting eccentricity") attainable by the inner binary under the influence of the tertiary perturbations and GR effect. In systems with sufficiently high hierarchy, the double averaging (DA) model is a good approximation; we show that the orbits which can flip under the octupole-order perturbation reach the same limiting eccentricity, which can be calculated analytically using the quadrupole-order Hamiltonian. In systems with moderate hierarchy, DA breaks down and the so-called Brown Hamiltonian is often introduced as a correction term; we show that this does not change the limiting eccentricity. Finally, we employ the single averaging (SA) model and find that the limiting eccentricity in the SA model is higher than the one in the DA model. We derive an analytical scaling for the modified limiting eccentricity in the SA model.</description>

      <title>Cepheid Metallicity in the Leavitt Law (C- MetaLL) survey: IX: Spectroscopic detection of rare earth Dysprosium, Erbium, Lutetium and Thorium in Classical Cepheids</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.04269</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.04269v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Classical Cepheids are among the most important distance calibrators and play a crucial role in the calibration as the first rung of the extragalactic distance ladder. Given their typical age, they also constitute an optimal tracer of the young population in the Galactic disc. We aim to increase the number of available DCEPS with high-resolution spectroscopic metallicities, to study the galactocentric radial gradients of several chemical elements and analyse the spatial distribution of the Galactic young population of stars in the Milky Way disc. We performed a complete spectroscopical analysis of 136 spectra obtained from three different high-resolution spectrographs, for a total of 60 DCEPs. More than half have pulsational periods longer than 15 days, up to 70 days, doubling the number of stars in our sample with P&gt;15d. We derived radial velocities, atmospheric parameters and chemical abundances up to 33 different species. We present an updated list of trusted spectroscopic lines for the detection and estimation of chemical abundances. We used this new set to revisit the abundances already published in the context of the C-MetaLL survey and increase the number of available chemical species. For the first time (to our knowledge), we present the estimation of abundances for Dysprosium, as well as a systematic estimation of Erbium, Lutetium and Thorium abundances. We calculate a galactic radial gradient for [Fe/H] with a slope of $-0.064\pm0.002$, in good agreement with recent literature estimation. The other elements also exhibit a clear negative radial trend, with this effect diminishing and eventually disappearing for heavier neutron-capture elements. Depending on the proposed spiral arms model present in several literature sources, our most external stars agree on tracing either the Perseus, the Norma-Outer or both the Outer and the association Outer-Scutum-Centaurus (OSC) arms.</description>

      <title>Transiting Exoplanets from Sharjah Astronomical Observatory (SAO-M47): The Exoplanet HAT-P-25b Using L and V Filters</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.04396</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.04396v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this study, we conduct a comparative analysis of observations carried out on the exoplanet HAT-P-25 b at the Sharjah Astronomical Observatory (SAO). We have employed two distinct filters, namely, the Luminoso (L) and Visual (V) filters. Our research aims to discern any variations in transit depth or exoplanet size resulting from the use of these different filters. The primary focus of this study is to determine the exoplanet's size relative to its host star using the transit method. The application of different filters was expected to introduce subtle variations in size, influenced by factors such as the exoplanet's atmosphere. Notably, our findings reveal that the exoplanet's size appears larger when observed through the L filter compared to the V filter. Throughout the analytical process, we employed the TRASCA model to determine the transit depth for each epoch. Fixed parameters, including the orbital period of the exoplanet (P, measured in days) and the transit duration (measured in minutes), were utilized in these calculations. Our results indicate that the transit depths observed with the L filter were greater than those with the V filter, measuring 0.0238 magnitudes and 0.0200 magnitudes, respectively. These values deviate from the reference result of 0.0204 magnitudes.</description>

Abstract: We present a comprehensive study on the physical and chemical structures of a chemically rich bipolar outflow in a high-mass star forming region IRAS 16272$-$4837 (SDC335), utilizing high-resolution spectral line data at 1.3 mm and 3 mm dual-bands from the ALMA ATOMS and QUARKS surveys. The high-velocity jet is enveloped by a lower-velocity outflow cavity, containing bright knots that show enhanced molecular intensities and elevated excitation temperatures. Along the outflow, we have identified 35 transitions from 22 molecular species. By analyzing the spatial distribution and kinematics of these molecular lines, we find that the molecular inventory in the outflow is regulated by three processes: (i) direct entrainment from the natal molecular core by the outflow; (ii) shock-induced release of molecules or atoms from dust grains; and (iii) thermal desorption and gas-phase reactions driven by shock heating. These results confirm that outflows are not only dynamical structures but also active chemical factories, where entrainment, shocks, and thermal processing jointly enrich the molecular content. Our findings confirmed that outflow chemistry has multi-origin nature, and provide critical insights into chemical evolution during high-mass star formation.</description>

      <title>Coronal hole picoflare jets are progenitors of both fast and Alfv\'enic slow solar wind</title>

Abstract: Solar wind, classified by its bulk speed and the Alfv\'enic nature of its fluctuations, generates the heliosphere. The elusive physical processes responsible for the generation of the different types of this wind are a topic of active debate. Recent observations reveal intermittent jets, with kinetic energy in the picoflare range, emerging from dark areas of a polar coronal hole threaded by open magnetic field lines. These could substantially contribute to solar wind. However, their ubiquity and direct links to solar wind have not been established. Here, we report a unique set of remote-sensing and in situ observations from the Solar Orbiter spacecraft that establish a unified picture of fast and Alfv\'{e}nic slow wind, connected to the similar widespread picoflare jet activity in two coronal holes. Radial expansion of coronal holes ultimately regulates the speed of the emerging wind.</description>

      <title>Black Hole Survival Guide: Searching for Stars in the Galactic Center That Endure Partial Tidal Disruption</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.14705v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Once per 10,000-100,000 years, an unlucky star may experience a close encounter with a supermassive black hole (SMBH), partially or fully tearing apart the star in an exceedingly brief, bright interaction called a tidal disruption event (TDE). Remnants of partial TDEs are expected to be plentiful in our Galactic center, where at least six unexplained, diffuse, star-like "G objects" have already been detected which may have formed via interactions between stars and the SMBH. Using numerical simulations, this work aims to identify the characteristics of TDE remnants. We take 3D hydrodynamic FLASH models of partially disrupted stars and map them into the 1D stellar evolution code MESA to examine the properties of these remnants from tens to billions of years after the TDE. The remnants initially exhibit a brief, highly luminous phase, followed by an extended cooling period as they return to stable hydrogen burning. During the initial stage (&lt; 100,000 yr) their luminosities increase by orders of magnitude, making them intriguing candidates to explain a fraction of the mysterious G objects. Notably, mild TDEs are the most common and result in the brightest remnants during this initial phase. However, most remnants exist in a long-lived stage where they are only modestly offset in temperature and luminosity compared to main-sequence stars of equivalent mass. Nonetheless, our results indicate remnants will sustain abnormal, metal-enriched envelopes that may be discernible through spectroscopic analysis. Identifying TDE survivors within the Milky Way could further illuminate some of the most gravitationally intense encounters in the Universe.</description>

      <title>Glitch analysis and asteroseismic modelling of subgiant $\mu$ Herculis: confirming and interpreting the $\Gamma_1$ peak as the helium glitch</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.01577</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.01577v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The measurements of pressure-mode and mixed-mode oscillation frequencies in subgiant stars offer a unique opportunity to probe their internal structures -- from the surface to the deep interior -- and to precisely determine their global properties. We have conducted a detailed asteroseismic analysis of the benchmark subgiant $\mu$ Herculis using eight seasons of radial velocity observations from the SONG-Tenerife, and have determined its mass, radius, age, and surface helium abundance to be $1.105_{-0.024}^{+0.058}$ M$_\odot$, $1.709_{-0.015}^{+0.030}$ R$_\odot$, $8.4_{-0.1}^{+0.4}$ Gyr, and $0.242^{+0.006}_{-0.021}$, respectively. We have demonstrated that simultaneously fitting the helium glitch properties, oscillation frequencies, and spectroscopic observables yields a more accurate inference of the surface helium abundance and hence stellar age. A significant discrepancy between the observed extent of the helium ionization zone and that predicted by stellar models is identified and examined, underscoring potential limitations in the current modelling of stellar interiors. Our analysis confirms that the helium glitch originates from the region between the two stages of helium ionisation, i.e. from the $\Gamma_1$ peak, rather than from the second helium ionisation zone itself. Within the conventional formalism, this implies that the glitch analysis characterises the region located between the two helium ionisation zones.</description>

      <title>The SPAr burning: proton captures powering carbon-oxygen shell mergers in massive stars</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.13749</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.13749v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Carbon-oxygen (C-O) shell mergers in massive stars play a crucial role in both nucleosynthesis and the final stages of stellar evolution. These convective-reactive events significantly alter the internal structure of the star shortly before core collapse. We investigate how the enhanced production of light particles (especially protons) during a C-O shell merger, relative to classical oxygen shell burning, affects the energy balance and evolution of the convective shell. We derive the budget for direct and reverse nucleosynthesis flows across all relevant nuclear reactions from stellar evolution models, and we assess the relative energy produced. We find that proton capture reactions on 32,34S, 31P, and 38Ar (SPAr) dominate the nuclear energy production in typical C-O shell mergers as predicted by 1D stellar models. Their combined energy output is approximately 400 times greater than that of C and O fusion under the same conditions. Our results highlight the critical importance of including these proton-capture reactions in simulations of convective-reactive burning. This work suggests that excluding their contribution can lead to inaccurate modeling of the dynamics and nucleosynthesis in advanced stellar evolutionary phases. Such results will need to be confirmed by new 1D stellar simulations and 3D hydrodynamics models.</description>

      <title>Mass-radius relationship and gravitational wave emission from magnetized spheroidal quark stars</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.20459</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.20459v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this work, we investigate the structure and gravitational wave (GW) signatures of strongly magnetized, oblate spheroidal quark stars by employing an anisotropic equation of state (EoS) derived from the MIT Bag model, extended to include the effects of density-dependent strong magnetic fields and the resulting pressure anisotropy arising from the breaking of spatial symmetry. Both magnetized strange quark matter (MSQM) and magnetized color-flavor locked (MCFL) phases are examined within the framework of the $\gamma$-metric formalism, which captures the deviation from spherical symmetry. We compute the mass-radius relation, ellipticity, gravitational redshift, mass quadrupole moment and tidal deformability for representative bag constants of $\rm{65\,MeV/fm^3}$ and $\rm{75\,MeV/fm^3}$. Using the obtained quadrupole moments, we further estimate the continuous gravitational wave strain amplitude ($h_{0}$) for isolated deformed rotating quark stars. Our results indicate that density-dependent strong magnetic fields and color superconductivity can significantly alter stellar compactness and yield gravitational wave signals, potentially detectable by next generation observatories like the Einstein Telescope and Cosmic Explorer.</description>

      <title>Properties of Carbon-rich AGB Stars in the LMC and the Milky Way</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.00397</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.00397v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present a comparative study of carbon-rich asymptotic giant branch (CAGB) stars in the Large Magellanic Cloud (LMC; 7347 stars) and the Milky Way (7163 stars) using infrared color-magnitude diagrams (CMDs), spectral energy distributions (SEDs), two-color diagrams (2CDs), and variability data. Observed SEDs are compared with theoretical models to characterize the central stars and their circumstellar dust envelopes and to estimate distances. For the LMC, a set of best-fitting CAGB models is derived by fitting observed SEDs with radiative transfer models, utilizing the galaxy's well-established distance. For Galactic CAGB stars, where Gaia DR3 parallaxes are uncertain, we estimate distances by fitting observed SEDs with the CAGB models validated against LMC stars, and for Mira variables, from the period-magnitude relation calibrated with LMC Miras. A comparison of these approaches demonstrates that the SED-based distances are both reliable and practical for a large sample of Galactic CAGB stars. We find that CAGB stars in both galaxies show broadly similar infrared properties, although the LMC sample lacks stars with extremely thick dust envelopes.</description>

      <title>Ionospheric responses over the Antarctic region to Intense Space Weather events: Plasma Convection vs. Auroral Precipitation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.27372</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.27372v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The present investigation is directed at exploring southern polar ionospheric responses to intense space weather events and their correlations with plasma convection and auroral precipitation. The main phases of six geomagnetic storms occurring in the year 2023 (ascending phase of the present solar cycle) are considered for this study. The ionospheric Total Electron Content (TEC) measurements derived from GPS receivers covering the Antarctic region are used for probing the electron density perturbations during these events. Auroral precipitation maps are shown to illustrate the locations of the GPS stations relative to particle precipitation. SuperDARN maps are shown to understand the effects of plasma convection over these locations. Correlation between the enhanced TEC observations with the auroral precipitation (R $\sim$ 0.31) and the plasma convection (R $\sim$ 0.88) reveals that the latter is more responsible for causing significant enhancements in the diurnal maximum values of TEC over the Antarctic region in comparison to the former. Therefore, this work shows correlation studies between two physical processes and ionospheric density enhancements over the under-explored south polar region under strong levels of geomagnetic activity during 2023.</description>

      <title>Determining the impact of post-main-sequence stellar evolution on the transiting giant planet population</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.02896</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.02896v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The post-main sequence evolution of stars is expected to impact the exoplanets residing on close-in orbits around them. Using photometric data from the TESS Full-Frame-Images we have performed a transit search for exoplanets with post-main sequence hosts to search for the imprints of these impacts on the giant planet population. We detect 130 short period planets and candidates, thirty-three of which are newly discovered candidates, from a sample of 456,941 post-main sequence stars spanning the evolutionary stages from the end of the main sequence to the bottom of the red giant branch. We measure an occurrence rate of $0.28 \pm 0.04$% for short period giant planets orbiting post-main sequence stars. We also measure occurrence rates for two stellar sub-populations, measuring values of $0.35 \pm 0.05$% for a sub-population representing the earliest stages of post-main sequence evolution and $0.11^{+0.06}_{-0.05}$% for a sub-population of more evolved stars. We show that the giant planet occurrence rate decreases with increasing stellar evolution stage, with a larger occurrence rate decrease observed for shorter period planets. Our results are clear evidence that the population of short period giant planets is being sculpted by the post-main sequence evolution of the host stars, and we conclude that this is most likely through the destruction of these giant planets through the increased strength of planet-star tidal interactions resulting in the rapid tidal decay of the planets' orbits.</description>
