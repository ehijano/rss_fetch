      <title>High multiplicity and global structure of coexistence states in a predator-prey model with saturation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.05714</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.05714v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper establishes that, under the appropriate range of values of the parameters involved in the formulation of the model, a diffusive predator-prey system with saturation can have an arbitrarily large number of coexistence states for sufficiently large saturation rates. Moreover, it ascertains the global structure of the set of coexistence states in the limiting system as the saturation rate blows-up.</description>

      <title>Statistical properties of equilibrium states for fiber-bunched matrix cocycles and applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.05771</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.05771v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We contribute to the thermodynamic formalism of H\"older continuous fiber-bunched matrix cocycles, Anosov diffeomorphisms, and hyperbolic repellers. Specifically, we prove that $1$-typical fiber-bunched cocycles $\mathcal{A}$ over topologically mixing subshifts of finite type admit a unique Gibbs equilibrium state $\mu_t$ associated with the non-additive family of potentials $\{t \log \|\mathcal{A}^n\|\}_{n \in \mathbb{N}}$, for a range of parameters $t \in (-t_*, +\infty)$, where $t_* &gt; 0$. Furthermore, these equilibrium states are $\psi$-mixing, therefore weak Bernoulli. In addition, these results allow us to derive consequences for the thermodynamic formalism of open sets of hyperbolic repellers and Anosov diffeomorphisms. In particular, it provides a positive answer to a conjecture posed by Gatzouras and Peres for $C^1$-open sets of $\alpha$-fiber-bunched hyperbolic repellers.</description>

      <title>B\"ottcher-type potential for the secant map</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.05847</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.05847v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a construction of a B\"ottcher-type holomorphic map for the potential of the secant method dynamical system near a root-type fixed point. The modulus of the B\"ottcher-type map extends to be continuous on the entire basin of attraction of the fixed point, and is real-analytic away from the iterated preimages of the fixed point. Using this construction, we show the associated Green's function for the fixed point is pluriharmonic wherever it is finite.</description>

      <title>Mostly nonuniformly sectional expanding systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.06233</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.06233v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this note, we introduce the notion of mostly nonuniform sectional expanding (MNUSE) for singular flows which contains the well known sectional hyperbolicity as well new definitions as asymptotically sectional and multisingular hyperbolicities. We exhibit an example of nonuniformly sectional hyperbolic set, in this new sense, which is neither $2$-sectional hyperbolic nor asymptotically sectional hyperbolic, proving that this is a broader notion of weak hyperbolicity for singular flows. Moreover, in $C^2$ setting, under some assumptions of either the dimension or the sign of Lyapunov exponents of the central subbundle, we prove that attracting MNUSE sets support a physical/SRB measure. And this measure is unique for MNUSE attractors.</description>

      <title>Singularity of Furstenberg measure for infinite covolume discrete subroups in higher rank</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.06329</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.06329v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider symmetric random walks on discrete, Zariski-dense subgroups $\Gamma$ of a semisimple Lie group $G$ with Property (T). We prove that if $\Gamma$ has infinite covolume, then the associated hitting measure on the Furstenberg boundary of $G$ is singular. This is in contrast to Furstenberg's discretization of Brownian motion to lattices, and it is the first result of this type when $G$ has higher rank.</description>

      <title>Dynamical Systems with Bounded Condition and $C^{*}$-algebras</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.05713</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.05713v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: By introducing the totally uniqueness condition for maps, we establish a one-to-one correspondence between the family of invariant sets for the $q x{+}d$-function (e.g. the $3 x{+}1$-map, also known as the Collatz map), where $q$ and $d$ are arbitrary positive odd numbers, and the family of reducing subspaces for the associated $C^{*}$-algebra. This extends the connection between the Collatz conjecture (also known as the $3 n{+}1$-problem) and the irreducibility of its associated $C^{*}$-algebra. We also introduce homomorphisms between dynamical systems with bounded conditions that preserve the structures of these dynamical systems. We prove the existence of an isomorphism between their associated $C^{*}$-algebras is proven for every isomorphism between dynamical systems with bounded condition.</description>

      <title>A note on the singularity conjecture for infinite covolume discrete subgroups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.05756</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.05756v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider random walks on semisimple Lie groups where the support of the step distribution generates (as a group) a Zariski dense discrete subgroup of infinite covolume. When the semisimple Lie group has property (T), we show that the stationary measure on the Furstenberg boundary is singular to the Lebesgue measure class. This result does not require any condition on the moment or symmetry of the step distribution. When the semisimple Lie group has rank one and the step distribution has a finite first moment, we again show that the stationary measure on the Furstenberg boundary is singular to the Lebesgue measure class. For general semisimple Lie groups, we also obtain a sufficient condition for the singularity of the stationary measure and a general Patterson-Sullivan measure.</description>

      <title>On the factorization of iterates of $x^d+c$ in large degree</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.05795</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.05795v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Let $K$ be a function field of a curve in characteristic zero or a number field over which the $abc$-conjecture holds, fix $\alpha\in K$, and let $f_{d,c}(x)=x^d+c$ for some $d\geq2$ and some $c\in K$. Then for many $c$ and $d$, we prove that $f_{d,c}^n(x)-\alpha$ has at most $d$ factors in $K[x]$ for all $n\geq1$. For example, when $\alpha=0$ we prove that the set \[\Big\{d\,:\, f_{d,c}^n(x)\;\text{has at most $d$ factors in $K[x]$ for all $n\geq1$ and all $h(c)&gt;0$}\Big\}\] has positive asymptotic density. We then apply this result to compute the density of prime divisors in certain forward orbits and to establish the finiteness of integral points in certain backward orbits.</description>

      <title>Replacement dynamics of binary quadratic forms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.05816</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.05816v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: For an $S$-valued function $f$ of $m \geq 1$ variables we define a dynamical process in which the output $f(\overline{v})$ replaces exactly one entry of the input $\overline{v} \in S^m$ at each step in the iterative process. Our study focuses on periodic vectors with respect to this process. We define a stratification of periodic vectors according to their type, and characterize types for which the determination of periodic vectors comes down to dynamics of univariate polynomials. We then restrict to the case of a diagonal binary quadratic form $f$ over $\mathbb{Q}$, and classify rational periodic vectors for all types of period up to $5$. This includes two types which do not arise from the univariate case.</description>

      <title>Collision of orbits for families of polynomials defined over fields of positive characteristic</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.06279</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.06279v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Let $L$ be a field of positive characteristic $p$ with a fixed algebraic closure $\overline{L}$, and let $\alpha_1,\alpha_2,\beta\in L$. For an integer $d\ge 2$, we consider the family of polynomials $f_{\lambda}(z) := z^d+\lambda$, parameterized by $\lambda\in\overline{L}$. Define $C(\alpha_1,\alpha_2;\beta)$ to be the set of all $\lambda\in\overline{L}$ for which there exist $m,n\in\mathbb{N}$ such that $f_{\lambda}^m(\alpha_1)=f_{\lambda}^n(\alpha_2)=\beta$. In other words, $C(\alpha_1,\alpha_2;\beta)$ consists of all $\lambda\in\overline{L}$ with the property that the orbit of $\alpha_1$ collides with the orbit of $\alpha_2$ under the same polynomial $f_{\lambda}$ precisely at the point $\beta$. Assuming $\alpha_1,\alpha_2,\beta$ are not all contained in a finite subfield of $L$, we provide explicit necessary and sufficient conditions under which $C(\alpha_1,\alpha_2;\beta)$ is infinite. We also discuss the remaining case where $\alpha_1,\alpha_2,\beta\in \overline{\mathbb F}_p$ and provide ample computational data that suggest a somewhat surprising conjecture. Our problem fits into a long series of questions in the area of unlikely intersections in arithmetic dynamics, which have been primarily studied over fields of characteristic $0$. Working in characteristic $p$ adds significant difficulties, but also reveals the subtlety of our problem, especially when some of the points lie in a finite field or when $d$ is a power of $p$.</description>

      <title>Parallelized computation of quasi-periodic solutions for finite element problems: A Fourier series expansion-based shooting method</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.06302</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.06302v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: High-dimensional nonlinear mechanical systems admit quasi-periodic solutions that are essential for the understanding of the dynamical systems. These quasi-periodic solutions stay on some invariant tori governed by complex PDEs in hyper-time. Here, we propose a Fourier series expansion-based shooting method (FSE-Shooting) for the parallelized computation of quasi-periodic solution with $d$ base frequencies ($d \ge 2$). We represent the associated $d$-torus as a collection of trajectories initialized at a ($d-1$)-torus. We drive a set of ODEs that hold for any of these trajectories. We also derive a set of boundary conditions that couple the initial and terminal states of these trajectories and then formulate a set of nonlinear algebraic equations via the coupling conditions. We use Fourier series expansion to parameterize the ($d-1$)-torus and shooting method to iterate the Fourier coefficients associated with initial torus such that the coupling conditions are satisfied. In particular, the terminal points of these trajectories are parallelized computed via Newmark integration, where the time points and Fourier coefficients are transformed to each other by alternating Frequency-Time method. A straightforward phase condition is devised to track the quasi-periodic solutions with priori unknown base frequencies. Additionally, the by-product of the FSE-Shooting can be also directly used to compute the Lyapunov exponents to assess the stabilities of quasi-periodic solutions. The results of three finite element systems show the efficiency and versatility of FSE-Shooting in high-dimensional nonlinear dynamical systems, including a three-dimensional shell structure with $1872$ DOFs.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2508.06396v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce the notion of Quasi-Stationary State (QSS) in the context of quantum Markov semigroups that generalizes the one of quasi-stationary distribution in the case of classical Markov chains. We provide an operational interpretation of QSSs using the theory of direct and indirect quantum measurements. Moreover, we prove that there is a connection between QSSs and spectral properties of the quantum Markov semigroup. Finally, we discuss some examples which, despite their simplicity, already show interesting features.</description>

      <title>Quasi-compactness of Frobenius-Perron Operator for Piecewise Convex Maps with Countable Branches</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.19929v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we prove the quasi-compactness of the Frobenius-Perron operator for a piecewise convex map $\tau$ with a countably infinite number of branches on the interval $I=[0,1]$. We establish that for high enough $n$ iterates of $\tau$, $\tau^n$ are piecewise expanding. Using the Lasota-Yorke Inequality derived from references \cite{hofbauer1982} and \cite{keller1985}, adapted to meet the assumptions of the Ionescu-Tulcea and Marinescu ergodic theorem, we demonstrate the existence of absolutely continuous invariant measure (ACIM) $\mu$ for $\tau$, the exactness of the dynamical system $(I, \tau,\mu)$ and the quasi-compactness of Frobenius-Perron operator $P_\tau$ induced by $\tau$. The last fact implies a multitude of strong ergodic properties of $\tau$.</description>

      <title>Equilibrium Selection in Replicator Equations Using Adaptive-Gain Control</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.09305</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.09305v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we deal with the equilibrium selection problem, which amounts to steering a population of individuals engaged in strategic game-theoretic interactions to a desired collective behavior. In the literature, this problem has been typically tackled by means of open-loop strategies, whose applicability is however limited by the need of accurate a priori information on the game and scarce robustness to uncertainty and noise. Here, we overcome these limitations by adopting a closed-loop approach using an adaptive-gain control scheme within a replicator equation -a nonlinear ordinary differential equation that models the evolution of the collective behavior of the population. For most classes of 2-action matrix games we establish sufficient conditions to design a controller that guarantees convergence of the replicator equation to the desired equilibrium, requiring limited a-priori information on the game. Numerical simulations corroborate and expand our theoretical findings.</description>
