      <title>Uniqueness and explicit form of linear Hermite--Chebyshev approximations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.03880</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.03880v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, relying on known results on consistent Hermite-Pad\'e approximations of a system of trigonometric series, sufficient conditions are found under which linear Hermite-Chebyshev approximations exist and are determined uniquely. When the found conditions are met, formulas describing the explicit form of the numerators and denominator of linear Hermite-Pad\'e approximations for a system of functions that are sums of Fourier series with respect to Chebyshev polynomials of the first and second kind are obtained.</description>

      <title>Distribution learning via neural differential equations: minimal energy regularization and approximation theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.03795</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.03795v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Neural ordinary differential equations (ODEs) provide expressive representations of invertible transport maps that can be used to approximate complex probability distributions, e.g., for generative modeling, density estimation, and Bayesian inference. We show that for a large class of transport maps $T$, there exists a time-dependent ODE velocity field realizing a straight-line interpolation $(1-t)x + tT(x)$, $t \in [0,1]$, of the displacement induced by the map. Moreover, we show that such velocity fields are minimizers of a training objective containing a specific minimum-energy regularization. We then derive explicit upper bounds for the $C^k$ norm of the velocity field that are polynomial in the $C^k$ norm of the corresponding transport map $T$; in the case of triangular (Knothe--Rosenblatt) maps, we also show that these bounds are polynomial in the $C^k$ norms of the associated source and target densities. Combining these results with stability arguments for distribution approximation via ODEs, we show that Wasserstein or Kullback--Leibler approximation of the target distribution to any desired accuracy $\epsilon &gt; 0$ can be achieved by a deep neural network representation of the velocity field whose size is bounded explicitly in terms of $\epsilon$, the dimension, and the smoothness of the source and target densities. The same neural network ansatz yields guarantees on the value of the regularized training objective.</description>

      <title>Applications of dimension interpolation to orthogonal projections</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.03926</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.03926v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Dimension interpolation is a novel programme of research which attempts to unify the study of fractal dimension by considering various spectra which live in between well-studied notions of dimension such as Hausdorff, box, Assouad and Fourier dimension. These spectra often reveal novel features not witnessed by the individual notions and this information has applications in many directions. In this survey article, we discuss dimension interpolation broadly and then focus on applications to the dimension theory of orthogonal projections. We focus on three distinct applications coming from three different dimension spectra, namely, the Fourier spectrum, the intermediate dimensions, and the Assouad spectrum. The celebrated Marstrand--Mattila projection theorem gives the Hausdorff dimension of the orthogonal projection of a Borel set in Euclidean space for almost all orthogonal projections. This result has inspired much further research on the dimension theory of projections including the consideration of dimensions other than the Hausdorff dimension, and the study of the exceptional set in the Marstrand--Mattila theorem.</description>

      <title>Dimensions of orthogonal projections of typical self-affine sets and measures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.04000</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.04000v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Let $T_1,\ldots, T_m$ be a family of $d\times d$ invertible real matrices with $\|T_i\|&lt;1/2$ for $1\leq i\leq m$. For ${\bf a}=(a_1,\ldots, a_m)\in {\Bbb R}^{md}$, let $\pi^{\bf a}\colon \Sigma=\{1,\ldots, m\}^{\Bbb N}\to {\Bbb R}^d$ denote the coding map associated with the affine IFS $\{T_ix+a_i\}_{i=1}^m$, and let $K^{\bf a}$ denote the attractor of this IFS. Let $W$ be a linear subspace of ${\Bbb R}^d$ and $P_W$ the orthogonal projection onto $W$. We show that for $\mathcal L^{md}$-a.e.~${\bf a}\in {\Bbb R}^{md}$, the Hausdorff and box-counting dimensions of $P_W(K^{\bf a})$ coincide and are determined by the zero point of a certain pressure function associated with $T_1,\ldots, T_m$ and $W$. Moreover, for every ergodic $\sigma$-invariant measure $\mu$ on $\Sigma$ and for $\mathcal L^{md}$-a.e.~${\bf a}\in {\Bbb R}^{md}$, the local dimensions of $(P_W\pi^{\bf a})_*\mu$ exist almost everywhere, here $(P_W\pi^{\bf a})_*\mu$ stands for the push-forward of $\mu$ by $P_W\pi^{\bf a}$. However, $(P_W\pi^{\bf a})_*\mu$ may not be exact dimensional for $\mathcal L^{md}$-a.e.~${\bf a}\in {\Bbb R}^{md}$. Nevertheless, when $\mu$ is a Bernoulli product measure, or more generally, a supermultiplicative ergodic $\sigma$-invariant measure, $(P_W\pi^{\bf a})_*\mu$ is exact dimensional for $\mathcal L^{md}$-a.e.~${\bf a}\in {\Bbb R}^{md}$.</description>

      <title>Projections of self-affine fractals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.04001</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.04001v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We extend Falconer's 1988 landmark result on the dimensions of self-affine fractals to encompass the dimensions of their projections, showing furthermore that their families of exceptional projections contain algebraic varieties which are preserved by the underlying linear algebraic group. The techniques which we develop allow us to construct examples of additional new phenomena: firstly, we give general examples of equilibrium measures on self-affine fractals which admit non-exact-dimensional projections. Secondly, we construct strongly irreducible self-affine sets which have small sumsets without any arithmetic resonance in their construction.</description>

      <title>Connection formulae for the radial Toda equations I</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.16550</link>
      <description>arXiv:2309.16550v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper is the first in a forthcoming series of works where the authors study the global asymptotic behavior of the radial solutions of the 2D periodic Toda equation of type $A_n$. The principal issue is the connection formulae between the asymptotic parameters describing the behavior of the general solution at zero and infinity. To reach this goal we are using a fusion of the PDE analysis and the Riemann-Hilbert nonlinear steepest descent method of Deift and Zhou which is applicable to 2D Toda in view of its Lax integrability. A principal technical challenge is the extension of the nonlinear steepest descent analysis to Riemann-Hilbert problems of matrix rank greater than $2$. In this paper, we meet this challenge for the case $n=2$ (the rank $3$ case) and it already captures the principal features of the general $n$ case.</description>

      <title>A Multi-Parameter Singular Perturbation Analysis of the Robertson Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.04008</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.04008v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The Robertson model describing a chemical reaction involving three reactants is one of the classical examples of stiffness in ODEs. The stiffness is caused by the occurrence of three reaction rates $k_1,\,k_2$, and $k_3$, with largely differing orders of magnitude, acting as parameters. The model has been widely used as a numerical test problem. Surprisingly, no asymptotic analysis of this multiscale problem seems to exist. In this paper we provide a full asymptotic analysis of the Robertson model under the assumption $k_1, k_3 \ll k_2$. We rewrite the equations as a two-parameter singular perturbation problem in the rescaled small parameters $(\varepsilon_1,\varepsilon_2):=(k_1/k_2,k_3/k_2)$, which we then analyze using geometric singular perturbation theory (GSPT). To deal with the multi-parameter singular structure, we perform blow-ups in parameter- and variable space. We identify four distinct regimes in a neighbourhood of the singular limit $(\varepsilon_1,\varepsilon_2)= (0,0)$. Within these four regimes we use GSPT and additional blow-ups to analyze the dynamics and the structure of solutions. Our asymptotic results are in excellent qualitative and quantitative agreement with the numerics.</description>
