      <title>Course Recommender Systems Need to Consider the Job Market</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.10876</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.10876v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Current course recommender systems primarily leverage learner-course interactions, course content, learner preferences, and supplementary course details like instructor, institution, ratings, and reviews, to make their recommendation. However, these systems often overlook a critical aspect: the evolving skill demand of the job market. This paper focuses on the perspective of academic researchers, working in collaboration with the industry, aiming to develop a course recommender system that incorporates job market skill demands. In light of the job market's rapid changes and the current state of research in course recommender systems, we outline essential properties for course recommender systems to address these demands effectively, including explainable, sequential, unsupervised, and aligned with the job market and user's goals. Our discussion extends to the challenges and research questions this objective entails, including unsupervised skill extraction from job listings, course descriptions, and resumes, as well as predicting recommendations that align with learner objectives and the job market and designing metrics to evaluate this alignment. Furthermore, we introduce an initial system that addresses some existing limitations of course recommender systems using large Language Models (LLMs) for skill extraction and Reinforcement Learning (RL) for alignment with the job market. We provide empirical results using open-source data to demonstrate its effectiveness.</description>

      <title>Threat Behavior Textual Search by Attention Graph Isomorphism</title>

Abstract: Cyber attacks cause over \$1 trillion loss every year. An important task for cyber security analysts is attack forensics. It entails understanding malware behaviors and attack origins. However, existing automated or manual malware analysis can only disclose a subset of behaviors due to inherent difficulties (e.g., malware cloaking and obfuscation). As such, analysts often resort to text search techniques to identify existing malware reports based on the symptoms they observe, exploiting the fact that malware samples share a lot of similarity, especially those from the same origin. In this paper, we propose a novel malware behavior search technique that is based on graph isomorphism at the attention layers of Transformer models. We also compose a large dataset collected from various agencies to facilitate such research. Our technique outperforms state-of-the-art methods, such as those based on sentence embeddings and keywords by 6-14%. In the case study of 10 real-world malwares, our technique can correctly attribute 8 of them to their ground truth origins while using Google only works for 3 cases.</description>

      <title>A Survey on Retrieval-Augmented Text Generation for Large Language Models</title>

Abstract: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) merges retrieval methods with deep learning advancements to address the static limitations of large language models (LLMs) by enabling the dynamic integration of up-to-date external information. This methodology, focusing primarily on the text domain, provides a cost-effective solution to the generation of plausible but incorrect responses by LLMs, thereby enhancing the accuracy and reliability of their outputs through the use of real-world data. As RAG grows in complexity and incorporates multiple concepts that can influence its performance, this paper organizes the RAG paradigm into four categories: pre-retrieval, retrieval, post-retrieval, and generation, offering a detailed perspective from the retrieval viewpoint. It outlines RAG's evolution and discusses the field's progression through the analysis of significant studies. Additionally, the paper introduces evaluation methods for RAG, addressing the challenges faced and proposing future research directions. By offering an organized framework and categorization, the study aims to consolidate existing research on RAG, clarify its technological underpinnings, and highlight its potential to broaden the adaptability and applications of LLMs.</description>

      <title>DRepMRec: A Dual Representation Learning Framework for Multimodal Recommendation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.11119</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.11119v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Multimodal Recommendation focuses mainly on how to effectively integrate behavior and multimodal information in the recommendation task. Previous works suffer from two major issues. Firstly, the training process tightly couples the behavior module and multimodal module by jointly optimizing them using the sharing model parameters, which leads to suboptimal performance since behavior signals and modality signals often provide opposite guidance for the parameters updates. Secondly, previous approaches fail to take into account the significant distribution differences between behavior and modality when they attempt to fuse behavior and modality information. This resulted in a misalignment between the representations of behavior and modality. To address these challenges, in this paper, we propose a novel Dual Representation learning framework for Multimodal Recommendation called DRepMRec, which introduce separate dual lines for coupling problem and Behavior-Modal Alignment (BMA) for misalignment problem. Specifically, DRepMRec leverages two independent lines of representation learning to calculate behavior and modal representations. After obtaining separate behavior and modal representations, we design a Behavior-Modal Alignment Module (BMA) to align and fuse the dual representations to solve the misalignment problem. Furthermore, we integrate the BMA into other recommendation models, resulting in consistent performance improvements. To ensure dual representations maintain their semantic independence during alignment, we introduce Similarity-Supervised Signal (SSS) for representation learning. We conduct extensive experiments on three public datasets and our method achieves state-of-the-art (SOTA) results. The source code will be available upon acceptance.</description>

      <title>Causal Deconfounding via Confounder Disentanglement for Dual-Target Cross-Domain Recommendation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.11180</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.11180v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In recent years, dual-target Cross-Domain Recommendation (CDR) has been proposed to capture comprehensive user preferences in order to ultimately enhance the recommendation accuracy in both data-richer and data-sparser domains simultaneously. However, in addition to users' true preferences, the user-item interactions might also be affected by confounders (e.g., free shipping, sales promotion). As a result, dual-target CDR has to meet two challenges: (1) how to effectively decouple observed confounders, including single-domain confounders and cross-domain confounders, and (2) how to preserve the positive effects of observed confounders on predicted interactions, while eliminating their negative effects on capturing comprehensive user preferences. To address the above two challenges, we propose a Causal Deconfounding framework via Confounder Disentanglement for dual-target Cross-Domain Recommendation, called CD2CDR. In CD2CDR, we first propose a confounder disentanglement module to effectively decouple observed single-domain and cross-domain confounders. We then propose a causal deconfounding module to preserve the positive effects of such observed confounders and eliminate their negative effects via backdoor adjustment, thereby enhancing the recommendation accuracy in each domain. Extensive experiments conducted on five real-world datasets demonstrate that CD2CDR significantly outperforms the state-of-the-art methods.</description>

      <title>Large Language Models meet Collaborative Filtering: An Efficient All-round LLM-based Recommender System</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.11343</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.11343v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Collaborative filtering recommender systems (CF-RecSys) have shown successive results in enhancing the user experience on social media and e-commerce platforms. However, as CF-RecSys struggles under cold scenarios with sparse user-item interactions, recent strategies have focused on leveraging modality information of user/items (e.g., text or images) based on pre-trained modality encoders and Large Language Models (LLMs). Despite their effectiveness under cold scenarios, we observe that they underperform simple traditional collaborative filtering models under warm scenarios due to the lack of collaborative knowledge. In this work, we propose an efficient All-round LLM-based Recommender system, called A-LLMRec, that excels not only in the cold scenario but also in the warm scenario. Our main idea is to enable an LLM to directly leverage the collaborative knowledge contained in a pre-trained state-of-the-art CF-RecSys so that the emergent ability of the LLM as well as the high-quality user/item embeddings that are already trained by the state-of-the-art CF-RecSys can be jointly exploited. This approach yields two advantages: (1) model-agnostic, allowing for integration with various existing CF-RecSys, and (2) efficiency, eliminating the extensive fine-tuning typically required for LLM-based recommenders. Our extensive experiments on various real-world datasets demonstrate the superiority of A-LLMRec in various scenarios, including cold/warm, few-shot, cold user, and cross-domain scenarios. Beyond the recommendation task, we also show the potential of A-LLMRec in generating natural language outputs based on the understanding of the collaborative knowledge by performing a favorite genre prediction task.

      <title>Deep Pattern Network for Click-Through Rate Prediction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.11456</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.11456v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Click-through rate (CTR) prediction tasks play a pivotal role in real-world applications, particularly in recommendation systems and online advertising. A significant research branch in this domain focuses on user behavior modeling. Current research predominantly centers on modeling co-occurrence relationships between the target item and items previously interacted with by users in their historical data. However, this focus neglects the intricate modeling of user behavior patterns. In reality, the abundance of user interaction records encompasses diverse behavior patterns, indicative of a spectrum of habitual paradigms. These patterns harbor substantial potential to significantly enhance CTR prediction performance. To harness the informational potential within user behavior patterns, we extend Target Attention (TA) to Target Pattern Attention (TPA) to model pattern-level dependencies. Furthermore, three critical challenges demand attention: the inclusion of unrelated items within behavior patterns, data sparsity in behavior patterns, and computational complexity arising from numerous patterns. To address these challenges, we introduce the Deep Pattern Network (DPN), designed to comprehensively leverage information from user behavior patterns. DPN efficiently retrieves target-related user behavior patterns using a target-aware attention mechanism. Additionally, it contributes to refining user behavior patterns through a pre-training paradigm based on self-supervised learning while promoting dependency learning within sparse patterns. Our comprehensive experiments, conducted across three public datasets, substantiate the superior performance and broad compatibility of DPN.</description>

      <title>Unifying Bias and Unfairness in Information Retrieval: A Survey of Challenges and Opportunities with Large Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.11457</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.11457v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: With the rapid advancement of large language models (LLMs), information retrieval (IR) systems, such as search engines and recommender systems, have undergone a significant paradigm shift. This evolution, while heralding new opportunities, introduces emerging challenges, particularly in terms of biases and unfairness, which may threaten the information ecosystem. In this paper, we present a comprehensive survey of existing works on emerging and pressing bias and unfairness issues in IR systems when the integration of LLMs. We first unify bias and unfairness issues as distribution mismatch problems, providing a groundwork for categorizing various mitigation strategies through distribution alignment. Subsequently, we systematically delve into the specific bias and unfairness issues arising from three critical stages of LLMs integration into IR systems: data collection, model development, and result evaluation. In doing so, we meticulously review and analyze recent literature, focusing on the definitions, characteristics, and corresponding mitigation strategies associated with these issues. Finally, we identify and highlight some open problems and challenges for future work, aiming to inspire researchers and stakeholders in the IR field and beyond to better understand and mitigate bias and unfairness issues of IR in this LLM era. We also consistently maintain a GitHub repository for the relevant papers and resources in this rising direction at https://github.com/KID-22/LLM-IR-Bias-Fairness-Survey.</description>

      <title>Disentangled Cascaded Graph Convolution Networks for Multi-Behavior Recommendation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.11519</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.11519v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Multi-behavioral recommender systems have emerged as a solution to address data sparsity and cold-start issues by incorporating auxiliary behaviors alongside target behaviors. However, existing models struggle to accurately capture varying user preferences across different behaviors and fail to account for diverse item preferences within behaviors. Various user preference factors (such as price or quality) entangled in the behavior may lead to sub-optimization problems. Furthermore, these models overlook the personalized nature of user behavioral preferences by employing uniform transformation networks for all users and items. To tackle these challenges, we propose the Disentangled Cascaded Graph Convolutional Network (Disen-CGCN), a novel multi-behavior recommendation model. Disen-CGCN employs disentangled representation techniques to effectively separate factors within user and item representations, ensuring their independence. In addition, it incorporates a multi-behavioral meta-network, enabling personalized feature transformation across user and item behaviors. Furthermore, an attention mechanism captures user preferences for different item factors within each behavior. By leveraging attention weights, we aggregate user and item embeddings separately for each behavior, computing preference scores that predict overall user preferences for items. Our evaluation on benchmark datasets demonstrates the superiority of Disen-CGCN over state-of-the-art models, showcasing an average performance improvement of 7.07% and 9.00% on respective datasets. These results highlight Disen-CGCN's ability to effectively leverage multi-behavioral data, leading to more accurate recommendations.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.10795v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: On social media platforms, the act of predicting reposting is seen as a challenging issue related to Short Message Services (SMS). This study examines the issue of predicting picture reposting in SMS and forecasts users' behavior in sharing photographs on Twitter. Several research vary. The paper introduces a network called Image Retweet Modeling (IRM) that models heterogeneous image retransmission. It considers the user's previous reposting of the image tweet, the next contact in the SMS, and the preferences of the reposted person. Three aspects connected to content. A text-guided multimodal neural network is developed to create a novel multi-faceted attention ranking network methodology. This allows for learning the joint image Twitter representation and user preference representation in the prediction job. Multiple experiments conducted on extensive data sets demonstrate that our approach outperforms current methods on Social Network platforms.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.10890v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) hold potential for innovative HCI research, including the creation of synthetic personae. However, their black-box nature and propensity for hallucinations pose challenges. To address these limitations, this position paper advocates for using LLMs as data augmentation systems rather than zero-shot generators. We further propose the development of robust cognitive and memory frameworks to guide LLM responses. Initial explorations suggest that data enrichment, episodic memory, and self-reflection techniques can improve the reliability of synthetic personae and open up new avenues for HCI research.</description>

      <title>Causal Intervention for Fairness in Multi-behavior Recommendation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2209.04589</link>
      <description>arXiv:2209.04589v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Recommender systems usually learn user interests from various user behaviors, including clicks and post-click behaviors (e.g., like and favorite). However, these behaviors inevitably exhibit popularity bias, leading to some unfairness issues: 1) for items with similar quality, more popular ones get more exposure; and 2) even worse the popular items with lower popularity might receive more exposure. Existing work on mitigating popularity bias blindly eliminates the bias and usually ignores the effect of item quality. We argue that the relationships between different user behaviors (e.g., conversion rate) actually reflect the item quality. Therefore, to handle the unfairness issues, we propose to mitigate the popularity bias by considering multiple user behaviors.
  In this work, we examine causal relationships behind the interaction generation procedure in multi-behavior recommendation. Specifically, we find that: 1) item popularity is a confounder between the exposed items and users' post-click interactions, leading to the first unfairness; and 2) some hidden confounders (e.g., the reputation of item producers) affect both item popularity and quality, resulting in the second unfairness. To alleviate these confounding issues, we propose a causal framework to estimate the causal effect, which leverages backdoor adjustment to block the backdoor paths caused by the confounders. In the inference stage, we remove the negative effect of popularity and utilize the good effect of quality for recommendation. Experiments on two real-world datasets validate the effectiveness of our proposed framework, which enhances fairness without sacrificing recommendation accuracy.</description>

      <title>Recommender Systems in the Era of Large Language Models (LLMs)</title>

      <description>arXiv:2307.02046v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: With the prosperity of e-commerce and web applications, Recommender Systems (RecSys) have become an important component of our daily life, providing personalized suggestions that cater to user preferences. While Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) have made significant advancements in enhancing recommender systems by modeling user-item interactions and incorporating textual side information, DNN-based methods still face limitations, such as difficulties in understanding users' interests and capturing textual side information, inabilities in generalizing to various recommendation scenarios and reasoning on their predictions, etc. Meanwhile, the emergence of Large Language Models (LLMs), such as ChatGPT and GPT4, has revolutionized the fields of Natural Language Processing (NLP) and Artificial Intelligence (AI), due to their remarkable abilities in fundamental responsibilities of language understanding and generation, as well as impressive generalization and reasoning capabilities. As a result, recent studies have attempted to harness the power of LLMs to enhance recommender systems. Given the rapid evolution of this research direction in recommender systems, there is a pressing need for a systematic overview that summarizes existing LLM-empowered recommender systems, to provide researchers in relevant fields with an in-depth understanding. Therefore, in this paper, we conduct a comprehensive review of LLM-empowered recommender systems from various aspects including Pre-training, Fine-tuning, and Prompting. More specifically, we first introduce representative methods to harness the power of LLMs (as a feature encoder) for learning representations of users and items. Then, we review recent techniques of LLMs for enhancing recommender systems from three paradigms, namely pre-training, fine-tuning, and prompting. Finally, we comprehensively discuss future directions in this emerging field.</description>

      <title>Gradient Flow of Energy: A General and Efficient Approach for Entity Alignment Decoding</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.12798</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.12798v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Entity alignment (EA), a pivotal process in integrating multi-source Knowledge Graphs (KGs), seeks to identify equivalent entity pairs across these graphs. Most existing approaches regard EA as a graph representation learning task, concentrating on enhancing graph encoders. However, the decoding process in EA - essential for effective operation and alignment accuracy - has received limited attention and remains tailored to specific datasets and model architectures, necessitating both entity and additional explicit relation embeddings. This specificity limits its applicability, particularly in GNN-based models. To address this gap, we introduce a novel, generalized, and efficient decoding approach for EA, relying solely on entity embeddings. Our method optimizes the decoding process by minimizing Dirichlet energy, leading to the gradient flow within the graph, to maximize graph homophily. The discretization of the gradient flow produces a fast and scalable approach, termed Triple Feature Propagation (TFP). TFP innovatively generalizes adjacency matrices to multi-views matrices:entity-to-entity, entity-to-relation, relation-to-entity, and relation-to-triple. The gradient flow through generalized matrices enables TFP to harness the multi-view structural information of KGs. Rigorous experimentation on diverse public datasets demonstrates that our approach significantly enhances various EA methods. Notably, the approach achieves these advancements with less than 6 seconds of additional computational time, establishing a new benchmark in efficiency and adaptability for future EA methods.</description>

Abstract: The rapid advancement of high-quality image generation models based on AI has generated a deluge of anime illustrations. Recommending illustrations to users within massive data has become a challenging and popular task. However, existing anime recommendation systems have focused on text features but still need to integrate image features. In addition, most multi-modal recommendation research is constrained by tightly coupled datasets, limiting its applicability to anime illustrations. We propose the User-aware Multi-modal Animation Illustration Recommendation Fusion with Painting Style (UMAIR-FPS) to tackle these gaps. In the feature extract phase, for image features, we are the first to combine image painting style features with semantic features to construct a dual-output image encoder for enhancing representation. For text features, we obtain text embeddings based on fine-tuning Sentence-Transformers by incorporating domain knowledge that composes a variety of domain text pairs from multilingual mappings, entity relationships, and term explanation perspectives, respectively. In the multi-modal fusion phase, we novelly propose a user-aware multi-modal contribution measurement mechanism to weight multi-modal features dynamically according to user features at the interaction level and employ the DCN-V2 module to model bounded-degree multi-modal crosses effectively. UMAIR-FPS surpasses the stat-of-the-art baselines on large real-world datasets, demonstrating substantial performance enhancements.</description>

      <title>GenSERP: Large Language Models for Whole Page Presentation</title>

Abstract: The advent of large language models (LLMs) brings an opportunity to minimize the effort in search engine result page (SERP) organization. In this paper, we propose GenSERP, a framework that leverages LLMs with vision in a few-shot setting to dynamically organize intermediate search results, including generated chat answers, website snippets, multimedia data, knowledge panels into a coherent SERP layout based on a user's query. Our approach has three main stages: (1) An information gathering phase where the LLM continuously orchestrates API tools to retrieve different types of items, and proposes candidate layouts based on the retrieved items, until it's confident enough to generate the final result. (2) An answer generation phase where the LLM populates the layouts with the retrieved content. In this phase, the LLM adaptively optimize the ranking of items and UX configurations of the SERP. Consequently, it assigns a location on the page to each item, along with the UX display details. (3) A scoring phase where an LLM with vision scores all the generated SERPs based on how likely it can satisfy the user. It then send the one with highest score to rendering. GenSERP features two generation paradigms. First, coarse-to-fine, which allow it to approach optimal layout in a more manageable way, (2) beam search, which give it a better chance to hit the optimal solution compared to greedy decoding. Offline experimental results on real-world data demonstrate how LLMs can contextually organize heterogeneous search results on-the-fly and provide a promising user experience.</description>

      <title>Leave No One Behind: Online Self-Supervised Self-Distillation for Sequential Recommendation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.07219</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.07219v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Sequential recommendation methods play a pivotal role in modern recommendation systems. A key challenge lies in accurately modeling user preferences in the face of data sparsity. To tackle this challenge, recent methods leverage contrastive learning (CL) to derive self-supervision signals by maximizing the mutual information of two augmented views of the original user behavior sequence. Despite their effectiveness, CL-based methods encounter a limitation in fully exploiting self-supervision signals for users with limited behavior data, as users with extensive behaviors naturally offer more information. To address this problem, we introduce a novel learning paradigm, named Online Self-Supervised Self-distillation for Sequential Recommendation ($S^4$Rec), effectively bridging the gap between self-supervised learning and self-distillation methods. Specifically, we employ online clustering to proficiently group users by their distinct latent intents. Additionally, an adversarial learning strategy is utilized to ensure that the clustering procedure is not affected by the behavior length factor. Subsequently, we employ self-distillation to facilitate the transfer of knowledge from users with extensive behaviors (teachers) to users with limited behaviors (students). Experiments conducted on four real-world datasets validate the effectiveness of the proposed method.</description>

      <title>The Elephant in the Room: Rethinking the Usage of Pre-trained Language Model in Sequential Recommendation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.08796</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.08796v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Sequential recommendation (SR) has seen significant advancements with the help of Pre-trained Language Models (PLMs). Some PLM-based SR models directly use PLM to encode user historical behavior's text sequences to learn user representations, while there is seldom an in-depth exploration of the capability and suitability of PLM in behavior sequence modeling. In this work, we first conduct extensive model analyses between PLMs and PLM-based SR models, discovering great underutilization and parameter redundancy of PLMs in behavior sequence modeling. Inspired by this, we explore different lightweight usages of PLMs in SR, aiming to maximally stimulate the ability of PLMs for SR while satisfying the efficiency and usability demands of practical systems. We discover that adopting behavior-tuned PLMs for item initializations of conventional ID-based SR models is the most economical framework of PLM-based SR, which would not bring in any additional inference cost but could achieve a dramatic performance boost compared with the original version. Extensive experiments on five datasets show that our simple and universal framework leads to significant improvement compared to classical SR and SOTA PLM-based SR models without additional inference costs.</description>

      <title>A Text Classification Framework for Simple and Effective Early Depression Detection Over Social Media Streams</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/1905.08772</link>
      <description>arXiv:1905.08772v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: With the rise of the Internet, there is a growing need to build intelligent systems that are capable of efficiently dealing with early risk detection (ERD) problems on social media, such as early depression detection, early rumor detection or identification of sexual predators. These systems, nowadays mostly based on machine learning techniques, must be able to deal with data streams since users provide their data over time. In addition, these systems must be able to decide when the processed data is sufficient to actually classify users. Moreover, since ERD tasks involve risky decisions by which people's lives could be affected, such systems must also be able to justify their decisions. However, most standard and state-of-the-art supervised machine learning models are not well suited to deal with this scenario. This is due to the fact that they either act as black boxes or do not support incremental classification/learning. In this paper we introduce SS3, a novel supervised learning model for text classification that naturally supports these aspects. SS3 was designed to be used as a general framework to deal with ERD problems. We evaluated our model on the CLEF's eRisk2017 pilot task on early depression detection. Most of the 30 contributions submitted to this competition used state-of-the-art methods. Experimental results show that our classifier was able to outperform these models and standard classifiers, despite being less computationally expensive and having the ability to explain its rationale.</description>

      <title>Retrieval-Augmented Generation: Is Dense Passage Retrieval Retrieving?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.11035</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.11035v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Dense passage retrieval (DPR) is the first step in the retrieval augmented generation (RAG) paradigm for improving the performance of large language models (LLM). DPR fine-tunes pre-trained networks to enhance the alignment of the embeddings between queries and relevant textual data. A deeper understanding of DPR fine-tuning will be required to fundamentally unlock the full potential of this approach. In this work, we explore DPR-trained models mechanistically by using a combination of probing, layer activation analysis, and model editing. Our experiments show that DPR training decentralizes how knowledge is stored in the network, creating multiple access pathways to the same information. We also uncover a limitation in this training style: the internal knowledge of the pre-trained model bounds what the retrieval model can retrieve. These findings suggest a few possible directions for dense retrieval: (1) expose the DPR training process to more knowledge so more can be decentralized, (2) inject facts as decentralized representations, (3) model and incorporate knowledge uncertainty in the retrieval process, and (4) directly map internal model knowledge to a knowledge base.</description>

      <title>JMLR: Joint Medical LLM and Retrieval Training for Enhancing Reasoning and Professional Question Answering Capability</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.17887</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.17887v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated a remarkable potential in medical knowledge acquisition and question-answering. However, LLMs can potentially hallucinate and yield factually incorrect outcomes, even with domain-specific pretraining. Previously, retrieval augmented generation (RAG) has limited success in addressing hallucinations. Unlike previous methods in RAG where the retrieval model was trained separately from the LLM, we introduce JMLR (for Jointly trains LLM and information Retrieval (IR)) during the fine-tuning phase. The synchronized training mechanism enhances JMLR's ability to retrieve clinical guidelines and leverage medical knowledge to reason and answer questions and reduces the demand for computational resources. We evaluated JMLR on the important medical question answering application. Our experimental results demonstrate that JMLR-13B (70.5%) outperforms a previous state-of-the-art open-source model using conventional pre-training and fine-tuning Meditron-70B (68.9%) and Llama2-13B with RAG (54.9%) on a medical question-answering dataset. JMLR-13B (148 GPU hours) also trains much faster than Meditron-70B (42630 GPU hours). Through this work, we provide a new and efficient knowledge enhancement tool for healthcare, demonstrating the potential of integrating IR and LLM training for medical question-answering systems.</description>

      <title>Leveraging Foundation Models for Content-Based Medical Image Retrieval in Radiology</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.06567</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.06567v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Content-based image retrieval (CBIR) has the potential to significantly improve diagnostic aid and medical research in radiology. Current CBIR systems face limitations due to their specialization to certain pathologies, limiting their utility. In response, we propose using vision foundation models as powerful and versatile off-the-shelf feature extractors for content-based medical image retrieval. By benchmarking these models on a comprehensive dataset of 1.6 million 2D radiological images spanning four modalities and 161 pathologies, we identify weakly-supervised models as superior, achieving a P@1 of up to 0.594. This performance not only competes with a specialized model but does so without the need for fine-tuning. Our analysis further explores the challenges in retrieving pathological versus anatomical structures, indicating that accurate retrieval of pathological features presents greater difficulty. Despite these challenges, our research underscores the vast potential of foundation models for CBIR in radiology, proposing a shift towards versatile, general-purpose medical image retrieval systems that do not require specific tuning.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.17089v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The advent of ChatGPT and similar large language models (LLMs) has revolutionized the human-AI interaction and information-seeking process. Leveraging LLMs as an alternative to search engines, users can now access summarized information tailored to their queries, significantly reducing the cognitive load associated with navigating vast information resources. This shift underscores the potential of LLMs in redefining information access paradigms. Drawing on the foundation of task-focused information retrieval and LLMs' task planning ability, this research extends the scope of LLM capabilities beyond routine task automation to support users in navigating long-term and significant life tasks. It introduces the GOLF framework (Goal-Oriented Long-term liFe tasks), which focuses on enhancing LLMs' ability to assist in significant life decisions through goal orientation and long-term planning. The methodology encompasses a comprehensive simulation study to test the framework's efficacy, followed by model and human evaluations to develop a dataset benchmark for long-term life tasks, and experiments across different models and settings. By shifting the focus from short-term tasks to the broader spectrum of long-term life goals, this research underscores the transformative potential of LLMs in enhancing human decision-making processes and task management, marking a significant step forward in the evolution of human-AI collaboration.</description>

      <title>Use of a Structured Knowledge Base Enhances Metadata Curation by Large Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.05893</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.05893v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Metadata play a crucial role in ensuring the findability, accessibility, interoperability, and reusability of datasets. This paper investigates the potential of large language models (LLMs), specifically GPT-4, to improve adherence to metadata standards. We conducted experiments on 200 random data records describing human samples relating to lung cancer from the NCBI BioSample repository, evaluating GPT-4's ability to suggest edits for adherence to metadata standards. We computed the adherence accuracy of field name-field value pairs through a peer review process, and we observed a marginal average improvement in adherence to the standard data dictionary from 79% to 80% (p&lt;0.01). We then prompted GPT-4 with domain information in the form of the textual descriptions of CEDAR templates and recorded a significant improvement to 97% from 79% (p&lt;0.01). These results indicate that, while LLMs may not be able to correct legacy metadata to ensure satisfactory adherence to standards when unaided, they do show promise for use in automated metadata curation when integrated with a structured knowledge base.</description>
