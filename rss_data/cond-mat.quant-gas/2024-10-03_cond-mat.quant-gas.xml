      <title>Normal liquid $^3$He studied by Path Integral Monte Carlo with a parametrized partition function</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.01569</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.01569v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We compute the energy per particle of normal liquid ${}^3$He in the temperature range $0.15-2$ K using Path Integral Monte Carlo simulations, leveraging a recently proposed method to overcome the sign problem -- a long-standing challenge in many-body fermionic simulations. This approach is based on introducing a parameter $\xi$ into the partition function, which allows a generalization from bosons ($\xi=1$) to fermions ($\xi=-1$). By simulating systems with $\xi \geq 0$, where the sign problem is absent, one can then extrapolate to the fermionic case at $\xi = -1$. Guided by an independent particle model that uncovers non-analytic behavior due to the superfluid transition, which is moderated by finite-size effects, we develop a tailored extrapolation strategy for liquid ${}^3$He that departs from the extrapolation schemes shown to be accurate in those cases were quantum degeneracy effects are weak, and enables accurate results in the presence of Bose--Einstein Condensation and superfluidity for $\xi &gt; 0$. Our approach extends the previously proposed framework and yields energy per particle values in excellent agreement with experimental data.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.01605v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: By means of a diffusion Monte Carlo technique, we study one-dimensional mixtures of fermionic Ytterbium atoms ($^{173}$Yb, $^{171}$Yb) in which the total number of $^{173}$Yb particles is different from the sum of all the atoms belonging to the $^{171}$Yb isotope. Even tough self-bound droplets are possible for different compositions, the most stable ones are clusters with a slight excess of attractively interacting $^{171}$Yb particles belonging to different spins with respect to the number of spin-polarized $^{173}$Yb atoms.</description>

      <title>Fate of chiral order and impurity self-pinning in flat bands with local symmetry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.01780</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.01780v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Interacting bosons on a single plaquette threaded by a $\pi$-flux can spontaneously break time-reversal symmetry, resulting in a chiral loop current. Connecting such bosonic $\pi$-flux plaquettes in a dispersive configuration was recently shown to lead to long-range chiral order. Here, instead, we design a chain of $\pi$-flux plaquettes that exhibits an all-flat-bands single-particle energy spectrum and an extensive set of local symmetries. As a consequence, Elitzur's theorem is shown to prevent the emergence of long-range chiral order. Moreover, projecting the dynamics to a Creutz ladder model with an effective intra-rung interaction allows one to derive simple spin Hamiltonians capturing the ground state degeneracy and the low-energy excitations, and to confirm the absence of chiral order. Finally, we observe an ``impurity self-pinning'' phenomenon, when an extra boson is added on top of a ground state at integer filling, resulting in a non-dispersive density peak. Exact diagonalization benchmarks are also provided, and experimental perspectives are discussed.</description>

      <title>Itinerant magnetism in Hubbard models with long-range interactions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.00955</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.00955v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A wide variety of experimental platforms, ranging from semiconductor quantum-dot arrays to moir\'e materials, have recently emerged as powerful quantum simulators for studying the Hubbard model and its variants. Motivated by these developments, here, we investigate a generalization of the Hubbard model which includes the effects of long-range Coulomb interactions. Working on finite-sized two-dimensional square and triangular lattices, we use exact diagonalization and density-matrix renormalization group calculations to probe the magnetic structure of the ground state in the strong-coupling regime, where $U$ (the onsite repulsion) $\gg$ $t$ (the nearest-neighbor hopping). For small electron dopings above the half-filled antiferromagnet, we numerically uncover a rich variety of magnetically ordered states, and in conjunction with theoretical arguments, infer the phase diagram of the system as a function of doping and interaction strengths. In particular, we find that the inclusion of long-range Coulomb interactions induces an instability of high-spin states$\unicode{x2014}$such as the saturated Nagaoka ferromagnet$\unicode{x2014}$towards phase separation and stripe ordering. We also present proposals for the observation of some of our key findings in experiments that would shed further light on this paradigmatic strongly correlated system.</description>

      <title>Multi-site gates for state preparation in quantum simulation of the Bose Hubbard Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.00973</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.00973v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We construct a sequence of multi-site gates which transform an easily constructed product state into an approximation to the superfluid ground state of the Bose-Hubbard model. The mapping is exact in the one dimensional hard core limit, and for non-interacting particles in both one and two dimensions. The gate sequence has other applications, such as being used as part of a many-body interferometer which probes the existence of doublons.</description>

      <title>Condensation phenomena of ions in an electrostatic logarithmic trap</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.01582</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.01582v2 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The effects of an electrostatic logarithmic trap (ELT) on an ionic gas confined in a cylindric chamber are studied in detail, with special reference to the effects of the ion-ion Coulombic interactions and the resulting low-temperature thermodynamics. The collapse of the ions in radially localized states, about the axial cathode, is shown to cause an abrupt (but not critical) transition from non degeneration to strong degeneration, at a special temperature $T_c$. This transition could actually involve both Bosons and Fermions and is not to be confused with a Bose-Einstein condensation (BEC), which is excluded in principle. However, while for Bosons the resulting effects on the pressure are observable in the ultra high vacuum (UHV) regime, the Fermions' density should fall well below UHV, for the pressure change to be observable. This is because the ion-ion \emph{exchange} interactions increase the kinetic energy along the axial cathode, which makes the Fermi level and the non degeneration threshold temperature increase accordingly.</description>

      <title>Probing early phase coarsening in a rapidly quenched Bose gas using off-resonant matter-wave interferometry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.03742</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.03742v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We experimentally investigate the evolution of spatial phase correlations in a rapidly quenched inhomogeneous Bose gas of rubidium using off-resonant matter-wave interferometry. We measure the phase coherence length $\ell$ of the sample and directly probe its increase during the early stage of condensate growth before vortices are formed. Once the vortices are formed stably in the quenched condensate, the measured value of $\ell$ is shown to be linearly proportional to the mean distance between the vortex. These results confirm the presence of phase coarsening prior to vortex formation, which is crucial for a quantitative understanding of the resultant defect density in samples undergoing critical phase transitions.</description>

      <title>Effect of trap imperfections on the density of a quasi-two-dimensional uniform dipolar quantum Bose gas</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.04719v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We theoretically investigate the impact of weak static perturbations of a flat potential on the density of a quasi-two-dimensional dipolar Bose gas. {We consider the perturbative effects of potential perturbations at first order and restrict to the mean-field stable regime. We first study cosinusoidal potential perturbations at a given spatial frequency; this allows us to understand the effects of optical lattices as well as of isolated momentum contributions in the Fourier decomposition of an arbitrary potential. We then study potential perturbations characterized by a static white-noise spectrum over a given momentum range; this captures the effects of inherent optical aberrations in setups that create uniform optical dipole traps.</description>

      <title>Engineering quantum droplet formation by cavity-induced long-range interactions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.18215</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.18215v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate a dilute Bose gas with both a short-range contact and an effective long-range interaction between the atoms. The latter is induced by the strong coupling to a cavity light mode and is spatially characterized by a periodic signature and a tunable envelope rooted in the pumping of the cavity. We formulate a Bogoliubov theory which is based on a homogeneous mean-field description and quantum fluctuations around it. We find that the repulsive mean-field contact interaction could be destabilized by quantum fluctuation corrections rooting in the long-range interaction. The competition between both allows for the formation of self-bound quantum droplets. This generic approach is applied to two cavity setups without and with a momentum-conserving effective long-range interaction between the atoms in the form of a driven dispersive cavity mode and a multimode cavity, respectively. For both cases we show analytically how the size and the central density of the cavity-induced quantum droplets depend on the contact interaction strength and on the shape of the spatial envelope of the long-range interaction.</description>

      <title>Signatures of metal to insulator crossover in the repulsive Fermi Hubbard model through static correlations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.13054</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.13054v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Cold atom systems provide a rich platform to realize strongly interacting condensed matter systems, and recent progress in fluorescence imaging technique has enabled identification of nontrivial doublon, singlon, and holon correlation functions. We show that these correlators can be used to identify the conditions under which local moments form in an interacting electronic system. Toward this end, we report a Determinantal Quantum Monte Carlo (DQMC) study of such correlation functions in the two-dimensional repulsive Fermi Hubbard model on a square lattice as a function of doping, interaction strength and temperature. We find definite signatures of the crossover from small U(band regime) to large U(correlated insulator regime). Our key findings are: (1) An opening of a charge gap in the thermodynamic density of states is accompanied by the appearance of temperature insensitive points in the equation of state at finite doping, which can be used to distinguish the band regime in cold atom experiments. (2) Nearest neighbor doublon holon correlations track the opening of charge gap; these compete with density correlations to generate moment moment correlations that show different behavior in the metallic and correlated insulator regime. (3) Non local correlation functions can be used to distinguish between the two regimes, both at and away from half filling. Our results allow comparisons of different correlation functions with recent experimental findings and guide further experimental investigations.</description>
