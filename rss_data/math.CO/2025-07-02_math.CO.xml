      <title>Compact Representation of Semilinear and Terrain-like Graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.00252</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.00252v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider the existence and construction of \textit{biclique covers} of graphs, consisting of coverings of their edge sets by complete bipartite graphs. The \textit{size} of such a cover is the sum of the sizes of the bicliques. Small-size biclique covers of graphs are ubiquitous in computational geometry, and have been shown to be useful compact representations of graphs. We give a brief survey of classical and recent results on biclique covers and their applications, and give new families of graphs having biclique covers of near-linear size.
  In particular, we show that semilinear graphs, whose edges are defined by linear relations in bounded dimensional space, always have biclique covers of size $O(n\polylog n)$. This generalizes many previously known results on special classes of graphs including interval graphs, permutation graphs, and graphs of bounded boxicity, but also new classes such as intersection graphs of L-shapes in the plane. It also directly implies the bounds for Zarankiewicz's problem derived by Basit, Chernikov, Starchenko, Tao, and Tran (\textit{Forum Math. Sigma}, 2021).
  We also consider capped graphs, also known as terrain-like graphs, defined as ordered graphs forbidding a certain ordered pattern on four vertices. Terrain-like graphs contain the induced subgraphs of terrain visibility graphs. We give an elementary proof that these graphs admit biclique partitions of size $O(n\log^3 n)$. This provides a simple combinatorial analogue of a classical result from Agarwal, Alon, Aronov, and Suri on polygon visibility graphs (\textit{Discrete Comput. Geom.} 1994).
  Finally, we prove that there exists families of unit disk graphs on $n$ vertices that do not admit biclique coverings of size $o(n^{4/3})$, showing that we are unlikely to improve on Szemer\'edi-Trotter type incidence bounds for higher-degree semialgebraic graphs.</description>

      <title>Faces in rectilinear drawings of complete graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.00313</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.00313v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We initiate the study of extremal problems about faces in convex rectilinear drawings of~$K_n$, that is, drawings where vertices are represented by points in the plane in convex position and edges by line segments between the points representing the end-vertices. We show that if a convex rectilinear drawing of $K_n$ does not contain a common interior point of at least three edges, then there is always a face forming a convex 5-gon while there are such drawings without any face forming a convex $k$-gon with $k \geq 6$.
  A convex rectilinear drawing of $K_n$ is \emph{regular} if its vertices correspond to vertices of a regular convex $n$-gon. We characterize positive integers $n$ for which regular drawings of $K_n$ contain a face forming a convex 5-gon.
  To our knowledge, this type of problems has not been considered in the literature before and so we also pose several new natural open problems.</description>

      <title>2-factors in $\frac{3}{2}$-tough maximal planar graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.00395</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.00395v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The toughness of a graph $G$ is defined as the minimum value of $|S|/c(G-S)$ over all cutsets $S$ of $G$ if $G$ is noncomplete, and is defined to be $\infty$ if $G$ is complete. For a real number $t$, we say that $G$ is $t$-tough if its toughness is at least $t$. Followed from the classic 1956 result of Tutte, every more than $\frac{3}{2}$-tough planar graph on at least three vertices has a 2-factor. In 1999, Owens constructed a sequence of maximal planar graphs with toughness $\frac{3}{2}-\varepsilon$ for any $\varepsilon &gt;0$, but the graphs do not contain any 2-factor. He then posed the question of whether there exists a maximal planar graph with toughness exactly $\frac{3}{2}$ and with no 2-factor. This question was recently answered affirmatively by the third author. This naturally leads to the question: under what conditions does a $\frac{3}{2}$-tough maximal planar graph contain a 2-factor? In this paper, we provide a sufficient condition for the existence of 2-factors in $\frac{3}{2}$-tough maximal planar graphs, stated as a bound on the distance between vertices of degree 3.</description>

      <title>The square of every subcubic planar graph without 4-cycles and 5-cycles is 7-choosable</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.00426</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.00426v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The square of a graph $G$, denoted by $G^2$, has the same vertex set as $G$ and has an edge between two vertices if the distance between them in $G$ is at most $2$. Thomassen (2018) and independently, Hartke, Jahanbekam and Thomas (2016) proved that $\chi(G^2) \leq 7$ if $G$ is a subcubic planar graph. A natural question is whether $\chi_{\ell}(G^2) \leq 7$ or not if $G$ is a subcubic planar graph. Recently, Kim and Lian (2024) proved that $\chi_{\ell}(G^2) \leq 7$ if $G$ is a subcubic planar graph of girth at least 6. In this paper, we prove that $\chi_{\ell}(G^2) \leq 7$ if $G$ is a subcubic planar graph without 4-cycles and 5-cycles, which improves the result of Kim and Lian.</description>

      <title>Sums and products in sets of positive density</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.00515</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.00515v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We develop an analytic approach that draws on tools from Fourier analysis and ergodic theory to study Ramsey-type problems involving sums and products in the integers. Suppose $Q$ denotes a polynomial with integer coefficients. We establish two main results. First, we show that if $Q(1) = 0$, then any set of natural numbers with positive upper logarithmic density contains a pair of the form $\{x + Q(y), xy\}$ for some $x, y \in \mathbb{N} \setminus \{1\}$. Second, we prove that if $Q(0) = 0$, then any set of natural numbers with positive density relative to a new multiplicative notion of density, which arises naturally in the context of such problems, contains $\{x + Q(y), xy\}$ for some $x, y \in \mathbb{N}$.</description>

      <title>Linear rank-metric intersecting codes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.00569</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.00569v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper we introduce and investigate rank-metric intersecting codes, a new class of linear codes in the rank-metric context, inspired by the well-studied notion of intersecting codes in the Hamming metric. A rank-metric code is said to be intersecting if any two nonzero codewords have supports intersecting non trivially. We explore this class from both a coding-theoretic and geometric perspective, highlighting its relationship with minimal codes, MRD codes, and Hamming-metric intersecting codes. We derive structural properties, sufficient conditions based on minimum distance, and geometric characterizations in terms of 2-spannable $q$-systems. We establish upper and lower bounds on code parameters and show some constructions, which leave a range of unexplored parameters. Finally, we connect rank-intersecting codes to other combinatorial structures such as $(2,1)$-separating systems and frameproof codes.</description>

      <title>Nondegenerate hyperplane covers of the hypercube</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.00773</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.00773v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider collections of hyperplanes in $\mathbb{R}^n$ covering all vertices of the $n$-dimensional hypercube $\{0,1\}^n$, which satisfy the following nondegeneracy condition: For every $v\in \{0,1\}^n$ and every $i=1,\dots,n$, we demand that there is a hyperplane $H$ in the collection with $v\in H$ such that the variable $x_i$ appears with a non-zero coefficient in the hyperplane equation describing $H$. We prove that every collection $\mathcal{H}$ of hyperplanes in $\mathbb{R}^n$ covering $\{0,1\}^n$ with this nondegeneracy condition must have size $|\mathcal{H}|\ge n/2$.
  This bound is tight up to constant factors. It generalizes a recent result concerning the intensively studied skew covers problem, which asks about the minimum possible size of a hyperplane cover of $\{0,1\}^n$ in which all variables appear with non-zero coefficients in all hyperplane equations.
  As an application of our result, we also obtain an essentially tight bound for an old problem about collections of hyperplanes slicing all edges of the $n$-dimensional hypercube, in the case where all of the hyperplanes have bounded integer coefficients.</description>

      <title>Improved bound of graph energy in terms of vertex cover number</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.00798</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.00798v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $ G $ be a simple graph with the vertex cover number $ \tau $. The energy $ \mathcal{E}(G) $ of $ G $ is the sum of the absolute values of all the adjacency eigenvalues of $ G $. In this article, we establish $ \mathcal{E}(G)\geq 2\tau $ for several classes of graphs. The result significantly improves the known result $ \mathcal{E}(G)\geq 2\tau-2c$ for many classes of graphs, where $ c $ is the number of odd cycles.</description>

      <title>Tur\'{a}n density of tight cycles minus one edge in the $\ell_2$-norm</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.00812</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.00812v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The $3$-uniform tight $\ell$-cycle minus one edge $C_{\ell}^{3-}$ is the $3$-graph on $\ell$ vertices consisting of $\ell-1$ consecutive triples in the cyclic order. We show that for every integer $\ell \ge 5$ satisfying $\ell\not\equiv 0\pmod3$, every $C_{\ell}^{3-}$-free $3$-graph whose $\ell_2$-norm, that is, the sum of codegree squares, is close to the maximum must be structurally close to the iterative blowup of a single triple. This confirms a conjecture of Balogh--Clemen--Lidick\'{y}~[Surveys in combinatorics 2022, 21-63] in a stronger form.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2507.00813v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate generalisations of 1-factorisations and hyperfactorisations of the complete graph $K_{2n}$. We show that they are special subsets of the association scheme obtained from the Gelfand pair $(S_{2n},S_2 \wr S_n)$. This unifies and extends results by Cameron (1976) and gives rise to new existence and non-existence results. Our methods involve working in the group algebra $\mathbb{C}[S_{2n}]$ and using the representation theory of $S_{2n}$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2507.00941v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider the model of limited visibility Cops and Robbers, where the cops can only see within their $l$-neighbourhood. We prove that the number of cops needed to see the robber can be arbitrarily smaller than the number needed to capture the robber, answering an open question from the literature. We then consider how close we can get to seeing the robber when we do not have enough cops, along with a probabilistic interpretation.</description>

      <title>Rotationally Symmetric Tilings with Convex Pentagons and Hexagons</title>

      <description>arXiv:1509.06297v3 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In contrast to many known results concerning periodic tilings of the Euclidean plane with pentagons, here tilings with rotational symmetry are investigated. A certain class of convex pentagons is introduced. It can be shown that for any given symmetry type $\mathbf{C}_{n}$ or $\mathbf{D}_{n}$ there exists a monohedral tiling generated by a pentagon from this class. For $n&gt;1$ each of these tilings is also a spiral tiling with $n$ arms. As a byproduct it follows that the same holds for convex hexagons.</description>

      <title>Reducing Profile-Based Matching to the Maximum Weight Matching Problem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.00047</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.00047v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The profile-based matching problem is the problem of finding a matching that optimizes profile from an instance $(G, r, \langle u_1, \dots, u_r \rangle)$, where $G$ is a bipartite graph $(A \cup B, E)$, $r$ is the number of utility functions, and $u_i: E \to \{ 0, 1, \dots, U_i \}$ is utility functions for $1 \le i \le r$. A matching is optimal if the matching maximizes the sum of the 1st utility, subject to this, maximizes the sum of the 2nd utility, and so on. The profile-based matching can express rank-maximal matching \cite{irving2006rank}, fair matching \cite{huang2016fair}, and weight-maximal matching \cite{huang2012weight}. These problems can be reduced to maximum weight matching problems, but the reduction is known to be inefficient due to the huge weights.
  This paper presents the condition for a weight function to find an optimal matching by reducing profile-based matching to the maximum weight matching problem. It is shown that a weight function which represents utilities as a mixed-radix numeric system with base-$(2U_i+1)$ can be used, so the complexity of the problem is $O(m\sqrt{n}(\log{n} + \sum_{i=1}^{r}\log{U_i}))$ for $n = |V|$, $m = |E|$. In addition, it is demonstrated that the weight lower bound for rank-maximal/fair/weight-maximal matching, better computational complexity for fair/weight-maximal matching, and an algorithm to verify a maximum weight matching can be reduced to rank-maximal matching. Finally, the effectiveness of the profile-based algorithm is evaluated with real data for school choice lottery.</description>

      <title>Verification of Hamiltonian Path Conjecture (BHR Conjecture) for Integers up to p=31</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.00059</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.00059v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The BHR (Buratti-Horak-Rosa) Conjecture (2006) proposes that for every p and a multiset L of (p-1) positive integers modulo p, there exists a Hamiltonian path in the Complete Graph Kp with consecutive edge lengths given by the elements of L. In this article, we outline an approach to the conjecture based on frequency partitions and local/global adjustment operations and backtracking. We describe the mathematical strategy, experimental evidence, and implementation in a Python Program to explore valid Hamiltonian paths p &lt; 37. This is a result an improvement over by Mariusz Meszka for all primes up to 23 (included) with the aid of a computer.</description>

      <title>Semi-strictification of $(\infty, n)$-categories</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.00146</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.00146v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We prove the first equivalence between a weak non-algebraic model and a semi-strict algebraic model of $(\infty, n)$-categories. This takes the form of a natural semi-strictification, whereby a weak $(\infty, n)$-category is embedded into a semi-strict one through an acyclic cofibration, in such a way that weak functors lift to semi-strict functors; this constitutes the derived unit of a Quillen equivalence between weak model categories whose fibrant objects are, respectively, the weak $(\infty, n)$-categories and (up to an acyclic fibration) the semi-strict ones. The semi-strict model has algebraic units and composition of round pasting diagrams, satisfying a strict form of associativity and interchange as in Henry's regular version of Simpson's weak units conjecture; semi-strict functors strictly preserve round composition, but only weakly preserve units. Globular composition operations are obtained from a combination of units and round composition. Since the models satisfy the homotopy hypothesis in the case $n = 0$, this result also exhibits the first semi-strict model of the classical homotopy types that has algebraic units and composition. The constructions are based on the combinatorics of regular directed complexes and are entirely explicit and combinatorial, in the spirit of Mac Lane's strictification of bicategories.</description>

      <title>Continuous Noncrossing Partitions and Weighted Circular Factorizations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.00283</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.00283v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This article examines noncrossing partitions of the unit circle in the complex plane; we call these continuous noncrossing partitions. More precisely, we focus on the degree-$d$ continuous noncrossing partitions where unit complex numbers in the same block have identical $d$-th powers. We prove that the degree-$d$ continuous noncrossing partitions form a topological poset whose uncountable set of elements can be indexed by equivalence classes of objects we call weighted linear factorizations of factors of a $d$-cycle. Moreover, the maximal elements in this poset form a subspace homeomorphic to the dual Garside classifying space for the $d$-strand braid group.
  The degree-$d$ continuous noncrossing partitions of the unit circle are a special case of a more general construction. For every choice of Coxeter element $c$ in any Coxeter group $W$ we define a topological poset of equivalence classes of weighted linear factorizations of factors of $c$ in $W$ whose elements we call continuous $c$-noncrossing partitions. The maximal elements in this poset form a subspace homeomorphic to the one-vertex complex whose fundamental group is the corresponding dual Artin group.</description>

      <title>The strong convergence phenomenon</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.00346</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.00346v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In a seminal 2005 paper, Haagerup and Thorbj{\o}rnsen discovered that the norm of any noncommutative polynomial of independent complex Gaussian random matrices converges to that of a limiting family of operators that arises from Voiculescu's free probability theory. In recent years, new methods have made it possible to establish such strong convergence properties in much more general situations, and to obtain even more powerful quantitative forms of the strong convergence phenomenon. These, in turn, have led to a number of spectacular applications to long-standing open problems on random graphs, hyperbolic surfaces, and operator algebras, and have provided flexible new tools that enable the study of random matrices in unexpected generality. This survey aims to provide an introduction to this circle of ideas.</description>

Abstract: We revisit several partition-theoretic generating functions, including the theta quotients from Ramanujan's lost notebook, MacMahon's partition functions, and reciprocal sums of parts in partitions, through the lens of the classical Fa\`{a} di Bruno formula. This approach offers a unified and natural reinterpretation of known results and provides a systematic framework for deriving new identities of a similar type.</description>

      <title>Computational complexity of covering regular trees</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.00564v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A graph covering projection, also referred to as a locally bijective homomorphism, is a mapping between the vertices and edges of two graphs that preserves incidences and is a local bijection. This concept originates in topological graph theory but has also found applications in combinatorics and theoretical computer science. In this paper we consider undirected graphs in the most general setting -- graphs may contain multiple edges, loops, and semi-edges. This is in line with recent trends in topological graph theory and mathematical physics.
  We advance the study of the computational complexity of the {\sc $H$-Cover} problem, which asks whether an input graph allows a covering projection onto a parameter graph $H$. The quest for a complete characterization started in 1990's. Several results for simple graphs or graphs without semi-edges have been known, the role of semi-edges in the complexity setting has started to be investigated only recently. One of the most general known NP-hardness results states that {\sc $H$}-Cover is NP-complete for every simple connected regular graph of valency greater than two. We complement this result by considering regular graphs $H$ arising from connected acyclic graphs by adding semi-edges. Namely, we prove that any graph obtained by adding semi-edges to the vertices of a tree making it a $d$-regular graph with $d \geq 3$, defines an NP-complete graph covering problem. In line with the so called Strong Dichotomy Conjecture, we prove that the NP-hardness holds even for simple graphs on input.</description>

      <title>Study of $p$-Young tableaux, Robinson-Schensted correspondence and the lacunary Cauchy identity of group algebras $KG_{r}$ and $KSG_{r}$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.00580</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.00580v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we develop the Robinson-Schensted correspondence between the elements of the groups $G_{r}$ $(\mathbb{Z}_{p^{r}}\rtimes \mathbb{Z}^{*}_{p^{r}})$ and $SG_{r}$ $(\mathbb{Z}_{p^{r-1}}\rtimes \mathbb{Z}^{*}_{p^{r}})$, along with a pair of the standard $p$-Young tableaux. This approach differs from the classical method, and ours is based on matrix units arising from orthogonal primitive idempotents computed for every group algebra. Some classical properties of the Robinson-Schensted correspondence are discussed. As a by-product, we also extend the Cauchy identity to our setup, which we refer to as the lacunary Cauchy identity. This study offers new insights into the representation theory of these groups and their combinatorial structures.</description>

      <title>Dispersion models on a circle: universal properties and asymptotic results</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.00737</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.00737v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Consider a sequence of masses $m_0,m_1,...$ arriving uniformly at random at some points $u_0,u_1,...$ on the unit circle $\mathbb{R}/\mathbb{Z}$ (or on $\mathbb{Z}/n\mathbb{Z}$, in the discrete version). Upon arrival, each mass undergoes a relaxation phase during which it is dispersed, possibly also at random. This process can model many physical phenomena, such as the diffusion of liquid in a porous medium. In the discrete case, it can model parking (related to additive coalescence and hashing with linear probing) in which the cars are permitted to follow random displacement policies.
  The dispersion policies considered in the paper ensure that at time $k$, after the successive dispersions of $m_0,\cdots,m_{k-1}$, the total covered region has Lebesgue measure $m_0+\cdots+m_{k-1}$. Furthermore, during the dispersion of a given mass, the covered domain increases continuously, except when it merges with another covered connected component (CC).
  We show a very general exchangeability property for the sequence of covered CC. Additionally, we demonstrate a universal spacing property between these CC, and a notable general result: if the $(u_i)$ are independent and rotationally invariant, then the number of free (not covered) CC follows a binomial distribution whose parameters depend solely on the number and total mass of arrived particles. Furthermore, conditional on the number of CC, the sizes of the free CC follow a simple Dirichlet distribution in the continuous case, regardless of the dispersion policy considered and the values of the masses. We also characterize the distribution of the occupied space.
  In the second part of the paper, we study the total cost associated with these models for various cost models, and establish connections with the additive coalescent. We also provide an asymptotic representation of the limiting covered space as the number of masses goes to infinity.</description>

Abstract: In this paper, we prove a conjecture by Aas and Linusson on the two-point correlations of adjacent particles in a continuous multispecies TASEP on a ring (AIHPD, 2018). We use the theory of multiline queues as devised by Ferrari and Martin (AOP, 2008) to interpret the conjectures in terms of placements of numbers in triangular arrays. Further, we use projections to calculate correlations in the continuous multispecies TASEP using a distribution on these placements.</description>

Abstract: We analyze the combinatorics behind the operation of taking the logarithm of the generating function $G_k$ for $k^\text{th}$ generalized Catalan numbers. We provide combinatorial interpretations in terms of lattice paths and in terms of tree graphs. Using explicit bijections, we are able to recover known closed expressions for the coefficients of $\log G_k$ by purely combinatorial means of enumeration. The non-algebraic proof easily generalizes to higher powers $\log^a G_k$, $a\geq 2$.</description>

      <title>Constructing disjoint Steiner trees in Sierpi\'{n}ski graphs</title>

      <description>arXiv:2310.16463v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Let $G$ be a graph and $S\subseteq V(G)$ with $|S|\geq 2$. Then the trees $T_1, T_2, \cdots, T_\ell$ in $G$ are \emph{internally disjoint Steiner trees} connecting $S$ (or $S$-Steiner trees) if $E(T_i) \cap E(T_j )=\emptyset$ and $V(T_i)\cap V(T_j)=S$ for every pair of distinct integers $i,j$, $1 \leq i, j \leq \ell$. Similarly, if we only have the condition $E(T_i) \cap E(T_j )=\emptyset$ but without the condition $V(T_i)\cap V(T_j)=S$, then they are \emph{edge-disjoint Steiner trees}. The \emph{generalized $k$-connectivity}, denoted by $\kappa_k(G)$, of a graph $G$, is defined as $\kappa_k(G)=\min\{\kappa_G(S)|S \subseteq V(G) \ \textrm{and} \ |S|=k \}$, where $\kappa_G(S)$ is the maximum number of internally disjoint $S$-Steiner trees. The \emph{generalized local edge-connectivity} $\lambda_{G}(S)$ is the maximum number of edge-disjoint Steiner trees connecting $S$ in $G$. The {\it generalized $k$-edge-connectivity} $\lambda_k(G)$ of $G$ is defined as $\lambda_k(G)=\min\{\lambda_{G}(S)\,|\,S\subseteq V(G) \ and \ |S|=k\}$. These measures are generalizations of the concepts of connectivity and edge-connectivity, and they and can be used as measures of vulnerability of networks. It is, in general, difficult to compute these generalized connectivities. However, there are precise results for some special classes of graphs. In this paper, we obtain the exact value of $\lambda_{k}(S(n,\ell))$ for $3\leq k\leq \ell^n$, and the exact value of $\kappa_{k}(S(n,\ell))$ for $3\leq k\leq \ell$, where $S(n, \ell)$ is the Sierpi\'{n}ski graphs with order $\ell^n$. As a direct consequence, these graphs provide additional interesting examples when $\lambda_{k}(S(n,\ell))=\kappa_{k}(S(n,\ell))$. We also study the some network properties of Sierpi\'{n}ski graphs.</description>

Abstract: A new class of simple symmetric digraphs called $\mathcal{D}$ is defined and studied here. Any digraph in $\mathcal{D}$ has the property that each non-pendant vertex is adjacent to at least one pendant vertex. A graph theoretical description for the entries of the group inverse of a real square matrix with any digraph belonging to this class is given. We classify all the real square matrices $A$ such that the digraphs associated with $A$ and $A^{\#}$ both are in $\mathcal{D}$, that is, the digraph related to $A$ is either a corona or a star digraph.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.04030v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Classical Ramsey theory has successfully extended to relational structures, yielding a wealth of results that have profoundly influenced other areas of mathematics. Interestingly, the same development has not occurred in the case of dual Ramsey theory. The main goal of this paper is to advance the dual Ramsey theory for finite relational structures with respect to natural structure-preserving maps. Tools from category theory prove instrumental in this endeavor, as was previously the case for finite algebraic systems where the dual Ramsey property had been established for every class of finite algebras coming from an equationally defined class. One cannot help but feel that dual Ramsey phenomena are deeply connected to categorical strategies.</description>

      <title>Maximal intersecting families revisited</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.03674</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.03674v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The well-known Erd\H{o}s--Ko--Rado theorem states that for $n&gt; 2k$, every intersecting family of $k$-sets of $[n]:=\{1,\ldots ,n\}$ has at most $ {n-1 \choose k-1}$ sets, and the extremal family consists of all $k$-sets containing a fixed element (called a full star). The Hilton--Milner theorem provides a stability result by determining the maximum size of a uniform intersecting family that is not a subfamily of a full star. The further stabilities were studied by Han and Kohayakawa (2017) and Huang and Peng (2024). Two families $\mathcal{F}$ and $\mathcal{G}$ are called cross-intersecting if for every $F\in \mathcal{F}$ and $G\in \mathcal{G}$, the intersection $F\cap G$ is non-empty. Let $k \geq 1, t\ge 0$ and $n \geq 2 k+t$ be integers. Frankl (2016) proved that if $\mathcal{F} \subseteq\binom{[n]}{k+t}$ and $\mathcal{G} \subseteq\binom{[n]}{k}$ are cross-intersecting families, and $\mathcal{F}$ is non-empty and $(t+1)$-intersecting, then $|\mathcal{F}|+|\mathcal{G}| \leq\binom{n}{k}-\binom{n-k-t}{k}+1$. Recently, Wu (2023) sharpened Frankl's result by establishing a stability variant. The aim of this paper is two-fold. Inspired by the above results, we first prove a further stability variant that generalizes both Frankl's result and Wu's result. Secondly, as an interesting application, we illustrate that the aforementioned results on cross-intersecting families could be used to establish the stability results of the Erd\H{o}s--Ko--Rado theorem. More precisely, we present new short proofs of the Hilton--Milner theorem, the Han--Kohayakawa theorem and the Huang--Peng theorem. Our arguments are more straightforward, and it may be of independent interest.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.18782v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We prove the exponential growth of the cardinality of the set of numbers of spanning trees in simple (and planar) graphs on $n$ vertices, answering a question of Sedl\'a\v{c}ek from 1969. The proof uses a connection with continued fractions, ``thin orbits,'' and Zaremba's conjecture.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.15608v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We show that if a simplicial complex is a near-cone of sufficiently high depth, then the only maximum families of small pairwise intersecting faces are those with a common intersection. Thus, near-cones of sufficiently high depth satisfy the strict Erd\H{o}s-Ko-Rado property conjectured by Holroyd and Talbot and by Borg. One consequence is a strict Erd\H{o}s-Ko-Rado theorem for independence complexes of chordal graphs with an isolated vertex. Under stronger shiftedness conditions, we prove a sharper stability theorem of Hilton-Milner type, as well as two cross-intersecting theorems.</description>

      <title>On the Sumset of Sets of Size $k$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.07679</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.07679v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The set $\mathcal{R}_{G}(h,k)$ consists of all possible sizes for the $h$-fold sumset of sets containing $k$ elements from an additive abelian group $G$. The exact makeup of this set is still unknown, but there has been progress towards determining which integers are present. We know that $\mathcal{R}_{G}(h,k)\subseteq\left[hk-h+1,\binom{h+k-1}{h}\right]$, where the right side is an interval of integers that includes the endpoints. These endpoints are known to be attained. We will prove that the integers in $\left[hk-h+2,hk-1\right]$ are not possible sizes for the $h$-fold sumset of a set containing $k\geq 4$ elements of a torsion-free additive abelian group $G$. Furthermore, we will confirm that this interval can't be made larger by exhibiting a subset of $G$ whose $h$-fold sumset has size $hk$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2506.23124v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A discriminantal hyperplane arrangement B(n,k,A) is constructed from a given (generic) hyperplane arrangement A, which is classified as either very generic or non-very generic depending on the combinatorial structure of B(n,k,A). In particular, A is considered non-very generic if the intersection lattice of B(n,k,A) contains at least one non-very generic intersection -- that is, an intersection that fails to satisfy a specific rank condition established by Athanasiadis in [1]. In this paper, we present arithmetic criteria characterizing non-very generic intersections in discriminantal arrangements and we complete and correct a previous result by Libgober and the third author concerning rank-two intersections in such arrangements.</description>

Abstract: A graph $\mathcal G = (\mathcal V, \mathcal E)$ is said to satisfy the Neighbour Sum Property if there exists some $f:\mathcal V\to\mathbb R$ such that $f\not\equiv 0$ and it maps every vertex to the sum of the values taken by its neighbours. In this article, we provide an algorithm to check whether a given finite tree satisfies the neighbour sum property. We also find a large class of trees on $n$ vertices that satisfy the property.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2310.17635v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Let $A$ be an $n\times n$ matrix with iid entries where $A_{ij} \sim \mathrm{Ber}(p)$ is a Bernoulli random variable with parameter $p = d/n$. We show that the empirical measure of the eigenvalues converges, in probability, to a deterministic distribution as $n \rightarrow \infty$. This essentially resolves a long line of work to determine the spectral laws of iid matrices and is the first known example for non-Hermitian random matrices at this level of sparsity.</description>

      <title>The golf model on $\mathbb{Z}/n\mathbb{Z}$ and on $\mathbb{Z}$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.13380</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.13380v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We introduce a particle model, that we call the $\textit{golf model}$. Initially, on a graph $G$, balls and holes are placed at random on some distinct vertices. The balls then move one by one, doing a random walk on $G$, starting from their initial vertex and stopping at the first empty hole they encounter, which they fill. On finite graphs, under reasonable assumptions (if there are more holes than balls, and if the Markov chain characterizing the random walks is irreducible) a final configuration is reached almost surely. In the paper, we are mainly interested in ${\bf H}^1$, the set of remaining holes. We give the distribution of ${\bf H}^1$ on $\mathbb{Z}/n\mathbb{Z}$, and describe a phase transition for the largest distance between two consecutive holes when the number of remaining holes is of order $\sqrt{n}$. We show that the model on $\mathbb{Z}$ is well-defined if every vertex contains either a ball with probability $d_{\sf b}$, a hole with probability $d_{\sf h}$, or nothing, independently from the other vertices, as long as $d_{\sf b} \leq d_{\sf h}$, and we describe the law of ${\bf H}^1$ in this case.</description>

      <title>Quantifying analogy of concepts via ologs and wiring diagrams</title>

      <description>arXiv:2402.01020v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We build on the theory of ontology logs (ologs) created by Spivak and Kent, and define a notion of wiring diagrams. In this article, a wiring diagram is a finite directed labelled graph. The labels correspond to types in an olog; they can also be interpreted as readings of sensors in an autonomous system. As such, wiring diagrams can be used as a framework for an autonomous system to form abstract concepts. We show that the graphs underlying skeleton wiring diagrams form a category. This allows skeleton wiring diagrams to be compared and manipulated using techniques from both graph theory and category theory. We also extend the usual definition of graph edit distance to the case of wiring diagrams by using operations only available to wiring diagrams, leading to a metric on the set of all skeleton wiring diagrams. In the end, we give an extended example on calculating the distance between two concepts represented by wiring diagrams, and explain how to apply our framework to any application domain.</description>

      <title>Large random matrices with given margins</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.14942</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.14942v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study large random matrices with i.i.d. entries conditioned to have prescribed row and column sums (margins), a problem connected to relative entropy minimization, Schr\"odinger bridges, contingency tables, and random graphs with given degree sequences. Our central result is a `transference principle': the complex margin-conditioned matrix can be closely approximated by a simpler matrix whose entries are independent and drawn from an exponential tilting of the original model. The tilt parameters are determined by the sum of two potentials. We establish phase diagrams for `tame margins', where these potentials are uniformly bounded. This framework resolves a 2011 conjecture by Chatterjee, Diaconis, and Sly on $\delta$-tame degree sequences and generalizes a sharp phase transition in contingency tables obtained by Dittmer, Lyu, and Pak in 2020. For tame margins, we show that a generalized Sinkhorn algorithm can compute the potentials at a dimension-free exponential rate. Our limit theory further establishes that for a convergent sequence of tame margins, the potentials converge as fast as the margins converge.
  We apply this framework and obtain several key results for the conditioned matrix: The marginal distribution of any single entry is asymptotically an exponential tilting of the base measure, resolving a 2010 conjecture by Barvinok on contingency tables. The conditioned matrix concentrates in cut norm around a `typical table' (the expectation of the tilted model), which acts as a static Schr\"odinger bridge between the margins. The empirical singular value distribution of the rescaled matrix converges to an explicit law determined by the variance profile of the tilted model. In particular, we confirm the universality of the Marchenko-Pastur law for constant linear margins.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.19878v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The transpose top-$2$ with random shuffle (J. Theoret. Probab., 2020) is a lazy random walk on the alternating group $A_n$ generated by $3$-cycles of the form $(\star,n-1,n)$ and $(\star,n,n-1)$. We obtain the limit profile of this random walk by comparing it with the random walk on $A_n$ generated by all $3$-cycles. Our method employs a non-commutative Fourier analysis analogue of the comparison method introduced by Nestoridi (Electron. J. Probab., 2024). We also give the complete spectrum of the alternating group graph, thus answering a question of Huang and Huang (J. Algebraic Combin., 2019).</description>

      <title>Unbent Collections of Orthogonal Drawings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.18390</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.18390v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recently, there has been interest in representing single graphs by multiple drawings; for example, using graph stories, storyplans, or uncrossed collections. In this paper, we apply this idea to orthogonal graph drawing. Due to the orthogonal drawing style, we focus on 4-graphs, that is, graphs of maximum degree 4. We restrict ourselves to plane graphs, that is, planar graphs whose embedding is fixed. Our goal is to represent any plane 4-graph $G$ by an unbent collection, that is, a collection of orthogonal drawings of $G$ that adhere to the embedding of $G$ and ensure that each edge of $G$ is drawn without bends in at least one of the drawings. We investigate two objectives. First, we consider minimizing the number of drawings in an unbent collection. We prove that every plane 4-graph can be represented by a collection with at most three drawings, which is tight. We also give necessary and sufficient conditions for a graph to admit an unbent collection of size $2$. Second, we consider minimizing the total number of bends over all drawings in an unbent collection. We show that this problem is NP-hard and give a 3-approximation algorithm. For the special case of plane triconnected cubic graphs, we show how to compute minimum-bend collections in linear time.</description>

      <title>Simple Approximations for General Spanner Problems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.23638</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.23638v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Consider a graph with n nodes and m edges, independent edge weights and lengths, and arbitrary distance demands for node pairs. The spanner problem asks for a minimum-weight subgraph that satisfies these demands via sufficiently short paths w.r.t. the edge lengths. For multiplicative alpha-spanners (where demands equal alpha times the original distances) and assuming that each edge's weight equals its length, the simple Greedy heuristic by Alth\"ofer et al. (1993) is known to yield strong solutions, both in theory and practice. To obtain guarantees in more general settings, recent approximations typically abandon this simplicity and practicality. Still, so far, there is no known non-trivial approximation algorithm for the spanner problem in its most general form. We provide two surprisingly simple approximations algorithms. In general, our Augmented Greedy achieves the first unconditional approximation ratio of m, which is non-trivial due to the independence of weights and lengths. Crucially, it maintains all size and weight guarantees Greedy is known for, i.e., in the aforementioned multiplicative alpha-spanner scenario and even for additive +beta-spanners. Further, it generalizes some of these size guarantees to derive new weight guarantees. Our second approach, Randomized Rounding, establishes a graph transformation that allows a simple rounding scheme over a standard multicommodity flow LP. It yields an O(n log n)-approximation, assuming integer lengths and polynomially bounded distance demands. The only other known approximation guarantee in this general setting requires several complex subalgorithms and analyses, yet we match it up to a factor of O(n^{1/5-eps}) using standard tools. Further, on bounded-degree graphs, we yield the first O(log n) approximation ratio for constant-bounded distance demands (beyond multiplicative 2-spanners in unit-length graphs).</description>
