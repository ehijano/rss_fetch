      <title>Comparing the 3D morphology of solid-oxide fuel cell anodes for different manufacturing processes, operating times, and operating temperatures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.15259</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.15259v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Solid oxide fuel cells (SOFCs) are becoming increasingly important due to their high electrical efficiency, the flexible choice of fuels and relatively low emissions of pollutants. However, the increasingly growing demands for electrochemical devices require further performance improvements. Since it is well known that the 3D morphology of the electrodes, which is significantly influenced by the underlying manufacturing process, has a profound impact on the resulting performance, a deeper understanding for the structural changes caused by modifications of the manufacturing process or degradation phenomena is desirable. In the present paper, we investigate the influence of the operating time and the operating temperature on the 3D morphology of SOFC anodes using 3D image data obtained by focused-ion beam scanning electron microscopy, which is segmented into gadolinium-doped ceria, nickel and pore space. In addition, structural differences caused by manufacturing the anode via infiltration or powder technology, respectively, are analyzed quantitatively by means of various geometrical descriptors such as specific surface area, length of triple phase boundary per unit volume, mean geodesic tortuosity, and constrictivity. The computation of these descriptors from 3D image data is carried out both globally as well as locally to quantify the heterogeneity of the anode structure.</description>

      <title>Versatile Top-Down Patterning of 3D, 2D and 0D Perovskites for On-Chip Integration</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.15286</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.15286v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Metal-halide perovskites (MHPs) have exciting optoelectronic properties and are under investigation for various applications, such as photovoltaics, light-emitting diodes, and lasers. An essential step toward exploiting the full potential of this class of materials is their large-scale, on-chip integration with high-resolution, top-down patterning. The development of such patterning methods for perovskite films is challenging because of their ionic behavior and adverse reactions with the solvents used in standard lithography processes. Here, we introduce a versatile and precise method comprising photolithography and reactive ion etching (RIE) processes that can be tuned to accommodate different perovskite compositions and morphologies, including 3D, quasi-2D, and quasi-0D structures. Our method utilizes conventional photoresists at reduced temperatures to create micron-sized features down to 1 $\mu$m, providing high reproducibility from chip to chip. The patterning technique is validated through atomic force microscopy (AFM), X-ray diffraction (XRD), optical spectroscopy, and scanning electron microscopy (SEM). It enables the scalable and high-throughput on-chip monolithic integration of MHPs.</description>

      <title>Identification of large polarons and exciton polarons in rutile and anatase polymorphs of titanium dioxide</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.15344</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.15344v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Titanium dioxide (TiO2) is a wide-gap semiconductor with numerous applications in photocatalysis, photovoltaics, and neuromorphic computing. The unique functional properties of this material critically depend on its ability to transport charge in the form of polarons, namely narrow electron wavepackets accompanied by local distortions of the crystal lattice. It is currently well established that the most important polymorphs of TiO2, the rutile and anatase phases, harbor small electron polarons and small hole polarons, respectively. However, whether additional polaronic species exist in TiO2, and under which conditions, remain open questions. Here, we provide definitive answers to these questions by exploring the rich landscape of polaron quasiparticles in TiO2 via recently developed ab initio techniques. In addition to the already known small polarons, we identify three novel species, namely a large hole polaron in rutile, a large quasi-two-dimensional electron polaron in anatase, and a large exciton polaron in anatase. These findings complete the puzzle on the polaorn physics of TiO2 and pave the way for systematically probing and manipulating polarons in a broad class of complex oxides and quantum materials.</description>

      <title>Accelerating CALPHAD-based Phase Diagram Predictions in Complex Alloys Using Universal Machine Learning Potentials: Opportunities and Challenges</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.15351</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.15351v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Accurate phase diagram prediction is crucial for understanding alloy thermodynamics and advancing materials design. While traditional CALPHAD methods are robust, they are resource-intensive and limited by experimentally assessed data. This work explores the use of machine learning interatomic potentials (MLIPs) such as M3GNet, CHGNet, MACE, SevenNet, and ORB to significantly accelerate phase diagram calculations by using the Alloy Theoretic Automated Toolkit (ATAT) to map calculations of the energies and free energies of atomistic systems to CALPHAD-compatible thermodynamic descriptions. Using case studies including Cr-Mo, Cu-Au, and Pt-W, we demonstrate that MLIPs, particularly ORB, achieve computational speedups exceeding three orders of magnitude compared to DFT while maintaining phase stability predictions within acceptable accuracy. Extending this approach to liquid phases and ternary systems like Cr-Mo-V highlights its versatility for high-entropy alloys and complex chemical spaces. This work demonstrates that MLIPs, integrated with tools like ATAT within a CALPHAD framework, provide an efficient and accurate framework for high-throughput thermodynamic modeling, enabling rapid exploration of novel alloy systems. While many challenges remain to be addressed, the accuracy of some of these MLIPs (ORB in particular) are on the verge of paving the way toward high-throughput generation of CALPHAD thermodynamic descriptions of multi-component, multi-phase alloy systems.</description>

      <title>Temperature dependent spin dynamics in La$_{0.67}$Sr$_{0.33}$MnO$_3$/Pt bilayers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.15417</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.15417v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Complex ferromagnetic oxides such as La$_{0.67}$Sr$_{0.33}$MnO$_3$ (LSMO) offer a pathway for creating energy efficient spintronic devices with new functionalities. LSMO exhibits high-temperature ferromagnetism, half metallicity, sharp resonance linewidth, low damping and a large anisotropic magnetoresistance response. Combined with Pt, a proven material with high spin-charge conversion efficiency, LSMO can potentially be used to create robust nano-oscillators. Here, we employed the ferromagnetic resonance (FMR) and spin-pumping FMR measurements to investigate the magnetization dynamics and spin transport in NdGaO3(110)/LSMO(15 nm)/Pt(0 and 5 nm) thin films at temperatures ranging from 300K to 90K. We find that the bilayer system exhibits a low magnetic damping (0.002), small linewidth (12Oe) and a large spin Hall angle ( 3.2%) at 170K, making it the optimum working temperature for spin orbit torque oscillators based on this system.</description>

      <title>Epitaxial PbGeSe thin films and their photoluminescence in the mid-wave infrared</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.15464</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.15464v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: PbSe is a narrow bandgap IV-VI compound semiconductor with application in mid-wave infrared optoelectronics, thermoelectrics, and quantum devices. Alkaline earth or rare earth elements such as Sr and Eu can substitute Pb to widen the bandgap of PbSe in heterostructure devices, but they come with challenges such as deteriorating optical and electronic properties, even in dilute concentrations due to their dissimilar atomic nature. We substitute Pb instead with column-IV Ge and assess the potential of rocksalt phase PbGeSe as a wider bandgap semiconductor in thin films grown by molecular beam epitaxy on GaAs substrates. Low sticking of GeSe adatoms requires synthesis temperatures below 260 {\deg}C to incorporate Ge, but this yields poor structural and compositional uniformity as determined by X-ray diffraction. Consequently, as-grown films in the range Pb0.94Ge0.06Se to Pb0.83Ge0.17Se (6-17% Ge) show much less bandgap widening in photoluminescence than prior work on bulk crystals using absorption. We observe that post-growth rapid thermal annealing at temperatures of 375-450 {\deg}C improves the crystal quality and recovers bandgap widening. Rapid interdiffusion of Ge during annealing, however, remains a challenge in harnessing such PbGeSe materials for compositionally sharp heterostructures. Annealed 17%-Ge films emit light at 3-3.1 um with minimal shift in wavelength versus temperature. These samples are wider in bandgap than PbSe films by 55 meV at room temperature and the widening increases to 160 meV at 80 K, thanks to sharply different dependence of bandgap on temperature in PbSe and PbGeSe.</description>

      <title>Manipulating the Optical Response of TaIrTe4 Heterostructures through Band Alignment Strategy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.15517</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.15517v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Weyl semimetals, such as $TaIrTe_{4}$, characterized by their unique band structures and exotic transport phenomena, have become a central focus in modern electronics. Despite extensive research, a systematic understanding of the impact of heterogeneous integration on the electronic and optical properties of TaIrTe4 device remains elusive. We have carried out density functional theory combined with nonequilibrium Green's function formalism calculations for $TaIrTe_{4}/WTe_{2}$, $TaIrTe_{4}/MoTe_{2}$ and $TaIrTe_{4}/h-BN$ heterostructures, aiming to understand the manipulation of photoresponse through various band alignment strategies. The underlying impacts of interlayer interactions, charge transfer and build-in electric field on the electronic properties are carefully investigated. We design a dual-probe photodetector device to understand the overall photoresponse enhancement of the heterogeneous integration by decomposing into the specific strain, interlayer transition, band overlap and symmetry lowering mechanics. These van der Waals integrations provide an ideal platform for studying band alignment physics in self-powered optoelectronic devices.</description>

      <title>Large tuning of the optical properties of nanoscale NdNiO3 via electron doping</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.15679</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.15679v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We synthesized crystalline films of neodymium nickel oxide (NdNiO3), a perovskite quantum material, switched the films from a metal phase (intrinsic) into an insulator phase (electron-doped) by field-driven lithium-ion intercalation, and characterized their structural and optical properties. Time-of-flight secondary-ion mass spectrometry (ToF-SIMS) showed that the intercalation process resulted in a gradient of the dopant concentration along the thickness direction of the films, turning the films into insulator-metal bilayers. We used variable-angle spectroscopic ellipsometry to measure the complex refractive indices of the metallic and insulating phases of NdNiO3. The insulator phase has a refractive index of n ~ 2 and low absorption in the visible and near infrared, and analysis of the complex refractive indices indicated that the band gap of the insulating phase is roughly 3-4 eV. Electrical control of the optical band gap, with corresponding large changes to the optical refractive indices, creates new opportunities for tunable optics.</description>

      <title>Optical absorption spectroscopy probes water wire and its ordering in a hydrogen-bond network</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.15688</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.15688v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Water wires, quasi-one-dimensional chains composed of hydrogen-bonded (H-bonded) water molecules, play a fundamental role in numerous chemical, physical, and physiological processes. Yet direct experimental detection of water wires has been elusive so far. Based on advanced $ab$ $initio$ many-body theory that includes electron-hole interactions, we report that optical absorption spectroscopy can serve as a sensitive probe of water wires and their ordering. In both liquid and solid water, the main peak of the spectrum is discovered to be a charge transfer exciton. In water, the charge transfer exciton is strongly coupled to the H-bonding environment where the exciton is excited between H-bonded water molecules with a large spectral intensity. In regular ice, the spectral weight of the charge transfer exciton is enhanced by a collective excitation occurring on proton-ordered water wires, whose spectral intensity scales with the ordering length of water wire. The spectral intensity and excitonic interaction strength reaches its maximum in ice XI, where the long-range ordering length yields the most pronounced spectral signal. Our findings suggest that water wires, which widely exist in important physiological and biological systems and other phases of ice, can be directly probed by this approach.</description>

      <title>Occupation and diffusion of interstitial solutes in dilute alloys in perspective of the Gauss Legendre three square theorem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.15725</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.15725v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the example of the diffusion of C, N, O in dilute ferric iron alloys, it is shown that the polyhedron consisting of equivalent occupation of interstitial solutes in dilute alloys, can be classified into 7 groups altogether, i.e., cube, octahedron, cuboctahedron, truncated octahedron, truncated cube, rhombicuboctahedron and truncated cuboctahedron. No more polyhedron can be found. The notation and the migration paths of C, N, O in dilute alloys are well described by the Gauss Legendre three square theorem. The abstraction of the migration paths gives rise to the Wythoffian operations illustrated with cube and octahedron. The occupation and migration paths of the diffuser in this work can be generalized to the diffusion of vacancy and interstitial atoms in other host materials with low concentration of substitutional solutes.</description>

      <title>A unified variational model for grain boundary dynamics incorporating microscopic structure</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.15747</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.15747v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent experiments, atomistic simulations, and theoretical predictions have identified various new types of grain boundary motions that are controlled by the dynamics of underlying microstructure of line defects (dislocations or disconnections), to which the classical motion by mean curvature model does not apply. Different continuum models have been developed by upscaling from discrete line defect dynamics models under different settings (dislocations or disconnections, low angle grain boundaries or high angle grain boundaries, etc.), to account for the specific detailed natures of the microscopic dynamics mechanisms, and these continuum models are not in the variational form. In this paper, we propose a unified variational framework to account for all the underlying line defect mechanisms for the dynamics of both low and high angle grain boundaries and the associated grain rotations. The variational formulation is based on the developed constraints of the dynamic Frank-Bilby equations that govern the microscopic line defect structures. The proposed variational framework is able to recover the available models for different motions under different conditions. The unified variational framework is more efficient to describe the collective behaviors of grain boundary networks at larger length scales. It also provides a mathematically tractable basis for rigorous analysis of these partial differential equation models and for the development of efficient numerical methods.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.15754v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We report the first spectral reflectance of tungsten carbide (WC) as potential solar selective absorber. We developed an optical measurement system for visible to mid-infrared spectroscopy, covering the range of 0.1 to 2.5 eV, to evaluate the solar selectivity. A polycrystalline WC was prepared using spark plasma sintering method. The measured spectral reflectance of WC exhibits a low-energy plasma excitation around 0.6 eV corresponding to the cutoff energy of sunlight, consistent with ab initio calculations, thus making it preferable for the solar selective absorber. We also discuss effects of the sample quality on the spectral reflectance.</description>

      <title>Simultaneous Measurement of Thermal Conductivity, Heat Capacity, and Interfacial Thermal Conductance by Leveraging Negative Delay-Time Data in Time-Domain Thermoreflectance</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.15767</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.15767v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Time-domain thermoreflectance (TDTR) is a widely used technique for characterizing the thermal properties of bulk and thin-film materials. Traditional TDTR analyses typically focus on positive delay time data for fitting, often requiring multiple-frequency measurements to simultaneously determine thermal conductivity and heat capacity. However, this multiple-frequency approach is cumbersome and may introduce inaccuracies due to inconsistencies across different frequency measurements. In this study, we propose a novel solution to these challenges by harnessing the often-overlooked negative delay time data in TDTR. By integrating these data points, we offer a streamlined, single-frequency method that simultaneously measures thermal conductivity, heat capacity, and interface thermal conductance for both bulk and thin-film materials, enhancing measurement efficiency and accuracy. We demonstrate the effectiveness of this method by measuring several bulk samples including sapphire, silicon, diamond, and Si0.992Ge0.008, and several thin-film samples including a 1.76-{\mu}m-thick gallium nitride (GaN) film epitaxially grown on a silicon substrate, a 320-nm-thick gallium oxide ({\epsilon}-Ga2O3) film epitaxially grown on a silicon carbide substrate, and a 330-nm-thick tantalum nitride (TaN) film deposited on a sapphire substrate, all coated with an aluminum (Al) transducer layer on the surface. Our results show that the new method accurately determines the thermal conductivity and heat capacity of these samples as well as the Al/sample interface thermal conductance using a single modulation frequency, except for the Si0.992Ge0.008 sample. This study sheds light on the untapped potential of TDTR, offering a new, efficient, and accurate avenue for thermal analysis in material science.</description>

Abstract: Beryllium (Be) alloys are indispensable in cutting-edge applications due to their unique advantages. However, the scientific understanding about their structure and property is deficient, which greatly restricts their applications within a narrow field. In this work, a systematic investigation on the structure and properties of Be-Fe binary was carried out with first-principles unbiased evolutionary algorithms. Five new intermetallics unreported before, including insulating Be11Fe and Be4Fe, metallic Be3Fe, and metastable BeFe and BeFe2 were discovered, among which Be11Fe has a unique clathrate structure and is an electride. Surprisingly, we found that Fe unexpectedly acts as an anion in all known Be-Fe intermetallics, and its valence state can even reach -5, leading to the complete filling of its 3d orbitals. Most of these compounds exhibiting a gap or pseudogap at the Fermi level. Specifically, the band gap is determined as 0.22 eV and 0.85 eV for Be11Fe and Be4Fe at the level of single-shot GW, respectively. This is the first report of insulating phases in Be-based intermetallics. We also discovered that Be11Fe exhibits an impressive thermoelectric power factor of 178 ${\mu}W cm^{-1}K^2$ at room temperature, to our best knowledge, the highest among known semiconductors under ambient conditions, indicating its potential for waste heat harvesting and active cooling. These findings will deepen our understanding of Be-based and Fe-based compounds, and expand the application fields of Be-based alloys to a brand-new realm.</description>

      <title>Ultrafast Spectroscopy of Dirac Semimetal Cd3As2 under Pressure</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.15791</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.15791v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Topological properties of a three-dimensional Dirac semimetal Cd3As2, protected by crystal rotation and time-reversal symmetry, can be tuned with the application of pressure. Ultrafast spectroscopy is a unique tool to investigate the character and time evolution of electronic states, emphasizing the signatures of transition. We designed an experimental setup for in-situ pressure-dependent ultrafast optical pump optical probe spectroscopy of Cd3As2 using a symmetric diamond anvil cell. The fast relaxation processes show significant changes across pressure-induced phase transitions at PC1, approximately 3 GPa, and PC2, approximately 9 GPa. A new sub-picosecond time scale relaxation dynamics emerges beyond PC2. Theoretical calculations of differential reflectivity for both interband and intraband processes indicate that the negative (positive) differential reflectivity (Delta R/R) results from the interband (intraband) processes. The pressure-dependent behavior of relaxation dynamics amplitudes beyond PC1 emphasized the necessity of incorporating quadratic band opening in the calculations, explaining the transition of Cd3As2 from a Dirac semimetal to a semiconducting phase. The time evolution of differential reflectivity is calculated using the electronic temperature as a function of time, as provided by the two-temperature model, which fits the experimental data.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.15815v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we present a comprehensive analysis of the contact mechanics associated with a micron-sized sliding asperity, which plays a crucial role in the abrasive wear processes. Utilising nanoscratch testing, we experimentally investigate the deformation and employ High-Resolution Electron Backscatter Diffraction (HR-EBSD) to characterise the resulting strain fields at various locations in the residual nanoscratch. To simulate these experiments, we utilise a physically-based Crystal Plasticity Finite Element (CPFE) model, enabling a three-dimensional simulation that can accurately capture the measured elastic and plastic strain fields around the sliding contact. This knowledge serves as a foundation from which we may be able to discern the multi-physical processes governing micro-scale wear phenomena.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.15840v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The outcome of conventional topological materials prediction scheme could sensitively depend on first-principles calculations parameters. Symmetry, as a powerful tool, has been exploited to enhance the reliability of predictions. Here, we establish the relationship between the Wyckoff positions (WYPOs) and the phonon wavefunctions at each high-symmetry point (HSP) in all 230 space groups (SGs). Based on this, on one hand, we obtain a complete mapping from WYPO to the occurrence of emergent particles (EMPs) at each HSP in 230 SGs, and establish several rules of enforcing EMPs for phonons; on the other hand, we determine the contribution of the WYPO to the phonon angular momentum. Then we unambiguously identify 20,516,167 phonon EMPs in 111,872 materials in two databases. The purely symmetry-determined wavefunctions generalize the conventional Bloch theorem, could find a wide scope of application to physical properties related with basis functions of irreducible representations.</description>

      <title>Fourfold Anisotropic Magnetoresistance and Unconventional Critical Exponents in Twinned FePd$_2$Te$_2$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.15842</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.15842v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: As a special material symmetry operation, crystal twins usually influence physical properties. Here, detailed electrical transport and magnetic measurements were performed to reveal twinning effect on properties of van der Waals ferromagnet FePd$_2$Te$_2$. Orthorhombic crystal domains were observed in polarized optical microscopy and fixed $\pi$/2 angle between adjacent domains suggests a phase transition origin of the twins. FePd$_2$Te$_2$ exhibits fourfold in-plane anisotropic magnetoresistance. It is attributed to antiferromagnetic coupling component near atomically flat twin boundary and pseudo four-fold symmetry from perpendicular Fe chains. Intense magnetic domain motion is suggested by Hopkinson effect observed in magnetic susceptibility. A set of unusual critical exponents $\beta$ = 0.866, $\gamma$ = 1.043, $\delta$ = 2.20 cannot be classified in any universal class predicted by renormalized group. Deviation from standard model reflects the non-saturating magnetization and slow growth of spontaneous magnetization resulting from crystal domain walls. These results show that additional symmetry from twins and twin boundary have a significant effect on electrical transport and magnetic properties of FePd$_2$Te$_2$. There is much room to modulate physical properties of twinned van der Waals ferromagnets through twins.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.15918v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The paper gathers and unifies mechanical stability conditions for all symmetry classes of 3D and 2D materials under arbitrary load. The methodology is based on the spectral decomposition of the fourth-order stiffness tensors mapped to a second-order tensors using orthonormal (Mandel) notation, and the verification of the positivity of the so-called Kelvin moduli. An explicit set of stability conditions for 3D and 2D crystals of higher symmetry is also included, as well as a Mathematica notebook that allows mechanical stability analysis for crystals, stress-free and stressed, of arbitrary symmetry under arbitrary loads.</description>

      <title>Why is Grain Growth Not Curvature Flow?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.15983</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.15983v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Grain growth describes the increase in the mean grain size with time during the annealing of a polycrystal; it is widely accepted that this is driven by capillarity (surface tension). Although classically modeled and interpreted as mean curvature flow, a growing body of evidence has demonstrated that this is overly simplistic and inconsistent with experimental observations. Despite many proposals for the source of this failure, it remains a subject of ongoing debate. By considering the fundamental microscopic mechanism of grain boundary (GB) migration, we demonstrate that internal stress (shear coupling) associated with GB motion is the primary factor causing deviations in grain growth from mean curvature flow. This is achieved through the application of a two-dimensional bicrystallography-respecting continuum model for GB migration to grain growth, implemented in a diffuse-interface approach. These results are validated by comparison with atomistic simulations and the scatter in the curvature-velocity relationship is shown to be in excellent agreement with experimental results for grain growth in 3D polycrystals (not possible based on other proposed explanations). This work also demonstrates how to account for the mechanical effects that are integral to grain growth in crystalline solids.</description>

      <title>Octahedral Rotation Induced, Antiferroelectric-like Double Hysteresis in Strained Perovskites</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.16065</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.16065v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Antiferroelectrics, which host both polar and antipolar order parameters, are characterized by the double hysteresis loops which are advantageous for various applications such as high-density energy storage. In this study, we investigate the coupling between oxygen octahedral rotations and polarization in well-known perovskites, with a focus on SrTiO$_3$. Using first-principles calculations and symmetry-adapted Landau-Ginzburg-Devonshire theory, we construct an energy landscape to analyze how this coupling shapes polarization-voltage hysteresis behavior. We show that tuning the relative strength of polar and rotational instabilities by exploiting epitaxial strain and layering leads to nontrivial hysteresis behavior. Consequently, the rotation coupling with polarization leads to an expanded search space of materials exhibiting antiferroelectric-like double hysteresis.</description>

      <title>Electronic Trap Detection with Carrier-Resolved Photo-Hall Effect</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.16092</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.16092v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Electronic trap states are a critical yet unavoidable aspect of semiconductor devices, impacting performance of various electronic devices such as transistors, memory devices, solar cells, and LEDs. The density, energy level, and position of these trap states often enable or constrain device functionality, making their measurement crucial in materials science and device fabrication. Most methods for measuring trap states involve fabricating a junction, which can inadvertently introduce or alter traps, highlighting the need for alternative, less-invasive techniques. Here, we present a unique photo-Hall-based method to detect and characterize trap density and energy level while concurrently extracting key carrier properties, including mobility, photocarrier density, recombination lifetime, and diffusion length. This technique relies on analyzing the photo-Hall data in terms of "photo-Hall conductivity" vs. electrical conductivity under varying light intensities and temperatures. We show that the photo-Hall effect, in the presence of traps, follows an $\textit{astonishingly simple}$ relationship - $\textit{a hyperbola equation}$ - that reveals detailed insights into charge transport and trap occupation. We have successfully applied this technique to P and N-type silicon as a benchmark and to high-performance halide perovskite photovoltaic films. This technique substantially expands the capability of Hall effect-based measurements by integrating the effects of the four most common excitations in nature - electric field, magnetic field, photon, and phonon in solids - into a single equation and enabling unparalleled extraction of charge carrier and trap properties in semiconductors.</description>

      <title>Control of ferromagnetism of Vanadium Oxide thin films by oxidation states</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.16125</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.16125v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Vanadium oxide (VOx) is a material of significant interest due to its metal-insulator transition (MIT) properties as well as its diverse stable antiferromagnetism depending on the valence states of V and O with distinct MIT transitions and N\'eel temperatures. Although several studies reported the ferromagnetism in the VOx, it was mostly associated with impurities or defects, and pure VOx has rarely been reported as ferromagnetic. Our research presents clear evidence of ferromagnetism in the VOx thin films, exhibiting a saturation magnetization of approximately 14 kA/m at 300 K. We fabricated 20-nm thick VOx thin films via reactive sputtering from a metallic vanadium target in various oxygen atmosphere. The oxidation states of ferromagnetic VOx films show an ill-defined stoichiometry of V2O3+p, where p = 0.05, 0.23, 0.49, with predominantly disordered microstructures. Ferromagnetic nature of these VOx films is confirmed through a strong antiferromagnetic exchange coupling with the neighboring ferromagnetic layer in the VOx/Co bilayers, in which the spin configurations of Co layer is influenced strongly due to the additional anisotropy introduced by VOx layer. The present study highlights the potential of VOx as an emerging functional magnetic material with tunability by oxidation states for modern spintronic applications.</description>

      <title>Anomalous and parallel Hall effects in ferromagnetic Weyl semimetal Cr$_3$Te$_4$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.16184</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.16184v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recently, time-reversal symmetry broken magnetic Weyl semimetals (WSMs) have attracted extensive attention and have provided an intriguing platform for exploring fundamental physical phenomena. The study of chromium telluride-based systems has also drawn significant interest towards spintronics applications owing to their high Curie temperatures. Here, using \textit{ab initio} calculations, we propose the emergence of multiple Weyl points (WPs) near the Fermi level in such an intrinsic ferromagnetic system, Cr$_3$Te$_4$. The large, well-separated, nontrivial Fermi arcs and surface states, suggest that the WPs are highly robust and resilient to perturbations. A substantial Berry curvature contribution in the vicinity of the Fermi energy not only serves as the origin of large conventional anomalous Hall conductivity (AHC), but also produces unconventional parallel AHC in this material, owing to the low structural symmetry. In addition to the charge Hall conductivity, we also find significant anomalous Nernst conductivities originating from the Berry curvature. Alongside our theoretical predictions, we present complementary experimental results, including X-ray diffraction (XRD) analysis and an examination of the magnetic properties, which demonstrate a Curie temperature of 327 K. Our study advances the understanding of magnetic WSMs, and also encourages further studies in the context of topological properties of our proposed material.</description>

      <title>Typical altermagnetism with huge nonrelativistic spin-split and flat band in the bulk CoF$_2$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.16188</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.16188v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recently, a third phase named altermagnet, has been introduced to describe a special magnetic state and some materials are classified as altermagnets. Here, our first principles calculations indicate that the bulk CoF$_2$ is an altermagnet with a huge spin-split and flat bands near the Fermi energy. By comparing the results with and without spin-orbit coupling, it can be shown that the huge spin splitting is not caused by relativistic effects but rather by a special symmetry. There are also flat bands near the Fermi energy which can be adjusted by changing the direction of the magnetic moment. From the band structure, we obtain a spin-resolved effective low-energy model that describes a quasi-two-dimensional hole gas with two independent spin components, leading to exotic transport phenomena that are distinct from those in conventional two-dimensional or bulk materials. Therefore, the bulk CoF$_2$ is a typical altermagnet with a huge nonrelativistic spin-split and flat bands which deserves further study for the potential spintronics and electronics applications.</description>

      <title>ToMSGKpoint: A user-friendly package for computing symmetry transformation properties of electronic eigenstates of nonmagnetic and magnetic crystalline materials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.16190</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.16190v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The calculation of (co)irreducible representations of energy bands at high-symmetry points (HSPs) is essential for high-throughput research on topological materials based on symmetry-indicators or topological quantum chemistry. However, existing computational packages usually require transforming crystal structures into specific conventions, thus hindering extensive application, especially to materials whose symmetries are yet to be identified. To address this issue, we developed a Mathematica package, \texttt{ToMSGKpoint}, capable of determining the little groups and (co)irreducible representations of little groups of HSPs, high-symmetry lines (HSLs), and high-symmetry planes (HSPLs) for any nonmagnetic and magnetic crystalline materials in two and three dimensions, with or without considering spin-orbit coupling. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first package to achieve such functionality. The package also provides magnetic space group operations, supports the analysis of (co)irreducible representations of energy bands at HSPs, HSLs, and HSPLs using electronic wavefunctions obtained from \textit{ab initio} calculations interfaced with VASP. Designed for user convenience, the package generates results in a few simple steps and presents all relevant information in clear tabular format. Its versatility is demonstrated through applications to nonmagnetic topological insulator Bi$_2$Se$_3$ and Dirac semimetal Na$_3$Bi, as well as the antiferromagnetic topological material MnBi$_2$Te$_4$. Suitable for any crystal structure, this package can be conveniently applied in a streamlined study once magnetic space group varies with various symmetry-breakings caused by phase transitions.</description>

      <title>Work-function and structures of (100), (111) and (101) Au surfaces with/without oxygen</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.16208</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.16208v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: (100), (101), and (111) Au surfaces with chemisorbed oxygen of varying coverages are studied using density and hybrid functional theories and experiments. This clarifies the work function (f), surface structures, stability, and density of states. f of the (100), (101), and (111) Au surfaces calculated using the hybrid functional is 5.06-5.23 eV, and consistent with the reported experimental f of polycrystalline Au films (5.1 +- 0.1 eV). The hybrid functional calculations on f at (100) and (101) AuO surfaces agree with the experimental f. However, in the reported and present experiments, the difference in f between the Au and AuO surfaces (Df) is 0.8-0.9 eV. The reported theoretical Df at (111) surface (3 eV) completely contradicts this value, which has been unresolved. We find that when O atoms are at (111) surface and subsurface, the theoretical Df at (111) agrees with experimental Df (0.8-0.9 eV). This state is considered to correspond to the experiments, because the oxygen-chemisorption is more stable in this state than when O atoms are at (111) surface only. This property is unique to the (111) surface. The prediction of chemisorbed-oxygen-induced disorders that are experimentally observed provides more evidence for the veracity of these calculations.</description>

Many of the most interesting behaviours emerge at small twist angles, where the materials reconstruct to form areas of perfectly stacked crystal separated by partial dislocations. However, understanding the properties of these systems is often impossible without correlative imaging of their local reconstructed domain architecture, which exhibits random variations due to disorder and contamination. Here we demonstrate a simple and widely accessible route to visualise domains in as-produced twisted transition metal dichalcogenide (TMD) heterostructures using electron channelling contrast imaging (ECCI) in the scanning electron microscope (SEM). This non-destructive approach is compatible with conventional substrates and allows domains to be visualised even when sealed beneath an encapsulation layer. Complementary theoretical calculations reveal how a combination of elastic and inelastic scattering leads to contrast inversions at specified detector scattering angles and sample tilts. We demonstrate that optimal domain contrast is therefore achieved by maximising signal collection while avoiding contrast inversion conditions.</description>

      <title>Giant Electron-Phonon Coupling Induced Band-Gap Renormalization in Anharmonic Silver Chalcohalide Antiperovskites</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.16279</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.16279v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Silver chalcohalide antiperovskites (CAP), Ag$_{3}$XY (X = S, Se; Y = Br, I), are a family of highly anharmonic inorganic compounds with great potential for energy applications. However, a substantial and unresolved discrepancy exists between the optoelectronic properties predicted by theoretical first-principles methods and those measured experimentally at room temperature, hindering the fundamental understanding and rational engineering of CAP. In this work, we employ density functional theory, tight-binding calculations, and anharmonic Fr\"ohlich theory to investigate the optoelectronic properties of CAP at finite temperatures. Near room temperature, we observe a giant band-gap ($E_{g}$) reduction of approximately $20$-$60$\% relative to the value calculated at $T = 0$ K, bringing the estimated $E_{g}$ into excellent agreement with experimental measurements. This relative $T$-induced band-gap renormalization is roughly twice the largest value previously reported in the literature for similar temperature ranges. Low-energy optical polar phonon modes, which break inversion symmetry and promote the overlap between silver and chalcogen $s$ electronic orbitals in the conduction band, are identified as the primary contributors to this giant $E_{g}$ reduction. Furthermore, when considering temperature effects, the optical absorption coefficient of CAP increases by nearly an order of magnitude for visible light frequencies. These insights not only bridge a crucial gap between theory and experiment but also open pathways for future technologies where temperature, electric fields, or light dynamically tailor optoelectronic behavior, positioning CAP as a versatile platform for next-generation energy applications.</description>

      <title>Sub-40mV Sigma-VTH IGZO nFETs in 300mm Fab</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.16299</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.16299v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Back and double gate IGZO nFETs have been demonstrated down to 120nm and 70nm respectively leveraging 300mm fab processing. While the passivation of oxygen vacancies in IGZO is challenging with an integration of front side gate, a scaled back gated flow has been optimized by multiplying design of experiments around contacts and material engineering. We then successfully demonstrated sub-40mV $\sigma$(VTH_ON) in scaled IGZO nFETs. Regarding the performance and the VTH_ON control, a new IGZO phase is also reported. A model of dopants location is proposed to better explain the experimental results reported in literature.</description>

      <title>Temperature Control of Spin-Wave Spectra in Continuously Graded Epitaxial Pd-Fe Alloy Films</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.16323</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.16323v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Continuously graded ferromagnetic thin films represent a new class of magnonic materials, where a spin-wave resonance spectrum can be tuned in resonance frequencies/fields, number of modes and even dispersion law by the magnetic properties profiling across the film thickness. In the paper, we demonstrate that temperature is another degree of freedom controlling the spin-wave spectra in graded magnetic materials. We show that temperature affects the spectrum not only in a trivial way via the temperature dependence of magnetization and related quantities, but rather through modification of magnetic structure of a film due to the Curie temperature being crossed by fractions of its thickness. The profile that is continuous at lower temperatures may become discontinuous at higher temperatures. To demonstrate this, four 200-nm thick vertically graded epitaxial Pd1-xFex films were synthesized using molecular beam epitaxy technique, in particular, two with the linear (2-10 at.% and 12-18 at.% range of the iron content), one with the sine and one with the cosine (both with the 2-10 at.% range of the iron content) distribution profiles. The resonance spectra of standing spin waves were studied by the cavity ferromagnetic resonance at 9.4 GHz in the temperature range of 20-300 K. Versatile spin-wave excitation patterns were obtained, and drastic evolution of their excitation energies, and number of modes with temperature was observed. Based on the modeling, temperature dependences of the spin-wave stiffness D and magnitudes of the interface $\alpha_{inter}$ and surface $\alpha_{surf}$ pinning constants were obtained. Our study shows that in addition to a continuous grading of magnetic properties of thin films, temperature provides another powerful and well elaborated tool for modifying the magnetic grading profile and thus, flexile tuning the spectrum of spin-wave excitations.</description>

      <title>Hydrated Silicate Ionic Liquids: Ionic Liquids for Silicate Material Synthesis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.16335</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.16335v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The development of Hydrated Silicate Ionic Liquids, which are hypo-hydrated room temperature melts of alkali silicates, has created new opportunities for synthesizing porous silicates. Their discovery also allows to reinterpret the role of an ionic liquid for zeolite synthesis and offer unique opportunities to study crystallization in situ. The reduced complexity of HSILs renders them excellent model systems yielding a large space of zeolite phases and framework compositions, and even allowing computer simulations. This work summarizes the impact of alkalinity, hydration, and cation type on silicate speciation and provides physicochemical data spanning relevant temperatures and compositions for zeolite formation. The data is meant as a reference point to further accommodate and verify (computational) models.</description>

      <title>On the effects of material strength in dynamic fracture: A phase-field study</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.16393</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.16393v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Over the past seven years, full-field analyses of a wide range of classical as well as modern quasi-static fracture experiments on nominally elastic brittle materials -- ranging from hard ceramics to soft elastomers -- have repeatedly identified the material strength surface as one of the key material properties that governs not only the nucleation of cracks, but also their propagation. Central to these analyses are the results generated by the Griffith phase-field fracture theory with material strength introduced in [21,23,20]. The first of two objectives of this paper is to extend this theory to account for inertia, this for the basic case of isotropic linear elastic brittle materials. From an applications point of view, the theory amounts to solving an initial-boundary-value problem comprised of a hyperbolic PDE coupled with an elliptic PDE for the displacement field $\mathbf{u}(\mathbf{X},t)$ and the phase field $d(\mathbf{X},t)$. A robust scheme is presented to generate solutions for these equations that is based on an adaptive finite-element discretization of space and an implicit finite-difference discretization of time. %At every time increment $t_m$, the resulting discretized equations are solved separately in a staggered manner for $\mathbf{u}(\mathbf{X},t_m)$ and $d(\mathbf{X},t_m)$ by means of Newton-Raphson schemes. The second objective is to illustrate the descriptive and predictive capabilities of the proposed theory via simulations of benchmark problems and experiments. These include problems involving fracture nucleation from large pre-existing cracks, such as the classical Kalthoff-Winkler experiments, as well as problems involving fracture nucleation within the bulk, such as the dynamic Brazilian fracture experiments.</description>

      <title>Switchable Skyrmion-Antiskyrmion Tubes in Rhombohedral BaTiO$_\mathrm{3}$ and Related Materials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.16395</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.16395v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Skyrmions are stable topological textures that have garnered substantial attention within the ferroelectric community for their exotic functional properties. While previous studies have questioned the feasibility of [001]$_{\text{pc}}$ skyrmion tubes in rhombohedral BaTiO$_3$ due to the high energy cost of 180$^\circ$ domain walls, we demonstrate here their stabilization with topological charges of $\mathcal{Q} = \pm 1$ from density functional theory and second-principles calculations. By enabling extensive vortex and antivortex polarization configurations, we overcome the expected prohibitive energetic barriers while preserving the topological nature of the structures. Notably, we extend these findings to demonstrate the appearance of skyrmion and antiskyrmion tubes in other related materials, highlighting their broader relevance. Furthermore, our computational experiments indicate that these structures can be directly stabilized and reversibly switched by applied electric fields, establishing a straightforward route for their practical realization and functional control in nanoelectronic devices.</description>

      <title>A Multi-agent Framework for Materials Laws Discovery</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.16416v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Uncovering the underlying laws governing correlations between different materials properties, and the structure-composition-property relationship, is essential for advancing materials theory and enabling efficient materials design. With recent advances in artificial intelligence (AI), particularly in large language models (LLMs), symbolic regression has emerged as a powerful method for deriving explicit formulas for materials laws. LLMs, with their pre-trained, cross-disciplinary knowledge, present a promising direction in "AI for Materials". In this work, we introduce a multi-agent framework based on LLMs specifically designed for symbolic regression in materials science. We demonstrate the effectiveness of the framework using the glass-forming ability (GFA) of metallic glasses as a case study, employing three characteristic temperatures as independent variables. Our framework derived an interpretable formula to describe GFA, achieving a correlation coefficient of up to 0.948 with low formula complexity. This approach outperforms standard packages such as GPlearn and demonstrates a ~30% improvement over random generation methods, owing to integrated memory and reflection mechanisms. The proposed framework can be extended to discover laws in various materials applications, supporting new materials design and enhancing the interpretation of experimental and simulation data.</description>

      <title>Advancing Electrochemical CO$_2$ Capture with Redox-Active Metal-Organic Frameworks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.16444</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.16444v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Addressing climate change calls for action to control CO$_2$ pollution. Direct air and ocean capture offer a solution to this challenge. Making carbon capture competitive with alternatives, such as forestation and mineralisation, requires fundamentally novel approaches and ideas. One such approach is electrosorption, which is currently limited by the availability of suitable electrosorbents. In this work, we introduce a metal-organic copper-2,3,6,7,10,11-hexahydroxytriphenylene (Cu$_3$(HHTP)$_2$) metal-organic framework (MOF) that can act as electrosorbent for CO$_2$ capture, thereby expanding the palette of materials that can be used for this process. Cu$_3$(HHTP)$_2$ is the first MOF to switch its ability to capture and release CO$_2$ in aqueous electrolytes. By using cyclic voltammetry (CV) and differential electrochemical mass spectrometry (DEMS), we demonstrate reversible CO$_2$ electrosorption. Based on density functional theory (DFT) calculations, we provide atomistic insights into the mechanism of electrosorption and conclude that efficient CO$_2$ capture is facilitated by a combination of redox-active copper and aromatic HHTP ligand within Cu3(HHTP)2. By showcasing the applicability of Cu$_3$(HHTP)$_2$ -- with a CO$_2$ capacity of 2 mmol g$^{-1}$ and an adsorption enthalpy of -20 kJ mol$^{-1}$ - this study encourages further exploration of conductive redox-active MOFs in the search for superior CO$_2$ electrosorbents.</description>

      <title>Lattice dynamics and phonon dispersion of van der Waals layered ferromagnet Fe3GaTe2</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.16463</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.16463v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Van der Waals (vdW) layered ferromagnet Fe3GaTe2 shows great potential in two-dimensional spintronic application due to its robust room-temperature ferromagnetism and large perpendicular magnetic anisotropy. Despite the tremendous progress in the spintronic and electronic studies of Fe3GaTe2, much less effort has been spent on the understanding of lattice dynamics and its possible interaction with spintronic and electronic degrees of freedom in Fe3GaTe2. In this work, by combining Raman spectroscopic data in a wide range of pressure (atmospheric pressure~19.5 GPa) and temperature (80 K~690 K) with first-principles calculation results, we systematically studied the lattice dynamics and phonon dispersion of Fe3GaTe2. Our results show that the phonon energies of Fe3GaTe2 located at 126.0 cm-1 and 143.5 cm-1 originate from the E_2g^2 and A_1g^1 vibration modes, respectively, and the nature of the E_2g^2 mode is anharmonic while that of the A_1g^1 mode is quasi-harmonic. Furthermore, the spin-phonon coupling in Fe3GaTe2 is discovered by identifying the anomalies in the Raman data right below the Curie temperature of 360 K, in which the phonon energies and the full widths at half maximum of the E_2g^2 mode clearly deviate from the classical anharmonic model. Our findings are valuable for fundamental studies and potential applications of vdW Fe3GaTe2-based materials and devices under variable temperature and pressure conditions.</description>

      <title>Minimal Acquisition Time Polarized Neutron Imaging of Current Induced Magnetic Fields in Superconducting Multifilamentary YBCO Tape</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.16473</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.16473v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper we showcase the strengths of polarized neutron imaging as a magnetic imaging technique through a case study on field-cooled multifilamentary YBCO tape carrying a transport current while containing a trapped magnetic field. The measurements were done at J-PARC's RADEN beamline, measuring a radiograph of a single polarization component, to showcase the analysis potential with minimal acquisition time.
  Regions of internal damage are easily and accurately identified as the technique probes the internal magnetic field of the sample, thereby avoiding surface-smearing effects. Quantitative measurements of the integrated field strength in various regions are acquired using time-of-flight information. Finally, we estimate the strength of the screening currents in the superconductor during the experiment by simulating an experiment with a model sample and comparing it to the experimental data. With this, we show that polarized neutron imaging is not only a useful tool for investigating magnetic structures but also for investigating samples carrying currents.</description>

      <title>Kinetic surface model in FESTIM: Verification and Validation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.16474</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.16474v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The open-source code FESTIM (Finite Element Simulation of Tritium In Materials) is a powerful user-friendly software for hydrogen transport simulations. Up to now, it was capable of addressing various hydrogen transport problems with surface processes dependent on the concentration of solute species. However, the kinetics of surface hydrogen concentration should be considered under certain conditions. The recent 1.3 release of FESTIM introduced a new kinetic surface model, implemented in a flexible way for various applications. The correctness of the implementation is first proven using the method of manufactured solutions. Then, reliability of the model is demonstrated by reproducing four experimental cases on dynamics of hydrogen isotope retention in different materials. An additional cross-code comparison with two other simulation packages, MHIMS and TESSIM-X, shows an excellent agreement and strengthens the validity of the model.</description>

      <title>Graph Transformer Networks for Accurate Band Structure Prediction: An End-to-End Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.16483</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.16483v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Predicting electronic band structures from crystal structures is crucial for understanding structure-property correlations in materials science. First-principles approaches are accurate but computationally intensive. Recent years, machine learning (ML) has been extensively applied to this field, while existing ML models predominantly focus on band gap predictions or indirect band structure estimation via solving predicted Hamiltonians. An end-to-end model to predict band structure accurately and efficiently is still lacking. Here, we introduce a graph Transformer-based end-to-end approach that directly predicts band structures from crystal structures with high accuracy. Our method leverages the continuity of the k-path and treat continuous bands as a sequence. We demonstrate that our model not only provides accurate band structure predictions but also can derive other properties (such as band gap, band center, and band dispersion) with high accuracy. We verify the model performance on large and diverse datasets.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.16497v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Twistronics has received much attention as a new method to manipulate the properties of 2D van der Waals structures by introducing moir\'e patterns through a relative rotation between two layers. Here we begin a theoretical exploration of twistronics beyond the realm of van der Waals materials by developing a first-principles description of the electronic structure and interlayer interactions of ultrathin perovskite bilayers. We construct both an ab initio tight-binding model as well as a minimal 3-band effective model for the valence bands of monolayers and bilayers of oxides derived from the Ruddlesden-Popper phase of perovskites, which is amenable to thin-layer formation. We illustrate the approach with the specific example of Sr$_2$TiO$_4$ layers but also provide model parameters for Ca$_2$TiO$_4$ and Ba$_2$TiO$_4$ .</description>

      <title>Characterization of Silicon Carbide Biphenylene Network through G0W0-BSE Calculations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.16520</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.16520v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Two-dimensional silicon carbide stands out among 2D materials, primarily due to its notable band gap, unlike its carbon-based counterparts. However, the binary nature and non-layered structure of bulk SiC present challenges in fabricating its 2D counterpart. Recent advancements in technology have led to the successful synthesis of atomically thin, large-scale epitaxial monolayers of hexagonal-SiC and Si9C15 , marking a significant milestone in semiconductor research. Inspired by these advancements, we have computationally designed another stable phase of 2D-SiC in the popular biphenylene network, termed SiC-biphenylene. This structure is characterized by interconnected polygons of octagons, hexagons, and tetragons arranged periodically. The dynamical and thermal stability has been confirmed through ab initio phonon dispersion and molecular dynamics simulations. The structure demonstrates a high melting point of approximately 3475 K and a direct band gap of 2.16 eV using the HSE06 functional. Upon considering many-body effects, the quasiparticle band gap widens to 2.89 eV at the G0W0 level, indicating pronounced electron correlation effects within the material. The optical spectrum obtained from solving the Bethe-Salpeter equation (G0W0+BSE) identifies the first optically active exciton peak at 2.07 eV, corresponding to a strongly bound exciton with a binding energy of 0.82 eV. Furthermore, the investigation into stable bilayer structures across various stacking configurations highlights the impact of stacking patterns on excitonic binding energies. Our investigation extends to identifying the stable bulk phase of SiC-biphenylene, revealing lower self-energy corrections compared to monolayer and bilayer structures, attributed to increased electron delocalization in bulk structures.</description>

      <title>Optical response of WSe$_2$-based vertical tunneling junction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.16576</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.16576v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Layered materials have attracted significant interest because of their unique properties. Van der Waals heterostructures based on transition-metal dichalcogenides have been extensively studied because of potential optoelectronic applications. We investigate the optical response of a light-emitting tunneling structure based on a WSe\textsubscript{2} monolayer as an active emission material using the photoluminescence (PL) and electroluminescence (EL) experiments performed at low temperature of 5~K. We found that the application of the bias voltage allows us to change both a sign and a value of free carriers concentrations. Consequently, we address the several excitonic complexes emerging in PL spectra under applied bias voltage. The EL signal was also detected and ascribed to the emission in a high-carrier-concentration regime. The results show that the excitation mechanisms in the PL and EL are different, resulting in various emissions in both types of experimental techniques.</description>

      <title>An FFT based chemo-mechanical framework with fracture: application to mesoscopic electrode degradation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.16583</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.16583v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: An FFT based method is proposed to simulate chemo-mechanical problems at the microscale including fracture, specially suited to predict crack formation during the intercalation process in batteries. The method involves three fields fully coupled, concentration, deformation gradient and damage. The mechanical problem is set in a finite strain framework and solved using Fourier Galerkin for non-linear problems in finite strains. The damage is modeled with Phase Field Fracture using a stress driving force. This problem is solved in Fourier space using conjugate gradient with an ad-hoc preconditioner. The chemical problem is modeled with the second Fick's law and physically based chemical potentials, is integrated using backward Euler and is solved by Newton-Raphson combined with a conjugate gradient solver. Buffer layers are introduced to break the periodicity and emulate Neumann boundary conditions for incoming mass flux. The framework is validated against Finite Elements the results of both methods are very close in all the cases. Finally, the framework is used to simulate the fracture of active particles of graphite during ion intercalation. The method is able to solve large problems at a reduced computational cost and reproduces the shape of the cracks observed in real particles.</description>

      <title>Thermoelastic Properties Of The Ti2AlC MAX Phase: An Ab Initio Study</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.16649</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.16649v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The MAX phases are in use at an industrial scale in the transportation, armour and furnace development sectors, among others. However, data on the finite temperature dynamical properties of these materials under varying conditions of temperature and pressure are rare or unavailable. This study reports on the dynamical properties of the elastic constants and moduli under these conditions, obtained from first principle calculations. Both static and dynamical results are presented and discussed. It is observed from the dynamical results, that the elastic moduli are degraded, specifically, the bulk and shear moduli show reduction ranging from 15 - 29% and 13 - 31%, respectively, between pressures of 10-30 GPa and in the temperature range of 300 - 1200 K.Such data is useful as part of decision support tools that can inform applications as well as the limitations of use.</description>

      <title>Al0.68Sc0.32N/SiC based metal-ferroelectric-semiconductor capacitors operating up to 900 C</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.16652v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Ferroelectric (FE)-based devices show great promise for non-volatile memory applications, yet few demonstrate reliable operation at elevated temperatures. In this work, we fabricated and characterized metal ferroelectric semiconductor capacitors integrating Aluminum Scandium Nitride onto Silicon Carbide, a prospective high temperature semiconductor for logic operations in extreme environments. The resultant Ni/Al0.68Sc0.32N/4H-SiC structure was evaluated for non-volatile memory performance from room temperature to high-temperature conditions. The 30-nm thick Al0.68Sc0.32N/SiC-based ferroelectric capacitors demonstrated ferroelectric switching at 900 C. The coercive field of the FE layer decreased linearly from -6.4/+11.9 MV cm-1 at room temperature to -3.1/+7.8 MV cm-1 at 800 C. Using positive-up negative-down measurements, we characterized the temperature dependence of remanent polarization. At 600 C, the devices achieved remarkable reliability, demonstrating endurance of ~2000 cycles and retention exceeding 100 hours with negligible polarization loss. Further reliability measurements extended to 800 C with 10,000 secs retention and &gt; 300 endurance cycles, establish these devices as promising candidates for high-temperature memory applications.</description>

      <title>Spontaneous Vibrations and Stochastic Resonance of Short Oligomeric Springs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.06016</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.06016v2 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: There is growing interest in molecular structures that exhibit dynamics similar to bistable mechanical systems. These structures have the potential to be used as nanodevices with two distinct states. Particularly intriguing are structures that display spontaneous vibrations and stochastic resonance. Previously, through molecular dynamics simulations, it was discovered that short pyridine-furan springs, when subjected to force loading, exhibit the bistable dynamics of a Duffing oscillator. In this study, we extend these simulations to include short pyridine-pyrrole and pyridine-furan springs in a hydrophobic solvent. Our findings demonstrate that these systems also display the bistable dynamics of a Duffing oscillator, accompanied by spontaneous vibrations and stochastic resonance activated by thermal noise.</description>

      <title>(Electro)catalytic oxidation of sulfide and recovery of elemental sulfur from sulfide-laden streams</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.15162</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.15162v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: MnxOy coated over TiO2 nanotube array substrate was doped with Mo and polyaniline (PANI) and applied for electrochemical desulfurization of concentrated sulfide (HS) solutions at basic pH, typical of biogas scrubbing solutions and industrial wastewater. Mo and PANI co-dopants significantly enhanced the anode activity towards sulfide oxidation and ensured its complete stability even in highly corrosive sulfide solutions (e.g., 200 mM HS). This was due to the increased electrochemically active surface area, improved coating conductivity and reduced charge transfer resistance. The (electro)catalytic oxidation of HS- demonstrated robust performance with very limited impact of different operational parameters (e.g., dissolved oxygen, anode potential, HS concentration). Due to the formation of elemental sulfur (S0) layer at the anode surface at basic pH, longer term anode usage requires its periodic removal. Chemical dissolution of S0 with toluene allows its rapid removal without affecting the anode activity, and easy recrystallization and recovery of pure sulfur.</description>

      <title>Reflections from the 2024 Large Language Model (LLM) Hackathon for Applications in Materials Science and Chemistry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.15221</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.15221v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Here, we present the outcomes from the second Large Language Model (LLM) Hackathon for Applications in Materials Science and Chemistry, which engaged participants across global hybrid locations, resulting in 34 team submissions. The submissions spanned seven key application areas and demonstrated the diverse utility of LLMs for applications in (1) molecular and material property prediction; (2) molecular and material design; (3) automation and novel interfaces; (4) scientific communication and education; (5) research data management and automation; (6) hypothesis generation and evaluation; and (7) knowledge extraction and reasoning from scientific literature. Each team submission is presented in a summary table with links to the code and as brief papers in the appendix. Beyond team results, we discuss the hackathon event and its hybrid format, which included physical hubs in Toronto, Montreal, San Francisco, Berlin, Lausanne, and Tokyo, alongside a global online hub to enable local and virtual collaboration. Overall, the event highlighted significant improvements in LLM capabilities since the previous year's hackathon, suggesting continued expansion of LLMs for applications in materials science and chemistry research. These outcomes demonstrate the dual utility of LLMs as both multipurpose models for diverse machine learning tasks and platforms for rapid prototyping custom applications in scientific research.</description>

      <title>Continuous Design and Reprogramming of Totimorphic Structures for Space Applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.15266</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.15266v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recently, a class of mechanical lattices with reconfigurable, zero-stiffness structures has been proposed, called Totimorphic structures. In this work, we introduce a computational framework that allows continuous reprogramming of a Totimorphic lattice's effective properties, such as mechanical and optical properties, via continuous geometric changes alone. Our approach is differentiable and guarantees valid Totimorphic lattice configurations throughout the optimisation process, thus providing not only specific configurations with desired properties but also trajectories through configuration space connecting them. It enables re-programmable structures where actuators are controlled via automatic differentiation on an objective-dependent cost function, altering the lattice structure at all times to achieve a given objective - which is interchangeable to achieve different functionalities. Our main interest lies in deep space applications where harsh, extreme, and resource-constrained environments demand solutions that offer flexibility, resource efficiency, and autonomy. We illustrate our framework through two proofs of concept: a re-programmable metamaterial as well as a space telescope mirror with adjustable focal length, both made from Totimorphic structures. The introduced framework is easily adjustable to a variety of Totimorphic designs and objectives, providing a light-weight model for endowing physical prototypes of Totimorphic structures with autonomous self-configuration and self-repair capabilities.</description>

      <title>Unconventional gapping behavior in a kagome superconductor</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.15333</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.15333v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Determining the types of superconducting order in quantum materials is a challenge, especially when multiple degrees of freedom, such as bands or orbitals, contribute to the fermiology and when superconductivity competes, intertwines, or coexists with other symmetry-breaking orders. Here, we study the Kagome-lattice superconductor CsV3Sb5, in which multiband superconductivity coexists with a charge order that substantially reduces the compound's space group symmetries. Through a combination of thermodynamic as well as electrical and thermal transport measurements, we uncover two superconducting regimes with distinct transport and thermodynamic characteristics, while finding no evidence for a phase transition separating them. Thermodynamic measurements reveal substantial quasiparticle weight in a high-temperature regime. At lower temperatures, this weight is removed via the formation of a second gap. The two regimes are sharply distinguished by a pronounced enhancement of the upper critical field at low temperatures and by a switch in the anisotropy of the longitudinal thermal conductivity as a function of in-plane magnetic field orientation. We argue that the band with a gap opening at lower temperatures continues to host low-energy quasiparticles, possibly due to a nodal structure of the gap. Taken together, our results present evidence for band-selective superconductivity with remarkable decoupling of the (two) superconducting gaps. The commonly employed multiband scenario, whereby superconductivity emerges in a primary band and is then induced in other bands appears to fail in this unconventional kagome superconductor. Instead, band-selective superconducting pairing is a paradigm that seems to unify seemingly contradicting results in this intensely studied family of materials and beyond.</description>

Abstract: We study theoretically the neutral and charged excitons in two-dimensional semiconductors with anisotropic dispersion of charge carriers. Such a situation is realized in CrSBr-based van der Waals heterostructures. We calculate the binding energies of excitons and trions and explore their dependence on the mass ratio, dielectric screening, and interlayer distance in bilayer structures. We also address the correlations between the excitons and the Fermi sea of resident electrons and the effects of exciton-light coupling, including the radiative decay and long-range electron-hole interaction. The estimates for CrSBr bilayers are in reasonable agreement with recent experiments.</description>

      <title>Itinerant electron metamagnetism for lattices with van Hove density-of-states singularities near the Fermi level</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.15748</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.15748v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Itinerant-electron metamagnetism is investigated within the Hubbard model for various lattices having van Hove singularities (vHS) in the electronic spectrum: face-centered cubic and orthorhombic lattices. The remarkable itinerant-electron metamagnetic transition occurs provided that the Fermi level is in the region with a strong positive curvature of the density of electron states typically positioned between two close van Hove singularities. Orthorhombic distortion of tetragonal lattice is a promising mechanism for generating two closely split vHS with strong density-of-states curvature between them. A phase diagram in terms of electron filling and Hubbard interaction parameter is presented, which shows the paramagnetic-metamagnetic-ferromagnetic phase transition and regions of saturated and non-saturated magnetism. The standard Landau theory expansion based on electron density of states in the vicinity of the Fermi level is demonstrated to be insufficient to describe the whole magnetic phase diagram including the itinerant-electron metamagnetic transition.</description>

Abstract: The modulation of channel conductance in field-effect transistors (FETs) via metal-oxide-semiconductor (MOS) structures has revolutionized information processing and storage. However, the limitations of silicon-based FETs in electrical switching have driven the search for new materials capable of overcoming these constraints. Electrostatic gating of competing electronic phases in a Mott material near its metal to insulator transition (MIT) offers prospects of substantial modulation of the free carriers and electrical resistivity through small changes in band filling. While electrostatic control of the MIT has been previously reported, the advancement of Mott materials towards novel Mott transistors requires the realization of their charge gain prospects in a solid-state device. In this study, we present gate-control of electron correlation using a solid-state device utilizing the oxide Mott system $La_{1-x}Sr_xVO_3$ as a correlated FET channel. We report on a gate resistance response that cannot be explained in a purely electrostatic framework, suggesting at least $\times100$ charge gain originating from the correlated behavior. These preliminary results pave the way towards the development of highly efficient, low-power electronic devices that could surpass the performance bottlenecks of conventional FETs by leveraging the electronic phase transitions of correlated electron systems.</description>

      <title>A review of geometric modeling methods in microstructure design and manufacturing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.15833</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.15833v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Microstructures, characterized by intricate structures at the microscopic scale, hold the promise of important disruptions in the field of mechanical engineering due to the superior mechanical properties they offer. One fundamental technique of microstructure design and manufacturing is geometric modeling, which generates the 3D computer models required to run high-level procedures such as simulation, optimization, and process planning. There is, however, a lack of comprehensive discussions on this body of knowledge. The goal of this paper is to compile existing microstructure modeling methods and clarify the challenges, progress, and limitations of current research. It also concludes with future research directions that may improve and/or complement current methods, such as compressive and generative microstructure representations. By doing so, the paper sheds light on what has already been made possible for microstructure modeling, what developments can be expected in the near future, and which topics remain problematic.</description>

      <title>Intertwined topological phases in TaAs2 nanowires with giant magnetoresistance and quantum coherent surface transport</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.15974</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.15974v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Nanowires (NWs) of topological materials are emerging as an exciting platform to probe and engineer new quantum phenomena that are hard to access in bulk phase. Their quasi-one-dimensional geometry and large surface-to-bulk ratio unlock new expressions of topology and highlight surface states. TaAs2, a compensated semimetal, is a topologically rich material harboring nodal-line, weak topological insulator (WTI), C2-protected topological crystalline insulator, and Zeeman field-induced Weyl semimetal phases. We report the synthesis of TaAs2 NWs in situ encapsulated in a dielectric SiO2 shell, which enabled us to probe rich magnetotransport phenomena, including metal-to-insulator transition and strong signatures of topologically non-trivial transport at remarkably high temperatures, direction-dependent giant positive and negative magnetoresistance, and a double pattern of Aharonov-Bohm oscillations, demonstrating coherent surface transport consistent with the two Dirac cones of a WTI surface. The coexistence and susceptibility of topological phases to external stimuli have potential applications in spintronics and nanoscale quantum technology.</description>

      <title>Electrodynamics of Photonic Temporal Interfaces</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.15984v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Exotic forms of wave control have been emerging by engineering matter in space and time. In this framework, temporal photonic interfaces, i.e., abrupt changes in the electromagnetic properties of a material, have been shown to induce temporal scattering phenomena dual to spatial reflection and refraction, at the basis of photonic time crystals and space-time metamaterials. Despite decades-old theoretical studies on these topics, and recent experimental demonstrations, the careful modeling of these phenomena has been lagging behind. Here, we develop from first principles a rigorous model of the electrodynamics of temporal photonic interfaces, highlighting the crucial role of the mechanisms driving time variations. We demonstrate that the boundary conditions and conservation laws associated with temporal scattering may substantially deviate from those commonly employed in the literature, based on their microscopic implementation. Our results open new vistas for both fundamental investigations over light-matter interactions in time-varying structures and for the prospect of their future implementations and applications in optics and photonics.</description>

      <title>Spin-dependent photovoltage in graphene/MoS2-based field-effect transistors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.16328</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.16328v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: It has recently been shown that Terahertz sensors can effectively detect the spin resonances of Dirac fermions in graphene. The associated photovoltaic measurement technique allows for the investigation of the intrinsic spin-orbit coupling in graphene as well as its topological properties from microwave to Terahertz frequencies. In this work, using graphene/MoS2-based Field-Effect Transistors, we observed a magnetic resonance photovoltage signal in the Gigahertz range that is independent of the gate bias. The dispersion of the associated spin-flip transitions remains intriguingly unaffected by the MoS2 layer. In parallel, the spin-related signal consistently appears as a drop in photovoltage, regardless of the signal's polarity or origin, whether it arises from plasma wave rectification or thermoelectric effects. This behavior is interpreted as a decrease in the system's spin polarization due to spin-dependent recombination or scattering of photocarriers. Understanding the various photovoltaic signals in highly sensitive Gigahertz/Terahertz sensors paves the way for exploring spin-dependent mechanisms in two-dimensional quantum materials, influenced by proximity effects such as spin-orbit coupling, topology, and magnetism.</description>

      <title>Origin of the transitions inversion in rare-earth vanadates</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.16351</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.16351v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The surprising inversion of the orbital- and magnetic-order transition temperatures in the RVO3 series with increasing the rare-earth radius makes the series unique among orbitally-ordered materials. Here, augmenting dynamical mean-field theory with a decomposition of the order parameter into irreducible tensors, we show that this anomalous behavior emerges from an unusual hierarchy of interactions. First, increasing the rare-earth radius, orbital physics comes to be controlled by xz-xz quadrupolar super-exchange rather than by lattice distortion. Next, for antiferromagnetic spin order, orbital super-exchange terms with different spin rank compete, so that the dipolar spin-spin interaction dominates. Eventually, G-type magnetic order (anti-ferro in all directions) can appear already above the orbital ordering transition, and C-type order (anti-ferro in the ab plane) right around it. The strict constraints we found explain why the inversion is rare, giving at the same time criteria to look for similar behavior in other materials.</description>

      <title>Highly Efficient Non-relativistic Edelstein effect in p-wave magnets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.16378</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.16378v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The origin and efficiency of charge-to-spin conversion, known as the Edelstein effect (EE), has been typically linked to spin-orbit coupling mechanisms, which require materials with heavy elements within a non-centrosymmetric environment. Here we demonstrate that the high efficiency of spin-charge conversion can be achieved even without spin-orbit coupling in the recently identified coplanar p-wave magnets. The non-relativistic Edelstein effect (NREE) in these magnets exhibits a distinct phenomenology compared to the relativistic EE, characterized by a strongly anisotropic response and an out-of-plane polarized spin density resulting from the spin symmetries. We illustrate the NREE through minimal tight-binding models, allowing a direct comparison to different systems. Through first-principles calculations, we further identify the p-wave candidate material CeNiAsO as a high-efficiency NREE material, revealing a 25 times larger response than the maximally achieved relativistic EE and other reported NREE in non-collinear magnetic systems with broken time-reversal symmetry. This highlights the potential for efficient spin-charge conversion in p-wave magnetic systems.</description>

      <title>A Novel Methodology for Modelling First and Second Order Phase Transformations -- Thermodynamic Aspects, Variational Methods and Applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.16430</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.16430v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper introduces a novel methodology for the mathematical modelling of first and second order phase transformations. It will be shown that this methodology can be related to certain limiting cases of the Cahn-Hilliard equation, specifically the cases of having (i) a convex molar free energy function and (ii) a convex molar free energy function with no regularization. The latter case is commonly regarded as unstable; however, by modifying the variational approach and solving for rate-dependent variables, we obtain a stabilized method capable of handling the missing regularization. While the specific numerical method used to solve the equations (a mixed finite element approach) has been previously employed in related contexts (e.g., to stabilize solutions of the Laplace equation), its application to diffusion and diffusional phase transformations is novel. We prove the thermodynamic consistency of the derived method and discuss several use cases. Our work contributes to the development of new mathematical tools for modeling complex phase transformations in materials science.</description>

      <title>Interfacial defect properties of high-entropy carbides: Stacking faults, Shockley partial dislocations, and a new Evans-Polanyi-Semenov relation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.00834</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.00834v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Using first principles calculations, {111} intrinsic stacking fault (ISF) energies in Group IVB, VB, and VIB high-entropy transition metal carbides are shown to be predictable from an optimized rule of mixtures based on the properties of the single metal carbide constituents present near the stacking fault. A composition-independent linear relationship is demonstrated between the ISF energies and the unstable stacking fault (USF) energies along the &lt;112&gt;{111} gamma surface slip path. Treating the ISF and USF energies as analogous to the heat of reaction and transition state barrier in chemical reactions, this linear relationship represents a new application of the Evans-Polanyi-Semenov principle. Further, a full defect energy distribution can be obtained from the predicted ISF energies with only the composition as an input for the mixed early-transition metal carbides. Applying a model that balances the elastic repulsion between partial dislocations with the distribution of ISF energies, we show that Shockley partial edge dislocations should remain bound for all valence electron concentration values up to about 9.6, even when the average stacking fault energy is negative.</description>

      <title>Engineering Symmetry Breaking Interfaces by Nanoscale Structural-Energetics in Orthorhombic Perovskite Thin Films</title>

      <description>arXiv:2401.08798v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The atomic configuration of phases and their interfaces is fundamental to materials design and engineering. Here, we unveil a transition metal oxide interface, whose formation is driven by energetic influences - epitaxial tensile strain versus oxygen octahedra connectivity - that compete in determining the orientation of an orthorhombic perovskite film. We study this phenomenon in a system of LaVO$_3$ grown on (101) DyScO$_3$, using atomic-resolution scanning transmission electron microscopy to measure intrinsic markers of orthorhombic symmetry. We identify that the film resolves this energetic conflict by switching its orientation by 90 degrees at an atomically-flat plane within its volume, not at the film/substrate interface. At either side of this "switching plane", characteristic orthorhombic distortions tend to zero to couple mismatched oxygen octahedra rotations. The resulting boundary is highly energetic, which makes it a priori unlikely; by using second-principles atomistic modeling, we show how its formation requires structural relaxation of an entire film grown beyond a critical thickness measuring tens of unit cells. The switching plane breaks the inversion symmetry of the Pnma orthorhombic structure, and sharply joins two regions, a thin intermediate layer and the film bulk, that are held under different mechanical strain states. By therefore contacting two distinct phases of one compound that would never otherwise coexist, this alternative type of interface opens new avenues for nanoscale engineering of functional systems, such as a chemically-uniform but magnetically inhomogeneous heterostructure.</description>

      <title>Anomalous Behavior of the Dielectric and Pyroelectric Responses of Ferroelectric Fine-Grained Ceramics</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.01108v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We revealed the anomalous temperature behavior of the giant dielectric permittivity and unusual frequency dependences of the pyroelectric response of the fine-grained ceramics prepared by the spark plasma sintering of the ferroelectric BaTiO3 nanoparticles. The temperature dependences of the electro-resistivity indicate the frequency-dependent transition in the electro-transport mechanisms between the lower and higher conductivity states accompanied by the maximum in the temperature dependence of the loss angle tangent. The pyroelectric thermal-wave probing revealed the existence of the spatially inhomogeneous counter-polarized ferroelectric state at the opposite surfaces of the ceramic sample. We described the temperature behavior of the giant dielectric response and losses using the core-shell model for ceramic grains, effective medium approach and Maxwell-Wagner approach. The superparaelectric-like state with a giant dielectric response may appear due to the internal barrier-layer capacitance effect, while the step-like thermal activation of localized polarons in the semiconducting grains is not excluded. The elucidation of the state microscopic origin requires measurements in the frequency range above 1 MHz.</description>

      <title>PDDFormer: Pairwise Distance Distribution Graph Transformer for Crystal Material Property Prediction</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.12984v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The crystal structure can be simplified as a periodic point set repeating across the entire three-dimensional space along an underlying lattice. Traditionally, methods for representing crystals rely on descriptors like lattice parameters, symmetry, and space groups to characterize the structure. However, in reality, atoms in material always vibrate above absolute zero, causing continuous fluctuations in their positions. This dynamic behavior disrupts the underlying periodicity of the lattice, making crystal graphs based on static lattice parameters and conventional descriptors discontinuous under even slight perturbations. To this end, chemists proposed the Pairwise Distance Distribution (PDD) method, which has been used to distinguish all periodic structures in the world's largest real materials collection, the Cambridge Structural Database. However, achieving the completeness of PDD requires defining a large number of neighboring atoms, resulting in high computational costs. Moreover, it does not account for atomic information, making it challenging to directly apply PDD to crystal material property prediction tasks. To address these challenges, we propose the atom-Weighted Pairwise Distance Distribution (WPDD) and Unit cell Pairwise Distance Distribution (UPDD) for the first time, incorporating them into the construction of multi-edge crystal graphs. Based on this, we further developed WPDDFormer and UPDDFormer, graph transformer architecture constructed using WPDD and UPDD crystal graphs. We demonstrate that this method maintains the continuity and completeness of crystal graphs even under slight perturbations in atomic positions.</description>

      <title>Effect of the Lattice-distortion on the Electronic Structure and Magnetic Anisotropy of the CoFeCrGa Spin Gapless Semiconductor: A First Principal Study</title>

Abstract: The impact of uniform lattice strain (with lattice parameter (LP), $a = 5.62$-$5.83$ \r{A}) and tetragonal lattice distortion (with $0.8 \leq c/a \leq1.2$ and $V_0$ volume; resulting LP: $a = 5.38$-$5.92$ \r{A}, $c = 5.33$-$6.45$ \r{A}) on the structural, electronic, and magnetic properties of CoFeCrGa SGS alloy (optimized LP: $a = 5.72$ \r{A}) has been investigated. The SGS nature of CoFeCrGa remains robust under uniform strain; however, the tetragonal lattice distortion has a detrimental impact on the SGS nature, and even a small distortions lead to metallic nature for CoFeCrGa. Despite this, the tetragonally distorted structures maintain high spin polarization (SP $\geq 60\% $); except for the structure with $c/a = 0.8$, for which SP significantly decreases to $\sim 25\%$. The lattice deformation-induced magnetic anisotropy (MA) is also explored by considering the magnetocrystalline anisotropy (MCA) and the magnetic shape anisotropy (MSA). Both MCA and MSA eliminate for the Y-I ordered and uniformly strained structures, resulting in a magnetic isotropic nature for them. Conversely, the tetragonally distorted structures with $c/a &lt; 1.0$ and $c/a &gt; 1.0$ exhibit very high in-plane magnetic anisotropy and perpendicular magnetic anisotropy, respectively; with magnitudes of $\sim 10^5$-$10^6$ J/m$^3$. For tetragonally deformed structures, MSA contribution to MA is negligible, and thus, MCA dictates the total MA. In summary, the isotropically strained structures show SGS nature, while the tetragonally distorted structures exhibit the high MA along with high SP.</description>

      <title>A facile route to synthesize cubic gauche polymeric nitrogen</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.10331</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.10331v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this work, the long-sought cg-N with N-N single bond has been synthesized for the first time by a thermal-driven-only chemical route at ambient conditions. The successful synthesis of cg-N was achieved by first creating a solution of azides, which was then pretreated under vacuum conditions. Following the pretreatment, the resultant concentrated azide was heated at temperatures ranging from 260{\deg}C to 330{\deg}C for a reaction time of 3 hours, ultimately leading to the formation of cg-N. The emergent intense Raman peak characterized of cg-N provides solid evidence that the double bonded nitrogen-nitrogen transforms into a single bond form, which agrees well with cg-N structure. To date, this is the only work achieving the quantity of cg-N synthesized at ambient conditions by a facile route that can be further developed for the scalable synthesis and applications of polymerized nitrogen-based materials as high energy density materials.</description>

      <title>Uncovering Electronic Exchange Behavior: Exploring Insights from Simple Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.11346</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.11346v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Exchange couplings are fundamental to our understanding of many physical phenomena in condensed matter physics and material science. Model systems provide a controlled environment to investigate such phenomena, effectively. In this study, we employ first-principle calculations based on density functional theory and Green's function (GF) method to explore the impact of chemical structure on the sign and magnitude of exchange coupling, systematically. By designing model systems with bcc-Fe bulk doped with nonmagnetic X= (H, B, C, N, O, and F) atoms, we examine the effects of different ligands on the behavior of Fe-Fe exchange coupling, and demonstrate that the chemical environment surrounding the metal atom significantly influences the Fe-Fe exchange coupling. Our results highlight the tunability of exchange coupling based on Fe-dopant bond length(s), where the nature of ligand atoms and their electron correlation play a crucial role. This work illuminates the complex relationship between structure, and magnetism in magnetic materials, providing insights into the development of high-performance magnetic materials.</description>

      <title>Scaling in Kinetics of Supercooled Liquids</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.09572</link>
      <description>arXiv:2308.09572v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The present study introduces a renormalization based approach to investigate the relaxation dynamics within supercooled liquids. By applying a numerical scale transformation to potential energies along the temporal axis, we have established a novel framework that elucidates the underlying kinetics of supercooled liquids. Our findings indicate that the skewness of the potential energy distribution attains its maximum at a characteristic time scale, D, which exhibits a Curie like scaling relationship with temperature. This scaling relationship is characterized by an exponent, g, that experiences a discontinuous transition at a critical cooling rate, signifying a kinetic like phase transition.We further demonstrate that g maintains an approximate scaling relationship with the cooling rate, where the product of g and the logarithm of the cooling rate is approximately constant.This constant, however, varies depending on whether the cooling rate is above or below the critical value, effectively classifying supercooled liquids into two distinct categories: the glass transition as the destiny of supercooled liquid, GDL, and the crystallization as the destiny of supercooled liquid, CDL. Furthermore, we identify that Ts corresponds to the glass transition temperature for GDL and the crystallization temperature for CDL, respectively. We have successfully developed a theoretical model,which not only derives the Curie like power law but also provides profound insights into the physical implications of D, g and Ts. This research delineates the differences between GDL and CDL, and offers a fresh perspective for exploring the nature of glasses. The findings contribute to the broader understanding of the dynamics of supercooled liquids and the mechanisms of glass formation.</description>

      <title>Atomic-scale tracking of topological defect motion and incommensurate charge order melting</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.08580</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.08580v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Charge order pervades the phase diagrams of quantum materials where it competes with superconducting and magnetic phases, hosts electronic phase transitions and topological defects, and couples to the lattice generating intricate structural distortions. Incommensurate charge order is readily stabilized in manganese oxides where it is associated with anomalous electronic and magnetic properties, but its nanoscale structural inhomogeneity complicates precise characterization and understanding of its relationship with competing phases. Leveraging atomic-resolution variable temperature cryogenic scanning transmission electron microscopy, we characterize the thermal evolution of charge order as it transforms from its ground state in a model manganite system. We find that mobile networks of discommensurations and dislocations generate phase inhomogeneity and induce global incommensurability in an otherwise lattice-locked modulation. Driving the order to melt at high temperatures, the discommensuration density grows and regions of order locally decouple from the lattice periodicity.</description>

      <title>Long-range crossed Andreev reflection in topological insulator nanowires proximitized by a superconductor</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.02383</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.02383v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Crossed Andreev reflection (CAR) is a nonlocal transport phenomenon that creates/detects Cooper-pair correlations between distant places. It is also the basis of Cooper-pair splitting to generate remote entanglement. Although CAR has been extensively studied in semiconductors proximity-coupled to a superconductor, it has been very difficult to observe it in a topological insulator (TI). Here we report the first observation of CAR in a proximitized TI nanowire (TINW). We performed local and nonlocal conductance spectroscopy on mesoscopic TINW devices in which superconducting (Nb) and metallic (Pt/Au) contacts are made on a bulk-insulating TINW. The local conductance detected a hard gap, accompanied by the appearance of Andreev bound states that can reach zero-bias, while a negative nonlocal conductance was occasionally observed upon sweeping the chemical potential, giving evidence for CAR. Surprisingly, the CAR signal was detected even over 1.5 $\mu$m, which implies that pair correlations extend over a length scale much longer than the expected superconducting coherence length of either Nb or the proximitised TINW. Such a long-range CAR effect is possibly due to an intricate role of disorder in proximitized nanowires. Also, our 0.9-$\mu$m device presented a decent Cooper-pair splitting efficiency of up to 0.5.</description>

      <title>Closing in on possible scenarios for infinite-layer nickelates: comparison of dynamical mean-field theory with angular-resolved photoemission spectroscopy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.12985</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.12985v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Conflicting theoretical scenarios for infinite-layer nickelate superconductors have been hotly debated, particularly regarding whether {only} a single Ni-3$d_{x^2-y^2}$ band is relevant at low energies besides electron pockets or whether multi-orbital physics including Ni-3$d_{z^2}$ is instead essential. The first scenario has emerged from density-functional theory plus dynamical mean-field theory (DFT+DMFT) calculations. Comparing the previous DFT+DMFT spectra to recent angular-resolved photoemission spectroscopy (ARPES) experiments, we find excellent agreement for both the Fermi surface and the strongly renormalized quasi-particle bands, supporting the first scenario. Our key findings further suggest that the "waterfalls" observed in ARPES might emerge from the quasi-particle--to--Hubbard-band crossover, and that additional spectral weight close to the $A$-pocket {likely} originates from the Ni-3$d_{xy}$ orbital.</description>

      <title>Continuous Dimer Angles on the Silicon Surface: Critical Properties and the Kibble-Zurek Mechanism</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.06412v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Langevin dynamics simulations are used to analyze the static and dynamic properties of an {XY} model adapted to dimers forming on Si(001) surfaces. The numerics utilise high-performance parallel computation methods on GPUs. The static exponent $\nu$ of the symmetry-broken XY model is determined to $\nu = 1.04$. The dynamic critical exponent $z$ is determined to $z = 2.13$ and, together with $\nu$, shows the behavior of the Ising universality class. For time-dependent temperatures, we observe frozen domains and compare their size distribution with predictions from Kibble-Zurek theory. We determine a significantly larger quench exponent that shows little dependence on the damping or the symmetry-breaking field.</description>

      <title>Exploring functionalized Zr$_2$N and Sc$_2$N MXenes as superconducting candidates with $\textit{ab initio}$ calculations</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.12052v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We explore the possibility of obtaining new superconductor candidates from functionalized MXene compounds Zr$_2$NS$_2$, Zr$_2$NCl$_2$, and Sc$_2$NCl$_2$ based on $\textit{ab initio}$ calculations with density functional theory for superconductors (SCDFT). The predicted superconducting transition temperature $T_c$ at ambient pressure may reach up to 9.48 K (Zr$_2$NS$_2$). Strain-induced $T_c$ enhancement is demonstrated with an example case for Zr$_2$NCl$_2$. We note a correlation between the profiles of superconducting gap $\Delta$ and the electron-phonon coupling $\lambda$ across the Fermi surface for all compounds, which are likely influenced by their modified electronic bandstructure components.</description>

      <title>Gapless dispersive continuum in a modulated quantum kagome antiferromagnet</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.01931</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.01931v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The pursuit of quantum spin liquid (QSL) states in condensed matter physics has drawn attention to kagome antiferromagnets (AFM) where a two-dimensional corner-sharing network of triangles frustrates conventional magnetic orders. While quantum kagome AFMs based on Cu$^{2+}$ (3d$^9$, $s=\frac{1}{2}$) ions have been extensively studied, there is so far little work beyond copper-based systems. Here we present our bulk magnetization, specific heat and neutron scattering studies on single crystals of a new titanium fluoride Cs$_8$RbK$_3$Ti$_{12}$F$_{48}$ where Ti$^{3+}$ (3d$^1$, $s = \frac{1}{2}$) ions form a modulated quantum kagome antiferromagnet that does not order magnetically down to 1.5 K. Our comprehensive map of the dynamic response function $S(Q,\hbar\omega)$ acquired at 1.5 K where the heat capacity is T-linear reveals a dispersive continuum emanating from soft lines that extend along (100). The data indicate fractionalized spinon-like excitations with quasi-one-dimensional dispersion within a quasi-two-dimensional spin system.</description>

      <title>High-Throughput Discovery of Kagome Materials in Transition Metal Oxide Monolayers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.08501</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.08501v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Kagome materials are known for hosting exotic quantum states, including quantum spin liquids, charge density waves, and unconventional superconductivity. The search for kagome monolayers is driven by their ability to exhibit neat and well-defined kagome bands near the Fermi level, which are more easily realized in the absence of interlayer interactions. However, this absence also destabilizes the monolayer forms of many bulk kagome materials, posing significant challenges to their discovery. In this work, we propose a strategy to address this challenge by utilizing oxygen vacancies in transition metal oxides within a "1+3" design framework. Through high-throughput computational screening of 349 candidate materials, we identified 12 thermodynamically stable kagome monolayers with diverse electronic and magnetic properties. These materials were classified into three categories based on their lattice geometry, symmetry, band gaps, and magnetic configurations. Detailed analysis of three representative monolayers revealed kagome band features near their Fermi levels, with orbital contributions varying between oxygen 2p and transition metal d states. This study demonstrates the feasibility of the "1+3" strategy, offering a promising approach to uncovering low-dimensional kagome materials and advancing the exploration of their quantum phenomena.</description>

      <title>Enhanced laser-induced single-cycle terahertz generation in a spintronic emitter with a gradient interface</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.18591</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.18591v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The development of spintronic emitters of broadband THz pulses relies on designing heterostructures where processes of laser-driven spin current generation and subsequent spin-to-charge current conversion are the most efficient. An interface between ferromagnetic and nonmagnetic layers in the emitter is one of the critical elements. Here, we study experimentally single-cycle THz pulse generation from a laser-pulse excited Pt/Co emitter with a composition gradient interface between Pt and Co and compare it with the emission from a conventional Pt/Co structure with an abrupt interface. We find that the gradient interface enhances the efficiency of optics-to-THz conversion by a factor of two in a wide range of optical fluences up to 3 mJ cm$^{-2}$. We reveal that this enhancement is caused by a pronounced increase in transmittance of the laser-driven spin-polarized current through the gradient interface compared to the abrupt one. Furthermore, we find that such a transmission deteriorates with laser fluence due to the spin accumulation effect.</description>

      <title>Renormalization of States and Quasiparticles in Many-body Downfolding</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.13725v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We explore the principles of many-body Hamiltonian complexity reduction via downfolding on an effective low-dimensional representation. We present a unique measure of fidelity between the effective (reduced-rank) description and the full many-body treatment for arbitrary (i.e., ground and excited) states. When the entire problem is mapped on a system of interacting quasiparticles [npj Computational Materials 9 (1), 126, 2023], the effective Hamiltonians can faithfully reproduce the physics only when a clear energy scale separation exists between the subsystems and its environment. We also demonstrate that it is necessary to include quasiparticle renormalization at distinct energy scales, capturing the distinct interaction between subsystems and their surrounding environments. Numerical results from simple, exactly solvable models highlight the limitations and strengths of this approach, particularly for ground and low-lying excited states. This work lays the groundwork for applying dynamical downfolding techniques to problems concerned with (quantum) interfaces.</description>

      <title>Non-Hermitian Spin-Spin Interaction Mediated by Chiral Phonons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.14545</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.14545v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Non-Hermiticity and chirality are two fundamental properties known to give rise to various intriguing phenomena. However, the interplay between these properties has been rarely explored. In this work, we bridge this gap by introducing an off-diagonal non-Hermitian spin-spin interaction mediated by chiral phonons. This interaction arises from the spin-selectivity due to the locking between phonon momentum and angular momentum in chiral materials. The resulting non-Hermitian interaction mediated by the vacuum field of chiral phonons can reach the kHz range for electron spins and can be further enhanced by externally driven mechanical waves, potentially leading to observable effects in the quantum regime. Moreover, the long-range nature of phonon-mediated interactions enables the realization of the long-desired non-Hermitian interaction among multiple spins. The effect proposed in this work may have wide-ranging applications in cascaded quantum systems, non-Hermitian many-body physics, and non-Hermitian cooling.</description>
