      <title>Evidence for synchronisation of Gaia eclipsing binaries from their stellar rotational velocity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.05774</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.05774v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Gaia DR3 catalogue includes line-broadening (vbroad) measurements for 10,387 eclipsing binaries. In this study, we focus on a subset of 977 short-period main-sequence systems with primary radii between 1.25 and 3 solar radii, effective temperatures from 5600 to 8000 K, orbital periods between 0.3 and 3 days, vbroad values from 30 to 300 km/s, eclipse depth ratios below 0.7, and eccentricity indicators |e cos(omega)| less than 0.1. We find a clear inverse correlation between vbroad and orbital period, consistent with tidal synchronisation and spin-orbit alignment. Comparing the Gaia vbroad values with the expected rotational velocities based on stellar radii, we find that the measurements are generally consistent with rotational broadening, albeit with a systematic offset of approximately 10 percent.</description>

      <title>Photometric study of hot Algol-type binaries with long cycles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.05856</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.05856v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Double periodic variables (DPVs) are hot Algol-type interacting binary systems with an orbital and a long photometric cycle. The origin of the latter may be related to cyclic structural changes in the accretion disc that surrounds the gainer star that are driven by a variable mass-transfer rate. If this is the case, changes in the orbital light curve would be expected throughout the long cycle. We conducted a detailed photometric analysis of the light curves of 134 Large Magellanic Cloud (LMC) DPVs to investigate variations in the morphology of the orbital light curves as a function of the long-cycle phase. We separated the two photometric cycles from the Optical Gravitational Lensing Experiment (OGLE) I band light curves for the systems. We thus compared the orbital light curves at opposite long-cycle phases, investigated the stability of the long period, and analysed the residuals of the separation process to search for significant frequencies above a 1% false-alarm probability threshold. We confirm that the DPVs OGLE-LMC-DPV-097 and OGLE-BLG-ECL-157529 change most strongly in their orbital light curves throughout the long cycle. By comparison, about 50% of the sample exhibits moderate morphological variations, in particular, around orbital phase 0.5. This is likely associated with structural changes in the accretion discs. In addition, we identified 18 DPVs with variable long periods, including 10 new cases. In some of them, the long period either increases or decreases continuously over time. For the first time, we found DPV systems that alternate between the two behaviours at different epochs. Moreover, we detected frequencies in the residuals that might be directly related to changes in the morphology of the orbital curves. Finally, some previously reported frequencies disappear when a variable long period is taken into account.</description>

      <title>Unveiling Unprecedented Fine Structure in Coronal Flare Loops with the DKIST</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.05875</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.05875v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present the highest-resolution H$\alpha$ observations of a solar flare to date, collected during the decay phase of an X1.3-class flare on 8 August 2024 at 20:12 UT. Observations with the Visible Broadband Imager at the National Science Foundation's (NSF) Daniel K. Inouye Solar Telescope reveal dark coronal loop strands at unprecedented spatial resolution in the flare arcade above highly structured chromospheric flare ribbons. After surveying the 20 best-seeing images, we calculate a mean loop width near the top of the arcade of 48.2 km, with a minimum loop width of ~21 km and distribution mode of ~43 km. The distributions of loop widths observed by the DKIST in our study are often symmetric about the mean loop width. This is initial evidence that the DKIST may be capable of resolving the fundamental scale of coronal loops, although further investigation is required to confirm this result. We demonstrate that the resolving power of the DKIST represents a significant step towards advancing modern flare models and our understanding of fine structure in the coronal magnetic field.</description>

      <title>Absolute Parameters of Young Stars: NO Puppis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.05893</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.05893v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The southern early-type, young, eccentric-orbit eclipsing binary NO Puppis forms the A component of the multiple star Gaia DR3 552\-8147999779517568. The B component is an astrometric binary now at a separation of about 8.1 arcsec. There may be other fainter stars in this interesting but complex stellar system. We have combined several lines of evidence, including TESS data from 4 sectors, new ground-based BVR photometry, HARPS (ESO) and HERCULES (UCMJO) high-resolution spectra and astrometry of NO Pup. We derive a revised set of absolute parameters with increased precision. Alternative optimal curve-fitting programs were used in the analysis, allowing a wider view of modelling and parameter uncertainties. The main parameters are as follows: $M_{Aa} = 3.58 \pm 0.11$, $M_{Ab} = 1.68 \pm 0.09$ (M$_\odot$); $R_{Aa} = 2.17 \pm 0.03$, $R_{Ab} = 1.51 \pm 0.06$ (R$_\odot$), and $T_{\rm e Aa} = 13300 \pm 500$, $T_{\rm e Ab} = 7400 \pm 500$ (K). We estimate approximate masses of the wide companions, Ba and Bb, as $M_{Ba} = 2.0$ and $M_{Bb} = 1.8$ (M$_\odot$). The close binary's orbital separation is $a= 8.51 \pm 0.05$ (R$_\odot$); its age is approximately $20$ Myr and distance $172 \pm 1$ pc. The close binary's secondary (Ab) appears to be the source of low amplitude $ {\delta}$ Scuti-type oscillations, although the form of these oscillations is irregular and unrepetitive. Analysis of the $ \lambda$ 6678 He I profile of the primary show synchronism of the mean bodily and orbital rotations. The retention of significant orbital eccentricity, in view of the closeness of the A-system components, is unexpected and poses challenges for the explanation that we discuss.</description>

      <title>On the estimation of solar wind velocity under varying solar activity conditions using Akatsuki measurements</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.06381</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.06381v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present an analysis of solar wind dynamics based on Doppler spectral width measurements of X-band radio signals from the Japanese Akatsuki spacecraft. The dataset includes two solar conjunction occultation experiments conducted in 2016 and 2022, capturing the transition from the descending phase of Solar Cycle 24, a period of low solar activity, to the ascending phase of Solar Cycle 25, which exhibited moderate to intense activity. Our study demonstrates the utility of this technique for estimating both slow and fast solar wind velocities across different phases of solar activity. A key focus is the 2022 experiment, which probed the solar corona near coronal holes at heliocentric distances ranging from 1.4 to 10 $R_\odot$. We also investigate the impact of electron density estimates on the accuracy of solar wind speed determinations, underscoring the need for improved electron density modeling to enhance the robustness of such measurements.</description>

      <title>Improving the atomic modelling for solar UV radiative transfer calculations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.06422</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.06422v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Radiative transfer calculations have been produced over the years for many lines and continua in the UV wavelength range of solar and cool stellar atmospheres for a variety of conditions. Despite significant improvements in computing power and availability of atomic data over time, atomic models are often still limited in size and rely on approximations for data. There have also been inconsistencies in the way photo-ionisation and radiative recombination have been treated. Here, we incorporate into the Lightweaver radiative transfer code new data and updated modelling of atomic processes for the low charge states of C, Si and S. Data are taken from the CHIANTI database and other widely-available sources for the relevant elements. We show the significant impact this has on the UV continua in the 1100-1700{\AA} region, especially for Si. The results are in much better agreement with averaged, quiet Sun observations, and remove the need to invoke "missing opacity" to resolve discrepancies. The present treatment has important implications for radiative transfer calculations and the model atmospheres used as inputs.</description>

      <title>Scaling K2 VIII: Short-Period Sub-Neptune Occurrence Rates Peak Around Early-Type M Dwarfs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.05734</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.05734v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We uniformly combined data from the NASA Kepler and K2 missions to compute planet occurrence rates across the entire FGK and M dwarf stellar range. The K2 mission, driven by targets selected by guest observers, monitored nine times more M dwarfs than the Kepler mission. Combined, Kepler and K2 observed 130 short-period ($P=1-40$ days) Earth to Neptune-sized candidate planets orbiting M dwarfs. K2 observed 3.5 times more of these planets than Kepler for host stars below 3700 K. Our planet occurrence rates show that short-period sub-Neptunes peak at $3750^{+153}_{-97}$ K and drop for cooler M dwarfs. A peak near this location was predicted by pebble accretion planet formation models and confirmed here by observations for the first time. Super-Earths continue to increase in occurrence toward cooler stars and show no clear evidence of a peak in the host star range considered here (3200 K$-$6900 K). Our observations provide critical input to further refine planet formation models. We strongly recommend further study of mid-to-late M dwarfs with TESS and soon the Nancy Grace Roman Space Telescope and PLATO to identify additional small planet trends.</description>

      <title>Faint southern spectrophotometric standard stars</title>

      <description>arXiv:2508.05758v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Context. The advent of the Extremely Large Telescope (ELT) will increase the collecting area by more than an order of magnitude compared to the individual Unit Telescopes of the Very Large Telescope (VLT). Fainter spectrophotometric standard stars than those currently available in the V = 11 to 13 mag (K = 12 to 14 mag) range are required for spectroscopic observations with instruments such as the Multi-AO Imaging Camera for Deep Observations (MICADO) on the ELT, notably in the near-infrared wavelength regime. Aims. We identify suitable spectrophotometric standard stars among white dwarfs with hydrogen atmospheres (DA white dwarfs) in the magnitude range K =14 to 16 mag and provide reference data based on stellar model atmospheres. Methods. We observed 24 candidate DA white dwarfs with the X-shooter instrument on the VLT, covering the wavelength range 300 nm to 2480 nm in three arms. We took care to include stars at latitudes below and above -25 degrees to allow observations for all wind directions at the location of the ELT. The spectra were analysed using model fluxes from 3D pure-hydrogen local thermodynamic equilibrium model atmospheres and multi-band photometry. From the sample of observed targets, we selected 14 reliable flux calibrators. For these targets, the residuals from the match between the model best-fit models and the observed spectra across the full wavelength range are &lt; 3%, with the exception of the UV regions affected by the ozone Huggins bands (300 nm - 340 nm) and regions contaminated by telluric lines. Results. We have identified and fully characterised 14 DA white dwarfs that can be used as spectrophotometric standard stars for the MICADO instrument as well as any other future instrument with similar requirements in the brightness range, K = 14 to 16 mag (Vegamag), and provide reference fluxes</description>

      <title>The tidal interaction of an orbiting giant planet with a star near the Kraft break: the excitation of $r$-modes and the retention of orbital and spin angular momenta misalignment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.05894</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.05894v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper we extend the previous work of Papaloizou \&amp; Savonije on tidal interactions between a solar mass star and a closely orbiting giant planet which is such that the orbital and stellar spin angular momentum directions are misaligned. Here we consider the situation when the central star has a mass of $1.3 M_{\odot}$ and is in the vicinity of the Kraft break. We find and determine the properties of the lowest order $r$ modes and the tidal response arising from the secular non axisymmetric forcing associated with a misaligned orbit. We find that the response of the thin convective envelope, as well as the shift of $r$ mode frequencies from the low rotation frequency, limit can be understood by adopting a vertically averaged model that is similar to the well known one governed by the Laplace tidal equation for an incompressible ocean. From our results we are able to estimate lower bounds on realignment time scales for hot Jupiter systems with orbital periods in the range $2.8-5 d$ and rotation periods in the range $5-31 d$ that indicate the process is indeed markedly less effective than for a solar type star. This is on account of there being less dissipation in a relatively smaller convective envelope as well as the generally faster rotation and hence larger spin angular momentum expected for the more massive star.</description>

      <title>Low-velocity large-scale shocks in the infrared dark cloud G035.39-00.33: bubble-driven cloud-cloud collisions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.06081</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.06081v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Low-velocity large-scale shocks impacting on the ISM may efficiently shape molecular clouds and trigger star formation within them. These shocks, both driven by galactic bubbles and/or cloud-cloud collisions, leave specific signatures in the gas morphology and kinematics. Observational studies of such signatures are crucial to investigate if and how shocks affect the clouds formation process and trigger their future star formation. We have analysed the shocked and dense gas tracers SiO(2-1) and H13CO+(1-0) emission toward the IRDC G035.39-00.33, using new, larger-scale maps obtained with the 30m telescope at the Instituto de Radioastronom\`ia Millim\'etrica. We find that the dense gas is organised into a northern and a southern filament having different velocities and tilted orientation with respect to each other. The two filaments are spatially separated yet connected by a faint bridge feature also seen in a position-velocity diagram extracted across the cloud. This bridge-feature, typical of cloud-cloud collisions, also coincides with a very spectrally narrow SiO-traced emission. The northern filament is suggested to be interacting with the nearby supernova remnant G035.6-0.4. Toward the southern filament, we also report the presence of a parsec-scale, spectrally narrow SiO emission likely driven by the interaction between this filament and a nearby expanding shell. The shell is visible in the 1.3 GHz and 610 MHz continuum images and our preliminary analysis suggests it may be the relic of a supernova remnant. We conclude that the two filaments represent the densest part of two colliding clouds, pushed toward each other by nearby Supernova Remnants. We speculate that this cloud-cloud collision driven by stellar feedback may have assembled the infrared dark cloud. We also evaluate the possibility that star formation may have been triggered within G035.39-00.33 by the collision.</description>

      <title>Dynamical neutron-star tides: The signature of a mode resonance</title>

      <description>arXiv:2508.06416v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Motivated by future opportunities in gravitational-wave astronomy and the ongoing effort to constrain physics under extreme conditions, we consider the signature of individual mode resonances excited during the inspiral of binary systems involving neutron stars. Specifically, we quantify how each resonant mode contributes to the effective (frequency-dependent) tidal deformability. The resonant solution is shown to be accurately represented by a new closed-form approximation, which sheds light on the involved phenomenology, and which should be useful for the development of precise waveform models and future parameter extraction efforts.</description>

      <title>Revisiting the Gas Dynamics of Henize 2-10: Possible Drivers of the Starburst</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.06472</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.06472v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The triggers of starburst episodes are a key component to our understanding of the baryon cycle in galaxies. Galaxy mergers are a commonly suggested catalyst for starbursts, but once the galaxies coalesce into a single kinematically disturbed system, their merger history can be difficult to assess. This is particularly true for dwarf galaxies, which are expected to dominate the merger rate at all redshifts due to their large numbers. One such dwarf galaxy undergoing an enigmatic starburst episode is Henize 2-10, which appears to be isolated. Possible scenarios that might have caused the starburst episode include a previous merger or stochastic processes within the galaxy itself, such as self-regulation via feedback processes. We present new VLA 21-cm observations and unpublished archival CARMA CO data to investigate the dynamical state and star formation activity in the galaxy. We do not detect an HI tail consistent with the structure reported by Kobulnicky et al. (1995), which was suggested as evidence for a merger or interaction, but rather these new observations indicate an extended HI distribution. We also find that the HI appears dynamically decoupled from an extended CO feature (inferred to be a tidal tail in previous work), suggesting large-scale dynamical processes of some type are affecting the gas in this system. We provide a meta-analysis of available results to enhance our understanding of what might be triggering the starburst episode in Henize 2-10, and speculate that the large CO feature could be falling into the galaxy and potentially trigger starburst activity.</description>

      <title>HIP 15429: A newborn Be star on an eccentric binary orbit</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.06973</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.06973v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We identified a new post-interaction binary, HIP 15429, consisting of a stripped star and a recently formed, rapidly rotating Be star companion ($v \sin i \approx 270$ km/s) sharing many similarities with recently identified bloated stripped stars. From orbital fitting of multi-epoch radial velocities we find a 221-day period. We also find an eccentricity of $e=0.52$, which is unexpectedly high as tides are expected to have circularised the orbit efficiently during the presumed recent mass transfer. The formation of a circumbinary disk during the mass transfer phase or the presence of an unseen tertiary companion might explain the orbit's high eccentricity. We determined physical parameters for both stars by fitting the spectra of the disentangled binary components and multi-band photometry. The stripped nature of the donor star is affirmed by its high luminosity at a low inferred mass ($\lesssim 1 \mathrm{M}_\odot$) and imprints of CNO-processed material in the surface abundances. The donor's relatively large radius and cool temperature ($T_{\mathrm{eff}} = 13.5 \pm 0.5$ kK) suggest that it has only recently ceased mass transfer. Evolutionary models assuming a 5-6 $\mathrm{M}_\odot$ progenitor can reproduce these parameters and imply that the binary is currently evolving towards a stage where the donor becomes a subdwarf orbiting a Be star. The remarkably high eccentricity of HIP 15429 challenges standard tidal evolution models, suggesting either inefficient tidal dissipation or external influences, such as a tertiary companion or circumbinary disk. This underscores the need to identify and characterise more post-mass transfer binaries to benchmark and refine theoretical models of binary evolution.</description>

      <title>Two Types of $1/f$ Range in Solar Wind Turbulence</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.17523v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The $1/f$ noise is a ubiquitous phenomenon in natural systems. Since the advent of space exploration, the $1/f$ range has been consistently observed in \textit{in situ} solar wind measurements throughout the heliosphere, sparking decades of debate regarding its origin. Recent Parker Solar Probe (PSP) observations near the Alfv\'en surface have revealed a systematic absence of the $1/f$ range in pristine solar wind, providing a unique opportunity to investigate its origin in solar wind turbulence. Despite numerous observations of the $1/f$ range at varying frequencies, no study has systematically examined its properties across different solar wind conditions. Here, we identify two distinct types of $1/f$ ranges in solar wind turbulence: the fast/Alfv\'enic wind type and the slow/mixed wind type. The fast/Alfv\'enic type appears to be an intrinsic feature of Alfv\'enic turbulence, while the slow/mixed type resembles classical flicker noise. For the fast/Alfv\'enic type, we find a near-perfect WKB evolution of the frequency-averaged fluctuation amplitude and an intriguing migration pattern in frequency space. For the slow/mixed type, we examine the solar cycle dependence of the $1/f$ noise using the OMNI-LRO dataset spanning solar cycles 22 to 25. We also analyze the autocorrelation function of the magnetic field vectors and identify a clear relationship between the $1/f$ range and the decline in correlation, as well as unexpected resonance peaks in the autocorrelation function.</description>

      <title>Parametric instability of Alfv\'en wave packets</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.10038v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Parametric instability of Alfv\'en wave packets with monochromatic carrier wave in low-$\beta$ plasma is studied using one-dimensional magnetohydrodynamic simulations. The results show spatial growth of incoming perturbations as they propagate through the mother wave. For sufficiently short packets, the perturbations emerge downstream of the packet as small-amplitude reverse Alfv\'en waves and forward slow magnetosonic waves. For larger packets the perturbations reach non-linear amplitude while still inside the mother wave. In this case, a downstream section of the mother wave collapses but the remaining upstream section stays largely intact and enters the phase of very slow evolution. The length scale separating the linear and non-linear regimes, as well as determining the size of the surviving section in the non-linear regime, is set by the Alfv\'en crossing time of the packet, the growth rate of the parametric instability for the unmodulated carrier wave, and the amplitude of incoming perturbations. The results are discussed in connection with the physics of solar wind.</description>

      <title>NGC 663 as a laboratory for massive star evolution</title>

Abstract: Massive young clusters with rich populations of high-mass stars are ideal laboratories to explore their evolutionary paths. Despite being the most prominent cluster in the Perseus-arm Cas OB8 association, NGC 663 remains comparatively little studied. We present a comprehensive investigation of its properties, integrating astrometric, photometric and spectroscopic data for the cluster and its surroundings, including accurate spectral classification for over 150 members. Gaia astrometry indicates over 300 B-type members, possibly rendering NGC 663 the most massive cluster in the Perseus arm, with initial mass likely exceeding 10000 M_\sun . This large population makes NGC 663 an excellent laboratory for studying massive star evolution. Spectral analysis of the earliest members reveals approximately solar metallicity and a turn-off mass of approximate 8.5 M_\sun, consistent with the photometric age of 23 Ma. We identify five spectroscopic blue stragglers, including the Be/X-ray binary RX J0146.9$+$6121. We outline its evolutionary history and compare its properties with other Be stars. Although the cluster contains many Be stars, their relative fraction is not particularly high. Intriguingly, four of the six blue supergiant members appear to have significantly higher masses than the brightest giants near the Hertzsprung gap. These observations suggest that most mid-B supergiants may form via mergers, unless stars of 10-12 M_\sun born as primaries in binaries rarely undergo supernova explosions. Similarly, if Be stars form through the binary channel, then either most are produced through case A evolution or supernovae are uncommon among primaries in this mass range.</description>

      <title>Bidirectional anisotropic solar energetic particle events observed by Solar Orbiter</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.16990v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Solar Energetic Particle (SEP) events are critical for understanding particle acceleration and transport in the heliosphere. While most SEP events involve outward streaming particles along open magnetic field lines, bidirectional events characterized by simultaneous sunward and anti-sunward particle flows offer unique insights into magnetic field topology and the interplay of multiple acceleration sources. We aim to investigate the origin and transport of energetic particles in two rare bidirectional anisotropic SEP events observed by Solar Orbiter. Both events showed two clear velocity dispersion signatures with opposite particle anisotropies during their onset phase. The sunward streaming protons, characterized by delayed release time, harder spectral index, and higher intensities, may be attributed to coronal mass ejection-driven shock acceleration, while the promptly released anti-sunward streaming protons are likely linked to flare acceleration. Notably, in both cases, small-scale flux ropes were identified in situ during the time intervals corresponding to the bidirectional particle streaming. Path lengths derived for sunward and anti-sunward injections were substantially greater than nominal values of the Parker field lines, further supporting the role of the flux rope in shaping particle trajectories. These observations demonstrate that magnetic flux rope could significantly affect magnetic connectivity to the source region and SEP propagation in the inner heliosphere, while simultaneous velocity dispersion from two distinct particle sources allows for direct constraints on the topology of the flux rope. Our results highlight the value of combining particle anisotropy, release time, source spectra, and magnetic structure diagnostics to unravel SEP transport in complex transient magnetic structures, and also present new challenges for the current SEP transport model.</description>

      <title>The Simons Observatory: Science Goals and Forecasts for the Enhanced Large Aperture Telescope</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.00636v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We describe updated scientific goals for the wide-field, millimeter-wave survey that will be produced by the Simons Observatory (SO). Significant upgrades to the 6-meter SO Large Aperture Telescope (LAT) are expected to be complete by 2028, and will include a doubled mapping speed with 30,000 new detectors and an automated data reduction pipeline. In addition, a new photovoltaic array will supply most of the observatory's power. The LAT survey will cover about 60% of the sky at a regular observing cadence, with five times the angular resolution and ten times the map depth of Planck. The science goals are to: (1) determine the physical conditions in the early universe and constrain the existence of new light particles; (2) measure the integrated distribution of mass, electron pressure, and electron momentum in the late-time universe, and, in combination with optical surveys, determine the neutrino mass and the effects of dark energy via tomographic measurements of the growth of structure at $z &lt; 3$; (3) measure the distribution of electron density and pressure around galaxy groups and clusters, and calibrate the effects of energy input from galaxy formation on the surrounding environment; (4) produce a sample of more than 30,000 galaxy clusters, and more than 100,000 extragalactic millimeter sources, including regularly sampled AGN light-curves, to study these sources and their emission physics; (5) measure the polarized emission from magnetically aligned dust grains in our Galaxy, to study the properties of dust and the role of magnetic fields in star formation; (6) constrain asteroid regoliths, search for Trans-Neptunian Objects, and either detect or eliminate large portions of the phase space in the search for Planet 9; and (7) provide a powerful new window into the transient universe on time scales of minutes to years, concurrent with observations from Rubin of overlapping sky.</description>

      <title>Gravitational wave signals from primordial black holes orbiting solar-type stars</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.07517v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Primordial black holes (PBHs) with masses between $10^{14}$ and $10^{20}$ kg are candidates to contribute a substantial fraction of the total dark matter abundance. When in orbit around the center of a star, which can possibly be a completely interior orbit, such objects would emit gravitational waves, as predicted by general relativity. In this work, we examine the gravitational wave signals emitted by such objects when they orbit typical stars, such as the Sun. We show that the magnitude of the waves that could eventually be detected on Earth from a possible PBH orbiting the Sun or a neighboring Sun-like star within our galaxy can be significantly stronger than those originating from a PBH orbiting a denser but more distant neutron star (NS). Such signals may be detectable by the LISA gravitational-wave detector. In addition, we estimate the contribution that a large collection of such PBH-star systems would make to the stochastic gravitational-wave background (SGWB) within a range of frequencies to which pulsar timing arrays are sensitive.</description>

      <title>Lie Group Theory of Multipole Moments and Shape of Stationary Rotating Fluid Bodies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.14712</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.14712v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present a rigorous framework for determining equilibrium configurations of uniformly rotating self-gravitating fluid bodies. This work addresses the longstanding challenge of modeling rotational deformation in celestial objects such as stars and planets. By integrating classical Newtonian potential theory with modern mathematical tools, we develop a unified formalism that improves both the precision and generality of shape modeling in astrophysical contexts. Our method employs Lie group theory and exponential mapping to characterize vector flows associated with rotational deformations. We derive functional equations for perturbations in density and gravitational potential, resolved analytically using the shift operator and Neumann series. This extends Clairaut's classical linear theory into the nonlinear regime. The resulting formulation yields an exact nonlinear differential equation for the shape function, describing hydrostatic equilibrium under rotation without assuming slow rotation. This generalized Clairaut equation incorporates nonlinear effects and accommodates large rotational speeds. We validate the theory by deriving exact solutions, including the Maclaurin spheroid, Jacobi ellipsoid, and the unit-index polytrope. We also introduce spectral decomposition techniques to analyze radial harmonics of the shape function and gravitational perturbations. Using Wigner's formalism for angular momentum addition, we compute higher-order spectral corrections and derive boundary conditions for radial harmonics. This enables accurate computation of Love numbers and gravitational multipole moments, offering a comprehensive, non-perturbative approach to modeling rotational deformations in astrophysical systems.</description>

      <title>Absolute Calibration of Cluster Mira Variables to Provide a New Anchor for the Hubble Constant Determination</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.10658</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.10658v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Mira variables in globular clusters can provide an accurate and precise absolute calibration of their period-luminosity relations (PLRs) to independently anchor the cosmic distance scale and determine the Hubble constant. We present homogeneous near-infrared ($JHK_s$) time-series photometric observations of a sample of 55 candidate long-period variables in 18 globular clusters covering a wide metallicity range ($-1.7 &lt; \textrm{[Fe/H]} &lt; -0.1$ dex). The Gaia proper motions, long-period variability information, and optical-infrared colors are used to identify 41 oxygen-rich Miras as members of the globular clusters. Mean luminosities of Miras in the $JHK_s$ bands are independently calibrated using the recommended distances and mean parallaxes to their host clusters. Cluster Mira PLRs exhibit scatter comparable to the Large Magellanic Cloud (LMC) variables and do not show any dependence on iron abundance for a wide range of metallicities. We establish the accuracy of cluster Miras as independent anchors by determining a distance modulus to the LMC, $18.45 \pm 0.04$ mag, in agreement with the 1.2\% precise geometric distance. Our $H$-band photometry is transformed to derive Hubble Space Telescope F160W PLR for cluster Miras providing a three-anchor baseline with the LMC and NGC 4258. We employ three-anchor solution to determine distances to two type Ia supernovae host galaxies, NGC 1559 ($31.39\pm0.05$ mag) and M101 ($29.07\pm0.04$ mag), and provide a $3.7\%$ measurement of the Hubble constant, $H_0 = 73.06\pm 2.67$ km~s$^{-1}$~Mpc$^{-1}$. Similar to Cepheids, our independent baseline solution results in a local $H_0$ determination that is systematically larger than its inference from the early universe probes, further supporting the ongoing Hubble tension.</description>
