      <title>Superintegrability and choreographic obstructions in dihedral $n$-body Hamiltonian systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.17987</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.17987v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this study $n$-body systems on the plane, invariant under the dihedral group $D_n$, with quadratic pairwise interactions are considered. In the center-of-mass frame the dynamics separates into Fourier normal modes. Although suitable couplings can make the system maximally superintegrable (so all bounded motions are periodic), resonance of the mode frequencies does not by itself ensure choreographic motion. We give an explicit criterion for choreographic symmetry of a $T$-periodic solution: invariance under the choreography generator (time shift $T/n$ combined with cyclic relabeling/rotation) holds if and only if every dynamically active Fourier sector satisfies a sectorwise phase condition. This yields a direct test for when a closed orbit can be realized as a single-trace $n$-body choreography. When several symmetry-distinct mode families are simultaneously excited, periodic motions are generically not single-trace; for generic superintegrable initial data the particles lie on distinct closed curves, producing multi-trace motion. In special cases this multi-trace structure organizes into sub-choreographies supported on distinct traces; we refer to this structured splitting as choreographic fragmentation. The cases $n=4,5,6$ are analyzed explicitly. In particular, for $n=6$ the maximally superintegrable resonance $1{:}2{:}3$ yields periodic but generically multi-trace dynamics, whereas a single-trace six-body choreography occurs only at the degenerate resonance $1{:}2{:}2$.</description>

      <title>Conditional thinning and multiplicative statistics of Laguerre-type orthogonal polynomial ensembles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.18113</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.18113v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the local statistics of orthogonal polynomial ensembles near a hard edge, subject to a multiplicative deformation of the measure. Probabilistically, this deformation corresponds to a position-dependent conditional thinning of the particles. We prove that, under critical hard edge scaling and for a large class of potentials and deformation symbols, the correlation kernel of the conditional ensemble converges to a universal limit, which we identify as the conditional thinned Bessel point process.
  We derive an explicit expression for this limiting kernel in terms of the solution to a nonlocal integrable system depending on a parameter. For a special choice of the parameter, this system was recently identified in the study of multiplicative statistics of the Bessel point process. Our results establish that this system governs the full correlation structure of the conditional Bessel point process, extending the classical connection between the standard Bessel kernel and the Painlev\'e V equation.</description>

      <title>The cross states of a composite quantum system: separability and entanglement in any Hilbert space dimension</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.18125</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.18125v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce a class of states of a composite quantum system, the so-called cross states, that turn out to play a major role in the theory of entanglement for a genuinely infinite-dimensional bipartite system. In the case where at least one of the Hilbert spaces of the bipartition is finite-dimensional, all states are cross states, whereas, in the genuinely infinite-dimensional setting where the dimension of both Hilbert spaces is not finite, the cross states form a trace-norm dense, convex, proper subset of the set of all states. In the latter case, the cross states can be regarded as those physical states that possess a finite amount of entanglement; accordingly, all separable states are of this kind. We prove that, for any Hilbert space dimension, the separable states can be characterized as those cross states that minimize a suitable norm, i.e., the projective norm associated with the projective tensor product of two trace classes; all other cross states are density operators belonging to the projective tensor product space. This is a generalization of the classical cross norm criterion of separability. Finally, we define an extended real-valued entanglement function and study its main properties. Coherently with the interpretation of cross states as finitely entangled states, this function is finite, and coincides with the projective norm, precisely on the cross states of the system.</description>

      <title>Twisted symmetric exclusion processes and set-theoretical $R$-matrices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.18204</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.18204v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate periodic integrable Markov models, constructed from set-theoretical solutions of the Yang-Baxter equation. We first focus on the simplest class of solutions, called Lyubashenko solutions. We show that the resulting models are equivalent to some twisted Symmetric Simple Exclusion Process (SSEP), which are usual periodic SSEP models where a twist is added on a bond of the ring. We also provide various possible interpretations for these Markov models. Then, we study the long time dynamics of the twisted SSEP, characterising its different stationary states and counting them. Allowing the twist to vary, we examine the possible transitions between the different stationary states. Finally, we extend our construction of Markov models to set-theoretical solutions that are more general than Lyubashenko solutions and show that such models are not equivalent to a twisted SSEP in general.</description>

      <title>Chern-Simons deformations of the gauged O(3) Sigma model on compact surfaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.17857</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.17857v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Existence of solutions to the field equations of the gauged Chern-Simons-O(3)-Sigma model on a compact Riemann surface is proved by a topological method. Existence of a minimal deformation constant $\kappa_{*} &gt; 0$ is proved, such that for any prescribed configuration of vortices and antivortices, at least one solution exists for $|\kappa| \leq \kappa_{*}$. For small values of the Chern-Simons deformation parameter $\kappa$, it is proved that the field equations admit multiple solutions, provided the total number of vortices and antivortices are different. The Maxwell limit is computed for solutions of the field equations. In contrast, if the number of vortices equals the number of antivortices, it is proved that the field equations admit at least one solution for any value of $\kappa$ and the limit $\kappa \to \infty$ is proved. dependence of the fields on the deformation parameter is investigated numerically on the sphere.</description>

      <title>Nonlocal-to-local $L^p$-convergence of convolution operators with singular, anisotropic kernels</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.18183</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.18183v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study nonlocal convolution-type operators with singular, possibly anisotropic kernels. Our main objective is to establish and quantify their nonlocal-to-local convergence to a local differential operator with natural boundary conditions, as the kernels concentrate at the origin in a suitable way. Such convergence results provide a useful tool for the physical justification of mathematical models, particularly in situations where the desired local differential operator cannot be directly derived from microscopic laws. The present work substantially extends previous results by allowing kernels with stronger singularities (comparable to those of fractional Laplacians), anisotropic and non-localized kernels, and by proving strong convergence in general $L^p$ spaces together with explicit convergence rates.</description>

      <title>Quantitative concentration inequalities for the uniform approximation of the IDS</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.18214</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.18214v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The integrated density of states (IDS) is a fundamental spectral quantity for quantum Hamiltonians modeling condensed matter systems, describing how densely energy levels are distributed. It can be interpreted as a volume-averaged spectral distribution. Hence, there are two equivalent definitions of the IDS related by the Pastur-Shubin formula: an operator-theoretic trace formula and a limit of normalized eigenvalue counting functions on finite volumes. We study a discrete random Schr\"odinger operator with bounded random potentials of finite-range correlations and prove a quantitative concentration inequality ensuring, with explicit high probability, that the empirical IDS (normalized eigenvalue counting function) uniformly approximates the abstract IDS trace formula within a prescribed error, thereby implying confidence regions for the IDS.</description>

      <title>Polytopes of alternating sign matrices with dihedral-subgroup symmetry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.18427</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.18427v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the convex hulls of the eight dihedral symmetry classes of $n \times n$ alternating sign matrices, i.e., ASMs invariant under a subgroup of the symmetry group of the square. Extending the prefix-sum description of the ASM polytope, we develop a uniform core--assembly framework: each symmetry class is encoded by a set of core positions and an affine assembly map that reconstructs the full matrix from its core. This reduction transfers polyhedral questions to lower-dimensional core polytopes, which are better suited to the tool set of polyhedral combinatorics, while retaining complete information about the original symmetry class. For the vertical, vertical--horizontal, half-turn, diagonal, diagonal--antidiagonal, and total symmetry classes, we give explicit polynomial-size linear inequality descriptions of the associated polytopes. In these cases, we also determine the dimension and provide facet descriptions. The quarter-turn symmetry class behaves differently: the natural relaxation admits fractional vertices, and we need to extend the system with a structured family of parity-type Chv\'atal--Gomory inequalities to obtain the quarter-turn symmetric ASM polytope. Our framework leads to efficient algorithms for computing minimum-cost ASMs in each symmetry class and provides a direct link between the combinatorics of symmetric ASMs and tools from polyhedral combinatorics and combinatorial optimization.</description>

      <title>Generalized finite and affine $W$-algebras in type $A$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.00271</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.00271v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We construct a new family of affine $W$-algebras $W^k(\lambda,\mu)$ parameterized by partitions $\lambda$ and $\mu$ associated with the centralizers of nilpotent elements in $\mathfrak{gl}_N$. The new family unifies a few known classes of $W$-algebras. In particular, for the column-partition $\lambda$ we recover the affine $W$-algebras $W^k(\mathfrak{gl}_N,f)$ of Kac, Roan and Wakimoto, associated with nilpotent elements $f\in\mathfrak{gl}_N$ of type $\mu$. Our construction is based on a version of the BRST complex of the quantum Drinfeld-Sokolov reduction. We show that the application of the Zhu functor to the vertex algebras $W^k(\lambda,\mu)$ yields a family of generalized finite $W$-algebras $U(\lambda,\mu)$ which we also describe independently as associative algebras.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2507.12182v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The paper is concerned with deformed Wigner random matrices. These matrices are closely related to Deep Neural Networks (DNNs): weight matrices of trained DNNs could be represented in the form $R + S$, where $R$ is random and $S$ is highly correlated. The spectrum of such matrices plays a key role in rigorous underpinning of the novel pruning technique based on Random Matrix Theory. In practice, the spectrum of the matrix $S$ can be rather complicated. In this paper, we develop an asymptotic analysis for the case of full rank $S$ with increasing number of outlier eigenvalues.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2511.15527v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We analyze Su-Schrieffer-Heeger (SSH) models using the doubling method for orthogonal polynomial sequences. This approach yields the analytical spectrum and exact eigenstates of the models. We demonstrate that the standard SSH model is associated with the doubling of Chebyshev polynomials. Extending this technique to the doubling of other finite sequences enables the construction of Hamiltonians for inhomogeneous SSH models which are exactly solvable. We detail the specific cases associated with Krawtchouk and $q$-Racah polynomials. This work highlights the utility of polynomial-doubling techniques in obtaining exact solutions for physical models.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2512.07763v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we consider the parameterization of the spectra of the three-state critical Potts quantum chain with integrable twisted boundary conditions in terms of Bethe ansatz type equations. The Bethe equations are found by investigating the structure of the eigenvalues of the respective twisted transfer matrices, and with the help of certain identities satisfied by the product of transfer matrix operators. We have studied the completeness of the spectrum in terms of the Bethe roots for small lattice sizes and have computed the eigenstate momenta. We found that the spins of the low-lying excitations can have fractional values in accordance with predictions of the underlying conformal field theory. We argue that our framework can be used to build integrable Hamiltonians whose spectra are determined by mixing different toroidal boundary conditions.</description>

      <title>The multinomial dimer model</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.12171v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The dimer model is a classical statistical mechanics model which is exactly solvable in two dimensions, but about which little is known in higher dimensions. In analogy with large $N$ limits in lattice gauge theory, we study a large $N$ limit of the dimer model in any dimension $d$. The dependence on $N$ comes from the multinomial tiling model introduced by Kenyon and Pohoata, which gives a general framework for adding a dependence on $N$ to a tiling model. We study the behavior of this model on periodic bipartite graphs in ${\mathbb R}^d$, in the scaling limit as the multiplicity $N$ and then the size of the graph go to infinity.
  In this iterated limit, in any dimension $d$, we prove a variational principle and show that random configurations concentrate on a limit shape which is the unique solution to an associated system of Euler-Lagrange equations. The rate function of the variational principle is the integral of a surface tension function, which we can compute explicitly for lattices in any dimension $d$ as the Legendre dual of the free energy for the model on the torus. We give a unified methodology for computing the surface tension and Euler-Lagrange equations in any dimension $d$.
  A new structure called the critical gauge also emerges in the large $N$ limit. We show that the critical gauge functions converges in the scaling limit to a limiting gauge function which is the unique solution to a dual Euler-Lagrange equation. This limiting gauge function determines the limit shape and vice versa.
  We further use our techniques to compute explicit limit shapes in some two and three dimensional examples, such as the Aztec diamond and "Aztec cuboid". This is one of the first stat mech models in dimensions $d\ge3$ where limit shapes can be computed explicitly.</description>

      <title>Perturbative renormalisation of the $\Phi^4_{4-\varepsilon}$ model via generalized Wick maps</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.03820</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.03820v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We consider the perturbative renormalisation of the $\Phi^4_d$ model from Euclidean Quantum Field Theory for any, possibly non-integer dimension $d&lt;4$. The so-called BPHZ renormalisation, named after Bogoliubov, Parasiuk, Hepp and Zimmermann, is usually encoded into extraction-contraction operations on Feynman diagrams, which have a complicated combinatorics. We show that the same procedure can be encoded in the much simpler algebra of polynomials in two unknowns $X$ and $Y$, which represent the fourth and second Wick power of the field. In this setting, renormalisation takes the form of a \lq\lq Wick map\rq\rq\ which maps monomials into Bell polynomials. The construction makes use of recent results by Bruned and Hou on multiindices, which are algebraic objects of intermediate complexity between Feynman diagrams and polynomials.</description>

We discuss its link with the Kohn-Nirenberg quantization of the phase space $G\times \widehat{G}$. We use it to argue that in this abstract setting the Wigner-Weyl quantization, when it exists, can still be interpreted as a symmetric ordering. Then, we identify all generalized (non-normalizable) pure states having a positive Kirkwood-Dirac distribution. They are, up to the natural action of the Weyl-Heisenberg group, Haar measures on closed subgroups. This generalizes a result known for finite abelian groups. We then show that the classical fragment of quantum mechanics associated with the Kirkwood-Dirac distribution is non-trivial if and only if the group has a compact identity component. Finally, we provide for connected compact abelian groups a complete geometric description of this classical fragment.</description>

      <title>Kerr-Schild transformation of the Benenti-Francaviglia metric</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.06561</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.06561v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The Benenti-Francaviglia (BF) family of metrics provides the most general form of a spacetime metric that admits two mutually commuting Killing vectors and an irreducible Killing tensor. The geodesic equations for the BF family are thus completely integrable by separation of variables. Within this broad class, we explore the Kerr-Schild transformation of a degenerate subclass distinguished by the existence of a shear-free null geodesic congruence. By requiring the deformed metric to preserve the Killing symmetry and circularity, we demonstrate that the deformed metric again falls into the degenerate BF family, modulo the replacement of a single structure function. We apply the present algorithm to ${\cal N}=2$ gauged supergravity and obtain a dyonic generalization of the Chong-Cveti\v{c}-L\"u-Pope rotating black hole solution, by taking the background metric to be a solution of the Einstein-scalar gravity. The present prescription extends to five dimensions, provided that the constant of geodesic motion associated with the extra Killing direction vanishes. The same reasoning applies to the case where the background degenerate BF metric is distorted in a (non)conformal manner. Our formalism offers a unified perspective on the relation between seed and deformed metrics in the Kerr-Schild construction.</description>

      <title>Exploring quantum fields in rotating black holes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.17623</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.17623v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we discuss the Unruh state for a free scalar quantum field on Kerr-de Sitter under the assumption of mode stability. We summarise the proof of its Hadamard property that was previously given in [C.Klein, Annales Henri Poincar\'e 24 (2023) 7, 2401-2442] for sufficiently small black-hole rotation and cosmological constant, and show how it can be generalised to any subextreme black-hole angular momentum in the same range of the cosmological constant. This is done by extending a geometric analysis of the trapped set of the Kerr spacetime [D. H\"afner, C. Klein, Lett.Math.Phys. 114 (2024) 5, 119] to Kerr-de Sitter. Moreover, we discuss the application of this state in the numerical study of quantum effects at the inner horizon [C. Klein, M. Soltani, M. Casals, S. Hollands, Phys.Rev.Lett. 132 (2024) 12, 121501], and describe a universality result for these effects [P. Hintz, C. Klein, Class.Quant.Grav. 41 (2024) 7, 075006].</description>

      <title>Burau representation, Squier's form, and non-Abelian anyons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.18186</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.18186v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We introduce a frequency-tunable, two-dimensional non-Abelian control of operation order constructed from the reduced Burau representation of the braid group $B_3$, specialised at $t=e^{i\omega}$ and unitarized by Squier's Hermitian form. Coupled to two non-commuting qubit unitaries $A$, $B$, the resulting switch admits a closed expression for the single-shot Helstrom success probability and a fixed-order ceiling $p_{\mathrm{fixed}}$, defining the fixed-order ceiling $p_{\mathrm{fixed}}^*$ and the witness gaps $\Delta_{\rm sw}(\omega)=p_{\mathrm{switch}}(\omega)-p_{\mathrm{fixed}}^*$ and $\Delta_{\rm test}(\omega)=p_{\mathrm{test}}(\omega)-p_{\mathrm{fixed}}^*$.
  The non-Abelian mixers can either enhance or suppress the bare switch advantage, which we quantify by the interference contrast $\Delta_{\rm int}(\omega):=\Delta_{\rm test}(\omega)-\Delta_{\rm sw}(\omega)=p_{\rm test}(\omega)-p_{\rm switch}(\omega)$. Across the Squier positivity region, $\Delta_{\rm int}(\omega)$ takes both positive (constructive) and negative (destructive) values, a hallmark of matrix-valued (non-Abelian) order control, while $\Delta_{\rm sw}(\omega)&gt;0$ certifies algebraic causal non-separability.
  Numerical simulations confirm both enhancement and suppression regimes, establishing a minimal $B_3$ braid control that reproduces the characteristic interference pattern expected from a \emph{Gedankenexperiment} in anyonic statistics.</description>

      <title>Non-perturbative data for Weil-Petersson volumes and intersection numbers using ordinary differential equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.03351</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.03351v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recently, a new method was introduced for computing $V_{g,1}(b)$, the Weil-Petersson volumes of the moduli space of Riemann surfaces of genus $g$ with one geodesic boundary of length $b$, various supersymmetric generalizations of them, as well as analogous quantities in intersection theory. The physical setting is the computation of a certain one-point function in a variety of models of 2D gravity for which there is a double-scaled random matrix model (RMM) description. The method combines perturbative solutions of two ordinary differential equations (ODEs), the Gel'fand-Dikii resolvent equation, and the RMM's string equation. In this paper, we extend the method to extract non-perturbative information about the $V_{g,1}(b)$ (and their analogues) that is naturally contained in the full ODEs, providing an efficient prescription for computing the transseries coefficients of the one-point correlation function, fully incorporating ZZ-brane and FZZT-brane effects, and for the first time, mixed ZZ-FZZT-effects. We use as a case study the (2,3) minimal string, computing perturbative and non-perturbative quantities, comparing them to perturbative results from topological recursion, and to results from the recent non-perturbative topological recursion framework. As a particularly powerful further application we provide general predictions for the large order in $g$ growth of $V_{g,1}(b)$, and apply them to JT gravity, finding agreement with known results, and for analogous quantities in ${N} {=} 1$ JT supergravity, proving a conjecture of Stanford and Witten. Our predictions yield new growth formulae for the cases of ${N} {=} 2$ and ${N}{=}4$ JT supergravity.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2601.19734v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A single geometric invariant fixes the relative normalization and structure of gravity, Yang-Mills theory, and fermion kinetic terms -- including ghost freedom in the gravitational sector -- without tuning. Our results establish a minimal geometric route to unification that does not rely on extra dimensions or symmetry breaking by hand. Unlike previous gauge-gravity constructions, the relative normalizations and ghost freedom emerge from a single Clifford-algebraic invariant, without explicit symmetry breaking.</description>

      <title>Group character averages via a single Laguerre</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.16088</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.16088v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Average of exponential ${\rm Tr}_R e^X$, i.e. of a group rather than an algebra character, in Gaussian matrix model is known to be an amusing generalization of Schur polynomial, where time variables are substituted by traces of products of non-commuting matrices ${\rm Tr} \left(\prod_i A_{k_i}\right)$ and are thus labeled by weak compositions. The entries of matrices $A_k$ are made from extended Laguerre polynomials, what introduces additional difficulties. We describe the generic sum rules, which express arbitrary traces through convolutions of a single Laguerre polynomial $L_{N-1}^1(z_{k_i})$, what is a considerable simplification.</description>

      <title>The Kinematics and Dynamics Theories of a Total Lagrangian Finite Element Analysis Framework for Finite Deformation Multibody Dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.17002</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.17002v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This work presents a Total Lagrangian finite element formulation for deformable body dynamics. We employ the TL-FEA framework to simulate the time evolution of collections of bodies whose motion is constrained by kinematic constraints and which mutually interact through contact and friction. These bodies experience large displacements, large deformations, and large rotations. A systematic approach is proposed for classifying and posing kinematic constraints acting between the bodies present in the system. We derive the governing equations for ANCF beam, ANCF shell, and tetrahedral elements, and present hyperelastic material models including St. Venant-Kirchhoff and Mooney-Rivlin formulations with their corresponding internal force contributions and consistent tangent stiffness matrices. A finite-strain Kelvin-Voigt viscous damping model is incorporated in the TL-FEA formulation for numerical stability.</description>
