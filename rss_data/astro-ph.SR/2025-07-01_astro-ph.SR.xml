      <title>Fewer Companions in the Crowd: The Low Close Binary Fraction in Globular Clusters from Gaia RVS</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.00131</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.00131v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In dense environments like globular clusters (GCs), dynamical interactions can disrupt or harden close binaries, nonetheless, detailed comparisons with field binary fractions remain limited. Here, we present an analysis of the close binary fraction in a carefully selected sample of field stars and 10 GCs using Gaia Radial Velocity Spectrometer (RVS) data, which is among the largest samples of GCs analysed using multi-epoch spectroscopy to date. By assessing the peak-to-peak variations of the sources' radial velocity (RV), we estimate the close binary fractions through a method that fits the distribution as the product of two Gaussian distributions. By applying the same RV-variability method to both cluster members and field stars, we ensure a homogeneous and inclusive comparison between the two environments. Despite matching stellar parameters between the field and GC samples, our findings confirm that GCs possess a significantly lower close binary fraction than field stars. Interestingly, we do not detect any clear trend of binary fraction with cluster metallicity; metal-rich and metal-poor GCs are uniformly binary-poor (within uncertainties). We discuss possible interpretations, including dynamical hardening in dense environments and the effects of common envelope evolution, which may lead to companion accretion or merger events.</description>

      <title>Metal-poor single Wolf-Rayet stars: the interplay of optically thick winds and rotation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.00137</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.00137v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Small Magellanic Cloud (SMC) hosts 12 known Wolf-Rayet stars (WRs), seven of which apparently single. Their formation is a challenge for current stellar evolution models, because line-driven winds are generally assumed to be quenched at a metallicity Z&lt;0.004. Here, we present a set of MESA models of single stars with zero-age main sequence masses 20-80 M_sun, considering different initial rotation speeds (Omega=0-0.7 Omega_c), metallicities (Z=0.002-0.0045), and wind mass-loss models (optically thin and thick winds). We show that if we account for optically thick winds, as described by Sabhahit+2023, fast rotating (Omega=0.6 Omega_c) single metal-poor O-type stars (with M&gt;20 M_sun) shed their envelope and become WR stars even at the low metallicity of the SMC. The luminosity, effective temperature, evolutionary timescale, surface abundance, and rotational velocity of our simulated WR stars are compatible to the WRs observed in the SMC. We speculate that this scenario can also alleviate the excess of giant stars across the Humphreys-Davidson limit. Our results have key implications for black hole masses, (pair instability) supernova explosions, and other observable signatures.</description>

      <title>Study of the peculiar variable star Khavchenko 1</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.00149</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.00149v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The work is devoted to the study of the peculiar variable star Khavchenko 1 in Auriga. It was discovered by the 7th grade student Sergey Khavchenko in 2020. The brightness of the star varies with an amplitude of about 0.4 magnitude and the period of 4.213 days. Initially the star could not have been attributed to any known type of variability. Its light curve looks like the upside-down light curve of the eclipsing binary similar to that of luminous red nova V1309 Scorpii a few years before the eruption. The analysis of the new data from the ZTF project gathered from 2020 till 2024 has shown the cyclic variations of the light curve amplitude. We have proposed several possible models of this system which can explain such an unusual behavior of this star. The continued observations of this star are necessary to reveal the period changes and to estimate the possible eruption date.</description>

      <title>Magnetic field monitoring of four massive A-F supergiants</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.00282</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.00282v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We report magnetic field measurements spanning about 15 years of four massive ($7.5-15 M_\odot$) supergiant stars: $\alpha$ Per (HD\,20902, F5Iab), $\alpha$ Lep (HD\,36673A, F0Ib), $\eta$ Leo (HD\,87737, A0Ib) and 13 Mon (HD\,46300, A1Ib). For each star, spectropolarimetric observations were collected using ESPaDOnS at the Canada-France-Hawaii Telescope. The observed spectra were co-added, normalized, then processed using Least Squares Deconvolution (LSD) to yield mean Stokes $I$ and $V$ profiles. Each spectrum was analyzed to infer the False Alarm Probability of signal detection, and the longitudinal magnetic field was measured. This process yielded persistent detection of magnetic fields in all four stars. The median $1\sigma$ longitudinal field uncertainty of the Zeeman detections was 0.6~G. The maximum unsigned longitudinal magnetic fields measured from the detections are rather weak, ranging from $0.34\pm 0.19$ G for $\alpha$ Lep to $2.61\pm 0.55$ G for 13 Mon. The Zeeman signatures show different levels of complexity; those of the two hotter stars are relatively simple, while those of the two cooler stars are more complex. The stars also exhibited different levels of variability of their Zeeman signatures and longitudinal fields. We report periodic variability of the longitudinal field and (complex) Stokes $V$ profiles of $\alpha$ Per with a period of either 50.75 or 90 days. The (simple) Stokes $V$ profiles of 13~Mon, and probably those of $\eta$ Leo, show global polarity changes once during the period of observation, but the data are insufficient to place strong constraints on the variability timescales.</description>

      <title>Exploring the probing power of gamma-Dor's inertial dip for core magnetism: case of a toroidal field</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.00308</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.00308v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Gamma-Dor stars are ideal targets for studies of stellar innermost dynamical properties due to their rich asteroseismic spectrum of gravity modes. Integrating internal magnetism to the picture appears as the next milestone of detailed asteroseismic studies, for its prime importance on stellar evolution. The inertial dip in prograde dipole modes period-spacing pattern of gamma-Dors stands out as a unique window on the convective core structure and dynamics. Recent studies have highlighted the dependence of the dip structure on core density stratification, contrast of the near-core Brunt-V\"ais\"al\"a frequency and rotation rate, as well as the core-to-near-core differential rotation. In the meantime, the effect of magnetism has been derived on envelope modes. We aim to revisit the inertial dip formation including core and envelope magnetism, and explore the probing power of this feature on dynamo-generated core fields. We consider a toroidal magnetic field with a bi-layer (core and envelope) Alfv\'en frequency. This configuration allows us to revisit the coupling problem using our knowledge on both core magneto-inertial modes and envelope magneto-gravito-inertial modes. We stay in an analytical framework to exhibit the magnetic effects on the inertial dip shape and location, setting up a laboratory towards the comprehension of magnetic effects on the dip structure. We show a shift of the inertial dip towards lower spin parameter values and a thinner dip with increasing core magnetic field, quite similar to the signature of differential rotation. The magnetic effects become sizeable when the ratio between the magnetic and the Coriolis effects is large enough. We explore the degeneracy of the magnetic effects with differential rotation. We study the detectability of core magnetism, considering observational constraints on the modes periods and potential gravito-inertial mode suppression.</description>

      <title>Connecting mean-field theory with dynamo simulations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.00632</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.00632v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Mean-field dynamo theory, describing the evolution of large-scale magnetic fields, has been the mainstay of theoretical interpretation of magnetism in astrophysical objects such as the Sun for several decades. More recently, three-dimensional magnetohydrodynamic simulations have reached a level of fidelity where they capture dynamo action self-consistently on local and global scales without resorting to parametrization of unresolved scales. Recent global simulations also capture many of the observed characteristics of solar and stellar large-scale magnetic fields and cycles. Successful explanation of the results of such simulations with corresponding mean-field models is a crucial validation step for mean-field dynamo theory. Here the connections between mean-field theory and current dynamo simulations are reviewed. These connections range from the numerical computation of turbulent transport coefficients to mean-field models of simulations, and their relevance to the solar dynamo. Finally, the most notable successes and current challenges in mean-field theoretical interpretations of simulations are summarized.</description>

      <title>The effect of local magnetic fields in quiet regions of stellar atmospheres simulated with MANCHA</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.00636</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.00636v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Our aim is to characterize the effects of the local magnetic fields in quiet regions of stellar atmospheres. We compute magneto-hydrodynamic and purely hydrodynamic simulations of G2V, K0V and M2V star. The magnetic simulations are started from the hydrodynamical ones, adding the Biermann battery term in the induction equation to produce a magnetic seed, that is enhanced by the action of the small-scale dynamo. Once the magnetic field is saturated, we compare the simulations with and without magnetic fields and characterize the differences in statistics of velocities, appearance of granulation, and the mean stratification of a number of relevant parameters. These differences are also compared with the deviations produced by different treatments of the opacity in the simulations. The saturation values of the magnetic fields are $\sim 100$ G for the three stars in their surface, consistent with the recent results for cool stars, and other results for the Sun in the literature. The local magnetic fields have a negligible effect on the velocities of the plasma or the mean stratifications of the simulated stars. In contrast, they produce changes in the bolometric intensity of the intergranular lanes and the power spectrum at small scales of the temperature and vertical velocity of downflows. Significant differences between the hydrodynamic and magneto-hydrodynamic simulations are also found for the kinetic energy. This difference in energy can be explained by the transformation of kinetic into magnetic energy, which is consistent with the action of the small-scale dynamo.</description>

      <title>Light Curve Analysis Of W-uma Type Binary Systems Rz Umi, Oq Uma, Lp Uma</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.00768</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.00768v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study presents new, high-quality, optical photometric observations of three W UMa type contact binaries. The analysis of the corresponding light curves is made using Djurasevic's inverse problem method. To explain the light curve asymmetries and variations, we used the Roche model that involved regions containing spots on the components. The fundamental parameters of these systems were derived, including the mass ratios determined using the q-search method. Hypotheses involving active surface regions, such as dark spots on the primary and secondary components, or bright spots in the neck region due to magnetic activity or continuous mass transfer between components, were examined to explain the varying amplitudes of maxima and nearly equal minima depths in the light curves. Using the derived orbital and physical parameters, three-dimensional models were constructed for various orbital phases.</description>

      <title>The Gaia-ESO Survey: Projected Rotational Velocities of B stars in the Carina Nebula</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.00800</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.00800v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Carina Nebula is an active star-forming region with several open clusters rich in massive OB stars, thus making it an optimal target for studying stellar properties such as rotation for large samples of these early-type stars. We studied a sample of early-type stars probable members of the 8 open clusters in the Carina Complex. The observational data consist of high-resolution spectra from the Gaia-ESO public Spectroscopic Survey. Astrometric and photometric data from Gaia EDR3 and radial velocities measured from the observed spectra are used to confirm the cluster members. The projected rotational velocities of 330 early-type stars of Carina are derived from the widths of \ion{He}{i} lines at 4388 and 4471 \AA. The reported \Vsini\ values are the first estimates for 222 early-type stars. The \Vsini\ distribution for the Carina clusters peaks at $\sim$100-150 \kms, consistent with the distributions for B stars in Galactic clusters. \Vsini\ estimates for stars members of the clusters Trumpler 15, Collinder 228, Collinder 232, and Bochum 11 are presented for the first time in the literature. For a subsample of stars with earlier spectral types from B0 to B3, we find a bimodal distribution, with a third, small peak towards the upper values of \Vsini. When the full sample is split according to the parent cluster, we find that the oldest cluster in our sample, NGC 3293, presents a higher concentration of rapidly rotating stars. In contrast, Collinder 228 presents a larger number of stars with lower \Vsini.</description>

      <title>Photospheric Helium Abundance in Cool Giants -- A Comprehensive Study</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.00801</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.00801v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: High-resolution optical spectra of sixteen red giants, two early asymptotic giant branch (AGB) stars, and two supergiants, having no/minimal to super lithium (Li)-rich abundances, are analyzed to investigate the helium (He)-enhancement. The spectra of eight giants were obtained from the Himalayan Chandra Telescope, and for the rest of the program stars the spectral data were collected from various public archives. Our detailed abundance analyses of the program stars involve the determination of stellar parameters and abundances for about 20 elements among the key abundances of He, Li, C, N, O and the 12C/13C ratios. The difference in the Mg-abundance derived from Mg I lines and the MgH band, and the difference in carbon abundance from C I and the CH-band, are used as a clue to the mild hydrogen-deficiency/helium-enhancement. From this analysis, four red giants, an early-AGB star and a supergiant star were found to be enhanced in helium. All these He-enhanced stars are also found to be super Li-rich except for the supergiant. Since the He-rich red giants are Li-rich as well, this implies, that He-enrichment is accompanied by Li-enrichment but not vice-versa. This is the first spectroscopic measurement of photospheric He-abundance in normal and Li-rich field giants. The Li-enrichment is observed across the giant branch from RGB-bump (KIC 9821622) to AGB phase, unlike that expected from the RGB-tip to RC-phase. A plausible scenario for the enrichment of He and as well as Li in giants is the fresh synthesis of Li in the interiors of giants and dredging up along with He to the surface, from deeper layers. However, there could be multiple scenarios operating in tandem. This analysis of He- and Li-enrichment along with other key elements provides more insights to decipher the mystery of Li-enrichment in giants.</description>

      <title>The Evolution of Pop III.1 Protostars Powered by Dark Matter Annihilation. I. Fiducial model and first results</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.00870</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.00870v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The existence of billion-solar-mass quasars at redshifts $z \gtrsim 7$ poses a formidable challenge to theories of black hole formation, requiring pathways for the rapid growth of massive seeds. Population III.1 stars, forming in pristine, dense dark matter (DM) minihalos, are compelling progenitors. This study presents a suite of stellar evolution models for accreting Pop III.1 protostars, calculated with the \textsc{GENEC} code. We systematically explore a wide parameter space, spanning ambient WIMP densities of $\rho_\chi \sim 10^{12}\mbox{-}10^{16}\,\mathrm{GeV\,cm^{-3}}$ and gas accretion rates of $10^{-3}\mbox{-}10^{-1}\,M_\odot\,\mathrm{yr^{-1}}$, to quantify the effects of DM annihilation. A central finding is that for a protostar to grow to supermassive scales ($\gtrsim 10^5 \, M_{\odot}$), the ambient DM density in the immediate vicinity of the star must exceed a critical threshold of $\rho_{\chi} \gtrsim 5 \times 10^{14} \, \text{GeV cm}^{-3}$. The energy injected by WIMP annihilation inflates the protostar, lowering its surface temperature, which suppresses the ionizing feedback that would otherwise halt accretion and significantly delays the onset of hydrogen fusion. This heating also governs the star's final fate: in dense halos ($\rho_\chi \gtrsim 10^{15}\,\mathrm{GeV\,cm^{-3}}$), stars remain stable against general relativistic instability beyond $10^6 \, M_{\odot}$, whereas at lower densities ($\rho_\chi \lesssim 10^{13}\,\mathrm{GeV\,cm^{-3}}$), they collapse at masses of $\sim 5 \times 10^5 \, M_{\odot}$. Once the DM fuel is exhausted and core burning commences, the protostar contracts and its ionising photon output can reach very high levels $\sim 10^{53} s^{-1}$. These distinct evolutionary phases offer clear observational signatures for the JWST, providing a robust, physically-grounded pathway for forming heavy black hole seeds in the early universe.</description>

      <title>The impact of differential rotation on the stochastic excitation of acoustic modes in solar-like pulsators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.00919</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.00919v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Acoustic modes are excited by turbulent convection in the outer convective envelope of solar-like stars. Observational results from asteroseismic studies show that 44% of solar-like stars do not present detectable stochastically-excited acoustic modes. This phenomenon appears to be related to their rotation rate and magnetic activity. In a first paper, we showed that uniform rotation tends to diminish the mode amplitudes significantly. However, convective envelopes in solar-type stars are differentially rotating: the rotation rate difference between mid-latitudes and the equator can go up to 60%, as shown by recent asteroseismic works. In this paper, we examine the impact of differential rotation on the stochastic excitation of acoustic modes in solar-like stars. We provide theoretical predictions for the excitation of acoustic modes in a differentially rotating solar-like star. We use the Rotating Mixing-Length Theory approach to model the local influence of differential rotation on convection. We then estimate the resulting impact on power injection by turbulent convection into oscillation modes numerically, using a combination of the MESA stellar structure and evolution code and GYRE stellar pulsation code. We show that the power injected in acoustic modes differs by up to 30 % for stars with the same mean rotation rate $5 \Omega_{\odot}$ but a distinct differential rotation rate. The excitation of axisymmetric acoustic modes is further inhibited in the anti-solar differential rotation regime where the pole of stars rotates faster than their equator when compared to the uniform rotation case. This could hinder mode detection in such configurations. This study permits a first prediction of the excitation of acoustic modes as a function of the differential rotation in solar-like pulsators.</description>

      <title>Inverse Velocity Dispersion of Solar Energetic Protons Observed by Solar Orbiter and Its Shock Acceleration Explanation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.00954</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.00954v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The particle acceleration and transport process during solar eruptions is one of the critical and long-standing problems in space plasma physics. Through decades of research, it is well accepted that particles with higher energies released during a solar eruption arrive at observers earlier than the particles with lower energies, forming a well-known structure in the dynamic energy spectrum called particle velocity dispersion (VD), as frequently observed by space missions. However, this picture is challenged by new observations from NASA's Parker Solar Probe and ESA's Solar Orbiter which show an unexpected inverse velocity dispersion (IVD) phenomenon, where particles with higher-energies arrive later at the observer. Facing on the challenge, we here report the recent discovery of such IVD structures with 10 solar energetic proton events observed by Solar Orbiter, and then analyze the mechanisms causing this unusual phenomenon. We suggest that shock diffusive acceleration, with respect to magnetic reconnection, is probably a dominant mechanism to accelerate protons to tens of MeV in such events where particles need longer time to reach higher energies. And we determine, innovatively, the physical conditions and time scales during the actual shock acceleration process that cannot be observed directly.</description>

      <title>Atmospheric model-trained machine learning selection and classification of ultracool TY dwarfs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.00957</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.00957v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The T and Y spectral classes represent the coolest and lowest-mass population of brown dwarfs, yet their census remains incomplete due to limited statistics. Existing detection frameworks are often constrained to identifying M, L, and early T dwarfs, owing to the sparse observational sample of ultracool dwarfs (UCDs) at later types. This paper presents a novel machine learning framework capable of detecting and classifying late-T and Y dwarfs, trained entirely on synthetic photometry from atmospheric models. Utilizing grids from the ATMO 2020 and Sonora Bobcat models, I produce a training dataset over two orders of magnitude larger than any empirical set of &gt;T6 UCDs. Polynomial color relations fitted to the model photometry are used to assign spectral types to these synthetic models, which in turn train an ensemble of classifiers to identify and classify the spectral type of late UCDs. The model is highly performant when validating on both synthetic and empirical datasets, verifying catalogs of known UCDs with object classification metrics &gt;99% and an average spectral type precision within 0.35 +/- 0.37 subtypes. Application of the model to a 1.5 degree region around Pisces and the UKIDSS UDS field results in the discovery of one previously uncatalogued T8.2 candidate, demonstrating the ability of this model-trained approach in discovering faint, late-type UCDs from photometric catalogs.</description>

      <title>Discovery and study of the eclipsing variable star Grigoriev 1</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.01005</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.01005v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This work is dedicated to the discovery of the eclipsing variable star Grigoriev 1 and determining the parameters of its binary system. The star was found through the systematic checking of ultraviolet sources of GALEX space observatory in Pegasus constellation. Analysis of the ZTF project data has shown the presence of eclipses with two magnitudes depth and a period of 6.5997 days. The duration of eclipse covers only 1% of the orbital period, and the partial phases are at least 30 times shorter. Those parameters imply that the star is a detached binary system with a white dwarf seen edge-on. The new object was added to the International Variable Star Index AAVSO VSX as Grigoriev 1. Over the 10 million objects in VSX database there are only 188 variable stars of EA/WD type. Grigoriev 1 has the longest orbital period out of those. Moreover, its absolute magnitude M at maximum light from Gaia space observatory data is about +6.8. On the color-luminosity diagram it occupies the intermediate position between hot subdwarfs and white dwarfs which makes it even more interesting and worth studying at professional telescopes.</description>

      <title>Evidence of the Earth's inner radiation belts during the low Solar and geomagnetic activity obtained with the STEP-F instrument</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.21218</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.21218v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Purpose: The subject of research is the spatio-temporal charged particles in the Earth's magnetosphere outside the South Atlantic magnetic Anomaly during the 11-year cycle of solar activity minimum. The work aims at searching for and clarifying the sustained and unstable new spatial zones of enhanced subrelativistic electron fluxes at the altitudes of the low Earth orbit satellites.
  Design/methodology/approach: Finding and ascertainment of new radiation belts of the Earth were made by using the data analysis from the D1e channel of recording the electrons of energies of $\Delta E_e =180$-510 keV and protons of energies $\Delta E_p=3.5$-3.7 MeV of the position-sensitive silicon matrix detector and onto the solid angle of view of the detector head of the instrument was used.
  Findings: A sustained structure of three electron radiation belts in the Earth's magnetosphere was found at the low solar and geomagnetic activity in May 2009. The two belts are known since the beginning of the space age as the Van Allen radiation belts, and an additional permanent layer is formed around the drift shell with the McIlwaine parameter of $L\approx1.65$. On some days in May 2009, the two new inner radiation belts were observed simultaneously, one of those latter being recorded between the investigated sustained belt at $L\approx1.65$ and the Van Allen inner belt at $L\approx2.52$.
  Conclusions: The new found inner radiation belts are recorded in a wide range of geographic longitudes, both at the ascending and descending nodes of the satellite orbit.

      <title>Mid-Infrared Dust Evolution and Late-time Circumstellar Medium Interaction in SN 2017eaw</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.00125</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.00125v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present JWST/MIRI and complementary ground-based near-infrared observations of the Type II SN 2017eaw taken 6 years post-explosion. SN 2017eaw is still detected out to 25 $\mu$m and there is minimal evolution in the mid-infrared spectral energy distribution (SED) between the newly acquired JWST/MIRI observations and those taken a year earlier. Modeling of the mid-infrared SED reveals a cool $\sim$160 K dust component of $5.5\times10^{-4}\ \mathrm{M}_\odot$ and a hot $\sim$1700 K component of $5.4\times10^{-8}\ \mathrm{M}_\odot$ both composed of silicate dust. Notably there is no evidence of temperature or mass evolution in the cool dust component in the year between JWST observations. We also present new and archival HST and ground-based ultraviolet (UV) and optical observations which reveal reduced but continued circumstellar medium (CSM)-ejecta interaction at $&gt;$2000 days post-explosion. The UV and mid-infrared emission show similar decline rates, suggesting both probe the interface between the ejecta and CSM. Given this, the continued existence of boxy H$\alpha$ emission in the nebular spectra, the low inferred optical depth of the dust, and the lack of temperature and mass evolution, we suggest that the cool dust component in SN 2017eaw may be primarily due to pre-existing dust rather than newly-formed dust in the ejecta or cold dense shell.</description>

      <title>$\textit{Eppur Si Muove}$: Self-Sustained Streaming Motions in Multi-Phase MHD</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.00136</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.00136v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Radiative cooling can drive dynamics in multi-phase gas. A dramatic example is hydrodynamic `shattering', the violent, pressure-driven fragmentation of a cooling cloud which falls drastically out of pressure balance with its surroundings. We run MHD simulations to understand how shattering is influenced by magnetic fields. In MHD, clouds do not `shatter' chaotically. Instead, after initial fragmentation, both hot and cold phases coherently `stream' in long-lived, field-aligned, self-sustaining gas flows, at high speed ($\sim 100 \, {\rm km \, s^{-1}}$). MHD thermal instability also produces such flows. They are due to the anisotropic nature of MHD pressure support, which only operates perpendicular to B-fields. Thus, even when $P_{\rm B} + P_{\rm gas} \approx$const, pressure balance only holds perpendicular to B-fields. Field-aligned gas pressure variations are unopposed, and results in gas velocities $v \sim (2 \Delta P/\rho)^{1/2}$ from Bernoulli's principle. Strikingly, gas in adjacent flux tubes $\textit{counter-stream}$ in opposite directions. We show this arises from a cooling-induced, MHD version of the thin shell instability. Magnetic tension is important both in enabling corrugational instability and modifying its non-linear evolution. Even in high $\beta$ hot gas, streaming can arise, since magnetic pressure support grows as gas cools and compresses. Thermal conduction increases the sizes and velocities of streaming cloudlets, but does not qualitatively modify dynamics. These results are relevant to the counter-streaming gas flows observed in solar coronal rain, as well as multi-phase gas cooling and condensation in the ISM, CGM and ICM.</description>

      <title>Searching for new Hypervelocity Stars with Gaia DR3 and VLT/FORS2 Spectroscopy</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.00150v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Hypervelocity stars are unique objects moving through the Milky Way at speeds exceeding the local escape velocity, providing valuable insights into the Galactic gravitational potential and the properties of its central supermassive black hole. The advent of Gaia DR3 offers an unprecedented astrometric precision, enabling the discovery of new hypervelocity stars and facilitating their characterization. This study seeks to identify and characterize hypervelocity star candidates using Gaia DR3 data, focusing on stars lacking radial velocity measurements. Our goal was to estimate the total velocities of these stars and establish their origin within the Galactic framework, if possible. We applied strict selection criteria to Gaia DR3 data, focusing on sources with low parallax uncertainties and high astrometric fidelity. The distributions of the total velocities in the Galactic rest frame were derived and used to identify candidates. Spectroscopic follow-up with VLT/FORS2 provided radial velocity measurements for a subset of these candidates. We evaluated the probabilities of stars exceeding local escape velocities under different Galactic potential models and traced their past orbits to identify possible origins. From Gaia DR3, we identified 149 hypervelocity star candidates with Pesc &gt; 50% of exceeding local escape velocities. Our follow-up spectroscopy for 23 of those sources confirms that the selected targets are traveling at high velocities, with many appearing to escape the Galaxy, depending on the Galactic potential adopted. Our analysis suggests that nearly one-third of the stars may have an extra-Galactic origin. These findings highlight the need for more precise astrometric and spectroscopic data to conclusively determine the origins of hypervelocity stars and improve models of the Galactic potential.</description>

      <title>An outer-disk SX Phe variable star in Rubin Data Preview 1</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.00192v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We report the discovery of an SX Phoenicis-type pulsating variable star via 217 epochs of time-series photometry from the Vera C. Rubin Observatory's Data Preview 1. The star, designated LSST-DP1-O- 614435753623041404 (or LSST-C25_var1 for short), has mean magnitudes of $(\langle g\rangle, \langle r\rangle) = (18.65, 18.63)$, with pulsation amplitudes of (0.60, 0.38)~mag in these bands. Its period is 0.0767 days (1.841 hours), typical of SX Phe pulsators. We derive a distance to the star of 16.6 kpc based on an SX Phe period-luminosity relation. Its position $\sim5$ kpc from the Galactic plane, in the outer Milky Way disk at a Galactocentric distance of $\sim22$ kpc, and its proper motion suggest that LSST-C25_var1 is part of the Monoceros Ring structure. This star is presented as a small taste of the many thousands of variable stars expected in Rubin/LSST data.</description>

      <title>FAST search for circumstellar atomic hydrogen. III. Planetary nebulae at Galactic latitudes |b|&gt;10degree</title>

Abstract: The detection of circumstellar atomic hydrogen (\ion{H}{1}) via the 21\,cm line remains a persistent challenge in planetary nebula (PN) studies, primarily due to contamination from ubiquitous interstellar \ion{H}{1} 21\,cm emission. In this paper, we report the results of a \ion{H}{1} survey of 12 high surface brightness PNe located at Galactic latitudes $|b|\geq10\arcdeg$, performed with the Five-hundred-meter Aperture Spherical radio Telescope (FAST), which is currently the most sensitive telescope in the $L$ band. Although the contamination from interstellar emission is still severe, we detect or tentatively detect circumstellar \ion{H}{1} 21\,cm absorption associated with two PNe: NGC\,6905 and NGC\,7662. \ion{H}{1} exhibits a comparatively high detection frequency in bipolar PNe. We estimate the \ion{H}{1} masses of the two PNe to range from 0.01 to 0.14 $M_{\sun}$, resulting in atomic-to-ionized hydrogen ratios of 0.02--0.3. The \ion{H}{1} shells have dynamical ages of 2100--2400 years. Our measurements confirm previous findings that the optical depth of \ion{H}{1} decreases with increasing linear radius of the nebula. The mass loss rates traced by the \ion{H}{1} absorption are larger than 10$^{-5}$\,M$_\sun$ yr$^{-1}$, indicating that they originate from the superwind phase at the tip of the asymptotic giant branch.</description>

      <title>Neural translation for Stokes inversion and synthesis</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.00594v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: [Abridged] The physical conditions in stellar atmospheres can be obtained from the interpretation of solar spectro-polarimetric observations. However, traditional inversion codes are computationally demanding, especially for lines whose formation is complex. The necessity of faster alternatives has motivated the emergence of machine learning solutions. This paper introduces an approach to the inversion and synthesis of Stokes profiles inspired by neural machine translation. Our aim is to develop a generative model that treats Stokes profiles and atmospheric models as two distinct ``languages'' encoding the same physical reality. We build a model that learns how to translate between them, also providing estimates of the uncertainty. We employ a tokenization strategy for both Stokes parameters and model atmospheres, which is learned using a VQ-VAE, a neural model used to compress the data into a lower dimensionality form. The core of our inversion code utilizes a transformer encoder-decoder architecture to perform the translation between these tokenized representations. The model is trained on a database of synthetic Stokes profiles derived from perturbations to various semi-empirical solar atmospheric models, ensuring a wide range of expected solar physical conditions. The method effectively reconstructs atmospheric models from observed Stokes profiles, showing better constrained models within the region of sensitivity of the considered spectral lines. The latent representation induced by the VQ-VAE helps accelerate the inversion by compressing the length of the Stokes profiles and model atmospheres. Additionally, it helps regularize the solution by reducing the chances of obtaining unphysical models. As a final advantage, the method provides the generative nature of our model, which naturally yields an estimate of the uncertainty in the solution.</description>

      <title>Close-in planet induces flares on its host star</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.00791v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In the past decade, hundreds of exoplanets have been discovered in extremely short orbits below 10 days. Unlike in the Solar System, planets in these systems orbit their host stars close enough to disturb the stellar magnetic field lines. The interaction can enhance the star's magnetic activity, such as its chromospheric and radio emission, or flaring. So far, the search for magnetic star-planet interactions has remained inconclusive. Here, we report the first detection of planet-induced flares on HIP 67522, a 17 million-year-old G dwarf star with two known close-in planets. Combining space-borne photometry from TESS and dedicated CHEOPS observations over a span of 5 years, we find that the 15 flares in HIP 67522 cluster near the innermost planet's transit phase, indicating persistent magnetic star-planet interaction in the system. The stability of interaction implies that the innermost planet is continuously self-inflicting a six time higher flare rate than it would experience without interaction. The subsequent flux of energetic radiation and particles bombarding HIP 67522 b may explain the planet's remarkably extended atmosphere, recently detected with the James Webb Space Telescope. HIP 67522 is therefore an archetype to understand the impact of magnetic star-planet interaction on the atmospheres of nascent exoplanets.</description>

      <title>Searching for planet-induced radio signal from the young close-in planet host star HIP 67522</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.00796</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.00796v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: HIP 67522 is a 17 Myr old 1.2$M_\odot$ dwarf, and the only such young star known to host two close-in gas giant planets. The inner planet likely orbits close enough to its host to power magnetic star-planet interactions. In the radio domain, magnetic star-planet interaction is expected to produce a unique signature: electron cyclotron maser emission (ECME), beamed in phase with the orbit of the close-in planet.
  We conducted the longest radio monitoring campaign of a G dwarf host star to date to search for ECME, totaling $135\,$h on HIP 67522 over a period of five months with the Australia Telescope Compact Array (ATCA) between $1.1-3.1$GHz.
  We find that HIP 67522 is active in the radio, with emission that varies stochastically, with a duty cycle of $69\%$ above $0.24$mJy, and frequent bursts. Both the bursts and the quiescent emission are consistent with the canonical G\"udel-Benz relation, and show a positive spectral index and brightness temperatures $\geq 10^{10}$K, indicating likely a flaring origin. Our observations cover $61\%$ of the innermost planet's orbit, including multiple visits of the quadrature where planet-induced ECME detection is most likely for this system. However, no orbital modulation or persistent polarization of the radio emission was detected. Our upper limit on circularly polarized emission from HIP 67522 suggests a $&lt;0.7\%$ conversion efficiency of the magnetic power generated in the star-planet interaction into radio waves, unless the emission was missed by our phase or frequency coverage, or was absorbed in the circumstellar plasma. HIP 67522 is a system with one of the highest expected powers of star-planet interaction among known systems and shows strong indication of planet-induced flaring, motivating observations at other wavelengths to probe for further dissipation pathways.</description>

      <title>The Evolution of Substructure during Star Cluster Assembly</title>

Abstract: Star cluster formation and assembly occurs inside filamentary and turbulent molecular clouds, which imprints both spatial and kinematic substructure on the young cluster. In this paper, we quantify the amount and evolution of this substructure in simulations of star cluster formation that include radiation magnetohydrodynamical evolution of the gas, coupled with detailed stellar dynamics, binary formation and evolution, and stellar feedback. We find that both spatial and kinematic substructure are present at early times. Both are erased as the cluster assembles through the formation of new stars as well as the merger of sub-clusters. Spatial substructure is erased over a timescale of approximately 2.5 times the initial free-fall time of the cloud. Kinematic substructure persists for longer, and is still present to the end of our simulations. We also explored our simulations for evidence of early dynamical mass segregation, and conclude that the presence of a population of binary stars can accelerate and enhance the mass segregation process.</description>

      <title>The Mass of the Vela Pulsar Progenitor and the Age of the Vela-Puppis Complex</title>

Abstract: The association of the Vela Pulsar with the Vela Supernova Remnant has long supported the hypothesis that core-collapse supernovae yield neutron stars, but its surrounding stellar population now offers new insights into progenitor evolution. By age-dating stars within 150 pc of the Vela Pulsar, we infer properties of its progenitor. These stars belong to the Vela-Puppis complex, revealing the region's star formation history. While stellar population models with standard assumptions suggest a likely progenitor age and mass, these predictions are internally inconsistent with the observed population, indicating that something is missing in the standard modeling approach. With those assumptions, there is very weak support for a $\lesssim$10 Myr old population, moderate support for a 40 Myr old population, and strong support for an intermediate age population around 65-100 Myrs old. The $\lesssim$10 Myr signal hinges on two peculiar O stars, which are unlike any others in the Vela-Puppis complex and imply nearly three times more main sequence stars than are observed. The 40 Myr-old population is supported by 6 red supergiants (RSGs) and several Be stars; but this population is again marginally inconsistent with the observed distribution of main sequence stars. The red giant (RG) and MS distributions are consistent with a 65-100 Myr old population. We discuss several possible resolutions, emphasizing how binary evolution and/or very rapid rotation could resolve these discrepancies. Gaia parallaxes and {\it Stellar Ages} enable these results; {\it Stellar Ages} is a novel stellar population modeling algorithm that combines individual and population-level age inferences.</description>

      <title>Fe I 6173 {\AA} Emission During White-Light Solar Flares</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.07440</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.07440v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Between 2017 and 2024, the Helioseismic and Magnetic Imager (HMI) onboard the Solar Dynamics Observatory has observed numerous white-light solar flares (WLFs). HMI spectro-polarimetric observations of certain WLFs, in particular the X9.3 flare of September 6, 2017, reveal one or more locations within the umbra or along the umbra/penumbra boundary of the flaring active region where the Fe\,I 6173\,\AA~line briefly goes into full emission, indicating significant heating of the photosphere and lower chromosphere. For five flares featuring Fe\,I 6173\,\AA~line-core emission, we perform spectro-polarimetric analysis using HMI 90\,s cadence Stokes data. For all investigated flares, line-core emission is observed to last for a single 90\,s frame and is either concurrent with or followed by an increase in the line continuum intensity lasting one to two frames (90\,s\,--\,180\,s). Additionally, permanent changes to the Stokes Q, U, and/or V profiles were observed, indicating long-lasting non-transient changes to the photospheric magnetic field. These emissions coincided with local maxima in hard X-ray emission observed by Konus-Wind, as well as local maxima in the time derivative of soft X-ray emission observed by GOES 16-18. Comparison of the Fe\,I 6173\,\AA~line profile synthesis for the ad-hoc heating of the initial empirical VAL-S umbra model and quiescent Sun (VAL-C-like) model indicates that the Fe\,I 6173\,\AA~line emission in the white-light flare kernels could be explained by the strong heating of initially cool photospheric regions.</description>

      <title>Stellar ejection velocities from the binary supernova scenario: A comparison across population synthesis codes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.16161</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.16161v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The vast majority of binary systems are disrupted at the moment of the first supernova, resulting in an unbound compact object and companion star. These ejected companion stars contribute to the observed population of runaway stars. Therefore, an understanding of their ejection velocities is essential to interpreting observations, particularly in the Gaia era of high-precision astronomy.
  We present a comparison of the predicted ejection velocities of disrupted binary companions in three different population synthesis codes: COSMIC, COMPAS, and binary_c, which use two independent algorithms for the treatment of natal kicks. We confirm that, despite the codes producing different pre-supernova evolution from the same initial conditions, they each find the ejection velocities of secondary stars from disrupted binaries are narrowly distributed about their pre-supernova orbital velocity. We additionally include a correction to the derivation included in Kiel &amp; Hurley 2009 that brings it into agreement with methods from other works for determining post-supernova binary orbital parameters. During this comparison, we identified and resolved bugs in the kick prescriptions of \textit{all three} codes we considered, highlighting how open-science practices and code comparisons are essential for addressing implementation issues.</description>

      <title>An accreting dwarf star orbiting the S-type giant star pi1 Gru</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.16845</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.16845v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Aims. We aim to characterize the properties of the inner companion of the S-type AGB star pi1 Gru and to identify plausible future evolutionary scenarios for this triple system. Methods. We observed pi1 Gru with ALMA and VLT/SPHERE. In addition, we collected archival photometry data and used the Hipparcos-Gaia proper motion anomaly. We derive the best orbital parameters from Bayesian inference. Results. In June-July 2019, the inner companion, pi1 Gru C, was located at 37.4 +/- 2.0 mas from the primary (a projected separation of 6.05 +/- 0.55 au at 161.7 +/- 11.7 pc). The best orbital solution yields a companion mass of 0.86 (+0.22/-0.20) Msun (using the derived mass of the primary) and a semi-major axis of 7.05(+0.54/-0.57) au, corresponding to an orbital period of 11.0 (+1.7/-1.5) yr. The preferred solution is an elliptical orbit with eccentricity e = 0.35(+0.18/-0.17), although a circular orbit cannot be fully excluded. The close companion could be either a K1V (F9.5V to K7V) star or a white dwarf (WD). Ultraviolet and millimeter continuum photometry are consistent with the presence of an accretion disk around the close companion. The ultraviolet emission may originate from hot spots in an overall cooler disk, or from a hot disk if the companion is a WD. Conclusions. Although the close companion and the AGB star are interacting and an accretion disk is observed around the companion, the mass-accretion rate is too low to trigger a Type Ia supernova, but it could produce novae every ~900 yr. Short-wavelength, spatially resolved observations are required to further constrain the nature of the C companion. Searches for close-in companions similar to this system will improve our understanding of the physics of mass and angular momentum transfer, as well as orbital evolution during late evolutionary stages.</description>

      <title>Evolution of star clusters with initial bulk rotation via N-body simulations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.20432</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.20432v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Young star clusters can inherit bulk rotation from the molecular clouds from which they have formed. This rotation can affect the long-term evolution of a star cluster and its constituent stellar populations. In this study, we aim to characterize the effects of different degrees of initial rotation on star clusters with primordial binaries. The simulations are performed using NBODY6++GPU. We find that initial rotation strongly affects the early evolution of star clusters. Rapidly rotating clusters show angular momentum transport from the inner parts to the outskirts, resulting in a core collapse. Angular momentum transport is accompanied by a highly elongated bar-like structure morphology. The effects of bulk rotation are reduced on the timescale of two-body relaxation. Rotating and non-rotating clusters experience changes in the direction of angular momentum near the dissolution and early evolution due to the tidal field, respectively. We present synthetic observations of simulated clusters for comparison with future observations in filters of Gaia, CSST, and HST. This work shows the effects of bulk rotation on systems with primordial binaries and could be used for the identification of rotation signatures in observed open clusters.</description>

      <title>Low-metallicity massive single stars with rotation. III. Source of ionization and C-IV emission in I Zw 18</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.21442</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.21442v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Chemically-homogeneously evolving stars have been proposed to account for several exotic phenomena, including gravitational-wave emissions and gamma-ray bursts. Here we study whether these stars can explain the metal-poor dwarf galaxy, I Zwicky 18. We apply our synthetic spectral models from Paper II to (i) establish a classification sequence for these hot stars, (ii) predict the photonionizing flux and the strength of emission lines from a IZw18-like stellar population, and (iii) compare our predictions to available observations of this galaxy. Adding two new models computed with PoWR, we report (i) these stars to follow a unique sequence of classes: O-&gt;WN-&gt;WO (i.e. without ever being WC). From our population synthesis with standard assumptions, we predict that (ii) the source of the UV C-IV and other emission bumps is a couple dozen WO-type Wolf-Rayet stars (not WC as previously assumed) which are the result of chem.-hom. evolution, while these, combined with the rest of the O-star population, account for the He-II ionizing flux and spectral hardness. Contrasting our results against published optical and UV data and accounting for different aperture sizes and spatial regions probed by the observations, we find that (iii) our models are highly consistent with them. Since our "massive Pop II stars" might just as well exist in early star-forming regions, our findings have implications for upcoming JWST surveys; and given that our results apply for binary populations too as long as the same fraction (10%) of the systems evolves chem. homogeneously, we conclude that the stellar progenitors of gravitational waves may very well exist today in IZw18.</description>
