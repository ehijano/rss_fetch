      <title>The effect of color-coding on students' perception of learning in introductory mechanics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.14605</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.14605v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We designed three color-coding schemes to identify related information across representations and to differentiate distinct information within a representation in slide-based instruction for calculus-based introductory mechanics. We found that students had generally favorable opinions on the use of color and that the few negative criticisms are easily addressed through minor modifications to implementation. Without having the color-coding schemes pointed out to them, a modest but consistent minority of students who found color helpful also described the color-coding schemes implemented, and about a quarter described the use of color in physics contexts as helpful even if they did not describe color-coding. We found that students particularly favored using color in mathematics and color-coding used to identify related variables, verbal definitions, and diagram elements. We additionally found that on average 40% of students found color to be helpful in matching and connecting related information or in separating and distinguishing distinct information, which were the motivating reasons for employing the color-coding schemes.</description>

      <title>Enhancing Undergraduate Physics Education: A Pedagogical Exploration of the Wheatstone Bridge with Symmetry and Simulation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.14853</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.14853v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Wheatstone bridge experiment is a fundamental component of the undergraduate physics curriculum, traditionally taught as a hands-on activity to explore resistance measurement and circuit balancing. This study introduces a pedagogical approach that combines qualitative symmetry-based analysis with quantitative computer-based sensitivity simulations, enhancing students' understanding and engagement. A key focus is demonstrating how balanced configurations in the Wheatstone bridge affect circuit sensitivity, providing students with an intuitive grasp of the relationship between symmetry and measurement accuracy. Using simulations, we investigate the impact of internal resistances in the galvanometer and power supply, showing that lower resistances increase the circuit's sensitivity to minor resistance changes. Additionally, various resistor configurations are analyzed, highlighting the effect of careful adjustments in achieving maximal sensitivity. A Bayesian optimization-based software tool was developed to guide students in selecting optimal component values, thereby minimizing the need for manual adjustments while ensuring accurate measurements. This integrated approach bridges traditional experimentation with computational techniques, fostering critical thinking and preparing students for modern scientific practices. The study demonstrates that this enriched methodology significantly enhances the learning experience, equipping students with valuable skills in both experimental and computational aspects of physics.</description>

      <title>The spinorial ball (II): a manipulable qubit at human scale</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.15059</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.15059v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The spinorial ball is an electronic manipulable device that we recently introduced to discuss the origin of spin-1/2 from rotations group representation, without relying on the quantum mechanics framework. Nevertheless, it is also a macroscopic visualization of a quantum two-level system, and can thus be used to gain intuition on some generic features of qubits. The present article therefore aims to complement and extend our previous work by discussing how the spinorial ball can be used to visualize quantum mechanics features. The Bloch sphere, the Hopf fibration and the Berry phase can for instance easily be seen and manipulated using this original device. We also discuss how the spinorial ball can be used to visualize Hamiltonian evolution, and we describe an explicit mapping between the ball's motion and the evolution of 1/2-spin in arbitrary magnetic field. An electronic implementation of projective measurement that matches the predictions of quantum mechanics is also proposed. The present article is written as a practical guide to manipulate the ball and establishes the exact correspondence between the spinorial ball and a generic two-level system.</description>

      <title>Course Deficit Model and the CLASP curriculum: Examining equity and graduation rates at two institutions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.11964</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.11964v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We have previously described the reformed introductory physics course, Collaborative Learning through Active Sense-Making in Physics (CLASP), for bioscience students at a large public research one university (Original University) and presented evidence that the course was more successful and more equitable than the course it replaced by several measures. Now we compare the original success of CLASP with an implementation at a second institution. We find that the original results hold at another institution despite some changes to the original curriculum and a somewhat different student population. We find that students who take CLASP are 1) less likely to drop, 2) less likely to fail, and 3) do as well in later coursework when compared to students who took the courses that CLASP replaced, even if that coursework is not similarly reformed. We find the above items to be independently true for historically marginalized students and remarkably, also find that 4) marginalized students who take CLASP are more likely to graduate from a STEM field. We use a course deficit model perspective to examine these results, and discuss some of the factors that may have contributed to this success. We argue that higher education has the tools they need to significantly increase equity, and improve student success and retention.</description>
