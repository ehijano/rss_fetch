      <title>Magnetic Field-dependent Isotope Effect Supports Radical Pair Mechanism in Tubulin Polymerization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.15288</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.15288v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Weak magnetic fields and isotopes have been shown to influence biological processes; however, the underlying mechanisms remain poorly understood, particularly because the corresponding interaction energies are far below thermal energies, making classical explanations challenging or impossible. Microtubules, dynamic cytoskeletal fibers, offer an ideal system to test weak magnetic field effects due to their self-assembling capabilities, sensitivity to magnetic fields, and their central role in cellular processes. In this study, we use a combination of experiments and simulations to explore how nuclear spin dynamics affect microtubule polymerization by examining interactions between magnesium isotope substitution and weak magnetic fields. Our experiments reveal an isotope-dependent effect, which can be explained via a radical pair mechanism, explicitly arising from nuclear spin properties rather than isotopic mass differences. This nuclear spin-driven isotope effect is notably enhanced under an applied weak magnetic field of approximately 3 mT. Our theoretical model based on radical pairs achieves quantitative agreement with our experimental observations. These results establish a direct connection between quantum spin dynamics and microtubule assembly, providing new insights into how weak magnetic fields influence cellular and biomolecular functions.</description>

      <title>Bacterial chemotaxis considering memory effects (letter)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.15385</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.15385v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Chemotaxis in bacteria such as \textit{E.\ coli} is controlled by the slow methylation of chemoreceptors. As a consequence, intrinsic time and length scales of tens of seconds and hundreds of micrometers emerge, making the Keller--Segel equations invalid when the chemical signal changes on these scales, as occurs in several natural environments. Using a kinetic approach, we show that chemotaxis is described using the concentration field of the protein that controls tumbling in addition to bacterial density. The macroscopic equations for these fields are derived, which describe the nonlocal response.</description>

      <title>Bacterial chemotaxis considering memory effects</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.15405v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Bacterial chemotaxis for E.coli is controlled by methylation of chemoreceptors, which in a biochemical pathway regulates the concentration of the CheY-P protein that finally controls the tumbling rate. As a consequence, the tumbling rate adjusts to changes in the concentration of relevant chemicals, to produce a biased random walk toward chemoattractants of against the repellers. Methylation is a slow process, implying that the internal concentration of CheY-P is not instantaneously adapted to the environment, and the tumbling rate presents memory. This implies that the Keller-Segel (KS) equations used to describe chemotaxis at the macroscopic scale, which assume a local relation between the bacterial flux and the chemical gradient, are not fully valid as memory and the associated nonlocal response are not considered. To derive the equations that replace the KS ones, we use a kinetic approach, in which a kinetic equation for the bacterial transport is written considering the dynamics of the protein concentration. When memory is large, the protein concentration field must be considered a relevant variable as the bacterial density. Working out the Chapman-Enskog (CE) method, the dynamical equations for these fields are obtained, which have the form of reaction-diffusion equations with flux and source terms depending on the gradients on the chemical signal. The transport coefficients are obtained entirely in terms of the microscopic dynamics, giving their values of the case of E.coli. Solving the equations for an inhomogeneous signal it is shown that the response is nonlocal, with a smoothing length as large as $170\mu$m for E.coli. The homogeneous response and the relaxational dynamics are also studied. The case of small memory is also studied, in which case the CE method reproduces the KS equations, with explicit expressions for the transport coefficients.</description>

      <title>Emergent epithelial elasticity governed by interfacial surface mechanics and substrate interaction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.15673</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.15673v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: During the life of animals, epithelial tissues undergo extensive deformations--first to form organs during embryogensis and later to preserve integrity and function in adulthood. To what extent these deformations resemble that of non-living elastic materials is not well understood. We derive an elasticity theory of epithelia, supported by a thin layer of extracellular material and the stroma, in which the mechanics of individual cells are dominated by differential interfacial tensions stemming from cell cortical tension and adhesion. Upon coarse-graining a discrete single-cell-level mechanics model, we obtain a harmonic deformation energy and derive the critical conditions for the elastic instability, where an initially flat tissue either buckles out of plane or forms wrinkles. Due to the distinct origin of elasticity, the scaling of the critical load to induce an instability and the wrinkling wavelength with layer thickness is fundamentally different than in solid plates. The theory also naturally describes reversal of the groove-to-crest thickness-modulation phase--a recently observed epithelial shape feature which cannot be explained by the classical elasticity theory. Our work provides a guideline for understanding the relative role of cell surface tensions and the interaction of tissues with substrates during epithelial morphogenesis.</description>

      <title>A method for site-specifically tethering the enzyme urease to DNA origami with sustained activity</title>

Abstract: Attaching enzymes to nanostructures has proven useful to the study of enzyme functionality under controlled conditions and has led to new technologies. Often, the utility and interest of enzyme-tethered nanostructures lie in how the enzymatic activity is affected by how the enzymes are arranged in space. Therefore, being able to conjugate enzymes to nanostructures while preserving the enzymatic activity is essential. In this paper, we present a method to conjugate single-stranded DNA to the enzyme urease while maintaining enzymatic activity. We show evidence of successful conjugation and quantify the variables that affect the conjugation yield. We also show that the enzymatic activity is unchanged after conjugation compared to the enzyme in its native state. Finally, we demonstrate the tethering of urease to nanostructures made using DNA origami with high site-specificity. Decorating nanostructures with enzymatically-active urease may prove to be useful in studying, or even utilizing, the functionality of urease in disciplines ranging from biotechnology to soft-matter physics. The techniques we present in this paper will enable researchers across these fields to modify enzymes without disrupting their functionality, thus allowing for more insightful studies into their behavior and utility.</description>

      <title>Boundary Effects and Oxygen Deficiency-Driven Pattern Transitions in Algal Bioconvection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.12362</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.12362v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Suspensions of motile microorganisms can spontaneously give rise to large scale fluid motion, known as bioconvection, which is characterized by dense, cell-rich downwelling plumes interspersed with broad upwelling regions. In this study, we investigate bioconvection in shallow suspensions of Chlamydomonas reinhardtii cells confined within spiral-shaped boundaries, combining detailed experimental observations with three dimensional simulations. Under open liquid-air interface conditions, cells accumulate near the surface due to negative gravitaxis, forming spiral shaped density patterns that subsequently fragment into lattice-like structures and give rise to downwelling plumes. Space-time analyses reveal coherent rotational dynamics, with inward moving patterns near the spiral core and bidirectional motion farther from the center. Introducing confinement by sealing the top boundary with an air impermeable transparent wall triggers striking transitions in the bioconvection patterns, driven by oxygen depletion: initially stable structures reorganize into new patterns with reduced characteristic wavelengths. Complementary 3D simulations, based on the incompressible Navier-Stokes equations and incorporating negative buoyancy and active stress from swimming cells, capture the initial pattern formation and its subsequent instability, reproducing the fragmentation of spiral-shaped accumulations into downwelling plumes and the emergence of strong vortical flows, nearly an order of magnitude faster than individual cell swimming speeds. However, these models do not capture the oxygen-driven pattern transitions observed experimentally. Our findings reveal that confinement geometry, oxygen dynamics, and metabolic transitions critically govern bioconvection pattern evolution, offering new strategies to control microbial self-organization and flow through environmental and geometric design.</description>

      <title>Physics Informed Constrained Learning of Dynamics from Static Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.12675</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.12675v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A physics-informed neural network (PINN) models the dynamics of a system by integrating the governing physical laws into the architecture of a neural network. By enforcing physical laws as constraints, PINN overcomes challenges with data scarsity and potentially high dimensionality. Existing PINN frameworks rely on fully observed time-course data, the acquisition of which could be prohibitive for many systems. In this study, we developed a new PINN learning paradigm, namely Constrained Learning, that enables the approximation of first-order derivatives or motions using non-time course or partially observed data. Computational principles and a general mathematical formulation of Constrained Learning were developed. We further introduced MPOCtrL (Message Passing Optimization-based Constrained Learning) an optimization approach tailored for the Constrained Learning framework that strives to balance the fitting of physical models and observed data. Its code is available at github link: https://github.com/ptdang1001/MPOCtrL Experiments on synthetic and real-world data demonstrated that MPOCtrL can effectively detect the nonlinear dependency between observed data and the underlying physical properties of the system. In particular, on the task of metabolic flux analysis, MPOCtrL outperforms all existing data-driven flux estimators.</description>
