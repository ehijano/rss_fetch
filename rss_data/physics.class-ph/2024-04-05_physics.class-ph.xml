      <title>Correlation and Spectral Density Functions in Mode-Stirred Reverberation -- III. Measurements</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.03497</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.03497v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Experimental auto- and cross-correlation functions and their corresponding spectral density functions are extracted from measured sweep data of mode-stirred fields. These are compared with theoretical models derived in part I, using estimated spectral moments from part II. The second-order Pad\'{e} approximant based model accounts for the main features of the spectral density function, including its slope near stir DC, corner frequency, stir DC-to-Nyquist level drop, and asymptotic spectral density. Ensemble averaging across secondary tune states offers a reduction of spectral bias and RMS spectral fluctuation, compared to spectral densities for individual stir sweeps or their concatenation. Periodogram- and correlation-based methods produce near-identical results. Distinctive theoretical features between power-based vs. field-based spectral densities are experimentally verified. Interchanging the roles of stirrer and tuner demonstrates the effect of stir efficiency on correlation and spectral density. The spectral characterization allows for stirrer diagnostics, which is demonstrated through detection and identification of EMI caused by mains power harmonics in the measured stir spectrum at low frequencies.</description>

      <title>Correlation and Spectral Density Functions in Mode-Stirred Reverberation -- II. Spectral Moments, Sampling, Noise, EMI and Understirring</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.03520</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.03520v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In part I, spectral moments and kurtosis were established as parameters in analytic models of correlation and spectral density functions for dynamic reverberation fields. In this part II, several practical limitations affecting the accuracy of estimating these parameters from measured stir sweep data are investigated. For sampled fields, the contributions of finite differencing and aliasing are evaluated. Finite differencing results in a negative bias that depends, to leading order, quadratically on the product of the sampling time interval and the stir bandwidth. Numerical estimates of moments extracted directly from sampled stir sweeps show good agreement with values obtained by an autocovariance method. The effects of data decimation and noise-to-stir ratios of RMS amplitudes are determined and experimentally verified. In addition, the dependencies on the noise-to-stir-bandwidth ratio, EMI, and unstirred energy are characterized.</description>

      <title>Two-Scale Geometric Modelling for Defective Media</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.03269</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.03269v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A new geometrically exact micro-structured model is constructed using a generalisation of the notion of Riemann-Cartan manifolds and fibre bundle theory of rank 3. This model is based around the concept of two different length scales: a macroscopic scale -- of dimensions 1, 2, or 3 -- and a microscopic one -- of dimension 3. As they interact with each other, they produce emergent behaviours such as dislocations (torsion) and disclinations (curvature). A first-order placement map F : TB --&gt; TE between a micro-structured body B and the micro-structured ambient space E is constructed, allowing to pull the ambient Riemann-Cartan geometry back onto the body. I norder to allow for curvature to arise, F is, in general, not required to be a gradient. Central to this model is the new notion of pseudo-metric, providing, in addition to a macroscopic metric (the usual Cauchy-Green tensor) and a microscopic metric, a notion of coupling between the microscopic and macroscopic realms. A notion of frame indifference is formalised and invariants are computed. In the case of a micro-linear structure, it is shown that the data of these invariants is equivalent to the data of the pseudo-metric.</description>

      <title>From integrability to chaos: the quantum-classical correspondence in a triple well bosonic model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.13189</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.13189v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this work, we investigate the semiclassical limit of a simple bosonic quantum many-body system exhibiting both integrable and chaotic behavior. A classical Hamiltonian is derived using coherent states. The transition from regularity to chaos in classical dynamics is visualized through Poincar\'e sections. Classical trajectories in phase space closely resemble the projections of the Husimi functions of eigenstates with similar energy, even in chaotic cases. It is demonstrated that this correlation is more evident when projecting the eigenstates onto the Fock states. The analysis is carried out at a critical energy where the eigenstates are maximally delocalized in the Fock basis. Despite the imperfect delocalization, its influence is present in the classical and quantum properties under investigation. The study systematically establishes quantum-classical correspondence for a bosonic many-body system with more than two wells, even within the chaotic region.</description>
