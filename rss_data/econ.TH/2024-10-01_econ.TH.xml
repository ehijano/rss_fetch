      <title>Mechanism Design with Endogenous Perception</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.19853</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.19853v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We provide a model of endogenous perception of private information in single-agent screening problems. The agent's evaluation of their type is determined by their cognitive state: either sophisticated (i.e., they correctly perceive their type) or naive (i.e., they misperceive their type). The cognitive state depends on the mechanism's incentive structure via costly investment in cognition. Specifically, the agent is sophisticated only if their value of sophistication (i.e., the expected payoff difference between sophisticated and naive behavior) exceeds some cognitive cost. We impose no restrictions on the form of misperception when naive, allowing for both unbiased perceptions (i.e., information) as well as those generated in a biased manner. We derive a general representation of the value of sophistication, show how it varies with the mechanism's allocation rule, and use it to define a notion of accuracy in perception. In applications we showcase how perception both shapes and is shaped by the design of mechanisms.</description>

      <title>Impartial Selection Under Combinatorial Constraints</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.20477</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.20477v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Impartial selection problems are concerned with the selection of one or more agents from a set based on mutual nominations from within the set. To avoid strategic nominations of the agents, the axiom of impartiality requires that the selection of each agent is independent of the nominations cast by that agent. This paper initiates the study of impartial selection problems where the nominations are weighted and the set of agents that can be selected is restricted by a combinatorial constraint. We call a selection mechanism $\alpha$-optimal if, for every instance, the ratio between the total sum of weighted nominations of the selected set and that of the best feasible set of agents is at least $\alpha$. We show that a natural extension of a mechanism studied for the selection of a single agent remains impartial and $\frac{1}{4}$-optimal for general independence systems, and we generalize upper bounds from the selection of multiple agents by parameterizing them by the girth of the independence system. We then focus on independence systems defined by knapsack and matroid constraints, giving impartial mechanisms that exploit a greedy order of the agents and achieve approximation ratios of $\frac{1}{3}$ and $\frac{1}{2}$, respectively, when agents cast a single nomination. For graphic matroids, we further devise an impartial and $\frac{1}{3}$-optimal mechanism for an arbitrary number of unweighted nominations.</description>

      <title>A look back at the core of games in characteristic function form: some new axiomatization results</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2208.01690</link>
      <description>arXiv:2208.01690v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper we provide three new results axiomatizing the core of games in characteristic function form (not necessarily having transferable utility) obeying an innocuous condition (that the set of individually rational pay-off vectors is bounded). One novelty of this exercise is that our domain is the {\em entire} class of such games: i.e., restrictions like "non-levelness" or "balancedness" are not required.</description>

      <title>Coordinating Charitable Donations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.10286</link>
      <description>arXiv:2305.10286v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Charity is typically carried out by individual donors, who donate money to charities they support, or by centralized organizations such as governments or municipalities, which collect individual contributions and distribute them among a set of charities. Individual charity respects the will of the donors, but may be inefficient due to a lack of coordination; centralized charity is potentially more efficient, but may ignore the will of individual donors. We present a mechanism that combines the advantages of both methods for donors with Leontief preferences (i.e., each donor seeks to maximize an individually weighted minimum of all contributions across the charities). The mechanism distributes the contribution of each donor efficiently such that no subset of donors has an incentive to redistribute their donations. Moreover, it is group-strategyproof, satisfies desirable monotonicity properties, maximizes Nash welfare, returns a unique Lindahl equilibrium, can be computed efficiently, and implemented via natural best-response spending dynamics.</description>

      <title>Balancing Selection Efficiency and Societal Costs in Selective Contests</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.09768</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.09768v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Selective contests can impair participants' overall welfare in overcompetitive environments, such as school admissions. This paper models the situation as an optimal contest design problem with binary actions, treating effort costs as societal costs incurred to achieve a desired level of selectivity. We provide a characterization for the feasible set of selection efficiency and societal cost in selective contests by establishing their relationship with feasible equilibrium strategies. We find that selection efficiency and contestants' welfare are complementary, i.e. it is almost impossible to improve one without sacrificing the other. We derive the optimal equilibrium outcome given the feasible set and characterize the corresponding optimal contest design. Our analysis demonstrates that it is always optimal for a contest designer who is sufficiently concerned with societal cost to intentionally introduce randomness into the contest. Furthermore, we show that the designer can optimize any linear payoff function by adjusting a single parameter related to the intensity of randomness, without altering the specific structure of the contest.</description>

      <title>Regulation of Algorithmic Collusion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.15794</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.15794v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Consider sellers in a competitive market that use algorithms to adapt their prices from data that they collect. In such a context it is plausible that algorithms could arrive at prices that are higher than the competitive prices and this may benefit sellers at the expense of consumers (i.e., the buyers in the market). This paper gives a definition of plausible algorithmic non-collusion for pricing algorithms. The definition allows a regulator to empirically audit algorithms by applying a statistical test to the data that they collect. Algorithms that are good, i.e., approximately optimize prices to market conditions, can be augmented to contain the data sufficient to pass the audit. Algorithms that have colluded on, e.g., supra-competitive prices cannot pass the audit. The definition allows sellers to possess useful side information that may be correlated with supply and demand and could affect the prices used by good algorithms. The paper provides an analysis of the statistical complexity of such an audit, i.e., how much data is sufficient for the test of non-collusion to be accurate.</description>
