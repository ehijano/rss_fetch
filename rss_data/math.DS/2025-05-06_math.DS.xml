      <title>Collet-Eckmann type conditions and conformal welding of unicritical quadratic laminations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.02965</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.02965v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we introduce a Collet-Eckmann type condition for the unicritical laminations on the unit circle. We prove that this condition implies the lamination admits a H\"older continuous conformal welding which produces a Julia set for some unicritical polynomial. In consequence, we present a new proof that almost all angles on the unit circle produce quadratic polynomials with H\"older Fatou components, without the use of Beurling's theorem.</description>

      <title>Full flexibility of entropies among ergodic measures for partially hyperbolic diffeomorphisms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.03079</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.03079v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study nonhyperbolic and transitive partially hyperbolic diffeomorphisms having a one-dimensional center. We prove joint flexibility with respect to entropy and center Lyapunov exponent for a broad class of these systems. Flexibility means that for any given value of the center Lyapunov exponent and any value of entropy less than the supremum of entropies of ergodic measures with that exponent, there is an ergodic measure with exactly this entropy and exponent. Our hypotheses involve minimal foliations and blender-horseshoes, they formalize the interplay between two regions of the ambient space, one of center expanding and the other of center contracting type. The list of examples our results apply is rather long, a non-exhaustive list includes fibered by circles, flow-type, some Derived from Anosov diffeomorphisms, and some anomalous (non-dynamically coherent) diffeomorphisms.</description>

      <title>Weighted Birkhoff averages: Deterministic and probabilistic perspectives</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.03210</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.03210v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we present physically related applications of a class of weighted quasi-Monte Carlo methods from a deterministic perspective, and establish quantitative universal rapid convergence results via various regularity assumptions. Specifically, we introduce weighting with compact support to the Birkhoff ergodic averages of quasi-periodic, almost periodic, and periodic systems, thereby achieving universal rapid convergence, including both arbitrary polynomial and exponential types. This is in stark contrast to the typically slow convergence in classical ergodic theory. These results, as new contributions, not only discuss more general weighting functions but also provide quantitative improvements to existing results, and the explicit regularity settings facilitate the application of these methods to specific problems. We also revisit the physically related problems and, for the first time, establish universal exponential convergence results for the weighted computation of Fourier coefficients, in both finite-dimensional and infinite-dimensional cases. In addition to the above, we explore results from a probabilistic perspective, including the weighted strong law of large numbers and the weighted central limit theorem, by building upon the historical results.</description>

      <title>Model reduction of nonlinear time-delay systems via ODE approximation and spectral submanifolds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.03239</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.03239v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Time-delay dynamical systems inherently embody infinite-dimensional dynamics, thereby amplifying their complexity. This aspect is especially notable in nonlinear dynamical systems, which frequently defy analytical solutions and necessitate approximations or numerical methods. These requirements present considerable challenges for the real-time simulation and analysis of their nonlinear dynamics. To address these challenges, we present a model reduction framework for nonlinear time-delay systems using spectral submanifolds (SSMs). We first approximate the time-delay systems as ordinary differential equations (ODEs) without delay and then compute the SSMs and their associated reduced-order models (ROMs) of the ODE approximations. These SSM-based ROMs successfully predict the nonlinear dynamical behaviors of the time-delay systems, including free and forced vibrations, and accurately identify critical features such as isolated branches in the forced response curves and bifurcations of periodic and quasi-periodic orbits. The efficiency and accuracy of the ROMs are demonstrated through examples of increasing complexity.</description>

      <title>Well-posedness and asymptotic behavior of difference equations with a time-dependent delay and applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.03301</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.03301v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we investigate the well-posedness and asymptotic behavior of difference equations of the form $x(t) = A x(t - \tau(t))$, $t \geq 0$, where the unknown function $x$ takes values in $\mathbb R^d$ for some positive integer $d$, $A$ is a $d \times d$ matrix with real coefficients, and $\tau\colon [0, +\infty) \to (0, +\infty)$ is a time-dependent delay.
  We provide our investigations for three spaces of functions: continuous, regulated, and $L^p$. We compare our results for these three cases, showing how the hypotheses change according to the space that we are treating. Finally, we provide applications of our results to difference equations with state-dependent delays for the cases of continuous and regulated function spaces, as well as to transport equations in one space dimension with time-dependent velocity.</description>

      <title>Orbits Inside Basins of Attraction of Skew Products</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.03503</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.03503v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A basic problem in complex dynamics is to understand orbits of holomorphic maps. One problem is to understand the collection of points $S$ in an attracting basin whose forward orbits land exactly on the attracting fixed point. In the paper [13], the second author showed that for holomorphic polynomials in $\mathbb C$, there is a constant $C$ so that all Kobayashi discs of radius $C$ must intersect this set $S$. In the paper [15], the second author showed that there are holomorphic skew products in $\mathbb {C}^2$ where this result fails. The main result of this paper is to show that for a large class of polynomial skew products, this result nevertheless holds.</description>

Abstract: Two variants of a deterministic multi-round, zero-sum, two-player game are presented: a turn-alternating version and an non-alternating version. The non-alternating version occurs in the computation of the covering radius of constrained systems, a quantity of interest in coding theory.</description>

      <title>Hyperchaos and complex dynamical regimes in $N$-dimensional neuron lattices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.03051</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.03051v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the dynamics of $N$-dimensional lattices of nonchaotic Rulkov neurons coupled with a flow of electrical current. We consider both nearest-neighbor and next-nearest-neighbor couplings, homogeneous and heterogeneous neurons, and small and large lattices over a wide range of electrical coupling strengths. As the coupling strength is varied, the neurons exhibit a number of complex dynamical regimes, including unsynchronized chaotic spiking, local quasi-bursting, synchronized chaotic bursting, and synchronized hyperchaos. For lattices in higher spatial dimensions, we discover dynamical effects arising from the ``destructive interference'' of many connected neurons and miniature ``phase transitions'' from coordinated spiking threshold crossings. In large two- and three-dimensional neuron lattices, we observe emergent dynamics such as local synchronization, quasi-synchronization, and lag synchronization. These results illustrate the rich dynamics that emerge from coupled neurons in multiple spatial dimensions, highlighting how dimensionality, connectivity, and heterogeneity critically shape the collective behavior of neuronal systems.</description>

      <title>$\mathcal{H}_2$-optimal model reduction of linear quadratic-output systems by multivariate rational interpolation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.03057</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.03057v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper addresses the $\mathcal{H}_2$-optimal approximation of linear dynamical systems with quadratic-output functions, also known as linear quadratic-output systems. Our major contributions are threefold. First, we derive interpolation-based first-order optimality conditions for the linear quadratic-output $\mathcal{H}_2$ minimization problem. These conditions correspond to the mixed-multipoint tangential interpolation of the full-order linear- and quadratic-output transfer functions, and generalize the Meier-Luenberger optimality framework for the $\mathcal{H}_2$-optimal model reduction of linear time-invariant systems. Second, given the interpolation data, we show how to enforce these mixed-multipoint tangential interpolation conditions explicitly by Petrov-Galerkin projection of the full-order model matrices. Third, to find the optimal interpolation data, we build on this projection framework and propose a generalization of the iterative rational Krylov algorithm for the $\mathcal{H}_2$-optimal model reduction of linear quadratic-output systems, called LQO-IRKA. Upon convergence, LQO-IRKA produces a reduced linear quadratic-output system that satisfies the interpolatory optimality conditions. The method only requires solving shifted linear systems and matrix-vector products, thus making it suitable for large-scale problems. Numerical examples are included to illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed method.</description>

      <title>Harmonic analysis of multiplicative chaos Part II: Fourier dimensions of classical multiplicative chaos measures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.03298</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.03298v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce a unified approach for studying the polynomial Fourier decay of classical multiplicative chaos measures. As consequences, we obtain the precise Fourier dimensions for multiplicative chaos measures arising from the following key models: the sub-critical 1D and 2D GMC; the sub-critical $d$-dimensional GMC with $d \ge 3$ when the parameter $\gamma$ is near the critical value; the canonical Mandelbrot random coverings; the canonical Mandelbrot cascades. For various other models, we establish the non-trivial lower bounds of the Fourier dimensions and in various cases we conjecture that they are all optimal and provide the exact value of the Fourier dimensions.</description>

      <title>On the local constancy of regularized superdeterminants along special families of differential operators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.03404</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.03404v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider the flat-regularized determinant of families of operators of the form $D_\tau=[\delta_\tau,d_\nabla]$, where $\tau\to\delta_\tau$ are families of degree $-1$ maps in the twisted de Rham complex $\left(\Omega^\bullet(M,E),d_\nabla\right)$ generalizing the (twisted) Hodge codifferential. We show that under suitable assumptions, both geometrical and analytical in nature, the flat-regularized determinant of $D_\tau$, restricted to the subspace $\mathrm{im}(\delta_\tau)$, is constant in $\tau$. The general result we present implies both local constancy of the Ray--Singer torsion and of the value at zero of the Ruelle zeta function for a contact Anosov flow, upon choosing $\delta_\tau = \delta_{g_\tau}$, the Hodge codifferential for a family of metrics, and $\delta_\tau=\iota_{X_\tau}$, the contraction along a family of (regular, contact) Anosov vector fields, respectively.</description>

      <title>Efficient Training of Physics-enhanced Neural ODEs via Direct Collocation and Nonlinear Programming</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.03552</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.03552v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose a novel approach for training Physics-enhanced Neural ODEs (PeNODEs) by expressing the training process as a dynamic optimization problem. The full model, including neural components, is discretized using a high-order implicit Runge-Kutta method with flipped Legendre-Gauss-Radau points, resulting in a large-scale nonlinear program (NLP) efficiently solved by state-of-the-art NLP solvers such as Ipopt. This formulation enables simultaneous optimization of network parameters and state trajectories, addressing key limitations of ODE solver-based training in terms of stability, runtime, and accuracy. Extending on a recent direct collocation-based method for Neural ODEs, we generalize to PeNODEs, incorporate physical constraints, and present a custom, parallelized, open-source implementation. Benchmarks on a Quarter Vehicle Model and a Van-der-Pol oscillator demonstrate superior accuracy, speed, and generalization with smaller networks compared to other training techniques. We also outline a planned integration into OpenModelica to enable accessible training of Neural DAEs.</description>

      <title>Ergodic Generative Flows</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.03561</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.03561v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Generative Flow Networks (GFNs) were initially introduced on directed acyclic graphs to sample from an unnormalized distribution density. Recent works have extended the theoretical framework for generative methods allowing more flexibility and enhancing application range. However, many challenges remain in training GFNs in continuous settings and for imitation learning (IL), including intractability of flow-matching loss, limited tests of non-acyclic training, and the need for a separate reward model in imitation learning. The present work proposes a family of generative flows called Ergodic Generative Flows (EGFs) which are used to address the aforementioned issues. First, we leverage ergodicity to build simple generative flows with finitely many globally defined transformations (diffeomorphisms) with universality guarantees and tractable flow-matching loss (FM loss). Second, we introduce a new loss involving cross-entropy coupled to weak flow-matching control, coined KL-weakFM loss. It is designed for IL training without a separate reward model. We evaluate IL-EGFs on toy 2D tasks and real-world datasets from NASA on the sphere, using the KL-weakFM loss. Additionally, we conduct toy 2D reinforcement learning experiments with a target reward, using the FM loss.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2505.03591v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We model dynamically changing candidate positions in the face of a dynamic electorate. To formulate our equations, we use a space-time-continuous Hegselmann-Krause equation, which we solve using a particle method. We use the combined candidate-voter model to demonstrate the possibility of discontinuous jumps in candidate behavior as parameters of the model are varied. We also extend the analysis to a three candidate scenario. We observe that depending on the parameters, candidates do not always come or stay together at their dynamically evolving position.</description>

Abstract: In this article we prove that the Hausdorff dimension of geodesic directions that are recurrent and diverge on average coincides with the entropy at infinity of the geodesic flow for any complete, pinched negatively curved Riemannian manifold. Furthermore, we prove that the entropy of a $\sigma$-finite, infinite, ergodic and conservative invariant measure is bounded from above by the entropy at infinity of the geodesic flow.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.04935v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We extend Ratner's theorem on equidistribution of individual orbits of unipotent flows on finite volume homogeneous spaces of Lie groups to trajectories of non-contracting curves definable in polynomially bounded o-minimal structures.
  To be precise, let $\varphi:[0,\infty)\to \text{SL}(n,\mathbb R)$ be a continuous map whose coordinate functions are definable in a polynomially bounded o-minimal structure; for example, rational functions. Suppose that $\varphi$ is non-contracting; that is, for any linearly independent vectors $v_1,\ldots,v_k$ in $\mathbb R^n$, $\varphi(t).(v_1\wedge\cdots\wedge v_k)\not\to0$ as $t\to\infty$. Then, there exists a unique smallest subgroup $H_\varphi$ of $\text{SL}(n,\mathbb R)$ generated by unipotent one-parameter subgroups such that $\varphi(t)H_\varphi\to g_0H_\varphi$ in $\text{SL}(n,\mathbb R)/H_\varphi$ as $t\to\infty$ for some $g_0\in \text{SL}(n,\mathbb R)$.
  Let $G$ be a closed subgroup of $\text{SL}(n,\mathbb R)$ and $\Gamma$ be a lattice in $G$. Suppose that $\varphi([0,\infty))\subset G$. Then $H_\varphi\subset G$, and for any $x\in G/\Gamma$, the trajectory $\{\varphi(t)x:t\in [0,T]\}$ gets equidistributed with respect to the measure $g_0\mu_{Lx}$ as $T\to\infty$, where $L$ is a closed subgroup of $G$ such that $\overline{Hx}=Lx$ and $Lx$ admits a unique $L$-invariant probability measure, denoted by $\mu_{Lx}$.
  A crucial new ingredient in this work is proving that for any finite-dimensional representation $V$ of $\text{SL}(n,\mathbb R)$, there exist $T_0&gt;0$, $C&gt;0$, and $\alpha&gt;0$ such that for any $v\in G$, the map $t\mapsto \|\varphi(t)v\|$ is $(C,\alpha)$-good on $[T_0,\infty)$.</description>

      <title>On the metric mean dimensions of saturated sets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.09218</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.09218v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Saturated sets and its reduced case, the set of generic points, constitute two significant types of fractal-like sets in multifractal analysis of dynamical systems. In the context of infinite entropy systems, we aim to provide some qualitative aspects of saturated sets and the set of generic points from both topological and measure-theoretic perspectives.
  For systems with the specification property, we establish certain variational principles for saturated sets in terms of Bowen and packing metric mean dimensions, and show the upper capacity metric mean dimension of saturated sets has full metric mean dimension. As applications, we further present some qualitative aspects of the metric mean dimensions of level sets and the set of mean Li-Yorke pairs in infinite entropy systems.</description>

      <title>On the Oscillations in Cournot Games with Best Response Strategies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.09435</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.09435v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we consider the dynamic oscillation in the Cournot oligopoly model, which involves multiple firms producing homogeneous products. To explore the oscillation under the updates of best response strategies, we focus on the linear price functions. In this setting, we establish the existence of oscillations. In particular, we show that for the scenario of different costs among firms, the best response converges to either a unique equilibrium or a two-period oscillation. We further characterize the oscillations and propose linear-time algorithms for finding all types of two-period oscillations. To the best of our knowledge, our work is the first step toward fully analyzing the periodic oscillation in the Cournot oligopoly model.</description>

      <title>Harmonic analysis of multiplicative chaos Part I: the proof of Garban-Vargas conjecture for 1D GMC</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.13923</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.13923v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we establish the exact Fourier dimensions of all standard sub-critical Gaussian multiplicative chaos on the unit interval, thereby confirming the Garban-Vargas conjecture. The proof relies on a significant improvement of the vector-valued martingale method, initially developed by Chen-Han-Qiu-Wang in the studies of the Fourier dimensions of Mandelbrot cascade random measures.</description>
