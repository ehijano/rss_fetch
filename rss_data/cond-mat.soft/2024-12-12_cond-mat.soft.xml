      <title>Machine Learning-Informed Scattering Correlation Analysis of Sheared Colloids</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.07926</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.07926v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We carry out theoretical analysis, Monte Carlo simulations and Machine Learning analysis to quantify microscopic rearrangements of dilute dispersions of spherical colloidal particles from coherent scattering intensity. Both monodisperse and polydisperse dispersions of colloids are created and undergo a rearrangement consisting of an affine simple shear and non-affine rearrangement using Monte Carlo method. We calculate the coherent scattering intensity of the dispersions and the correlation function of intensity before and after the rearrangement, and generate a large data set of angular correlation functions for varying system parameters, including number density, polydispersity, shear strain, and non-affine rearrangement. Singular value decomposition of the data set shows the feasibility of machine learning inversion from the correlation function for the polydispersity, shear strain, and non-affine rearrangement using only three parameters. A Gaussian process regressor is then trained based on the data set and can retrieve the affine shear strain, non-affine rearrangement, and polydispersity with a relative error of 3\%, 1\% and 6\%, respectively. Together, our model provides a framework for quantitative studies of both steady and non-steady microscopic dynamics of colloidal dispersions using coherent scattering methods.</description>

      <title>Bond exchange reactions as a paradigm for mitigating residual stress in polymer matrix fiber composites</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.08033</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.08033v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Polymer matrix fiber composites often suffer from residual stresses due to differences in coefficients of thermal expansion between the fibers and resins, as well as contractile strain of the resins during curing. To address residual stress driven composite failure, we propose the use of vitrimers as composite resins, which can undergo thermally activated, stress alleviating, bond exchange reactions (BERs). We conduct fiber Bragg grating measurements for a single glass fiber within bulk vitrimer. These show that the fiber strain in vitrimers with 5% catalyst is significantly lower than in those with 0% catalyst (minimal BER expected) during both curing and post-curing phases. We developed a finite deformation, micromechanically-inspired model that incorporates curing, thermal processes, and BERs, and then implemented this model it into finite element software to simulate stress evolution within single fiber composite systems. The combination of experimental and computational results reveals that BERs can effectively mitigate, but not eliminate, the residual stress in polymer matrix fiber composites.</description>

      <title>Viscoelastic lubrication of a submerged cylinder sliding down an incline</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.08242</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.08242v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Lubrication flows between two solid surfaces can be found in a variety of biological and engineering settings. In many of these systems, the lubricant exhibits viscoelastic properties, which modify the associated lubrication forces. Here, we experimentally study viscoelastic lubrication by considering the motion of a submerged cylinder sliding down an incline. We demonstrate that cylinders move faster when released in a viscoelastic Boger liquid compared to a Newtonian liquid with similar viscosity. Cylinders exhibit pure sliding motion in viscoelastic liquids, in contrast to the stick-slip motion observed in Newtonian liquids. We rationalize our results by using the second-order fluid model, which predicts a lift force on the cylinder arising from the normal-stress differences provided by the dissolved polymers. The interplay between viscoelastic lift, viscous friction, and gravity leads to a prediction for the sliding speed, which is consistent with our experimental results for weakly viscoelastic flows. Finally, we identify a remarkable difference between the lubrication of cylindrical and spherical contacts, as the latter does not exhibit any lift for weak viscoelasticity.</description>

      <title>Polymer Composites Informatics for Flammability, Thermal, Mechanical and Electrical Property Predictions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.08407</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.08407v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Polymer composite performance depends significantly on the polymer matrix, additives, processing conditions, and measurement setups. Traditional physics-based optimization methods for these parameters can be slow, labor-intensive, and costly, as they require physical manufacturing and testing. Here, we introduce a first step in extending Polymer Informatics, an AI-based approach proven effective for neat polymer design, into the realm of polymer composites. We curate a comprehensive database of commercially available polymer composites, develop a scheme for machine-readable data representation, and train machine-learning models for 15 flame-resistant, mechanical, thermal, and electrical properties, validating them on entirely unseen data. Future advancements are planned to drive the AI-assisted design of functional and sustainable polymer composites.</description>

      <title>Revisiting the Ratchet Principle: When Hidden Symmetries Prevent Steady Currents</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.07851</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.07851v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The ``ratchet principle", which states that non-equilibrium systems violating parity symmetry generically exhibit steady-state currents, is one of the few generic results outside thermal equilibrium. We study exceptions to this principle observed in active and passive systems with spatially varying fluctuations sources. For dilute systems, we show that a hidden time-reversal symmetry prevents the emergence of ratchet currents. At higher densities, pairwise forces break this symmetry but an emergent conservation law for the momentum field may nevertheless prevent steady currents. We show how the presence of this conservation law can be tested analytically and characterize the onset of ratchet currents in its absence. Our results show that the ratchet principle should be amended to preclude parity symmetry, time-reversal symmetry, and bulk momentum conservation.</description>

      <title>Singular Twist Waves in Chromonic Liquid Crystals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.10769</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.10769v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Chromonic liquid crystals are lyotropic nematic phases whose applications span from food to drug industries. It has recently been suggested that the elastic energy density governing the equilibrium distortions of these materials may be quartic in the measure of twist. Here we show that the non-linear twist-wave equation associated with such an energy has smooth solutions that break down in a finite time, giving rise to the formation of a shock wave, under rather generic assumptions on the initial profile. The critical time at which smooth solutions become singular is estimated analytically with an accuracy that numerical calculations for a number of exemplary cases prove to be satisfactory.</description>
