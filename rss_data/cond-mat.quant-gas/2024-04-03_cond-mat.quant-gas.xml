      <title>Universality of Efimov states in highly mass-imbalanced cold-atom mixtures with van der Waals and dipole interactions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.02441</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.02441v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study three-body systems in a mass-imbalanced two-component cold-atom mixture, and investigate the three-body parameter of their Efimov states for both bosonic and fermionic systems, with a major focus on the Er-Er-Li Efimov states. For a system interacting solely via van der Waals interactions, the van der Waals universality of the three-body parameter is analytically derived using the quantum defect theory. With the addition of a perturbative dipole interaction between the heavy atoms, the three-body parameters of the bosonic and fermionic Efimov states are found to behave differently. When the dipole interaction is as strong as the van der Waals interaction, corresponding to realistic Er-Er-Li Efimov states, we show that the van der Waals universality persists once the effects of the non-perturbative dipole interaction are renormalized into the s-wave and p-wave scattering parameters between the heavy atoms. For a dipole interaction much stronger than the van der Waals interaction, we find that the universality of the Efimov states can be alternatively characterized by a quasi-one-dimensional scattering parameter due to a strong anisotropic deformation of the Efimov wavefunctions. Our work thus clarifies the interplay of isotropic and anisotropic forces in the universality of the Efimov states. Based on the renormalized van der Waals universality, the three-body parameter is estimated for specific isotopes of Er-Li cold-atom mixtures.</description>

      <title>Mean-field theory of 1+1D $\mathbb{Z}_2$ lattice gauge theory with matter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.02890</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.02890v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Lattice gauge theories (LGTs) provide valuable insights into problems in strongly correlated many-body systems. Confinement which arises when matter is coupled to gauge fields is just one of the open problems, where LGT formalism can explain the underlying mechanism. However, coupling gauge fields to dynamical charges complicates the theoretical and experimental treatment of the problem. Developing a simplified mean-field theory is thus one of the ways to gain new insights into these complicated systems. Here we develop a mean-field theory of a paradigmatic 1+1D $\mathbb{Z}_2$ lattice gauge theory with superconducting pairing term, the gauged Kitaev chain, by decoupling charge and $\mathbb{Z}_2$ fields while enforcing the Gauss law on the mean-field level. We first determine the phase diagram of the original model in the context of confinement, which allows us to identify the symmetry-protected topological transition in the Kitaev chain as a confinement transition. We then compute the phase diagram of the effective mean-field theory, which correctly captures the main features of the original LGT. This is furthermore confirmed by the Green's function results and a direct comparison of the ground state energy. This simple LGT can be implemented in state-of-the art cold atom experiments. We thus also consider string-length histograms and the electric field polarization, which are easily accessible quantities in experimental setups and show that they reliably capture the various phases.</description>

      <title>GPU acceleration of ab initio simulations of large-scale identical particles based on path integral molecular dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.02628</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.02628v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Path integral Monte Carlo (PIMC) and path integral molecular dynamics (PIMD) provide the golden standard for the ab initio simulations of identical particles. In this work, we achieved significant GPU acceleration based on PIMD, which is equivalent to PIMC in the ab initio simulations, and developed an open-source PIMD code repository that does not rely on any other third party library. Numerical experiments show that for a system of 1600 interacting identical bosons in a harmonic trap, using a single GPU and a single CPU, it only takes two hours to achieve satisfactory simulation accuracy. With the increase of the number of identical particles, the advantage of GPU acceleration over CPU becomes more obvious, making it possible to simulate tens of thousands of identical particles from first principles using a single GPU. For example, for a system of 10000 non-interacting bosons, numerical experiments show that it takes 23 hours to obtain a simulation that is highly consistent with the exact results. Our study shows that GPU acceleration can lay a solid foundation for the wide application of PIMD simulations for extremely large-scale identical particle quantum systems with more than 10,000 particles. Numerical experiments show that a 24GB GPU can simulate up to 40000 identical particles from first principles, and the GPU acceleration leads to a roughly linear relationship between the computation time and the number of identical particles. In addition, we have also successfully implemented simulations for fictitious identical particle thermodynamics using GPU to overcome the Fermion sign problem, which makes it promising to efficiently and accurately simulate tens of thousands of fermions based on GPU.</description>

      <title>Particle dynamics and ergodicity-breaking in twisted-bilayer optical lattices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.01588</link>
      <description>arXiv:2306.01588v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Recent experiments have realized a twisted bilayer-like optical potential for ultra-cold atoms, which in contrast to solid-state set ups may allow for an arbitrary ratio between the inter- and intra-layer couplings. For commensurate Moir\'e twistings a large-enough inter-layer coupling results in particle transport dominated by channel formation. For incommensurate twistings, the interlayer coupling acts as an effective disorder strength. Whereas for weak couplings the whole spectrum remains ergodic, at a critical value part of the eigenspectrum transitions into multifractal states. A similar transition may be observed as well as a function of an energy bias between the two layers. Our study reveals atoms in optical twisted-bilayer lattices as an interesting new platform for the study of ergodicity breaking and multifractality.</description>

      <title>Dynamical characterization of $Z_{2}$ Floquet topological phases via quantum quenches</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.00114</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.00114v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The complete characterization of a generic $d$-dimensional Floquet topological phase is usually hard for the requirement of information about the micromotion throughout the entire driving period. In a recent work [L. Zhang et al., Phys. Rev. Lett. 125, 183001 (2020)], an experimentally feasible dynamical detection scheme was proposed to characterize the integer Floquet topological phases using quantum quenches. However, this theory is still far away from completion, especially for free-fermion Floquet topological phases, where the states can also be characterized by $Z_{2}$ invariants. Here we develop the first full and unified dynamical characterization theory for the $Z_{2}$ Floquet topological phases of different dimensionality and tenfold-way symmetry classes by quenching the system from a trivial and static initial state to the Floquet topological regime through suddenly changing the parameters and turning on the periodic driving. By measuring the minimal information of Floquet bands via the stroboscopic time-averaged spin polarizations, we show that the topological spin texture patterns emerging on certain discrete momenta of Brillouin zone called the $0$ or $\pi$ gap highest-order band-inversion surfaces provide a measurable dynamical $Z_{2}$ Floquet invariant, which uniquely determines the Floquet boundary modes in the corresponding quasienergy gap and characterizes the $Z_{2}$ Floquet topology. The applications of our theory are illustrated via one- and two-dimensional models that are accessible in current quantum simulation experiments. Our work provides a highly feasible way to detect the $Z_{2}$ Floquet topology and completes the dynamical characterization for the full tenfold classes of Floquet topological phases, which shall advance the research in theory and experiments.</description>

      <title>Deconfinement Dynamics of Fractons in Tilted Bose-Hubbard Chains</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.08455</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.08455v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Fractonic constraints can lead to exotic properties of quantum many-body systems. Here, we investigate the dynamics of fracton excitations on top of the ground states of a one-dimensional, dipole-conserving Bose-Hubbard model. We show that nearby fractons undergo a collective motion mediated by exchanging virtual dipole excitations, which provides a powerful dynamical tool to characterize the underlying ground state phases. We find that in the gapped Mott insulating phase, fractons are confined to each other as motion requires the exchange of massive dipoles. When crossing the phase transition into a gapless Luttinger liquid of dipoles, fractons deconfine. Their transient deconfinement dynamics scales diffusively and exhibits strong but subleading contributions described by a quantum Lifshitz model. We examine prospects for the experimental realization in tilted Bose-Hubbard chains by numerically simulating the adiabatic state preparation and subsequent time evolution, and find clear signatures of the low-energy fracton dynamics.</description>

      <title>Unifying Finite-Temperature Dynamical and Excited-State Quantum Phase Transitions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.18622</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.18622v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In recent years, various notions of dynamical phase transitions have emerged to describe far-from-equilibrium criticality. A unifying framework connecting these different concepts is still missing, and would provide significant progress towards understanding far-from-equilibrium quantum many-body universality. Initializing our system in a thermal ensemble and subsequently performing quantum quenches in the Lipkin-Meshkov-Glick model, we establish a direct connection between excited-state quantum phase transitions (ESQPTs) and two major types of dynamical phase transitions (DPTs), by relating the phases of the latter to the critical energies and conservation laws in the former. Our work provides further insight into how various concepts of non-ground-state criticality are intimately connected, paving the way for a unified framework of far-from-equilibrium universality.</description>
