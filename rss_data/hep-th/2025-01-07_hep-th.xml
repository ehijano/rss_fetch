      <title>The Double Copy of Maximal Supersymmetry in $D=4$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.02058</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.02058v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We realize off-shell, local and gauge invariant $N=8$ supergravity in $D=4$, to cubic order in fields, as the double copy of $N=4$ super Yang-Mills theory (SYM). Employing the homotopy algebra approach, we show that, thanks to a redundant formulation for the fermionic fields, the kinematic algebra $K$ of $N=4$ SYM is compatible with an action of the global supersymmetry algebra. The double copy space is then a subspace of $K\otimes \widetilde{K}$ that inherits an $L_{\infty}$ algebra on which the two copies of the $N=4$ action combine into an action of the $N=8$ supersymmetry algebra, with a corresponding enhancement of the $R$-symmetry group to $SU(8)$.</description>

      <title>Symmetry and causality constraints on Fermi liquids</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.02073</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.02073v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate symmetry and causality constraints on interacting Fermi liquids. Whereas Galilean or Lorentz boost symmetry leads to a well-known constraint on the first Landau parameter $F_1$, we show that scale invariance similarly constrains $F_0$. In the case of conformal Fermi liquids, we show that causality constraints on the particle-hole continuum and on zero sound strongly restrict the available parameter space for interacting Fermi liquids. We also consider nonlinear response, which we show is sensitive to additional ``generalized Landau parameters'' even at lowest orders in the long wavelength limit. We impose Galilean, Lorentz and scale symmetry on these generalized Landau parameters, obtaining further nonlinear constraints. We test our constraints in several microscopic models that enter a Fermi liquid phase.</description>

      <title>The Massive Flat Space Limit of Cosmological Correlators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.02119</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.02119v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Identifying useful flat-space limits for cosmological correlators, where they can be expressed in terms of observables in Minkowski space is nontrivial due to their scale-invariant nature. In recent years, it has been shown that momentum-space correlators encode flat-space amplitudes at specific singularities that emerge in the complex plane of their kinematics after analytical continuation. This flat-space limit is massless in the sense that the amplitude corresponds to the ultraviolet regime of the associated flat-space process, where the masses of the internal propagators are effectively zero. In this paper, we introduce a novel massive flat-space (MFS) limit, in which the internal masses in the corresponding flat-space Feynman graph remain finite. Our proposal applies to arbitrary graphs with light external legs and heavy internal lines, using a double-scaling limit. In this limit, the external energies, treated as independent variables, approach zero in inverse proportion to the propagator masses, which are sent to infinity. We present a general reduction formula that expresses diagrams in this limit in terms of amputated Feynman graphs in flat space. Our findings underscore the deep connections between the rich structure of massive Feynman integrals and the properties of cosmological correlators involving the exchange of heavy fields. Using this reduction formula, we compute sample one-loop contributions from heavy particles to inflationary correlators in the small sound-speed regime, revealing novel bispectrum shapes. The non-Gaussian signals we uncover, which are especially pronounced around the equilateral configuration, cannot be reproduced by adding local terms to the effective field theory of single-field inflation. Instead, they are captured by incorporating prescribed spatially non-local operators into the EFT.</description>

      <title>Dynamical de Sitter conjecture and quintessence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.02258</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.02258v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The de Sitter conjecture yields a severe bound on possible vacua for a consistent quantum gravity. We extend the de Sitter conjecture by taking into account dynamics of the scalar field. We then apply such an extended de Sitter conjecture to a quintessence model of inflation for which dynamics of the scalar field is essential, and obtain an allowed region of parameters of the scalar potential wider than previously considered cases with the conventional de Sitter conjecture. The new bounds in the swampland conjecture could have implications in several situations to construct compactification models.</description>

      <title>Nonminimal coupling, quantum scalar field stress-energy tensor and energy conditions on global anti-de Sitter space-time</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.02320</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.02320v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We compute the renormalized expectation value of the stress-energy tensor operator for a quantum scalar field propagating on three-dimensional global anti-de Sitter space-time. The scalar field has general mass and nonminimal coupling to the Ricci scalar curvature, and is subject to Dirichlet, Neumann or Robin boundary conditions at the space-time boundary. We consider both vacuum and thermal states, and explore whether the weak and null energy conditions are satisfied by the quantum stress-energy tensor. We uncover a rather complicated picture: compliance with these two energy conditions depends strongly on the mass and coupling of the scalar field to the curvature, and the boundary conditions applied.</description>

      <title>Traversable Wormhole in AdS and Entanglement</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.02324</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.02324v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A traversable wormhole generally violates the averaged null energy condition, usually requiring exotic matter. Recently, it has been found that the traversable wormhole can be realized by non-exotic matter in Einstein-Dirac-Maxwell theories in flat space. This paper generalizes discussions to the AdS spacetime and finds traversable wormholes with spherical and planar topologies. Furthermore, based on the AdS/CFT correspondence, we compute the entanglement entropy of strips and disks on two AdS boundaries of the wormhole. We find that entanglement entropy undergoes a phase transition as the subsystem size increases.</description>

      <title>Quantum mechanics and observers for gravity in a closed universe</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.02359</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.02359v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent arguments based on the quantum extremal surface formula or the gravitational path integral have given fairly compelling evidence that the Hilbert space of quantum gravity in a closed universe is one-dimensional and real. How can this be consistent with the complexity of our own experiences? In this paper we propose that the experiences of any observer $Ob$ in a closed universe can be approximately described by a quantum mechanical theory with a Hilbert space whose dimension is roughly $e^{S_{Ob}}$, where $S_{Ob}$ is the number of degrees of freedom of $Ob$. Moreover we argue that the errors in this description are exponentially small in $S_{Ob}$. We give evidence for this proposal using the gravitational path integral and the coding interpretation of holography, and we explain how similar effects arise in black hole physics in appropriate circumstances.</description>

      <title>A Four-dimensional Gauge Theory Perspective on Quantum K-theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.02394</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.02394v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The two-dimensional gauged linear sigma model has provided a physical model for the quantum cohomology of a K\"ahler manifold, $X$. A three-dimensional version of such construction has recently been shown to shed light on models of quantum K-theory of $X$. We consider an $\mathcal{N}=1$ four-dimensional version consisting of a $U(1)$ vector multiplet and chiral multiplets, generalizing the two-dimensional $\mathcal{N}=(2,2)$ setup. We compute the four-dimensional partition function on $D^2\times \mathbb{T}^2$ and demonstrates that it satisfies a difference equation which reduces to the deformed quantum K-theoretic one in the appropriate limit. We also demonstrate, though indirectly, that 4d invariants reduce to 3d quantum K-theory invariants in the same limit.</description>

      <title>Investigating quantum criticality through charged scalar fields near the BTZ black hole horizon</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.02444</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.02444v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We examine a charged scalar field with a position-dependent mass \( m(\rho) = m_0 + \mathcal{S}(\rho) \), where \(\mathcal{S}(\rho)\) represents a Lorentz scalar potential, near a BTZ black hole in the presence of an external magnetic field. By deriving the Klein-Gordon equation for this setup, we explore two scenarios: (i) a mass-modified scalar field with \(m(\rho) = m_0 - a/\rho\) (an exactly solvable case), and (ii) a scenario involving both mass modification and an external magnetic field (conditionally exactly solvable). We identify quantum critical points (QCPs) associated with the coupling constant \(a\). In the first scenario, for massless charged scalar fields, critical points occur at \(a = n + 1/2\) for all radial quantum numbers \(n \geq 0\) and magnetic quantum numbers \(|m| \geq 0\). In the second scenario, these critical points shift to \(a = n + 3/2\) for \(n \geq 0\) and \(|m| &gt; 0\), with the case \(m = 0\) excluded. For massive scalar fields, QCPs emerge at \(a = (n + 1/2)/2\), leading to non-propagating fields at zero frequency. At these QCPs, the field frequencies drop to zero, marking transitions from stable oscillatory modes to non-propagating states. Below the critical points, the system exhibits instability, characterized by negative imaginary frequencies that suggest rapid decay and high dissipation. Above the critical points, the modes stabilize and propagate, indicating a transition to a superconducting-like phase, where dissipation vanishes and stable excitations dominate.</description>

      <title>Effect of Impurity on Inhomogeneous Vacuum and Interacting Vortices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.02500</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.02500v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the inhomogeneous abelian Higgs model with a magnetic impurity. The vacuum configuration of the symmetry-broken phase is not simply the constant Higgs vacuum but is a nontrivial function of spatial coordinates, satisfying the Euler-Lagrange equations. The vacuum of zero winding number has zero magnetic flux but its non-zero magnetic field depends on spatial coordinates. The corresponding vacuum energy is negative for weak coupling $(\lambda &lt; 1)$, zero for critical BPS coupling $(\lambda = 1)$, and positive for strong coupling $(\lambda &gt; 1)$ by an over-, exact-, and under-cancellation of the huge positive impurity energy. This distinct vacuum energies are consistent with classification of the type I and I$\!$I superconductivity in dirty conventional superconductors. Non-BPS vortex configurations are also obtained in the presence of inhomogeneity. Their rest energies favor energetically vortex-impurity composite in conventional type I$\!$I superconductivity, consistent with imperfect diamagnetism. The delta function limit of Gaussian type impurity suggests the formation of vortex-lattice composite which elucidates flux-pinning in the context of inhomogeneous field theory.</description>

      <title>Feshbach resonances and dynamics of BPS solitons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.02589</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.02589v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We demonstrate that the geodesic dynamics of BPS solitons can be modified by the excitation of Feshbach resonances, or quasi-bound modes, in the Shifman-Voloshin model. A mode-generated force emerges, with a strength determined by the spectral flow of the frequency on the moduli space, and weakened by the coupling between the bound and scattering components of the resonance. Notably, spectral walls persist unaffected by the resonant mode's exponential decay, as the decay constant vanishes at the spectral wall. Our motivation comes from the 't Hooft-Polyakov monopoles, which do not present true bound states but long lived semi-bound excitations. Our findings suggest the existence of spectral walls in the scattering of excited monopoles in three dimensions, whose trajectories may significantly deviate from the geodesic motion in the moduli space of unexcited monopoles.</description>

      <title>A note on Centaur geometry -- probing IR de Sitter spacetime holography</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.02614</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.02614v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We explore a Centaur geometry in JT gravity, which is an asymptotically AdS spacetime but in the IR admits a dS bubble with another AdS geometry in the deep IR. Thus, this geometry admits a holographic dual in the sense that it is asymptotically AdS. In an attempt to understand this geometry, we calculate the density of states of the putative boundary dual for such mixed geometries by evaluating the on-shell action. We compute the density of states analytically in the classical limit. The resultant density of states suggest that the degrees of freedom in the IR are reduced in such a putative boundary theory due to the IR modification corresponding to the dS bubble.</description>

      <title>The gravitational path integral from an observer's point of view</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.02632</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.02632v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: One of the fundamental problems in quantum gravity is to describe the experience of a gravitating observer in generic spacetimes. In this paper, we develop a framework for describing non-perturbative physics relative to an observer using the gravitational path integral. We apply our proposal to an observer that lives in a closed universe and one that falls behind a black hole horizon. We find that the Hilbert space that describes the experience of the observer is much larger than the Hilbert space in the absence of an observer. In the case of closed universes, the Hilbert space is not one-dimensional, as calculations in the absence of the observer suggest. Rather, its dimension scales exponentially with $G_N^{-1}$. Similarly, from an observer's perspective, the dimension of the Hilbert space in a two-sided black hole is increased. We compute various observables probing the experience of a gravitating observer in this Hilbert space. We find that an observer experiences non-trivial physics in the closed universe in contrast to what it would see in a one-dimensional Hilbert space. In the two-sided black hole setting, our proposal implies that non-perturbative corrections to effective field theory for an infalling observer are suppressed until times exponential in the black hole entropy, resolving a recently raised puzzle in black hole physics. While the framework that we develop is exemplified in the toy-model of JT gravity, most of our analysis can be extended to higher dimensions and, in particular, to generic spacetimes not admitting a conventional holographic description, such as cosmological universes or black hole interiors.</description>

      <title>Extracting more information from entropy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.02668</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.02668v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We extract the complex frequency of the lowest quasi-normal mode from the holographically computed entropy density near thermodynamic equilibrium. The system consists of a purely thermal Supersymmetric Yang-Mills N=4 plasma in homogeneous isotropization dynamics. The initial state is far-from-equilibrium, proceeding to thermalization over time. The system evolves to equilibrium entropy forming a stairway pattern. The analysis reveals that the rate of increase of the stairway is twice the decay rate of the lowest quasi-normal mode. This leads us to propose a model explaining how this information is encoded in entropy. The model is extended to consider finite temperature, R-charge density and scalar condensate of the medium, disclosing an additional feature. The system's main dissipation channel may shift to one driven by the scalar condensate, depending on the chemical potential.</description>

      <title>Species scale associated with Weinberg operator and bound on Majorana neutrino mass</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.02682</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.02682v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: When states in a tower like the Kaluza-Klein or the string tower couple to another state through the irrelevant operators of the same type, their contributions to the loop corrections of the relevant or the marginal operators are not negligible, threatening the perturbativity. This can be avoided provided the cutoff scale is lower than the species scale associated with the irrelevant operator. We apply this to towers of states associated with the neutrino which couple to the Higgs through the Weinberg operator, the dimension-5 irrelevant operator generating the Majorana neutrino mass. Requiring the `Majorana species scale', the species scale associated with the Weinberg operator, to be below the gravitational species scale, one finds the lower bound on the Majorana neutrino mass determined by the species number. The Festina-Lente bound also gives the lower bound on the Majorana neutrino mass, but it is not so stringent. Meanwhile, even if the neutrino mass is of the Dirac type at the renormalizable level, the Majorana mass term still can be written in the effective field theory action so far as the Weinberg operator is not forbidden. Even if the Majorana neutrino mass is larger than the Dirac one, so far as there are sufficient degrees of freedom with mass smaller than the scale of the cosmological constant, the observation of the Majorana nature of the neutrino may not contradict to quantum gravity constraints which rules out the neutrino mass purely given by the Majorana type.</description>

      <title>Radiation-Reaction and Angular Momentum Loss at $\mathcal{O}(G^4)$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.02904</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.02904v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We point out that the contribution to the $\mathcal{O}(G^4)$ angular momentum loss for two-body scattering involving two radiation modes, $J_\text{2rad}$, is determined by the radiation-reaction contribution to the one-loop waveform. The latter is proportional to the tree-level one, and this reduces the calculation of $J_\text{2rad}$ to cut two-loop integrals. We exploit this simplification, which follows from unitarity, to obtain a closed-form expression for $J_\text{2rad}$ for generic velocities, which resums all fractional post-Newtonian (PN) corrections to the $\mathcal{O}(G^4)$ angular momentum loss starting at 1.5PN.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2501.02927v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: For the spinning superparticle we construct the pull-back of the world-line path integral to super moduli space in the Hamiltonian formulation. We describe the underlying geometric decomposition of super moduli space. Algebraically, this gives a realization of the cyclic complex. The resulting space-time action is classically equivalent to Yang-Mills theory up to boundary terms and additional non-local interactions.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2501.02991v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper explicitly develops the three-field cosmological perturbation theory with a flat field space. We solve the background and perturbation equations numerically for three different cases. First, to check the consistency of the three-field formalism, we investigate an effective two-field model motivated by the two-block case of the multi-giant vacua matrix Inflation model. Then we investigate a completely three-field case without any direct interaction between different fields, and finally, a three-field case containing direct interactions. The power spectra of the curvature perturbations in all cases are computed numerically, and the effects of rapid turn in the power spectrum are highlighted.</description>

      <title>Non-local modular flows across deformed null-cuts</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.02998</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.02998v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Modular flows probe important aspects of the entanglement structures, especially those of QFTs, in a dynamical framework. Despite the expected non-local nature in the general cases, the majority of explicitly understood examples feature local space-time trajectories under modular flows. In this work, we study a particular class of non-local modular flows. They are associated with the relativistic vacuum state and sub-regions whose boundaries lie on a planar null-surface. They satisfy a remarkable algebraic property known as the half-sided modular inclusion, and as a result the modular Hamiltonians are exactly known in terms of the stress tensor operators. To be explicit, we focus on the simplest QFT of a massive or massless free scalar in $2+1$ dimensions. We obtain explicit expressions for the generators. They can be separated into a sum of local and non-local terms showing certain universal pattern. The preservation of von-Neumann algebra under modular flow works in a subtle way for the non-local terms. We derive a differential-integral equation for the finite modular flow, which can be analyzed in perturbation theory of small distance deviating from the entanglement boundary, and re-summation can be performed in appropriate limits. Comparison with the general expectation of modular flows in such limits are discussed.</description>

      <title>Bosonic M-Theory From a Kac-Moody Algebra Perspective</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.03000</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.03000v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the existence of a bosonic m-theory extension of the 10D and 26D closed bosonic string in terms of Kac-Moody algebras. We argue that K11 and K27 are symmetries which protect the coefficients of the closed bosonic string in 10 and 26 dimensions. Therefore the Susskind-Horowitz bosonic m-theory obtained by compactification on S1/Z2, which does not produce the correct coefficients, must be replaced by something that preserves K11 and K27. We argue that in 11D, a non-trivial bosonic m-theory should be considered as (the bosonic sector of) m-theory, and in 27D that no obvious bosonic m-theory exists.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2501.03105v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We use resurgent extrapolation and continuation methods to extract detailed analytic information about the tilted cusp anomalous dimension solely from its weak coupling and strong coupling expansions. This enables accurate and smooth interpolation between the weak and strong coupling limits, and identifies the relevant singularities governing the finite radius of convergence of the weak coupling expansion and the asymptotic nature of the strong coupling expansion. The input data is purely perturbative, generated from the BES equations, and these resurgent methods extract accurate non-perturbative information which matches the underlying physical structure.</description>

Abstract: We discuss and extend some aspects pertaining to the canonical quantisation of JT gravity in de Sitter space, including the problem of time and the construction of a Hilbert space. We then extend this discussion to other two dimensional models obtained by changing the dilaton potential and show that the canonical quantisation procedure can be carried out for a large class of such models. Some discussion leading towards a path integral understanding for states, other than the Hartle Hawking state, is also included here, along with comments pertaining to Holography and the entropy of de Sitter space.</description>

      <title>Equilibrium of Charges and Differential Equations Solved by Polynomials II</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.01494v2 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We continue study of equilibrium of two species of 2d coulomb charges (or point vortices in 2d ideal fluid) started in [20]. Although for two species of vortices with circulation ratio -1 the relationship between the equilibria and the factorization/Darboux transformation of the Schrodinger operator was established a long ago, the question about similar relationship for the ratio -2 remained unanswered. Here we present the answer: One has to consider Darboux-type transformations of third order differential operators rather than second order Schrodinger operators. Furthermore, we show that such transformations can also generate equilibrium configurations where an additional charge of a third specie is present. Relationship with integrable hierarchies is briefly discussed.</description>

Abstract: We compute the 1-loop contribution to the graviton self-energy from a loop of massless fermions on a general cosmological background. The result is used to quantum-correct the linearized Einstein equation on de Sitter background and work out 1-loop corrections to gravitational radiation and to the response to a point mass. The renormalization group is employed to sum these to all orders for as long as the de Sitter phase persists.</description>

      <title>Machine Learns Quantum Complexity?</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.02005v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study how a machine based on deep learning algorithms learns Krylov spread complexity in quantum systems with N x N random Hamiltonians drawn from the Gaussian unitary ensemble. Using thermofield double states as initial conditions, we demonstrate that a convolutional neural network-based algorithm successfully learns the Krylov spread complexity across all timescales, including the late-time plateaus where states appear nearly featureless and random. Performance strongly depends on the basis choice, performing well with the energy eigenbasis or the Krylov basis but failing in the original basis of the random Hamiltonian. The algorithm also effectively distinguishes temperature-dependent features of thermofield double states. Furthermore, we show that the system time variable of state predicted by deep learning is an irrelevant quantity, reinforcing that the Krylov spread complexity well captures the essential features of the quantum state, even at late times.</description>

      <title>Distribution of regularized three-body phase-volume</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.02013</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.02013v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The micro-canonical phase-space volume for the three-body problem is a topic of intrinsic interest. Within the flux-based statistical theory, it provides a means to predict the scale of disintegration times for non-hierarchical systems. While the bare phase-volume diverges, arXiv:2205.04294 (Paper I) showed that a regularized version can be defined. Building on Paper I, which determined the regularized phase-volume for a given energy $\bar\sigma(E)$, this paper extends the analysis to its distribution over angular momentum, $\bar\sigma(E,L)$. Through analytical integrations, we reduce the problem to a 3d numerical integration, a step up in complexity from the 2d integration required for $\bar\sigma(E)$. We provide regularized phase-volume values for several mass sets across a range of $E$ and $L$, validated through an $L$-integration test. Notably, the values remain positive for all tested parameters, lending further support to the validity of the chosen regularization procedure. For high values of $L$ at fixed masses and $E$, we observe a strong suppression of $\bar\sigma(E,L)$.</description>

      <title>Relational bundle geometric formulation of non-relativistic quantum mechanics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.02046</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.02046v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a bundle geometric formulation of non-relativistic many-particles Quantum Mechanics. A wave function is seen to be a $\mathbb{C}$-valued cocyclic tensorial 0-form on configuration space-time seen as a principal bundle, while the Schr\"odinger equation flows from its covariant derivative, with the action functional supplying a (flat) cocyclic connection 1-form on the configuration bundle. In line with the historical motivations of Dirac and Feynman, ours is thus a Lagrangian geometric formulation of QM, in which the Dirac-Feynman path integral arises in a geometrically natural way.
  Applying the dressing field method, we obtain a relational reformulation of this geometric non-relativistic QM: a relational wave function is realised as a basic cocyclic 0-form on the configuration bundle. In this relational QM, any particle position can be used as a dressing field, i.e. as a "physical reference frame". The dressing field method naturally accounts for the freedom in choosing the dressing field, which is readily understood as a covariance of the relational formulation under changes of physical reference frame.</description>

      <title>A sufficient condition for the development of superradiant instabilities in charged black-hole spacetimes</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.02053v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The physical and mathematical properties of charged black holes that are linearly coupled to charged massive scalar fields are studied analytically. In particular, we prove that, in the eikonal large-mass regime $M\mu\gg1$, the compact dimensionless inequality $\Phi_{\text{H}}&gt;Q/M$ provides a sufficient condition for the development of superradiant instabilities in the curved black-hole spacetime [here $\{M,Q,\Phi_{\text{H}}\}$ are respectively the mass, the electric charge, and the horizon electrostatic potential of the central black hole and $\mu$ is the proper mass of the field]. The familiar charged Reissner-Nordstr\"om black hole does not satisfy this inequality. On the other hand, we explicitly prove that all charged Ay\'on-Beato-Garc\'ia (ABG) black-hole spacetimes satisfy this analytically derived sufficient condition and may therefore become superradiantly unstable to perturbations of charged massive scalar fields.</description>

      <title>Repulsive quantum gravitoelectric-gravitomagnetic interaction</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.02470v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate, in the framework of linearized quantum gravity, the quantum gravitational interaction between a gravitoelectrically polarizable object and a gravitomagnetically polarizable object. This interaction originates from the coupling between the instantaneous mass quadrupole moment and the mass-current quadrupole moment of the objects, induced by fluctuating gravitoelectric and gravitomagnetic fields in a vacuum. Using leading-order perturbation theory, we derive the explicit expression of the quantum gravitoelectric-gravitomagnetic interaction energy, which shows a distance dependence of $r^{-8}$ in the near regime and $r^{-11}$ in the far regime, where $r$ is the distance between the two objects. Remarkably, this interaction energy is positive, indicating that the force is repulsive. Since interactions between objects polarizable in the same gravitoelectric or gravitomagnetic manner are inherently attractive, for objects which are both gravitoelectrically and gravitomagnetically polarizable, the overall quantum gravitational interaction potential is reduced when the repulsive quantum gravitoelectric-gravitomagnetic interaction is taken into account. However, for two isotropically polarizable objects with identical gravitoelectric and gravitomagnetic polarizabilities and energy level spacing, the repulsive quantum interaction cannot surpass the attractive interactions.</description>

      <title>Global 21 cm signal: a promising probe of primordial features</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.02538</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.02538v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Inflationary models that involve bursts of particle production generate bump-like features in the primordial power spectrum of density perturbations. These features influence the evolution of density fluctuations, leaving their unique signatures in cosmological observations. A detailed investigation of such signatures would help constrain physical processes during inflation. With this motivation, the goal of this paper is two-fold. First, we conduct a detailed analysis of the effects of bump-like primordial features on the sky-averaged 21 cm signal. Using semi-numerical simulations, we demonstrate that the primordial features can significantly alter the ionization history and the global 21 cm profile, making them a promising probe of inflationary models. We found a special scale (namely, the turnover wavenumber, $k^{\rm turn}$) at which the effect of primordial bump-like features on the global 21 cm profile vanishes. Also, we found that the behaviour of the primordial features on the global profile and ionization history are quite opposite for $k &gt; k^{\rm turn}$ and $k &lt; k^{\rm turn}$. We trace the root cause of these behaviours to the effects of primordial features on the halo mass function at high redshifts. Furthermore, we discuss the degeneracy between the astrophysical parameters and the primordial features in detail. Secondly, for a fixed set of astrophysical parameters, we derive upper limits on the amplitude of bump-like features in the range $10^{-1} &lt; k\,[{\rm Mpc}^{-1}] &lt; 10^2$ using current limits on optical depth to reionization from CMB data by Planck.</description>

      <title>Parametrization Framework for the Deceleration Parameter in Scalar Field Dark Energy Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.02592</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.02592v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose a Friedmann-Lemaitre-Robertson-Walker cosmological model with a scalar field that represents dark energy. A new parametrization of the deceleration parameter is introduced of the form $q = 1 + \eta (1 + \mu a^{\eta})$ where $\eta$ and $\mu$ are model parameters. and the compatibility of the model is constrained by recent observational datasets, including cosmic chronometers, Pantheon+ and Baryon Acoustic Observations. By considering a variable deceleration parameter, we address the expansion history of the universe, providing a viable description of the transition from deceleration to acceleration. Using the Markov Chain Monte Carlo method, the parameters of the model are constrained and we examine the cosmological parameters. A comparison is then made with the $\Lambda$CDM model using the latest observations. We examine the history of the main cosmological parameters, such as the deceleration parameter, jerk parameter, snap parameter, density parameter, and equation-of-state parameter, by constraining and interpreting them to reveal insights into what has been dubbed "dynamical dark energy" under the assumptions made above. Our method provides a framework that is independent of the model to explore dark energy, leading to a deeper and more subtle understanding of the mechanisms driving late-time cosmic acceleration.</description>

      <title>Holographic inflation and holographic dark energy from entropy of the anti-de Sitter black hole</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.02759</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.02759v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Based on the entropy of anti-de Sitter black hole, a new holographic dark energy model has been proposed. When the Hubble horizon and particle horizon are chosen as the IR cutoff, the late-time accelerated expansion of universe is realized. In this paper, we consider the Hubble horizon as the IR cutoff to investigate holographic inflation and slow-roll inflation in this model. We find that slow-roll inflation with the chaotic potential $V_{0}\phi^{n}$ is favored by Planck results for some special cases, such as $n=1/3$ and $n=1/2$, while holographic inflation is not supported by Planck results. Then, we use the dynamical analysis method, statefinder diagnostic pairs, and the Hubble diagram to analyze this model. Our results indicate that when $b^{2}$ takes a small value, this model cannot be distinguished from the standard $\Lambda$CDM model and can serve as an alternative to it.</description>

      <title>$\eta$ invariant of massive Wilson Dirac operator and the index</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.02873</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.02873v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We revisit the lattice index theorem in the perspective of $K$-theory. The standard definition given by the overlap Dirac operator equals to the $\eta$ invariant of the Wilson Dirac operator with a negative mass. This equality is not coincidental but reflects a mathematically profound significance known as the suspension isomorphism of $K$-groups. Specifically, we identify the Wilson Dirac operator as an element of the $K^1$ group, which is characterized by the $\eta$-invariant. Furthermore, we prove that, at sufficiently small but finite lattice spacings, this $\eta$-invariant equals to the index of the continuum Dirac operator. Our results indicate that the Ginsparg-Wilson relation and the associated exact chiral symmetry are not essential for understanding gauge field topology in lattice gauge theory.</description>

      <title>Thermal RG Flow of AS Quantum Gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.02878</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.02878v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We perform the thermal Renormalization Group (RG) study of the Asymptotically Safe (AS) quantum gravity in the Einstein-Hilbert truncation by relating the temperature parameter to the running RG scale as $T \equiv k_T = \tau k$ (in natural units) in order to determine its thermal evolution in terms of the dimensionless temperature $\tau$ which is associated with the temperature of the expanding Universe. Thus, $k_T$ and $k$ are understood as running cutoffs for thermal and quantum fluctuations, respectively. Quantum effects are taken into account by moving along the thermal RG trajectory with fixed value of $\tau$ producing the quantum effective action at a given dimensionless temperature. The $\tau$-evolution of the dimensionless Newton coupling $g(\tau)$ and the dimensionless cosmological constant $\lambda(\tau)$ results in a vanishing $g$-coordinate of the Reuter (i.e., non-Gaussian UV) fixed point in the high temperature limit ($\tau \to \infty$) which means that only the symmetric phase of AS gravity survives at $\tau = \infty$.</description>

      <title>Revealing the internal magnetic field configuration of magnetars via their associated periodic signals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.02887</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.02887v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The magnetic deformation of magnetars is affected by their internal magnetic fields, which are generally difficult to be measured directly through observations. In this work, the periodic pulse-phase modulations in the hard X-ray emissions of the magnetars 4U 0142+61, 1E 1547.0-5408, SGR 1900+14, and SGR 1806-20, and the periodicities of fast radio bursts (FRBs) 180916 and 121102 are interpreted as free precession of the (host) magnetars. Using these periodic signals, we investigate the magnetars' internal magnetic fields. In order to simultaneously account for the modulation periods and surface thermal emissions of the former four magnetars, and require that their internal poloidal fields smoothly connect with the surface dipole fields, the parameter that characterizes the distribution of toroidal field in the magnetar interior should satisfy $\beta\gtrsim1$. Moreover, their volume-averaged strengths of poloidal and toroidal fields are respectively $\bar{B}_{\rm p}\sim10^{14}$--$10^{15}$ G and $\bar{B}_{\rm t}\sim10^{15}$ G with the strength ratios $\bar{B}_{\rm t}/\bar{B}_{\rm p}$ generally distributing within $\sim2$--$37$. We could also constrain the critical temperature for neutron superfluidity in the neutron-star core considering that the former four magnetars are probably precessing, and the most stringent constraint is $T_{\rm c,core}&lt;6.4\times10^8$ K. Adopting a possible critical temperature $T_{\rm c,core}=5\times10^8$ K, we could obtain $\bar{B}_{\rm p}\gtrsim10^{14}$--$10^{15}$ G and $\bar{B}_{\rm t}\gtrsim10^{14}$--$10^{15}$ G for the host magnetars of FRBs 180916 and 121102, which indicates that the magnetars of our interest possibly have similar poloidal and toroidal fields.</description>

      <title>Stable excitations and holographic transportation in tensor networks of critical spin chains</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.03084v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The AdS/CFT correspondence conjectures a duality between quantum gravity theories in anti-de Sitter (AdS) spacetime and conformal field theories (CFTs) on the boundary. One intriguing aspect of this correspondence is that it offers a pathway to explore quantum gravity through tabletop experiments. Recently, a multi-scale entanglement renormalization ansatz (MERA) model of AdS/CFT that can be implemented using contemporary quantum simulators has been proposed [R. Sahay, M. D. Lukin, and J. Cotler, arXiv:2401.13595 (2024)]. Particularly, local bulk excitations (entitled "hologrons") manifesting attractive interactions given by AdS gravity were found. However, the fundamental question concerning the stability of these identified hologrons is still left open. Here, we address this question and find that hologrons are unstable during dynamic evolution. In searching for stable bulk excitations with attractive interactions, we find they can be constructed by the local primary operators in the boundary CFT. Furthermore, we identify a class of boundary excitations that exhibit the bizarre behavior of "holographic transportation", which can be directly observed on the boundary system implemented in experiments.</description>

Abstract: The use of the vacuum projector $|0 \rangle \langle 0| $ and of the unitary Weyl operators enables us to construct a set of Hermitian dichotomic operators in relativistic scalar Quantum Field Theory in Minkowski spacetime. Employing test functions supported in diamond regions, both Bell and Mermin inequalities are studied by means of a numerical setup. In addition to reporting expressive violations of both inequalities, the cluster property is also checked.</description>

      <title>Positive geometries and canonical forms via mixed Hodge theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.03202</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.03202v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: ''Positive geometries'' are a class of semi-algebraic domains which admit a unique ''canonical form'': a logarithmic form whose residues match the boundary structure of the domain. The study of such geometries is motivated by recent progress in particle physics, where the corresponding canonical forms are interpreted as the integrands of scattering amplitudes. We recast these concepts in the language of mixed Hodge theory, and identify ''genus zero pairs'' of complex algebraic varieties as a natural and general framework for the study of positive geometries and their canonical forms. In this framework, we prove some basic properties of canonical forms which have previously been proved or conjectured in the literature. We give many examples and study in detail the case of arrangements of hyperplanes and convex polytopes.</description>

Abstract: The Checkerboard conformal field theory is an interesting representative of a large class of non-unitary, logarithmic Fishnet CFTs (FCFT) in arbitrary dimension which have been intensively studied in the last years. Its planar Feynman graphs have the structure of a regular square lattice with checkerboard colouring. Such graphs are integrable since each coloured cell of the lattice is equal to an R-matrix in the principal series representations of the conformal group. We compute perturbatively and numerically the anomalous dimension of the shortest single-trace operator in two reductions of the Checkerboard CFT: the first one corresponds to the Fishnet limit of the twisted ABJM theory in 3D, whereas the spectrum in the second, 2D reduction contains the energy of the BFKL Pomeron. We derive an analytic expression for the Checkerboard analogues of Basso--Dixon 4-point functions, as well as for the class of Diamond-type 4-point graphs with disc topology. The properties of the latter are studied in terms of OPE for operators with open indices. We prove that the spectrum of the theory receives corrections only at even orders in the loop expansion and we conjecture such a modification of Checkerboard CFT where quantum corrections occur only with a given periodicity in the loop order.</description>

Abstract: We provide an improved definition of new conserved quantities derived from the energy-momentum tensor in curved spacetime by introducing an additional scalar function. We find that the conserved current and the associated conserved charge become geometric under a certain initial condition of the scalar function, and show that such a conserved geometric current generally exists in curved spacetime. Furthermore, we demonstrate that the geometric conserved current agrees with the entropy current in an effective theory of a perfect fluid, thus the conserved charge is the total entropy of the system. While the geometric charge can be regarded as the entropy for a nondissipative fluid, its physical meaning should be investigated for more general cases.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.19411v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study multiscalar theories with $\text{O}(N) \times \text{O}(2)$ symmetry. These models have a stable fixed point in $d$ dimensions if $N$ is greater than some critical value $N_c(d)$. Previous estimates of this critical value from perturbative and non-perturbative renormalization group methods have produced mutually incompatible results. We use numerical conformal bootstrap methods to constrain $N_c(d)$ for $3 \leq d &lt; 4$. Our results show that $N_c&gt; 3.78$ for $d = 3$. This favors the scenario that the physically relevant models with $N = 2,3$ in $d=3$ do not have a stable fixed point, indicating a first-order transition. Our result exemplifies how conformal windows can be rigorously constrained with modern numerical bootstrap algorithms.</description>

Abstract: Cosmological correlators encode invaluable information about the wavefunction of the primordial universe. In this letter we present a duality between correlators and wavefunction coefficients that is valid to all orders in the loop expansion and manifests itself as a $\mathbb{Z}_4$ symmetry. To demonstrate the power of the duality, we derive a correlator-to-correlator factorisation (CCF) formula for the parity-odd part of cosmological correlators that relates $n$-point observables to lower-point ones via a series of diagrammatic cuts. These relations serve as the first example of physically testable cutting rules as they involve observables defined for arbitrary physical kinematics. We further show how the duality allows us to translate the cosmological optical theorem for wavefunction coefficients into statements about cosmological correlators.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.06268v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study Yang-Mills theory on four dimensional Anti-de Sitter space. The Dirichlet boundary condition cannot exist at arbitrarily large radius because it would give rise to colored asymptotic states in flat space. As observed in [1] this implies a deconfinement-confinement transition as the radius is increased. We gather hints on the nature of this transition using perturbation theory. We compute the anomalous dimensions of the lightest scalar operators in the boundary theory, which are negative for the singlet and positive for non-trivial representations. We also compute the correction to the coefficient $C_J$ and we estimate that the singlet operator reaches marginality before the value of the coupling at which $C_J=0$. These results favor the scenario of merger and annihilation as the most promising candidate for the transition. For the Neumann boundary condition, the lightest scalar operator is found to have a positive anomalous dimension, in agreement with the idea that this boundary condition extrapolates smoothly to flat space. The perturbative calculations are made possible by a drastic simplification of the gauge field propagator in Fried-Yennie gauge. We also derive a general result for the leading-order anomalous dimension of the displacement operator for a generic perturbation in Anti-de Sitter, showing that it is related to the beta function of bulk couplings.</description>

Abstract: We shed a new light on the longstanding problem of covariant charges in diffeomorphism invariant theories like General Relativity (GR) by noting the other important feature of the theory, the background independence. To this end, we develop covariant phase space formalism in which we allow for the boundaries of spacetime to have arbitrary fluctuations. Within this formalism we show non-covariance of charges appear in inevitable integration constants which also break background independence in the expression of charges. We then apply the same formalism to black hole thermodynamics. We generalize the seminal Iyer-Wald derivation the first law of bl1ack hole thermodynamics by relaxing the need for the assumptions at a bifurcation surface and asymptotic infinity, as well as addressing questions regarding the integrability of charges. We also present a first principles derivation of the Smarr relation within our framework.</description>

      <title>Double Field Theory and $\alpha'$ corrections: explicit examples</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.04833</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.04833v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We construct several solutions of effective actions for string theories beyond the supergravity approximation utilizing the framework of the Double Field Theory (DFT). The DFT effective actions, which are well suited for accommodating abelian and non-abelian T dualities, are naturally written in terms of modified connections and curvatures with torsion. We construct the most general solutions with vanishing modified torsion, and such geometries don't receive quantum corrections. We also compute the leading $\alpha'$ corrections to several supergravity solutions, including a pair of geometries related by a non-abelian T duality.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2408.08229v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We show how to reliably calculate quantum gravitational corrections to cosmological models using the unique effective action formalism for quantum gravity. Our calculations are model independent and apply to any ultra-violet complete theory of quantum gravity that admit general relativity as a low energy theory. We show that it is important to consider the full effective action to obtain renormalization group invariant solutions. We investigate the validity range of our techniques within simple cosmological models.</description>

      <title>Three-dimensional $\operatorname{SL}(2,\mathbb R)$ Yang-Mills theory is three-dimensional gravity with background sources</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.14228</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.14228v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Chern-Simons theory with certain gauge groups is known to be equivalent to a first-order formulation of three-dimensional Einstein gravity with a cosmological constant, where both are purely topological. Here, we extend this correspondence to theories with dynamical degrees of freedom. We show that three-dimensional Yang-Mills theory with gauge group $\operatorname{SL}(2,\mathbb R)$ is equivalent to the first-order formulation of three-dimensional Einstein gravity with no cosmological constant coupled to a background stress-energy tensor density (which breaks the diffeomorphism symmetry). The local degree of freedom of three-dimensional Yang-Mills theory corresponds to degenerate "gravitational waves" in which the metric is degenerate and the spin connection is no longer completely determined by the metric. Turning on a cosmological constant produces the third-way (for $\Lambda&lt;0$) or the imaginary third-way (for $\Lambda&gt;0$) gauge theories with a background stress-energy tensor density.</description>

      <title>Classical Weight-Four L-value Ratios as Sums of Calabi--Yau Invariants</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.07107</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.07107v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We revisit the series solutions of the attractor equations of 4d N=2 supergravities obtained by Calabi--Yau compactifications previously studied in Candelas, Kuusela, and McGovern (2021). While only convergent for a restricted set of black hole charges, we find that they are summable with Pad\'e resummation providing a suitable method. By specialising these solutions to rank-two attractors, we obtain many conjectural identities of the type discovered in CKM. These equate ratios of weight-four special L-values with an infinite series whose summands are formed out of genus-0 Gromov--Witten invariants. We also present two new rank-two attractors which belong to moduli spaces each interesting in their own right. Each moduli space possesses two points of maximal unipotent monodromy. One has already been studied by Hosono and Takagi, and we discuss issues stemming from the associated L-function having nonzero rank.</description>

      <title>On exact overlaps of integrable matrix product states: inhomogeneities, twists and dressing formulas</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.23117</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.23117v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Invoking a quantum dressing procedure as well as the representation theory of twisted Yangians we derive a number of summation formulas for the overlap between integrable matrix product states and Bethe eigenstates which involve only eigenvalues of fused transfer matrices and which are valid in the presence of inhomogeneities as well as twists. Although the method is general we specialize to the $SO(6)$ spin chain for which integrable matrix product states corresponding to evaluation representations of the twisted Yangian $Y^+(4)$ encode the information about one-point functions of the D3-D5 domain wall version of ${\cal N}=4$ SYM. Considering the untwisted and homogeneous limit of our summation formulas we finally fill the last gap in the analytical understanding of the overlap formula for the $SO(6$) sector of the D3-D5 domain wall system.</description>

      <title>Holographic boundary conformal field theory with $T\bar T$ deformation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.06345</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.06345v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We propose a holographic dual of boundary conformal field theory (BCFT) with $T\bar T$ deformation, i.e. of $T\bar T$ BCFT. Our holographic proposal distinguishes two types of $T\bar T$ BCFTs, depending on whether the $T\bar T$ deformation deforms the boundary. For the boundary-deformed case, we find that boundary entropy serves as an effective measure to quantify the impact of boundary deformation. In this scenario, we calculate the energy spectrum for the $T\bar T$ BCFT within a finite interval to support the proposed dual. For the boundary-undeformed case, we calculate the entanglement entropy and R\'enyi entropy from both the field theory side and the gravity side, and find that they match.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.12934v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Inspired by the possibility of emergent supersymmetry in critical random systems, we study a field theory model with a quartic potential of one superfield, possessing the Parisi-Sourlas supertranslation symmetry. Within perturbative $\epsilon$ expansion, we find nine non-trivial scale invariant renormalization group fixed points, but only one of them is conformal. We, however, believe scale invariance without conformal invariance cannot occur without a sophisticated mechanism because it predicts the existence of a non-conserved but non-renormalized vector operator called virial current, whose existence must be non-generic. We show that the virial current in this model is related to the supercurrent by supertranslation. The supertranslation Ward-Takahashi identity circumvents the genericity argument, explaining its non-renormalization property.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.13928v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The Ruijsenaars-Schneider models are integrable dynamical realizations of the Poincare group in 1+1 dimensions, which reduce to the Calogero and Sutherland systems in the nonrelativistic limit. In this work, a possibility to construct a one-parameter deformation of the Ruijsenaars-Schneider models by uplifting the Poincare algebra in 1+1 dimensions to the anti de Sitter algebra is studied. It is shown that amendments including a cosmological constant are feasible for the rational variant, while the hyperbolic and trigonometric systems are ruled out by our analysis. The issue of integrability of the deformed rational model is discussed in some detail. A complete proof of integrability remains a challenge.</description>

Abstract: We study the physics of 2 and 3 mutually intersecting conformal defects forming wedges and corners in general dimension. For 2 defects we derive the beta function of the edge interactions for infinite and semi-infinite wedges and study them in the tricritical model in $d=3-\epsilon$ as an example. We discuss the dependency of the edge anomalous dimension on the intersection angle, connecting to an old issue known in the literature. Additionally, we study trihedral corners formed by 3 planes and compute the corner anomalous dimension, which can be considered as a higher-dimensional analog of the cusp anomalous dimension. We also study 3-line corners related to the three-body potential of point-like impurities.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.09487v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The forced soliton equation is the starting point for semiclassical computations with solitons away from the small momentum transfer regime. This paper develops necessary analytical and numerical tools for analyzing solutions to the forced soliton equation in the context of two-dimensional models with kinks. Results include a finite degree of freedom regularization of soliton sector physics based on periodic and anti-periodic lattice models, a detailed analysis of numerical solutions, and the development of perturbation theory in the soliton momentum transfer to mass ratio Delta P/M. Numerical solutions at large transfer, greater or similar to the soliton mass, are capable of exhibiting, in a smooth and controlled fashion, extreme phenomena such as soliton-antisoliton pair creation and superluminal collective coordinate velocities, which we investigate.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.18965v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We show how Carrollian symmetries become important in the construction of one-dimensional fermionic systems with all flat-band spectra from first principles. The key ingredient of this construction is the identification of Compact Localised States (CLSs), which appear naturally by demanding $\textit{supertranslation}$ invariance of the system. We use CLS basis states, with inherent $\textit{ultra-local}$ correlations, to write down an interacting theory which shows a non-trivial phase structure and an emergent Carroll conformal symmetry at the gapless points. We analyze this theory in detail for both zero and finite chemical potential.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.19640v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We calculate n-point hard string scattering amplitudes (HSSA) with n-2 tachyons and 2 tensor states at arbitrary mass levels. We discover the stringy scaling behavior of these HSSA. It is found that for HSSA with more than 2 transverse directions, the degree of stringy scaling dimM2 decreases comparing to the degree of stringy scaling dimM1 of the n-1 tachyons and 1 tensor HSSA calculated previously. Moreover, we propose a set of K-identities which is the key to demonstrate the stringy scaling behavior of HSSA. We explicitly prove both the diagonal and off-diagonal K-identities for the 4-point HSSA and give numerical proofs of these K-identities for some higher point HSSA.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2501.00934v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Generalizing the usual setup for holographic duality, where bulk spacetime is described by pseudo-Riemannian geometry, we consider a Riemann-Cartan bulk with non-trivial torsion as a background for an Abelian bulk gauge field dual to $U(1)$ boundary current. Working in the probe limit, we explore how the bulk torsion, which induces spin current at the boundary, affects the conductivity of the boundary theory. We consider standard types of non-minimal couplings between torsion and the electromagnetic field found in the literature, and the results seem to suggest that these torsion couplings are more suitable candidates, compared to the common minimal coupling regime, for a holographic explanation of the existing experimental findings regarding conductivity.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.18410v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Chiral edges of 2+1D systems can have very robust emergent conformal symmetry. When the edge is purely chiral, the Hilbert space of low-energy edge excitations can form a representation of a single Virasoro algebra. We propose a method to systematically extract the generators of the Virasoro algebra from a single ground state wavefunction, using entanglement bootstrap and an input from the edge conformal field theory. We corroborate our construction by numerically verifying the commutation relations of the generators. We also study the unitary flows generated by these operators, whose properties (such as energy and state overlap) are shown numerically to agree with our analytical predictions.</description>

      <title>Massive Higher-Spin Fields in the Fractional Quantum Hall Effect</title>

Abstract: Incompressibility plays a key role in the geometric description of fractional quantum Hall fluids. It is naturally related to quantum area-preserving diffeomorphisms and the underlying Girvin-MacDonald-Plazman algebra, which gives rise to an emergent non-relativistic massive spin-2 mode propagating in the bulk. The corresponding metric tensor can be identified with a nematic order parameter for the bulk states. In the linearised regime with a flat background, it has been shown that this mode can be described by a spin-2 Schroedinger action. However, quantum area-preserving diffeomorphisms also suggest the existence of higher-spin modes that cannot be described through nematic fractional quantum Hall states. Here, we consider p-atic Hall phases, in which the corresponding p-atic order parameters are related to higher-rank symmetric tensors. We then show that in this framework, non-relativistic massive chiral higher-spin fields naturally emerge and that their dynamics is described by higher-spin Schroedinger actions. We finally show that these effective actions can be derived from relativistic massive higher-spin theories in 2+1 dimensions after taking a non-relativistic limit.</description>

      <title>Non-Hermitian Topology in Hermitian Topological Matter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.10015</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.10015v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Non-Hermiticity gives rise to distinctive topological phenomena absent in Hermitian systems. However, connection between such intrinsic non-Hermitian topology and Hermitian topology has remained largely elusive. Here, considering the bulk and boundary as an environment and system, respectively, we demonstrate that anomalous boundary states in Hermitian topological insulators exhibit non-Hermitian topology. We study the self-energy capturing the particle exchange between the bulk and boundary, and show that it detects Hermitian topology in the bulk and induces non-Hermitian topology at the boundary. As an illustrative example, we reveal non-Hermitian topology and concomitant skin effect inherently embedded within chiral edge states of Chern insulators. We also identify the emergence of hinge states within effective non-Hermitian Hamiltonians at surfaces of three-dimensional topological insulators. Furthermore, we comprehensively classify our correspondence across all the tenfold symmetry classes of topological insulators and superconductors. Our work uncovers hidden connection between Hermitian and non-Hermitian topology, and provides an approach to identifying non-Hermitian topology in quantum matter.</description>

      <title>Loop-induced masses for the first two generations with optimum flavour violation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.19179</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.19179v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A mechanism for the masses of third, second, and first generation charged fermions at the tree, 1-loop, and 2-loop levels, respectively, is proposed. The fermionic self-energy corrections that lead to this arrangement are induced through heavy vector bosons of a new gauged flavour symmetry group $G_F$. It is shown that a single Abelian group suffices as $G_F$. Moreover, the gauge charges are optimized to result in relatively smaller flavour violations in processes involving the first and second generation fermions. The scheme is explicitly implemented on the Standard Model fermions in an anomaly-free manner and is shown to be viable with observed charged fermion masses and quark mixings. Constraints from flavour violations dictate the lower limit on the new physics scale in these types of frameworks. Through optimal flavour violation, it is shown that nearly two orders of magnitude improvement can be achieved on the lower limit, leading to the new physics scale $\ge 10^3$ TeV in this case. Further improvements are possible at the cost of the down quark mass deviating more than $3 \sigma$ from its value extracted from lattice calculations. Options for inducing tiny masses for light neutrinos are also discussed.</description>

      <title>Random matrix universality in dynamical correlation functions at late times</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.12103</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.12103v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the behavior of two-time correlation functions at late times for finite system sizes considering observables whose (one-point) average value does not depend on energy. In the long time limit, we show that such correlation functions display a ramp and a plateau determined by the correlations of energy levels, similar to what is already known for the spectral form factor. The plateau value is determined, in absence of degenerate energy levels, by the fluctuations of diagonal matrix elements, which highlights differences between different symmetry classes. We show this behavior analytically by employing results from Random Matrix Theory and the Eigenstate Thermalisation Hypothesis, and numerically by exact diagonalization in the toy example of a Hamiltonian drawn from a Random Matrix ensemble and in a more realistic example of disordered spin glasses at high temperature. Importantly, correlation functions in the ramp regime do not show self-averaging behaviour, and, at difference with the spectral form factor the time average does not coincide with the ensemble average.</description>

      <title>On the Generality and Persistence of Cosmological Stasis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.00835</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.00835v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Hierarchical decays of $N$ matter species to radiation may balance against Hubble expansion to yield stasis, a new phase of cosmological evolution with constant matter and radiation abundances. We analyze stasis with various machine learning techniques on the full $2N$-dimensional space of decay rates and abundances, which serve as inputs to the system of Boltzmann equations that governs the dynamics. We construct a differentiable Boltzmann solver to maximize the number of stasis $e$-folds $\mathcal{N}$. High-stasis configurations obtained by gradient ascent motivate log-uniform distributions on rates and abundances to accompany power-law distributions of previous works. We demonstrate that random configurations drawn from these families of distributions regularly exhibit many $e$-folds of stasis. We additionally use them as priors in a Bayesian analysis conditioned on stasis, using stochastic variational inference with normalizing flows to model the posterior. All three numerical analyses demonstrate the generality of stasis and point to a new model in which the rates and abundances are exponential in the species index. We show that the exponential model solves the exact stasis equations, is an attractor, and satisfies $\mathcal{N}\propto N$, exhibiting inflation-level $e$-folding with a relatively low number of species. This is contrasted with the $\mathcal{N}\propto \log(N)$ scaling of power-law models. Finally, we discuss implications for the emergent string conjecture and string axiverse.</description>

      <title>Charged scalars at finite electric field and temperature in the optimized perturbation theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.05967</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.05967v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the symmetry breaking and restoration behavior of a self-interacting charged scalar field theory under the influence of a constant electric field and finite temperature. Our study is performed in the context of the optimized perturbation theory. The dependence of the effective potential with constant electric fields is established by means of the bosonic propagators in the Schwinger proper-time method. Explicit analytical expressions for the electric and thermal contributions are found. Our results show a very weak decreasing behavior of the vacuum expectation value as a function of the electric field, which is strengthened by the temperature effect. A first-order phase transition that occurs at zero/weak electric fields changes to a second-order phase transition under strong electric fields. The critical temperature for the phase transition exhibited a very weak dependence on the electric field. Additionally, we computed the vacuum persistence probability rate for the interacting theory, finding a peak at the critical point. The maximum value of this rate at the critical point is found to be independent of the coupling constant but depended solely on the magnitude of the electric field.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.08883v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The eikonal correspondence between the quasi-normal modes (QNMs) of asymptotically flat static spherically symmetric black holes and the properties of unstable null circular geodesics is studied in the case of higher dimensional Lovelock black holes (BHs). It is known that such correspondence does not generically hold for gravitational QNMs associated with BHs in Lovelock theories. In the present work, we revisit this correspondence and establish the relationship between the eikonal QNMs and the causal properties of the gravitational field equations in Lovelock theories of gravity.</description>

      <title>Constraints on primordial black holes from $N_{\text{eff}}$ : scalar induced gravitational waves as an extra radiation component</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.10111v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In June 2023, multiple pulsar timing array collaborations provided evidence for the existence of a stochastic gravitational wave background. Scalar induced gravitational waves (SIGWs), as one of the most likely sources of stochastic gravitational waves, have received widespread attention. When primordial curvature perturbations on small scales are sufficiently large, \acp{PBH} inevitably form, concurrently producing SIGWs with significant observable effects. These SIGWs can serve as an additional radiation component, influencing the relativistic degrees of freedom $N_{\text{eff}}$. Taking into account primordial non-Gaussianity, we study the energy density spectrum of SIGWs up to the third order and use the current observational data of $N_{\text{eff}}$ to constrain small-scale primordial curvature perturbations and the abundance of \acp{PBH}.</description>

      <title>Gravitational waves from burdened primordial black holes dark matter</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.17544v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Primordial black holes (PBHs) are the natural candidate of dark matter (DM) as they only interact gravitationally and can evade any experiments on earth. In the standard semiclassical calculation of Hawking radiation, PBHs with mass below $10^{15}\rm g$ evaporated by now and therefore cannot be DM. However, the recently-discovered quantum memory burden effect can significantly suppress the evaporation of PBHs after the half-decay time. This quantum effect could open up a new mass window below $10^{10} \rm g$ where PBHs can still exist today and be DM. In this paper, we compute the gravitational wave (GW) signals associated with the formation of PBHs in this new mass window. We consider two formation scenarios: PBHs formed from inflationary perturbation and PBHs formed from collapse of Fermi-balls in a first-order phase transition (FOPT). GWs produced from these two scenarios have distinct features and, while the GW from inflation peaks at high frequency, the GW from FOPT peaks at lower frequency that can be within the reach of future experiments.</description>

      <title>Renormalization group improved cosmology in the presence of a stiff matter era</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.03693</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.03693v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In \href{https://link.aps.org/doi/10.1103/PhysRevD.92.103004}{Phys. Rev. D 92 (2015) 103004}, simple analytical solutions of the Friedman equations were obtained for a universe having stiff matter component in the early universe together with a dark matter, and a dark energy component. In this analysis, the universe is considered to be made of a dark fluid which behaves as a stiff matter in the early phase of the universe (when the internal energy dominates). It is also more logical to consider quantum gravitational effects in the early phase of the cosmological evolution. In this analysis, following \href{https://link.aps.org/doi/10.1103/PhysRevD.65.043508}{Phys. Rev. D 65 (2002) 043508}, we consider renormalization group improved modified Friedmann equations where the Newton's gravitational constant ($G$) and the cosmological constant ($\Lambda$) flows with the momentum scale $k$ of the universe. It is observed that for a universe undergoing a stiff matter era, radiation era, and matter era, inflation is absent in the early time regime of the universe when the flow of the Newton's gravitational constant and cosmological constant is under consideration. Using the identification of the momentum scale with the scale factor of the universe, we then explore the era $t&gt;t_{\text{Pl}}$ which indicates a primarily matter dominated era with accelerated expansion due to the presence of dark energy. Finally, considering the total equation of state as a combination of linear equation of state along with a polytropic equation of state, we observe that after the Planck-time the universe can undergo an inflationary phase and we find out that the inflation is enhanced by quantum gravitational effects arising due to the consideration of renormalization group approach to quantum gravity.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.04674v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this work, we start by examining a spherically symmetric black hole within the framework of non-commutative geometry and apply a modified Newman-Janis method to obtain a new rotating solution. We then investigate its consequences, focusing on the horizon structure, ergospheres, and the black hole's angular velocity. Following this, a detailed thermodynamic analysis is performed, covering surface gravity, Hawking temperature, entropy, and heat capacity. We also study geodesic motion, with particular emphasis on null geodesics and their associated radial accelerations. Additionally, the photon sphere and the resulting black hole shadows are explored. Finally, we compute the quasinormal modes for scalar perturbations using the 6th-order WKB approximation.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.07092v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Using the bitstring probabilities of ground states of bipartitioned ladders of Rydberg atoms, we calculate the mutual information which is a lower bound on the corresponding bipartite von Neumann quantum entanglement entropy $S^{vN}_A$. We show that in many cases, these lower bounds can be improved by removing the bitstrings with a probability lower than some value $p_{min}$ and renormalizing the remaining probabilities (filtering). Surprisingly, in some cases, as we increase $p_{min}$ the filtered mutual information tends to plateaus at values very close to $S^{vN}_A$ over some range of $p_{min}$. We consider various sizes, lattice spacings and bipartitions. Our numerical investigation suggest that the filtered mutual information obtained with samples having just a few thousand bitstrings can provide reasonably close estimates of $S^{vN}_A$. We briefly discuss practical implementations with the QuEra's Aquila device.</description>

      <title>Black Holes and Baryon Number Violation: Unveiling the Origins of Early Galaxies and the Low-Mass Gap</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.10847</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.10847v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We propose that modifications to the Higgs potential within a narrow atmospheric layer near the event horizon of an astrophysical black hole could significantly enhance the rate of sphaleron transitions, as well as transform the Chern-Simons number into a dynamic variable. As a result, sphaleron transitions in this region occur without suppression, in contrast to low-temperature conditions, and each transition may generate a substantially greater baryon number than would be produced by winding around the Higgs potential in Minkowski spacetime. This effect amplifies baryon number violation near the black hole horizon, potentially leading to a considerable generation of matter. Given the possibility of a departure from equilibrium during the absorption of matter and the formation of relativistic jets in supermassive black holes, we conjecture that this process could contribute to the creation of a significant amount of matter around such black holes. This phenomenon may offer an alternative explanation for the rapid growth of supermassive black holes and their surrounding galaxies in the early Universe, as suggested by recent observations from the JWST. Furthermore, this mechanism may provide insights into the low-mass gap puzzle, addressing the observed scarcity of black holes with masses near the Oppenheimer-Volkoff limit.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.18685v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we complete the classification of 4 x 4 solutions of the Yang-Baxter equation. Regular solutions were recently classified and in this paper we find the remaining non-regular solutions. We present several new solutions, then consider regular and non-regular Lax operators and study their relation to the quantum Yang-Baxter equation. We show that for regular solutions there is a correspondence, which is lost in the non-regular case. In particular, we find non-regular Lax operators whose R-matrix from the fundamental commutation relations is regular but does not satisfy the Yang-Baxter equation.

      <title>A First Look at Supersymmetry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.07799</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.07799v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: These are expanded notes for a short series of lectures, presented at the University of Luxembourg in 2017, giving an introduction to some of the ideas of supersymmetry and supergeometry. In particular, we start from some motivating facts in physics, pass to the theory of supermanifolds, then to spinors, ending up at super-Minkowski space-times. We examine some salient mathematical issues with understanding supersymmetry in a classical setting and make no attempt to discuss phenomenologically interesting models. Moreover, the presentation is "light" in the sense that nothing is carefully proved. The audience of the seminars ranged from Ph.D. students to more experienced postdocs in mathematics. The audience was assumed to have a working knowledge of differential geometry, elementary category theory, and basic ideas from classical &amp; quantum mechanics. No knowledge of supersymmetry and supergeometry is assumed.</description>

      <title>Harvesting stabilizer entropy and non-locality from a quantum field</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.11918</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.11918v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The harvesting of quantum resources from the vacuum state of a quantum field is a central topic in relativistic quantum information. While several proposals for the harvesting of entanglement from the quantum vacuum exist, less attention has been paid to other quantum resources, such as non-stabilizerness, commonly dubbed {\em magic} and quantified by the Stabilizer R\'enyi Entropy (SRE) \cite{Leone_2022_SRE}. In this work, we show how to harvest SRE from the vacuum state of a massless field, using accelerated Unruh-DeWitt detectors in Minkowski spacetime. In particular, one can harvest a particular non-local form of SRE that cannot be erased by local unitary operations. This non-local SRE is a fundamental quantity to study the interplay between entanglement and non-stabilizer resources. We conclude our work with an analysis of the CHSH inequalities: one cannot extract a violation from the quantum field even when one can harvest the necessary resources for it.</description>

      <title>Simulations of the Sterile Neutrino Oscillations with a Crossing-Width Term</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.19220</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.19220v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we present an algorithm to generate the collider events of the GeV-scale oscillating sterile neutrinos with the ready-made event generation tools in the case that the crossing-widths among the nearly-degenerate fermionic fields arise. We prove the validity of our algorithm, and adopt some tricks for practical calculations. The formulations of the particle oscillation processes are also improved in the framework of the quantum field theory, offering us the ability to simulate the flying distances of the oscillating intermediate sterile neutrinos while regarding them as the internal lines in the Feynmann diagrams.</description>

      <title>An impediment to torsion from spectral geometry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.19626</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.19626v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Modifications of standard general relativity that bring torsion into a game have a long-standing history. However, no convincing arguments exist for or against its presence in physically acceptable gravity models. In this Letter, we provide an argument based on spectral geometry (using methods of pseudo-differential calculus) that suggests that the torsion shall be excluded from the consideration. We demonstrate that there is no well-defined functional extending to the torsion-full case of the spectral formulation of the Einstein tensor.</description>

      <title>Update on non-unitary mixing in the recent NO$\nu$A and T2K data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.00146</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.00146v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this letter, we have used a non-unitary mixing scheme to resolve the tension between NO$\nu$A and T2K data. It is demonstrated that the results of NO$\nu$A and T2K can be explained by the effects by non-unitary mixing arising from $\alpha_{00}$ and $\alpha_{10}$. For $\alpha_{00}$ there is a large overlap between the allowed NO$\nu$A and T2K regions for NH on the $\sin^2\theta_{23}-\delta_{\rm CP}$ plane at $1\,\sigma$. However, the tension still exists. NO$\nu$A rules out unitary mixing at a $3\,\sigma$ level, whereas T2K strongly prefers unitary mixing. For $\alpha_{10}$, the tension can be \textbf{well resolved} with the best-fit point for NH at $|\alpha_{10}|=0.06$ for both experiments.</description>
