      <title>WiRM: Wireless Respiration Monitoring Using Conjugate Multiple Channel State Information and Fast Iterative Filtering in Wi-Fi Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.23419</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.23419v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Monitoring respiratory health with the use of channel state information (CSI) has shown promising results. Many existing methods focus on monitoring only the respiratory rate, while others focus on monitoring the motion of the chest as a patient breathes, which is referred to as the respiratory waveform. This paper presents WiRM, a two-staged approach to contactless respiration monitoring. In the first stage, WiRM improves upon existing respiratory rate estimation techniques by using conjugate multiplication for phase sanitisation and adaptive multi-trace carving (AMTC) for tracing how the respiratory rate changes over time. When compared against three state-of-the-art methods, WiRM has achieved an average reduction of $38\%$ in respiratory rate root mean squared error (RMSE). In the second stage, WiRM uses this improved respiratory rate estimate to inform the decomposition and selection of the respiratory waveform from the CSI data. Remarkably, WiRM delivers a $178.3\%$ improvement in average absolute correlation with the ground truth respiratory waveform. Within the literature, it is difficult to compare the robustness of existing algorithms in noisy environments. In this paper, we develop a purpose-built simulation toolkit to evaluate the robustness of respiration monitoring solutions under various noise conditions, including thermal, multiplicative, and phase noise. Our results show that WiRM demonstrates improved or comparable resilience to these common noise sources.</description>

      <title>SOME: Symmetric One-Hot Matching Elector -- A Lightweight Microsecond Decoder for Quantum Error Correction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.23618</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.23618v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Conventional quantum error correction (QEC) decoders such as Minimum-Weight Perfect Matching (MWPM) and Union-Find (UF) offer high thresholds and fast decoding, respectively, but both suffer from high topological complexity. In contrast, Ising model-based decoders reduce topological complexity but demand considerable decoding time. We propose the Symmetric One-Hot Matching Elector (SOME), a novel decoder that reformulates the QEC decoding task as a Quadratic Unconstrained Binary Optimization (QUBO) problem -- termed the One-Hot QUBO (OHQ). Each variable in the QUBO represents whether a given pair of flipped syndromes is matched, while the error probabilities between the pair are encoded as interaction coefficients (weight). Constraints ensure that each flipped syndrome is matched exactly once. Valid solutions of OHQ correspond to self-inverse permutation matrices, characterized by symmetric one-hot encoding. To solve the OHQ efficiently, SOME reformulates the decoding task as the construction of permutation matrices that minimize the total weight. It initializes each candidate matrix from one of the minimum-weight syndrome pairs, then iteratively appends additional pairs in ascending order of weight, and finally selects the permutation matrix with the lowest total energy. SOME achieves up to a 99.9x reduction in variable count and reduces decoding times from milliseconds to microseconds on a single-threaded commodity CPU. OHQ also maintains performance up to a 10.5% physical error rate, surpassing the highest known threshold of MWPM@.</description>

      <title>Complexity-energy trade-off in programmable unitary interferometers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.22972</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.22972v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Coherent multiport interferometers are a promising approach to realize matrix multiplication in integrated photonics. However, most known architectures - such as MZI and beamsplitter meshes, as well as more general interferometers - suffer from complicated procedures for mapping the matrix elements of the desired transformation to specific phaseshifts in the device. We point out that the high programming complexity is intrinsic, rather than accidental. At the same time, we argue that interferometers admitting efficient programming algorithms in general yield a much lower useful output energy, which ultimately limits their accuracy and energy efficiency.</description>

      <title>FAST-LoRa: An Efficient Simulation Framework for Evaluating LoRaWAN Networks and Transmission Parameter Strategies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.23342</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.23342v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Internet of Things (IoT) has transformed many industries, and LoRaWAN (Long Range Wide Area Network), built on LoRa (Long Range) technology, has become a crucial solution for enabling scalable, low-cost, and energy-efficient communication in wide-area networks. Simulation tools are essential for optimizing the transmission parameters and, therefore, the energy efficiency and performance of LoRaWAN networks. While existing simulation frameworks accurately replicate real-world scenarios by including multiple layers of communication protocols, they often imply significant computational overhead and simulation times. To address this issue, this paper introduces FAST-LoRa, a novel simulation framework designed to enable fast and efficient evaluation of LoRaWAN networks and selection of transmission parameters. FAST-LoRa streamlines computation by relying on analytical models without complex packet-level simulations and implementing gateway reception using efficient matrix operations. Rather than aiming to replace discrete-event simulators, FAST-LoRa is intended as a lightweight and accurate approximation tool for evaluating transmission parameter strategies in scenarios with stable traffic patterns and uplink-focused communications. In our evaluation, we compare FAST-LoRa with a well-established simulator using multiple network configurations with varying numbers of end devices and gateways. The results show that FAST-LoRa achieves similar accuracy in estimating key network metrics, even in complex scenarios with interference and multi-gateway reception, with a Mean Absolute Error (MAE) of 0.940 $\times 10^{-2}$ for the Packet Delivery Ratio (PDR) and 0.040 bits/mJ for Energy Efficiency (EE), while significantly reducing computational time by up to three orders of magnitude.</description>

      <title>Breaking the mould of Social Mixed Reality -- State-of-the-Art and Glossary</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.23454</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.23454v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This article explores a critical gap in Mixed Reality (MR) technology: while advances have been made, MR still struggles to authentically replicate human embodiment and socio-motor interaction. For MR to enable truly meaningful social experiences, it needs to incorporate multi-modal data streams and multi-agent interaction capabilities. To address this challenge, we present a comprehensive glossary covering key topics such as Virtual Characters and Autonomisation, Responsible AI, Ethics by Design, and the Scientific Challenges of Social MR within Neuroscience, Embodiment, and Technology. Our aim is to drive the transformative evolution of MR technologies that prioritize human-centric innovation, fostering richer digital connections. We advocate for MR systems that enhance social interaction and collaboration between humans and virtual autonomous agents, ensuring inclusivity, ethical design and psychological safety in the process.</description>

      <title>Preprocessing Methods for Memristive Reservoir Computing for Image Recognition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.05588</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.05588v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Reservoir computing (RC) has attracted attention as an efficient recurrent neural network architecture due to its simplified training, requiring only its last perceptron readout layer to be trained. When implemented with memristors, RC systems benefit from their dynamic properties, which make them ideal for reservoir construction. However, achieving high performance in memristor-based RC remains challenging, as it critically depends on the input preprocessing method and reservoir size. Despite growing interest, a comprehensive evaluation that quantifies the impact of these factors is still lacking. This paper systematically compares various preprocessing methods for memristive RC systems, assessing their effects on accuracy and energy consumption. We also propose a parity-based preprocessing method that improves accuracy by 2-6% while requiring only a modest increase in device count compared to other methods. Our findings highlight the importance of informed preprocessing strategies to improve the efficiency and scalability of memristive RC systems.</description>

      <title>VRISE: A Virtual Reality Platfrom for Immersive and Interactive Surveying Education</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.22810</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.22810v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Surveying is a core component of civil engineering education, requiring students to engage in hands-on spatial measurement, instrumentation handling, and field-based decision-making. However, traditional instruction often poses logistical and cognitive challenges that can hinder accessibility and student engagement. While virtual laboratories have gained traction in engineering education, few are purposefully designed to support flexible, adaptive learning in surveying. To address this gap, we developed Virtual Reality for Immersive and Interactive Surveying Education (VRISE), an immersive virtual reality laboratory that replicates ground-based and aerial surveying tasks through customizable, accessible, and user-friendly modules. VRISE features interactive experiences such as differential leveling with a digital level equipment and waypoint-based drone navigation, enhanced by input smoothing, adaptive interfaces, and real-time feedback to accommodate diverse learning styles. Evaluation across multiple user sessions demonstrated consistent gains in measurement accuracy, task efficiency, and interaction quality, with a clear progression in skill development across the ground-based and aerial surveying modalities. By reducing cognitive load and physical demands, even in tasks requiring fine motor control and spatial reasoning, VRISE demonstrates the potential of immersive, repeatable digital environments to enhance surveying education, broaden participation, and strengthen core competencies in a safe and engaging setting.</description>
