      <title>AniGaussian: Animatable Gaussian Avatar with Pose-guided Deformation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.19441</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.19441v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent advancements in Gaussian-based human body reconstruction have achieved notable success in creating animatable avatars. However, there are ongoing challenges to fully exploit the SMPL model's prior knowledge and enhance the visual fidelity of these models to achieve more refined avatar reconstructions. In this paper, we introduce AniGaussian which addresses the above issues with two insights. First, we propose an innovative pose guided deformation strategy that effectively constrains the dynamic Gaussian avatar with SMPL pose guidance, ensuring that the reconstructed model not only captures the detailed surface nuances but also maintains anatomical correctness across a wide range of motions. Second, we tackle the expressiveness limitations of Gaussian models in representing dynamic human bodies. We incorporate rigid-based priors from previous works to enhance the dynamic transform capabilities of the Gaussian model. Furthermore, we introduce a split-with-scale strategy that significantly improves geometry quality. The ablative study experiment demonstrates the effectiveness of our innovative model design. Through extensive comparisons with existing methods, AniGaussian demonstrates superior performance in both qualitative result and quantitative metrics.</description>

      <title>SVGEditBench V2: A Benchmark for Instruction-based SVG Editing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.19453</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.19453v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Vector format has been popular for representing icons and sketches. It has also been famous for design purposes. Regarding image editing, research on vector graphics editing rarely exists in contrast with the raster counterpart. We considered the reason to be the lack of datasets and benchmarks. Thus, we propose SVGEditBench V2, a benchmark dataset for instruction-based SVG editing. SVGEditBench V2 comprises triplets of an original image, a ground truth image, and the editing prompt. We built the dataset by first extracting image pairs from various SVG emoji datasets. Then, we had GPT-4o to create the prompt. We found that triplets gained by this simple pipeline contain varying sorts of editing tasks. Additionally, we performed the editing tasks with existing LLMs and investigated how those current methods can perform SVG editing. Although there were some successful cases, we found that there is a massive room for improvement.</description>

      <title>TransVDM: Motion-Constrained Video Diffusion Model for Transparent Video Synthesis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.19454</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.19454v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent developments in Video Diffusion Models (VDMs) have demonstrated remarkable capability to generate high-quality video content. Nonetheless, the potential of VDMs for creating transparent videos remains largely uncharted. In this paper, we introduce TransVDM, the first diffusion-based model specifically designed for transparent video generation. TransVDM integrates a Transparent Variational Autoencoder (TVAE) and a pretrained UNet-based VDM, along with a novel Alpha Motion Constraint Module (AMCM). The TVAE captures the alpha channel transparency of video frames and encodes it into the latent space of the VDMs, facilitating a seamless transition to transparent video diffusion models. To improve the detection of transparent areas, the AMCM integrates motion constraints from the foreground within the VDM, helping to reduce undesirable artifacts. Moreover, we curate a dataset containing 250K transparent frames for training. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach across various benchmarks.</description>

      <title>FLAP: Fully-controllable Audio-driven Portrait Video Generation through 3D head conditioned diffusion mode</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.19455</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.19455v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Diffusion-based video generation techniques have significantly improved zero-shot talking-head avatar generation, enhancing the naturalness of both head motion and facial expressions. However, existing methods suffer from poor controllability, making them less applicable to real-world scenarios such as filmmaking and live streaming for e-commerce. To address this limitation, we propose FLAP, a novel approach that integrates explicit 3D intermediate parameters (head poses and facial expressions) into the diffusion model for end-to-end generation of realistic portrait videos. The proposed architecture allows the model to generate vivid portrait videos from audio while simultaneously incorporating additional control signals, such as head rotation angles and eye-blinking frequency. Furthermore, the decoupling of head pose and facial expression allows for independent control of each, offering precise manipulation of both the avatar's pose and facial expressions. We also demonstrate its flexibility in integrating with existing 3D head generation methods, bridging the gap between 3D model-based approaches and end-to-end diffusion techniques. Extensive experiments show that our method outperforms recent audio-driven portrait video models in both naturalness and controllability.</description>

      <title>Compression in 3D Gaussian Splatting: A Survey of Methods, Trends, and Future Directions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.19457</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.19457v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) has recently emerged as a pioneering approach in explicit scene rendering and computer graphics. Unlike traditional neural radiance field (NeRF) methods, which typically rely on implicit, coordinate-based models to map spatial coordinates to pixel values, 3DGS utilizes millions of learnable 3D Gaussians. Its differentiable rendering technique and inherent capability for explicit scene representation and manipulation positions 3DGS as a potential game-changer for the next generation of 3D reconstruction and representation technologies. This enables 3DGS to deliver real-time rendering speeds while offering unparalleled editability levels. However, despite its advantages, 3DGS suffers from substantial memory and storage requirements, posing challenges for deployment on resource-constrained devices. In this survey, we provide a comprehensive overview focusing on the scalability and compression of 3DGS. We begin with a detailed background overview of 3DGS, followed by a structured taxonomy of existing compression methods. Additionally, we analyze and compare current methods from the topological perspective, evaluating their strengths and limitations in terms of fidelity, compression ratios, and computational efficiency. Furthermore, we explore how advancements in efficient NeRF representations can inspire future developments in 3DGS optimization. Finally, we conclude with current research challenges and highlight key directions for future exploration.</description>

      <title>Building Interactable Replicas of Complex Articulated Objects via Gaussian Splatting</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.19459</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.19459v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Building articulated objects is a key challenge in computer vision. Existing methods often fail to effectively integrate information across different object states, limiting the accuracy of part-mesh reconstruction and part dynamics modeling, particularly for complex multi-part articulated objects. We introduce ArtGS, a novel approach that leverages 3D Gaussians as a flexible and efficient representation to address these issues. Our method incorporates canonical Gaussians with coarse-to-fine initialization and updates for aligning articulated part information across different object states, and employs a skinning-inspired part dynamics modeling module to improve both part-mesh reconstruction and articulation learning. Extensive experiments on both synthetic and real-world datasets, including a new benchmark for complex multi-part objects, demonstrate that ArtGS achieves state-of-the-art performance in joint parameter estimation and part mesh reconstruction. Our approach significantly improves reconstruction quality and efficiency, especially for multi-part articulated objects. Additionally, we provide comprehensive analyses of our design choices, validating the effectiveness of each component to highlight potential areas for future improvement.</description>

      <title>Text2VDM: Text to Vector Displacement Maps for Expressive and Interactive 3D Sculpting</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.20045</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.20045v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Professional 3D asset creation often requires diverse sculpting brushes to add surface details and geometric structures. Despite recent progress in 3D generation, producing reusable sculpting brushes compatible with artists' workflows remains an open and challenging problem. These sculpting brushes are typically represented as vector displacement maps (VDMs), which existing models cannot easily generate compared to natural images. This paper presents Text2VDM, a novel framework for text-to-VDM brush generation through the deformation of a dense planar mesh guided by score distillation sampling (SDS). The original SDS loss is designed for generating full objects and struggles with generating desirable sub-object structures from scratch in brush generation. We refer to this issue as semantic coupling, which we address by introducing classifier-free guidance (CFG) weighted blending of prompt tokens to SDS, resulting in a more accurate target distribution and semantic guidance. Experiments demonstrate that Text2VDM can generate diverse, high-quality VDM brushes for sculpting surface details and geometric structures. Our generated brushes can be seamlessly integrated into mainstream modeling software, enabling various applications such as mesh stylization and real-time interactive modeling.</description>

      <title>Tight Inversion: Image-Conditioned Inversion for Real Image Editing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.20376</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.20376v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Text-to-image diffusion models offer powerful image editing capabilities. To edit real images, many methods rely on the inversion of the image into Gaussian noise. A common approach to invert an image is to gradually add noise to the image, where the noise is determined by reversing the sampling equation. This process has an inherent tradeoff between reconstruction and editability, limiting the editing of challenging images such as highly-detailed ones. Recognizing the reliance of text-to-image models inversion on a text condition, this work explores the importance of the condition choice. We show that a condition that precisely aligns with the input image significantly improves the inversion quality. Based on our findings, we introduce Tight Inversion, an inversion method that utilizes the most possible precise condition -- the input image itself. This tight condition narrows the distribution of the model's output and enhances both reconstruction and editability. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach when combined with existing inversion methods through extensive experiments, evaluating the reconstruction accuracy as well as the integration with various editing methods.</description>

      <title>DGFM: Full Body Dance Generation Driven by Music Foundation Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.20176</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.20176v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In music-driven dance motion generation, most existing methods use hand-crafted features and neglect that music foundation models have profoundly impacted cross-modal content generation. To bridge this gap, we propose a diffusion-based method that generates dance movements conditioned on text and music. Our approach extracts music features by combining high-level features obtained by music foundation model with hand-crafted features, thereby enhancing the quality of generated dance sequences. This method effectively leverages the advantages of high-level semantic information and low-level temporal details to improve the model's capability in music feature understanding. To show the merits of the proposed method, we compare it with four music foundation models and two sets of hand-crafted music features. The results demonstrate that our method obtains the most realistic dance sequences and achieves the best match with the input music.</description>

      <title>Topological Autoencoders++: Fast and Accurate Cycle-Aware Dimensionality Reduction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.20215</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.20215v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper presents a novel topology-aware dimensionality reduction approach aiming at accurately visualizing the cyclic patterns present in high dimensional data. To that end, we build on the Topological Autoencoders (TopoAE) formulation. First, we provide a novel theoretical analysis of its associated loss and show that a zero loss indeed induces identical persistence pairs (in high and low dimensions) for the $0$-dimensional persistent homology (PH$^0$) of the Rips filtration. We also provide a counter example showing that this property no longer holds for a naive extension of TopoAE to PH$^d$ for $d\ge 1$. Based on this observation, we introduce a novel generalization of TopoAE to $1$-dimensional persistent homology (PH$^1$), called TopoAE++, for the accurate generation of cycle-aware planar embeddings, addressing the above failure case. This generalization is based on the notion of cascade distortion, a new penalty term favoring an isometric embedding of the $2$-chains filling persistent $1$-cycles, hence resulting in more faithful geometrical reconstructions of the $1$-cycles in the plane. We further introduce a novel, fast algorithm for the exact computation of PH for Rips filtrations in the plane, yielding improved runtimes over previously documented topology-aware methods. Our method also achieves a better balance between the topological accuracy, as measured by the Wasserstein distance, and the visual preservation of the cycles in low dimensions. Our C++ implementation is available at https://github.com/MClemot/TopologicalAutoencodersPlusPlus.</description>

      <title>InterMimic: Towards Universal Whole-Body Control for Physics-Based Human-Object Interactions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.20390</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.20390v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Achieving realistic simulations of humans interacting with a wide range of objects has long been a fundamental goal. Extending physics-based motion imitation to complex human-object interactions (HOIs) is challenging due to intricate human-object coupling, variability in object geometries, and artifacts in motion capture data, such as inaccurate contacts and limited hand detail. We introduce InterMimic, a framework that enables a single policy to robustly learn from hours of imperfect MoCap data covering diverse full-body interactions with dynamic and varied objects. Our key insight is to employ a curriculum strategy -- perfect first, then scale up. We first train subject-specific teacher policies to mimic, retarget, and refine motion capture data. Next, we distill these teachers into a student policy, with the teachers acting as online experts providing direct supervision, as well as high-quality references. Notably, we incorporate RL fine-tuning on the student policy to surpass mere demonstration replication and achieve higher-quality solutions. Our experiments demonstrate that InterMimic produces realistic and diverse interactions across multiple HOI datasets. The learned policy generalizes in a zero-shot manner and seamlessly integrates with kinematic generators, elevating the framework from mere imitation to generative modeling of complex human-object interactions.</description>

      <title>FSH3D: 3D Representation via Fibonacci Spherical Harmonics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.08308</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.08308v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Spherical harmonics are a favorable technique for 3D representation, employing a frequency-based approach through the spherical harmonic transform (SHT). Typically, SHT is performed using equiangular sampling grids. However, these grids are non-uniform on spherical surfaces and exhibit local anisotropy, a common limitation in existing spherical harmonic decomposition methods. This paper proposes a 3D representation method using Fibonacci Spherical Harmonics (FSH3D). We introduce a spherical Fibonacci grid (SFG), which is more uniform than equiangular grids for SHT in the frequency domain. Our method employs analytical weights for SHT on SFG, effectively assigning sampling errors to spherical harmonic degrees higher than the recovered band-limited function. This provides a novel solution for spherical harmonic transformation on non-equiangular grids. The key advantages of our FSH3D method include: 1) With the same number of sampling points, SFG captures more features without bias compared to equiangular grids; 2) The root mean square error of 32-degree spherical harmonic coefficients is reduced by approximately 34.6% for SFG compared to equiangular grids; and 3) FSH3D offers more stable frequency domain representations, especially for rotating functions. FSH3D enhances the stability of frequency domain representations under rotational transformations. Its application in 3D shape reconstruction and 3D shape classification results in more accurate and robust representations.</description>

      <title>Inverse Rendering using Multi-Bounce Path Tracing and Reservoir Sampling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.16360</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.16360v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present MIRReS, a novel two-stage inverse rendering framework that jointly reconstructs and optimizes the explicit geometry, material, and lighting from multi-view images. Unlike previous methods that rely on implicit irradiance fields or simplified path tracing algorithms, our method extracts an explicit geometry (triangular mesh) in stage one, and introduces a more realistic physically-based inverse rendering model that utilizes multi-bounce path tracing and Monte Carlo integration. By leveraging multi-bounce path tracing, our method effectively estimates indirect illumination, including self-shadowing and internal reflections, which improves the intrinsic decomposition of shape, material, and lighting. Moreover, we incorporate reservoir sampling into our framework to address the noise in Monte Carlo integration, enhancing convergence and facilitating gradient-based optimization with low sample counts. Through qualitative and quantitative evaluation of several scenarios, especially in challenging scenarios with complex shadows, we demonstrate that our method achieves state-of-the-art performance on decomposition results. Additionally, our optimized explicit geometry enables applications such as scene editing, relighting, and material editing with modern graphics engines or CAD software.

      <title>Omni-Scene: Omni-Gaussian Representation for Ego-Centric Sparse-View Scene Reconstruction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.06273</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.06273v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Prior works employing pixel-based Gaussian representation have demonstrated efficacy in feed-forward sparse-view reconstruction. However, such representation necessitates cross-view overlap for accurate depth estimation, and is challenged by object occlusions and frustum truncations. As a result, these methods require scene-centric data acquisition to maintain cross-view overlap and complete scene visibility to circumvent occlusions and truncations, which limits their applicability to scene-centric reconstruction. In contrast, in autonomous driving scenarios, a more practical paradigm is ego-centric reconstruction, which is characterized by minimal cross-view overlap and frequent occlusions and truncations. The limitations of pixel-based representation thus hinder the utility of prior works in this task. In light of this, this paper conducts an in-depth analysis of different representations, and introduces Omni-Gaussian representation with tailored network design to complement their strengths and mitigate their drawbacks. Experiments show that our method significantly surpasses state-of-the-art methods, pixelSplat and MVSplat, in ego-centric reconstruction, and achieves comparable performance to prior works in scene-centric reconstruction.</description>

Abstract: AI video generation is undergoing a revolution, with quality and realism advancing rapidly. These advances have led to a passionate scientific debate: Do video models learn "world models" that discover laws of physics -- or, alternatively, are they merely sophisticated pixel predictors that achieve visual realism without understanding the physical principles of reality? We address this question by developing Physics-IQ, a comprehensive benchmark dataset that can only be solved by acquiring a deep understanding of various physical principles, like fluid dynamics, optics, solid mechanics, magnetism and thermodynamics. We find that across a range of current models (Sora, Runway, Pika, Lumiere, Stable Video Diffusion, and VideoPoet), physical understanding is severely limited, and unrelated to visual realism. At the same time, some test cases can already be successfully solved. This indicates that acquiring certain physical principles from observation alone may be possible, but significant challenges remain. While we expect rapid advances ahead, our work demonstrates that visual realism does not imply physical understanding.
