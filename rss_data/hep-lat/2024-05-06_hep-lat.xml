      <title>Gluon Mass Generation from Renormalons and Resurgence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.01639</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.01639v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We establish a link between the concepts of infrared renormalons, infrared fixed point, and dynamical nonperturbative mass generation of gluons in pure Yang-Mills theories. By utilizing recent results in the resurgent analysis of renormalons through non-linear ordinary differential equations, we develop a new description for the gluon propagator, thereby realizing the Schwinger mechanism. Specifically, this approach leads to a nonperturbative, dynamic mass generation for Yang-Mills gauge bosons in the deep infrared region, a phenomenon closely associated with color confinement. Furthermore, we present arguments about the limit of applicability of the Borel-Ecalle resummation of the renormalons by comparing it with the Kallen-Lehman representation of the gluon propagator.</description>

      <title>Ab initio calculation of hyper-neutron matter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.01887</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.01887v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The equation of state (EoS) of neutron matter plays a decisive role in our understanding of the properties of neutron stars as well as the generation of gravitational waves in neutron star mergers. At sufficient densities, it is known that the appearance of hyperons generally softens the EoS, thus leading to a reduction in the maximum mass of neutron stars well below the observed values of about 2 solar masses. Even though repulsive three-body forces are known to solve this so-called "hyperon puzzle", so far performing \textit{ab initio} calculations with a substantial number of hyperons has remained elusive. In this work, we address this challenge by employing simulations based on Nuclear Lattice Effective Field Theory with up to 232 neutrons (pure neutron matter) and up to 116 $\Lambda$ hyperons (hyper-neutron matter) in a finite volume. We introduce a novel auxiliary field quantum Monte Carlo algorithm, allowing us to simulate for both pure neutron matter and hyper-neutron matter systems up to 5 times the density of nuclear matter using a single auxiliary field without any sign oscillations. Also, for the first time in {\em ab initio} calculations, we not only include $N\Lambda$ two-body and $NN\Lambda$ three-body forces, but also $\Lambda\Lambda$ and $N \Lambda\Lambda$ interactions. Consequently, we determine essential astrophysical quantities such as the mass-radius relation, the speed of sound and the tidal deformability of neutron stars. Our findings also confirm the existence of the $I$-Love-$Q$ relation, which gives access to the moment of inertia of the neutron star.</description>

      <title>On the (in)consistency of perturbation theory at finite temperature</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.02009</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.02009v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A well-known difficulty of perturbative approaches to quantum field theory at finite temperature is the necessity to address theoretical constraints that are not present in the vacuum theory. In this work, we use lattice simulations of scalar correlation functions in massive $\phi^{4}$ theory to analyse the extent to which these constraints affect the perturbative predictions. We find that the standard perturbative predictions deteriorate even in the absence of infrared divergences at relatively low temperatures, and that this is directly connected to the analytic structure of the propagators used in the expansion. This suggests that the incorporation of non-perturbative thermal effects in the propagators is essential for a consistent perturbative formulation of scalar quantum field theories at finite temperature. By utilising the spectral constraints imposed on finite-temperature correlation functions, we explore how these effects manifest themselves in the lattice data, and discuss why the presence of distinct thermoparticle excitations provides a potential resolution to these issues.</description>

      <title>Lectures on Resurgence in Integrable Field Theories</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.02224</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.02224v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: There has been recently considerable progress in understanding the nature of perturbation theory in UV free and gapped $2d$ integrable field theories with renormalon singularities. Thanks to Bethe ansatz and large $N$ techniques, non-perturbative corrections can also be computed and lead to the reconstruction of the trans-series for the free energy in presence of a chemical potential. This is an ideal arena to test resurgence in QFT and determine if and how the exact result can be reconstructed from the knowledge of the perturbative series only. In these notes we give a pedagogical introduction to this subject starting from the basics. In the first lecture we give an overview of applications in QFT of Borel resummations before the advent of resurgence. The second lecture introduces the key concepts of resurgence and finally in the third lecture we discuss a specific application in the context of the principal chiral field model. Extended version of three lectures given at IHES and review talks given at Les Diablerets and Mainz, in 2023.</description>

      <title>A nonperturbative test of nucleation calculations for strong phase transitions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.01876</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.01876v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Nucleation rate computations are of broad importance in particle physics and cosmology. Perturbative calculations are often used to compute the nucleation rate $\Gamma$, but these are incomplete. We perform nonperturbative lattice simulations of nucleation in a scalar field theory with a tree-level barrier, computing a final result extrapolated to the thermodynamic and continuum limits. Although the system in question should be well-described by a complete one-loop perturbative calculation, we find only qualitative agreement with the full perturbative result, with a 20% discrepancy in $|\log \Gamma|$. Our result motivates further testing of the current nucleation paradigm.</description>

      <title>Experimental lower bounds on entanglement entropy without twin copy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.09935</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.09935v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We discuss the possibility of estimating experimentally the von Neumann entanglement entropy $S_{A}^{vN}$ of a symmetric bi-partite quantum system $AB$ by using the basic measurement counts for a it $single$ copy of a prepared state. Using exact diagonalization and analog simulations performed with the publicly available QuEra facilities for chains and ladders of Rydberg atoms, we calculate the Shannon entropy $S_{AB}^X$ associated with the experimental measurements of adiabatically prepared ground states and the reduced entropy $S_A^X$ obtained by tracing the experimental probabilities over the $B$ half of the system. We show several examples for which, in good approximation, $S_{A}^{vN}\propto (2S_A^X-S_{AB}^X)$ with a constant of proportionality slightly larger than one. We argue that one should have the inequality $S_{A}^{vN}\geq(2S_A^X-S_{AB}^X)$ holding in more general circumstances. $2S_A^X-S_{AB}^X$ can be calculated easily for many qubit platforms and appears to be generically robust under measurement errors. Similar results are found for the second order R\'enyi entanglement entropy.</description>
