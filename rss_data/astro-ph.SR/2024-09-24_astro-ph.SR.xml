      <title>Convective Magnetic Flux Emergence Simulations from the Deep Solar Interior to the Photosphere: Comprehensive Study of Flux Tube Twist</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.15442</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.15442v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The emergence of magnetic flux from the deep convection zone plays an important role in the solar magnetism, such as the generation of active regions and triggering of various eruptive phenomena, including jets, flares, and coronal mass ejections. To investigate the effects of magnetic twist on flux emergence, we performed numerical simulations of flux tube emergence using the radiative magnetohydrodynamic code R2D2, and conducted a systematic survey on the initial twist. Specifically, we varied the twist of the initial tube both positively and negatively from zero to twice the critical value for kink instability. As a result, regardless of the initial twist, the flux tube was lifted by the convective upflow and reached the photosphere to create sunspots. However, when the twist was too weak, the photospheric flux was quickly diffused and not retained long as coherent sunspots. The degree of magnetic twist measured in the photosphere conserved the original twist relatively well, and was comparable to actual solar observations. Even in the untwisted case, a finite amount of magnetic helicity was injected into the upper atmosphere because the background turbulence added helicity. However, when the initial twist exceeded the critical value for kink instability, the magnetic helicity normalized by the total magnetic flux was found to be unreasonably larger than the observations, indicating that the kink instability of the emerging flux tube may not be a likely scenario for the formation of flare-productive active regions.</description>

      <title>Time-Adaptive PIROCK Method with Error Control for Multi-Fluid and Single-Fluid MHD Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.15552</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.15552v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The solar atmosphere is a complex environment with diverse species and varying ionization states, especially in the chromosphere, where significant ionization variations occur. This region transitions from highly collisional to weakly collisional states, leading to complex plasma state transitions influenced by magnetic strengths and collisional properties. These processes introduce numerical stiffness in multi-fluid models, imposing severe timestep restrictions on standard time integration methods. New numerical methods are essential to address these computational challenges, effectively managing the diverse timescales in multi-fluid and multi-physics models. The widely used time operator splitting technique offers a straightforward approach but requires careful timestep management to avoid stability issues and errors. Despite some studies on splitting errors, their impact on solar and stellar astrophysics is often overlooked. We focus on a Multi-Fluid Multi-Species (MFMS) model, which presents significant challenges for time integration. We propose a second-order Partitioned Implicit-Explicit Runge-Kutta (PIROCK) method that combines efficient explicit and implicit integration techniques with variable time-stepping and error control. Compared to a standard third-order explicit method and a first-order Lie splitting approach, the PIROCK method shows robust advantages in accuracy, stability, and computational efficiency. Our results reveal PIROCK's capability to solve multi-fluid problems with unprecedented efficiency. Preliminary results on chemical fractionation represent a significant step toward understanding the First-Ionization-Potential (FIP) effect in the solar atmosphere.</description>

      <title>Spectroscopic Observations of the Galex Nearby Young Star Survey Sample. 1. Nearby Moving Group Candidates</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.15579</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.15579v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The GALEX Nearby Young Star Search (GALNYSS) yielded the identification of more than 2000 late-type stars that, based on their ultraviolet and infrared colors and pre-Gaia proper motions, are potentially of age &lt; 200 Myr and lie within ~120 pc of Earth. We present the results of a campaign of medium- and high-resolution optical spectroscopy of 471 GALNYSS stars aimed at confirming their youth and their potential membership in nearby young stellar moving groups. We present radial velocity (RV), Li absorption, and H-$\alpha$ emission measurements for these spectroscopically observed GALNYSS stars, and assess their Li absorption and optical emission-line properties and infrared excesses. Our RV measurements are combined with literature and Gaia DR3 RV measurements and Gaia DR3 astrometry and photometry to obtain the spatiokinematics and color-magnitude positions of GALNYSS stars. We use these results to assess membership in the TW Hya, Tuc-Hor, Carina, Columba, and Argus Associations and the $\beta$-PMG and AB Dor moving groups. We have identified 132 stars as candidate members of these seven groups; roughly half of these candidates are newly identified on the basis of data presented here. At least one-third of the 132 candidates are spectroscopic and/or photometric binaries and/or have comoving (visual) binary companions in Gaia DR3. The contingent of young, low-mass stars in the solar vicinity we identify here should provide excellent subjects for future direct imaging exoplanet surveys and studies of the early evolution of low-mass stars and their planetary progeny.</description>

      <title>Three-Minute Oscillations in Sunspot's Penumbrae and Superpenumbrae. Alfv\'{e}nic or Sound?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.15701</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.15701v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the immediate sunspots' vicinity -- their superpenumbra -- 3-minute line-of-sight (LOS) velocity oscillations dominate in the photosphere and chromosphere. Oscillations of similar periods are also registered in the transition region and lower corona above active regions. The goal of the work is to clarify whether these LOS velocity oscillations are manifestations of Alfv\'enic waves in the lower solar atmosphere. The study is based on three sunspots with the use of the Solar Dynamics Observatory data. Additional observations of a sunspot were carried out at ground-based Automated Solar Telescope. We use narrow-band frequency filtration (5.6--5.8 mHz) of the LOS velocity, magnetic field, and intensity signals of the Fe i 6173 A spectral line. For the analysis, we used 90-minute long series. We come to the conclusion that the 3-minute oscillations in the LOS velocity signals result from magnetoacoustic waves rather than from Alfv\'enic waves. However, oscillations registered in magnetic field signals indicate that Alfv\'enic waves may be present already in the photosphere. Further research requires simultaneous observations of LOS velocity, magnetic field strength, spectral line width, and intensity carried out at two heights of the solar atmosphere.</description>

      <title>Gaia BH1 and BH2 - Evolutionary Models with Overshooting of the Black Hole Progenitors within the Present-Day Binary Separation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.15899</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.15899v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Three black holes (BHs) in wide binaries - Gaia BH1, BH2 and BH3 - were recently discovered. The likely progenitors of the BHs were massive stars that experienced a supergiant phase, reaching radii of ~1000 Rsun, before collapsing to form the BH. Such radii are difficult to accommodate with the present-day orbits of BH1 and BH2 - with semi-major axes of 1.4 and 3.7 au, respectively. In this letter, we show that the maximal radii of the supergiants are not necessarily so large, and realistic stellar evolution models, with some assumed overshooting above the convective core into the radiative stellar envelope, produce substantially smaller maximal radii. The limited expansion of supergiants is consistent with the empirical Humphreys-Davidson limit - the absence of red supergiants above an upper luminosity limit, notably lower than the highest luminosity of main-sequence stars. We propose that the evolution that led to the formation of Gaia BH1 and BH2 simply did not involve an expansion to the cool supergiant phase.</description>

      <title>Chromospheric modeling of the active M3V star G 80-21 with RH1.5D</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.16028</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.16028v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study investigates the active regions of the M3.0V star G 80-21 using the observed data from the CARMENES project with synthetic spectra generated by the RH1.5D radiative transfer code. The CARMENES project aims to search for exoplanets around M dwarfs using high-resolution near-infrared and optical echelle spectrographs. By comparing the observed data and models for the chromospheric lines of H$_\alpha$ and the bluest Ca II infrared triplet line, we obtain the best-fit models for this star. The optimal fitting for the observed spectrum of G 80-21 is achieved by employing two active areas in conjunction with an inactive regions, with a calcium abundance of [Ca/H] = $-$0.4. This combination successfully fits all the observed data across varying ratios. The minor active component consistently comprises approximately 18\% of the total (ranging from 14\% to 20\%), which suggests that the minor active component is likely located in the polar regions. Meanwhile, the major active component occupies a variable proportion, ranging from 51\% to 82\%. Our method allows for the determination of the structure and size of stellar chromospheric active regions by analyzing high-resolution observed spectra.</description>

      <title>JWST Observations of Young protoStars (JOYS). HH 211: the textbook case of a protostellar jet and outflow</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.16061</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.16061v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We use the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) and its Mid-Infrared Instrument (MIRI) (5-28 um), to study the embedded HH 211 flow. We map a 0.95'x0.22' region, covering the full extent of the blue-shifted lobe, the central protostellar region, and a small portion of the red-shifted lobe. The jet driving source is not detected even at the longest mid-IR wavelengths. The overall morphology of the flow consists of a highly collimated jet, mostly molecular (H2, HD) with an inner atomic ([FeI], [FeII], [SI], [NiII]) structure. The jet shocks the ambient medium, producing several large bow-shocks, rich in forbidden atomic and molecular lines, and is driving an H2 molecular outflow, mostly traced by low-J, v=0 transitions. Moreover, 0-0 S(1) uncollimated emission is also detected down to 2"-3" (~650-1000 au) from the source, tracing a cold (T=200-400 K), less dense and poorly collimated molecular wind. The atomic jet ([FeII] at 26 um) is detected down to ~130 au from source, whereas the lack of H2 emission close to the source is likely due to the large visual extinction. Dust continuum-emission is detected at the terminal bow-shocks, and in the blue- and red-shifted jet, being likely dust lifted from the disk. The jet shows an onion-like structure, with layers of different size, velocity, temperature, and chemical composition. Moreover, moving from the inner jet to the outer bow-shocks, different physical, kinematic and excitation conditions for both molecular and atomic gas are observed. The jet mass-flux rate, momentum, and momentum flux of the warm H2 component are up to one order of magnitude higher than those inferred from the atomic jet component. Our findings indicate that the warm H2 component is the primary mover of the outflow, namely it is the most significant dynamical component of the jet, in contrast to jets from more evolved YSOs, where the atomic component is dominant.</description>

      <title>Low-mass stellar and substellar candidate companions around massive stars in Sco OB1 and M17</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.16212</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.16212v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Massive stars are recognized for their high degree of multiplicity, yet the mass ratio regime below 0.1 remains insufficiently explored. It is therefore unknown whether extremely low-mass (possibly substellar) companions can form and survive in the direct UV-irradiated environment of massive stars. In this paper, we discuss VLT/SPHERE IFS (0".15 - 0".85) observations of six massive O- and early B-type stars in Sco OB1 and M17 that each have a low-mass candidate companion. Two targets have companions that are brown dwarf candidates. The other four have candidate companions in the low end of the stellar mass regime ($\leq$ 0.30 M$_\odot$). For three of these, we have obtained a second epoch observation. At least two sources exhibit similar proper motion to that of their central star. However, given the expected proper motion of background objects, this does not imply certain companionship. We show how future follow-up observations of the brown dwarf candidate companions in $J$, $H$ and $L$ bands should allow for an unambiguous confirmation of their nature.</description>

      <title>JWST Resolves CIA Features in White Dwarfs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.16224</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.16224v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Infrared-faint white dwarfs are cool white dwarfs exhibiting significant infrared flux deficits, most often attributed to collision-induced absorption (CIA) from H$_2$-He in mixed hydrogen-helium atmospheres. We present James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) near- and mid-infrared spectra of three such objects using NIRSpec (0.6-5.3 $\mu$m) and MIRI (5-14 $\mu$m): LHS 3250, WD J1922+0233, and LHS 1126. Surprisingly, for LHS 3250, we detect no H$_2$-He CIA absorption at 2.4 $\mu$m, instead observing an unexpected small flux bump at this wavelength. WD J1922+0233 exhibits the anticipated strong absorption feature centered at 2.4 $\mu$m, but with an unexpected narrow emission-like feature inside this absorption band. LHS 1126 shows no CIA features and follows a $\lambda^{-2}$ power law in the mid-infrared. LHS 1126's lack of CIA features suggests a very low hydrogen abundance, with its infrared flux depletion likely caused by He-He-He CIA. For LHS 3250 and WD J1922+0233, the absence of a 1.2 $\mu$m CIA feature in both stars argues against ultracool temperatures, supporting recent suggestions that infrared-faint white dwarfs are warmer and more massive than previously thought. This conclusion is further solidified by Keck near-infrared spectroscopy of seven additional objects. We explore possible explanations for the unexpected emission-like features in both stars, and temperature inversions above the photosphere emerge as a promising hypothesis. Such inversions may be common among the infrared-faint population, and since they significantly affect the infrared spectral energy distribution, this would impact their photometric fits. Further JWST observations are needed to confirm the prevalence of this phenomenon and guide the development of improved atmospheric models.</description>

      <title>Gaussian Process Models Impact the Inferred Properties of Giant Planets around Active Stars</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.15407</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.15407v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The recent development of statistical methods that can distinguish between stellar activity and dynamical signals in radial velocity (RV) observations has facilitated the discovery and characterization of planets orbiting young stars. One such technique, Gaussian process (GP) regression, has been regularly employed to improve the detection of a growing number of planets, but the impact of this model for mitigating stellar activity has not been uniformly analyzed for a large sample with real observations. The goal of this study is to investigate how GPs can affect the inferred parameters of RV-detected planets. We homogeneously analyze how two commonly adopted GP frameworks, a GP trained on RVs alone and a GP pretrained on photometry and then applied to RVs, can influence the inferred physical and orbital parameters compared to a traditional Keplerian orbit fit. Our sample comprises 17 short-period giant planets orbiting stars that exhibit a broad range of activity levels. We find that the decision to adopt GPs, as well as the choice of GP framework, can result in variations of inferred parameters such as minimum planet mass and eccentricity by up to 67% and 95%, respectively. This implies that the method for modeling stellar activity in RVs of young planet-hosting stars can have widespread ramifications on the interpretation of planet properties including their masses, densities, circularization timescales, and tidal quality factors. When mitigating stellar activity with GPs, we recommend carrying out comparative tests between different models to assess the sensitivity of planet physical and orbital parameters to these choices.</description>

      <title>The accretion history of the Milky Way IV. Hints of recent star formation in Milky Way dwarf spheroidal galaxies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.15414</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.15414v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Dwarf spheroidal galaxies are known to be dominated by old stellar populations. This has led to the assumption that their gas-rich progenitors lost their gas during their infall in the Milky Way (MW) halo at distant look-back times. Here, we report a discovery of a tiny but robustly detected population of possibly young ($\sim$ 1 Gyr old) and intermediate-mass ($\rm 1.8 M_{\odot} \le M &lt; 3 M_{\odot}$) stars in MW dwarf spheroidal galaxies. This was established on the basis of their positions in color-magnitude diagrams, after filtering out the bulk of the foreground MW using Gaia DR3 proper motions. We have considered the possibility that this population is made of evolved blue stragglers. For Sculptor, it seems unlikely, because 95.5% of its stars are older than 8 Gyr, leading to masses smaller than 0.9 M$_{\odot}$. This would only allow blue straggler masses of less than 1.8 M$_{\odot}$, which is much lower than what we observed. Alternatively, it would require the merger of three turnoff stars, which appears even more unlikely. On the other hand, the recent Gaia proper motion measurements of MW dwarf galaxies infer their low binding energies and large angular momenta, pointing to a more recent, $\le$ 3 Gyr, infall. Although the nature of the newly discovered stars still needs further confirmation, we find that they are consistent with the recent infall of the dwarf galaxies into the MW halo, when star formation occurred from the ram pressurization of their gas content before its removal by the hot Galactic corona. The abundance of this plausibly young population of stars is similar to the expectations drawn from hydrodynamical simulations. These results point to a novel origin for MW dwarf spheroidal galaxies.</description>

      <title>Indications of magnetic accretion in Swift J0826.2-7033</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.15429</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.15429v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present our findings from the first long X-ray observation of the hard X-ray source Swift J0826.2-7033 with XMM-Newton, which has shown characteristics of magnetic accretion. The system appears to have a long orbital period (~7.8 h) accompanied by short timescale variabilities, which we tentatively interpret as the spin and beat periods of an intermediate polar. These short- and long-timescale modulations are energy-independent, suggesting that photoelectric absorption does not play any role in producing the variabilities. If our suspected spin and beat periods are true, then Swift J0826.2-7033 accretes via disc-overflow with an equal fraction of accretion taking place via disc and stream. The XMM-Newton and Swift-BAT spectral analysis reveals that the post-shock region in Swift J0826.2-7033 has a multi-temperature structure with a maximum temperature of ~43 keV, which is absorbed by a material with an average equivalent hydrogen column density of ~1.6$\times$10$^{22}$ cm$^{-2}$ that partially covers ~27% of the X-ray source. The suprasolar abundances, with hints of an evolved donor, collectively make Swift J0826.2-7033 an interesting target, which likely underwent a thermal timescale mass transfer phase.</description>

      <title>Signatures of anti-social mass-loss in the ordinary Type II SN 2024bch - A non-interacting supernova with early high-ionisation features</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.15431</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.15431v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper we analyse the spectro-photometric properties of the Type II supernova \sn, exploded at a distance of $19.9\,\rm{Mpc}$, in NGC~3206. Its early spectra are characterised by narrow high-ionisation emission lines, often interpreted as signatures of ongoing interaction between rapidly expanding ejecta and a confined dense circumstellar medium. However, we provide a model of the bolometric light curve of the transient that does not require sources of energy different than the H recombination and radioactive decays. Our model can reproduce the bolometric light curve of SN~2024bch adopting an ejected mass of $M_{bulk}\simeq5$\msun~surrounded by an extended envelope of only 0.2\msun~with an outer radius $R_{env}=7.0\times10^{13}\,\rm{cm}$. An accurate modelling focused on the radioactive part of the light curve, which accounts for incomplete $\gamma-$ray trapping, gives a $^{56}\rm{Ni}$ mass of 0.048\msun. We propose narrow lines to be powered by Bowen fluorescence induced by scattering of \ion{He}{II} Ly$\alpha$ photons, resulting in the emission of high-ionisation resonance lines. Simple light travel time calculations based on the maximum phase of the narrow emission lines place the inner radius of the H-rich, un-shocked shell at a radius $\simeq4.4\times10^{15}\,\rm{cm}$, compatible with an absence of ejecta-CSM interaction during the first weeks of evolution. Possible signatures of interaction appear only $\sim69\,\rm{days}$ after explosion, although the resulting conversion of kinetic energy into radiation does not seem to contribute significantly to the total luminosity of the transient.</description>

      <title>Radio Signatures of Star-Planet Interactions, Exoplanets, and Space Weather</title>

Abstract: Radio detections of stellar systems provide a window onto stellar magnetic activity and the space weather conditions of extrasolar planets, information that is difficult to attain at other wavelengths. There have been recent advances observing auroral emissions from radio-bright low-mass stars and exoplanets largely due to the maturation of low-frequency radio instruments and the plethora of wide-field radio surveys. To guide us in placing these recent results in context, we introduce the foremost local analogues for the field: Solar bursts and the aurorae found on Jupiter. We detail how radio bursts associated with stellar flares are foundational to the study of stellar coronae, and time-resolved radio dynamic spectra offers one of the best prospects of detecting and characterising coronal mass ejections from other stars. We highlight the prospects of directly detecting coherent radio emission from exoplanetary magnetospheres, and early tentative results. We bridge this discussion to the field of brown dwarf radio emission, in which their larger and stronger magnetospheres are amenable to detailed study with current instruments. Bright, coherent radio emission is also predicted from magnetic interactions between stars and close-in planets. We discuss the underlying physics of these interactions and implications of recent provisional detections for exoplanet characterisation. We conclude with an overview of outstanding questions in theory of stellar, star-planet interaction, and exoplanet radio emission, and the prospects of future facilities in answering them.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.15570v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present the results of the optical study of the new eclipsing polar Gaia23cer. We analyzed the brightness variability of the polar in high ($\langle r \rangle \approx 16.5\mathrm{\,mag}$) and low ($\langle r \rangle \approx 19.2\mathrm{\,mag}$) states. The system has an orbital period $P_{orb} = 102.0665 \pm 0.0015$ min and exhibits deep eclipses with a duration $\Delta t_{ecl} = 401.30 \pm 0.81$ s. The spectra have a red cyclotron continuum with the Zeeman H$\alpha$ absorption triplet forming in a magnetic field with a strength of $15.2 \pm 1.1$ MG. The source of emission lines has a high radial velocity semiamplitude ($K\approx 450$km/s) and its eclipse lags behind the eclipse of the white dwarf. The mass $M_1=0.79 \pm 0.03 M_{\odot}$ and temperature $T=11350 \pm 650 K$ of the white dwarf have been found by modelling the spectral energy distribution. The eclipse duration corresponds to a donor mass $M_2 = 0.10-0.13M_{\odot}$ and an orbital inclination $i=84.3-87.0^{\circ}$. The donor temperature was estimated to be $T\approx 2900K$ by modelling the elliptical variability and eclipse depth.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.15714v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Polstar small explorer concept is for an ultraviolet (UV) spectropolarimetry space telescope mission with a focus on massive star astrophysics. The instrument waveband will be from 115 nm - 286 nm for spectroscopy and 122 nm - 286 nm for polarimetry. All 4 Stokes parameters, IQUV, will be measured at a resolving power of R=20,000 (15 km/s velocity resolution). The telescope aperture will be 40 cm with an effective area of about 22 cm^2 at a reference wavelength of 150 nm. The thrust of the science goals will be to determine the astrophysics of angular momentum exchange and transport, and consequences for massive star properties and evolution. This includes the effects of rapid to critical rotation for individual stars (magnetic and non-magnetic), and the effects of mass transfer for massive binaries, including identification of stripped core stars. If selected by the NASA/SMEX program, Polstar would launch around 2031 and observe ~300 stars to achieve science goals. The mission will include a Guest Observer program to advance discovery in other areas of astrophysics.</description>

      <title>Pulsar wind nebulae meeting the circumstellar medium of their progenitors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.15829</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.15829v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A significative fraction of high mass stars sail away through the interstellar medium of the galaxies. Once they evolved and died via a core collapse supernova, a magnetized, rotating neutron star (a pulsar) is usually their leftover. The immediate surroundings of the pulsar is the pulsar wind, which forms a nebula whose morphology is shaped by the supernova ejecta, channeled into the circumstellar medium of the progenitor star in the pre supernova time. Consequently, irregular pulsar wind nebulae display a large variety of radio appearances, screened by their interacting supernova blast wave or harboring asymmetric up down emission. Here, we present a series of 2.5 dimensional non relativistic magnetohydrodynamical simulations exploring the evolution of the pulsar wind nebulae (PWNe) generated by a red supergiant and a Wolf Rayet massive supernova progenitors, moving with Mach number M eq. to 1 and M eq. to 2 into the warm phase of the galactic plane. In such a simplified approach, the progenitors direction of motion, the local ambient medium magnetic field, the progenitor and pulsar axis of rotation, are all aligned, which restrict our study to peculiar pulsar wind nebula of high equatorial energy flux. We found that the reverberation of the termination shock of the pulsar wind nebulae, when sufficiently embedded into its dead stellar surroundings and interacting with the supernova ejecta, is asymmetric and differs greatly as a function of the past circumstellar evolution of its progenitor, which reflects into their projected radio synchrotron emission. This mechanism is particularly at work in the context of remnants involving slowly moving or very massive stars. We find that the mixing of material in plerionic core collapse supernova remnants is strongly affected by the asymmetric reverberation in their pulsar wind nebulae.</description>

      <title>Secrets in the shadow: High precision stellar abundances of fast-rotating A-type exoplanet host stars through transit spectroscopy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.15951</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.15951v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Context. The spectra of fast-rotating A-type stars have strongly broadened absorption lines. This effect causes blending of the absorption lines, hindering the measurement of the abundances of the elements that are in the stellar photosphere. Aims. As the exoplanet transits across its host star, it obscures the stellar spectrum that is emitted from directly behind the planet. We aim to extract this obscured spectrum because it is less affected by rotational broadening, resolving the blending of weak lines of elements that would otherwise remain inaccessible. This allows us to more precisely measure the metal abundances in ultra-hot Jupiter systems, many of which have fast rotating host stars. Methods. We develop a novel method that isolates the stellar spectra behind the planet during a spectral time-series, and reconstructs the disc-integrated non-broadened spectrum of the host star. We have systematically tested this method with model-generated spectra of the transit of WASP-189 b across its fast-rotating A-type host star, assessing the effects of limb darkening, choice of absorption lines, signal to noise regime; and demonstrating the sensitivity to photospheric parameters ($T_{\text{eff}}$, $\log g$) and elemental abundances. We apply the method to observations by the HARPS high-resolution spectrograph. Results. For WASP-189, we obtain the metallicity and photospheric abundances for several species previously not reported in literature, Mg, Ca and Ti, with significantly improved accuracy compared to the ordinary broadened stellar spectrum. This method can be generally applied to other transiting systems in which abundance determinations via spectral synthesis are imprecise due to severe line blending. It is important to accurately determine the photospheric properties of exoplanet host stars, as it can provide further insight into the formation and evolution of the planets.</description>

      <title>Radial velocity analysis of stars with debris discs</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.16021v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This study aims to identify potential exoplanet signals from nearby stars with resolved debris discs. However, the high activity of many stars with debris discs limits the detection of periodic signals. Our study is constrained to a sample of 29 stars that have appropriate radial velocity data and debris disc measurements sufficient to resolve their inclination. Our results confirm and update previous findings for exoplanets around HD 10647, HD 115617, HD 69830, GJ 581, HD 22049, and HD 142091, and we identify long-term activity signals around HD 207129 and HD 202628. We utilize the inclination angles of the debris discs, assuming co-planarity between debris disc and exoplanet orbit, to determine the "disc-aligned" masses of radial velocity exoplanets in this study. The "disc-aligned" masses of HD 69830 b, HD 69830 c, and 61 Vir b suggest that they may be classified as 'hot' or 'warm' Jupiters and so might be nearby examples of planets that have undergone recent type-II disc migration.</description>

Abstract: All types of interaction of a magnetized plasma flow with an obstacle (magnetized or not) are considered, and those susceptible to produce a radio signature are identified. The role of the sub-Alfv\'enic or super-Alfv\'enic character of the flow is discussed. Known examples in the solar system are given, as well as extrapolations to star-planet plasma interactions. The dissipated power and the fraction that goes into radio waves are evaluated in the frame of the radio-magnetic scaling law, the theoretical bases and validity of which are discussed in the light of recent works. Then it is shown how radio signatures can be interpreted in the frame of the cyclotron-maser theory (developed for explaining the generation of solar system planetary auroral and satellite-induced radio emissions) for deducing many physical parameters of the system studied, including the planetary or stellar magnetic field. Recent detections of such radio signatures with new generation low-frequency radiotelescopes and future prospects are then outlined.</description>

      <title>PEWDD: A database of white dwarfs enriched by exo-planetary material</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.16046v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present the Planetary Enriched White Dwarf Database (PEWDD), a collection of published photospheric abundances of white dwarfs accreting planetary debris alongside additional information relevant to metal-enrichment and the presence of infrared excesses, emission lines, and binary companions. PEWDD contains at the time of publishing information on 1739 white dwarfs and will be kept up-to-date with information from new publications. A total of 24 photospheric metals are recorded and are linked to accretion of exo-planetary material. The overall properties of metal-enriched white dwarfs are severely affected by observational selection effects; in particular we find that what metals are detectable strongly correlates with the effective temperature. By considering metal-enriched white dwarfs which have abundances measured by different methods, we find a spread that is comparable with the often quoted ad-hoc estimated abundance uncertainties, i.e. ~0.1-0.2dex. We draw attention to a dichotomy in the median accretion rates for metal-enriched H- and He-dominated white dwarfs, with M_{acc, H} = 7.7e7g/s and M_{acc, He} = 8.7e8g/s when extrapolating bulk compositions from bulk Earth Ca abundance. We identify 40 metal-enriched white dwarfs in binary systems and find evidence that enrichment is suppressed by binary companions within 200au.</description>

      <title>On the importance of separators as sites of 3D magnetic reconnection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.04076</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.04076v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: For 3D magnetic reconnection to occur there must exist a volume within which the electric field component parallel to the magnetic field is non-zero. In numerical experiments, locations of non-zero parallel electric field indicate sites of 3D magnetic reconnection. If these experiments contain all types of topological feature (null points, separatrix surfaces, spines and separators) then comparing topological features with the reconnection sites reveals that all the reconnection sites are threaded by separators with the local maxima/minima of the integrated parallel electric along fieldlines coinciding with these separators. However, not all separators thread a reconnection site. Furthermore, there are different types of separator. Cluster separators are short arising within an individual weak magnetic field region and have negligible parallel electric field along them so are not associated with much reconnection. Intercluster separators connect a positive null point lying in one weak-field region to a negative null point that lies in a different weak-field region. Intercluster separators often thread enhanced regions of parallel electric field and are long. Since separators form the boundary between 4 globally-significant topologically-distinct domains, they are important sites of reconnection which can results in the global restructuring of the magnetic field. By considering the kinematic bifurcation models in which separators form it is possible to understand the formation of cluster and intercluster separators and explain their key properties.</description>

      <title>A Census of Sun's Ancestors and their Contributions to the Solar System Chemical Composition</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.08036v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this work we compute the rates and numbers of different types of stars and phenomena (supernovae, novae, white dwarfs, merging neutron stars, black holes) that contributed to the chemical composition of the Solar System. This process is called "chemical evolution". In particular, we analyse the death rates of stars of all masses, dying either quiescently or explosively. These rates and total star numbers are computed in the context of a revised version of the two-infall model for the chemical evolution of the Milky Way, which reproduces fairly well the observed abundance patterns of several chemical species, the global solar metallicity, and the current gas, stellar, and total surface mass densities. We compute also the total number of stars ever born and still alive as well as the number of stars born up to the formation of the Solar System with a mass and metallicity like the Sun. This latter number will account for all the possible existing Solar Systems which can host life in the solar vicinity. We conclude that, among all the stars (from 0.8 to 100 M$_{\odot}$) born and died from the beginning up to the Solar System formation epoch, which contributed to its chemical composition, 93.00\% are represented by stars dying as single white dwarfs (without interacting significantly with a companion star) and originating in the mass range 0.8-8 M$_{\odot}$, while 5.24$\%$ are neutron stars and 0.73$\%$ are black holes, both originating from supernovae core-collapse (M &gt; 8 M$_{\odot}$); 0.64$\%$ are Type Ia supernovae and 0.40$\%$ are nova systems, both originating from the same mass range as the white dwarfs. The number of stars similar to the Sun born from the beginning up to the Solar System formation, with metallicity in the range 12+log(Fe/H)= 7.50 $\pm$ 0.04 dex is $ \sim 31 \cdot$ 10$^{7}$, and in particular our Sun is the $\sim 2.61 \cdot$ 10$^7$-th star of this kind.</description>

Abstract: Stellar mergers are one important path to highly magnetised stars. Mergers of two low-mass white dwarfs may create up to every third hot subdwarf star. The merging process is usually assumed to dramatically amplify magnetic fields. However, so far only four highly magnetised hot subdwarf stars have been found, suggesting a fraction of less than $1\%$.
  We present two high-resolution magnetohydrodynamical (MHD) simulations of the merger of two helium white dwarfs in a binary system with the same total mass of $0.6\,M_\odot$. We analysed an equal-mass merger with two $0.3\,M_\odot$ white dwarfs, and an unequal-mass merger with white dwarfs of $0.25\,M_\odot$ and $0.35\,M_\odot$. We simulated the inspiral, merger, and further evolution of the merger remnant for about $50$ rotations.
  We found efficient magnetic field amplification in both mergers via a small-scale dynamo, reproducing previous results of stellar merger simulations. The magnetic field saturates at a similar strength for both simulations.
  We then identified a second phase of magnetic field amplification in both merger remnants that happens on a timescale of several tens of rotational periods of the merger remnant. This phase generates a large-scale ordered azimuthal field via a large-scale dynamo driven by the magneto-rotational instability.
  Finally, we speculate that in the unequal-mass merger remnant, helium burning will initially start in a shell around a cold core, rather than in the centre. This forms a convection zone that coincides with the region that contains most of the magnetic energy, and likely destroys the strong, ordered field. Ohmic resistivity might then quickly erase the remaining small-scale field. Therefore, the mass ratio of the initial merger could be the selecting factor that decides if a merger remnant will stay highly magnetised long after the merger.</description>

      <title>Binarity at LOw Metallicity (BLOeM): a spectroscopic VLT monitoring survey of massive stars in the SMC</title>

Abstract: Surveys in the Milky Way and Large Magellanic Cloud revealed that the majority of massive stars will interact with companions during their lives. However, knowledge of the binary properties of massive stars at low metallicity, which approaches the conditions of the Early Universe, remains sparse. We present the Binarity at LOw Metallicity (BLOeM) campaign - an ESO large programme designed to obtain 25 epochs of spectroscopy for 929 massive stars in the SMC - the lowest metallicity conditions in which multiplicity is probed to date (Z = 0.2 Zsun). BLOeM will provide (i) the binary fraction, (ii) the orbital configurations of systems with periods P &lt; 3 yr, (iii) dormant OB+BH binaries, and (iv) a legacy database of physical parameters of massive stars at low metallicity.
  The stars are observed with the LR02 setup of the giraffe instrument of the Very Large Telescope (3960-4570A, resolving power R=6200; typical signal-to-noise ratio S/N=70-100). This paper utilises the first 9 epochs obtained over a three-month time. We describe the survey and data reduction, perform a spectral classification of the stacked spectra, and construct a Hertzsprung-Russell diagram of the sample via spectral-type and photometric calibrations. The sample covers spectral types from O4 to F5, spanning the effective temperature and luminosity ranges 6.5&lt;Teff/kK&lt;45 and 3.7&lt;log L/Lsun&lt;6.1 and initial masses 8&lt;Mini/Msun&lt;80. It comprises 159 O-type stars, 331 early B-type (B0-3) dwarfs and giants (luminosity classes V-III), 303 early B-type supergiants (II-I), and 136 late-type supergiants. At least 82 stars are Oe/Be stars: 20 O-type and 62 B-type (13% and 11% of the respective samples). In addition, it includes 4 high-mass X-ray binaries, 3 stars resembling luminous blue variables, 2 bloated stripped-star candidates, 2 candidate magnetic stars, and 74 eclipsing binaries.</description>

      <title>Detecting Detached Black Hole binaries through Photometric Variability</title>

Abstract: Understanding the connection between the properties of black holes (BHs) and their progenitors is interesting in many branches of astrophysics. Discovering BHs in detached orbits with luminous companions (LCs) promises to help create this map since the LC and BH progenitor are expected to have the same metallicity and formation time. We explore the possibility of detecting BH-LC binaries in detached orbits using photometric variations of the LC flux, induced by tidal ellipsoidal variation, relativistic beaming, and self-lensing. We create realistic present-day populations of detached BH-LC binaries in the Milky Way (MW) using binary population synthesis where we adopt observationally motivated initial stellar and binary properties, star formation history and present-day distribution of these sources in the MW based on detailed cosmological simulations. We test detectability of these sources via photometric variability by Gaia and TESS missions by incorporating their respective detailed detection biases as well as interstellar extinction. We find that Gaia is expected to resolve 300--1,000 (700--1,500) detached BH--LC binaries with SNR&gt;10 (1) depending on the photometric precision and details of supernova physics. Similarly, the number of resolved BH--LC binaries with TESS are ~50--200 (140--350). We find that 136^{+15}_{-15} BH--LC binaries would be common between Gaia and TESS. Moreover, between ~60--70 (50--200) BH--LC binaries identifiable using photometry with SNR &gt;10 may also be resolved using Gaia's radial velocity (astrometry).</description>
