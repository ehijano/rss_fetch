      <title>Non-iterative triples for transcorrelated coupled cluster</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.07858</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.07858v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present an implementation of a perturbative triples correction for coupled cluster including single and double excitations based on the transcorrelated Hamiltonian. Transcorrelation introduces explicit electron correlation in the electronic Hamiltonian through similarity transformation with a correlation factor. Due to this transformation, the transcorrelated Hamiltonian includes up to three-body couplings and becomes non-hermitian. Since conventional coupled cluster is solved by projection, it is well suited to harbor non-hermitian Hamiltonians. The arising three-body operator, however, creates a huge memory bottleneck and increases the runtime scaling of the coupled cluster equations. As it has been shown that the three-body operator can be approximated, by expressing the Hamiltonian in the normal-ordered form, we investigate this approximation for the perturbative triples correction. Results are compared with code-generation based transcorrelated coupled cluster up to quadruple excitations.</description>

      <title>An efficient particle tracking method on unstructured meshes in two and three dimensions based on patch searching</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.07959</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.07959v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a particle tracking method for unstructured meshes in two and three dimensions. Our tracking algorithm is based on a patch searching and includes two steps. We first locate the given point to a patch near a vertex, and then the host element is determined within the patch domain. We prove that the patch in the first step can be rapidly identified by constructing an auxiliary Cartesian grid with a prescribed resolution. Then, the second step can be converted into a searching problem, which can be easily solved by searching algorithms. Only coordinates to particles are required in our method. We conduct a series of numerical tests in two and three dimensions to illustrate the robustness and efficiency in our method.</description>

      <title>Machine learning from limited data: Predicting biological dynamics under a time-varying external input</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.07998</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.07998v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Reservoir computing (RC) is known as a powerful machine learning approach for learning complex dynamics from limited data. Here, we use RC to predict highly stochastic dynamics of cell shapes. We find that RC is able to predict the steady state climate from very limited data. Furthermore, the RC learns the timescale of transients from only four observations. We find that these capabilities of the RC to act as a dynamic twin allows us to also infer important statistics of cell shape dynamics of unobserved conditions.</description>

      <title>Defects Enhance Stability in 12-fold Symmetric Soft-Matter Quasicrystals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.08168</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.08168v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Quasicrystals are materials that exhibit long-range order without translational periodicity. In soft matter, the most commonly observed quasicrystal has 12-fold symmetry and consists of tilings made out of squares and triangles. Intriguingly, both in experiments and simulations, these tilings nearly always appear with many vacancy-related defects that are connected to an additional tile: a rhombus. In this letter, we explore the role of rhombus defects on the entropy of square-triangle 12-fold quasicrystals. We introduce a novel lattice-based Monte Carlo simulation method that uses open boundaries to allow the concentration of defects to fluctuate. Our simulations show that rhombus tiles significantly increase the configurational entropy of the quasicrystal phase, enhancing its stability. These findings highlight the critical role of defects in stabilizing soft-matter quasicrystals.</description>

      <title>Effect of hydrogen on the local chemical bonding states and structure of amorphous alumina by atomistic and electrostatic modeling of Auger parameter shifts</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.08255</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.08255v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This study discloses the effect of hydrogen impurities on the local chemical bonding states and structure of amorphous alumina films by predicting measured Auger parameter shifts using a combination of atomistic and electrostatic modeling. Different amorphous alumina polymorphs with variable H-content and density, as grown by atomic layer deposition, were successfully modeled using a universal machine learning interatomic potential. The annealing of highly defective crystalline hydroxide structures with experimental H-contents at the corresponding atomic layer deposition temperatures led to excellent agreement between theory and experiment in the density and structure of the resulting amorphous alumina polymorphs. The measured Auger parameter shifts of Al cations in such polymorphs were accurately predicted with respect to the H content by assuming that all H atoms are present in the form of hydroxyl ligands in the randomly interconnected 4-fold, 5-fold, and 6-fold nearest-coordination spheres of Al. As revealed by a combination of atomistic and electrostatic modeling, the measured Auger shifts with an increase in the H content and an accompanying decrease in the oxide density depend on the complex correlations between local coordination, bond lengths, bond angles, and ligand type(s) around the core-ionized atoms. Moreover, cryogenic X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy is suggested to offer new insights into the local chemical and structural building blocks of crystalline and amorphous oxides by reducing thermal noise. These findings and fundamental knowledge contribute to advancing the design of e.g. hydrogen oxide barrier films, oxide membranes for H separation, H storage materials, and fuel cells for a hydrogen-based economy.</description>

      <title>Coarsening and parallelism with reduction multigrids for hyperbolic Boltzmann transport</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.08262</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.08262v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Reduction multigrids have recently shown good performance in hyperbolic problems without the need for Gauss-Seidel smoothers. When applied to the hyperbolic limit of the Boltzmann Transport Equation (BTE), these methods result in very close to $\mathcal{O}(n)$ growth in work with problem size on unstructured grids. This scalability relies on the CF splitting producing an $A_\textrm{ff}$ block that is easy to invert. We introduce a parallel two-pass CF splitting designed to give diagonally dominant $A_\textrm{ff}$. The first pass computes a maximal independent set in the symmetrized strong connections. The second pass converts F-points to C-points based on the row-wise diagonal dominance of $A_\textrm{ff}$. We find this two-pass CF splitting outperforms common CF splittings available in hypre.
  Furthermore, parallelisation of reduction multigrids in hyperbolic problems is difficult as we require both long-range grid-transfer operators and slow coarsenings (with rates of $\sim$1/2 in both 2D and 3D). We find that good parallel performance in the setup and solve is dependent on several factors: repartitioning the coarse grids, reducing the number of active MPI ranks as we coarsen, truncating the multigrid hierarchy and applying a GMRES polynomial as a coarse-grid solver.
  We compare the performance of two different reduction multigrids, AIRG (that we developed previously) and the hypre implementation of $\ell$AIR. In the streaming limit with AIRG, we demonstrate 81\% weak scaling efficiency in the solve from 2 to 64 nodes (256 to 8196 cores) with only 8.8k unknowns per core, with solve times up to 5.9$\times$ smaller than the $\ell$AIR implementation in hypre.</description>

      <title>Local divergence-free velocity interpolation for the immersed boundary method using composite B-splines</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.08280</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.08280v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper introduces an approach to improve volume conservation in the immersed boundary (IB) method using regularized delta functions derived from composite B-splines. These delta functions employ tensor product kernels using B-splines, whose polynomial degrees vary in normal and tangential directions based on the corresponding velocity component. Our method addresses the long-standing volume conservation issues in the conventional IB method, particularly evident in simulations of pressurized, closed membranes. We demonstrate that our approach significantly enhances volume conservation, rivaling the performance of the non-local Divergence-Free Immersed Boundary (DFIB) method introduced by Bao et al. while maintaining the local nature of the classical IB method. This avoids the computational overhead associated with the DFIB method's construction of an explicit velocity potential which requires additional Poisson solves. Numerical experiments show that sufficiently regular composite B-spline kernels can maintain initial volumes to within machine precision. We analyze the relationship between kernel regularity and the accuracy of force spreading and velocity interpolation operations. Our findings indicate that composite B-splines of at least $C^1$ regularity produce results comparable to the DFIB method in dynamic simulations, with volume conservation errors primarily dominated by the time-stepping scheme's truncation error. This work offers a computationally efficient alternative for improving volume conservation in IB methods, particularly beneficial for large-scale, three-dimensional simulations. The proposed approach requires minimal modifications to an existing IB code, making it an accessible improvement for a wide range of applications in computational fluid dynamics and fluid-structure interaction.</description>

      <title>Scale-bridging within a complex model hierarchy for investigation of a metal-fueled circular energy economy by use of Bayesian model calibration with model error quantification</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.13092</link>

Abstract: Metal energy carriers recently gained growing interest in research as a promising storage and transport material for renewable electricity. Within the development of a metal-fueled circular energy economy, research involves a model hierarchy spanning from micro to macro scales, making the transfer of information among different levels of complexity a crucial task for the implementation of the new technology. Chemical reactor networks (CRNs) are models of reduced complexity and a promising approach to accomplish the scale-bridging task. This holds if valid information from CRNs can be obtained on a much denser set of operating conditions than available from experiments and elaborated simulation methods like Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD). An approach for CRN calibration from recent literature, including model error quantification, is further developed to construct a CRN model of a laboratory reactor for flash ironmaking, using data from the literature. By introducing a meta model of a CRN parameter, a simple CRN model on an extended set of operating conditions has successfully been calibrated. This way, the employed coupled calibration and uncertainty quantification framework has proven promising for the task of scale-bridging in the model hierarchy under investigation.</description>

      <title>Kinetic representation of the unified gas-kinetic wave-particle method and beyond</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.05691</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.05691v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The unified gas-kinetic wave-particle (UGKWP) method is a hybrid method for multiscale flow simulations, in which the contributions to the whole gas evolution from deterministic hydrodynamic wave and stochastic particle transport are combined simultaneously. Originally, the UGKWP method was developed as a direct modeling approach at discrete level. In this work, we revisit the time evolution of each part of the involved simulation particles and wave molecules in UGKWP, and present the corresponding kinetic equations. The resultant kinetic system can be viewed as a collision decomposition of the original kinetic equation, which can serve as a basis for developing other kinetic methods for flows in all flow regimes.</description>

      <title>Coarse-graining bistability with the Martini force field</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.14440</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.14440v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: An increasing interest in molecular structures whose long term dynamics resemble those of bistable mechanical systems promotes the search of possible candidates that may operate as two-state switching units. Of particular interest are the systems that are capable to exhibit such bistable effects as spontaneous vibrations, stochastic resonance and spontaneous synchronization. Previously, in all-atom molecular dynamics simulations it has been demonstrated that short pyridine-furan springs show these bistable phenomena. In this article we introduce a coarse-grained model of such springs and investigate the possibility to observe the bistability effects, such as spontaneous vibrations. Our findings allow the studies of short pyridine-furan springs at large time and length scales and open field for further computational research of large bistable systems.</description>
