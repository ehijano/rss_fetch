      <title>Safe Planning through Incremental Decomposition of Signal Temporal Logic Specifications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.10554</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.10554v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Trajectory planning is a critical process that enables autonomous systems to safely navigate complex environments. Signal temporal logic (STL) specifications are an effective way to encode complex temporally extended objectives for trajectory planning in cyber-physical systems (CPS). However, planning from these specifications using existing techniques scale exponentially with the number of nested operators and the horizon of specification. Additionally, performance is exacerbated at runtime due to limited computational budgets and compounding modeling errors. Decomposing a complex specification into smaller subtasks and incrementally planning for them can remedy these issues. In this work, we present a way to decompose STL requirements temporally to improve planning efficiency and performance. The key insight in our work is to encode all specifications as a set of reachability and invariance constraints and scheduling these constraints sequentially at runtime. Our proposed technique outperforms the state-of-the-art trajectory synthesis techniques for both linear and non linear dynamical systems.</description>

      <title>Depreciation Cost is a Poor Proxy for Revenue Lost to Aging in Grid Storage Optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.10617</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.10617v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Dispatch of a grid energy storage system for arbitrage is typically formulated into a rolling-horizon optimization problem that includes a battery aging model within the cost function. Quantifying degradation as a depreciation cost in the objective can increase overall profits by extending lifetime. However, depreciation is just a proxy metric for battery aging; it is used because simulating the entire system life is challenging due to computational complexity and the absence of decades of future data. In cases where the depreciation cost does not match the loss of possible future revenue, different optimal usage profiles result and this reduces overall profit significantly compared to the best case (e.g., by 30-50%). Representing battery degradation perfectly within the rolling-horizon optimization does not resolve this - in addition, the economic cost of degradation throughout life should be carefully considered. For energy arbitrage, optimal economic dispatch requires a trade-off between overuse, leading to high return rate but short lifetime, vs. underuse, leading to a long but not profitable life. We reveal the intuition behind selecting representative costs for the objective function, and propose a simple moving average filter method to estimate degradation cost. Results show that this better captures peak revenue, assuming reliable price forecasts are available.</description>

      <title>Lyapunov Neural Network with Region of Attraction Search</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.10621</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.10621v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Deep learning methods have been widely used in robotic applications, making learning-enabled control design for complex nonlinear systems a promising direction. Although deep reinforcement learning methods have demonstrated impressive empirical performance, they lack the stability guarantees that are important in safety-critical situations. One way to provide these guarantees is to learn Lyapunov certificates alongside control policies. There are three related problems: 1) verify that a given Lyapunov function candidate satisfies the conditions for a given controller on a region, 2) find a valid Lyapunov function and controller on a given region, and 3) find a valid Lyapunov function and a controller such that the region of attraction is as large as possible. Previous work has shown that if the dynamics are piecewise linear, it is possible to solve problems 1) and 2) by solving a Mixed-Integer Linear Program (MILP). In this work, we build upon this method by proposing a Lyapunov neural network that considers monotonicity over half spaces in different directions. We 1) propose a specific choice of Lyapunov function architecture that ensures non-negativity and a unique global minimum by construction, and 2) show that this can be leveraged to find the controller and Lyapunov certificates faster and with a larger valid region by maximizing the size of a square inscribed in a given level set. We apply our method to a 2D inverted pendulum, unicycle path following, a 3-D feedback system, and a 4-D cart pole system, and demonstrate it can shorten the training time by half compared to the baseline, as well as find a larger ROA.</description>

      <title>Forward-Backward Extended DMD with an Asymptotic Stability Constraint</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.10623</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.10623v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper presents a data-driven method to identify an asymptotically stable Koopman system from noisy data. In particular, the proposed approach combines approximations of the system's forward- and backward-in-time dynamics to reduce bias caused by noisy data while enforcing asymptotic stability. A Koopman model of an inherently asymptotically stable system can be unstable due to noisy data and a poor choice of lifting functions. To prevent identifying an unstable model, the proposed approach imposes an asymptotic stability constraint on the Koopman model. The proposed method is formulated as a semidefinite program and its performance is compared to state-of-the-art methods with a simulated Duffing oscillator dataset and experimental soft robot dataset.</description>

      <title>Leveraging Symmetries in Gaits for Reinforcement Learning: A Case Study on Quadrupedal Gaits</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.10723</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.10723v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this research, we address the complex task of developing versatile and agile quadrupedal gaits for robotic platforms, a domain predominantly governed by model-based trajectory optimization methods. We propose an innovative, reference-free reinforcement learning framework that exploits the intrinsic symmetries of dynamic systems to synthesize a broad array of naturalistic quadrupedal locomotion patterns. By capitalizing on distinct symmetry characteristics - namely temporal, morphological, and time-reversal - our approach efficiently facilitates the generation and transition among diverse gaits such as pronking, bounding half-bounding and galloping, across a spectrum of velocities, circumventing the necessity for expert-generated trajectories or complex reward structures. Implemented on the Petoi Bittle robotic model, our methodology illustrates robust and adaptable gait generation capabilities, significantly broadening the scope for robotic mobility and speed adaptability. This contribution not only advances our comprehension of quadrupedal locomotion mechanisms but also underscores the pivotal role of symmetry in the development of scalable and effective robotic gait strategies. Our findings hold substantial implications for robotic design and control, potentially enhancing operational versatility and efficiency across a variety of deployment environments.</description>

      <title>Time-Robust Path Planning with Piece-Wise Linear Trajectory for Signal Temporal Logic Specifications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.10735</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.10735v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Real-world scenarios are characterized by timing uncertainties, e.g., delays, and disturbances. Algorithms with temporal robustness are crucial in guaranteeing the successful execution of tasks and missions in such scenarios. We study time-robust path planning for synthesizing robots' trajectories that adhere to spatial-temporal specifications expressed in Signal Temporal Logic (STL). In contrast to prior approaches that rely on {discretize}d trajectories with fixed time steps, we leverage Piece-Wise Linear (PWL) signals for the synthesis. PWL signals represent a trajectory through a sequence of time-stamped waypoints. This allows us to encode the STL formula into a Mixed-Integer Linear Program (MILP) with fewer variables. This reduction is more pronounced for specifications with a long planning horizon. To that end, we define time-robustness for PWL signals. Subsequently, we propose quantitative semantics for PWL signals according to the recursive syntax of STL and prove their soundness. We then propose an encoding strategy to transform our semantics into a MILP. Our simulations showcase the soundness and the performance of our algorithm.</description>

      <title>Extended Kalman Filtering for Recursive Online Discrete-Time Inverse Optimal Control</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.10841</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.10841v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We formulate the discrete-time inverse optimal control problem of inferring unknown parameters in the objective function of an optimal control problem from measurements of optimal states and controls as a nonlinear filtering problem. This formulation enables us to propose a novel extended Kalman filter (EKF) for solving inverse optimal control problems in a computationally efficient recursive online manner that requires only a single pass through the measurement data. Importantly, we show that the Jacobians required to implement our EKF can be computed efficiently by exploiting recent Pontryagin differentiable programming results, and that our consideration of an EKF enables the development of first-of-their-kind theoretical error guarantees for online inverse optimal control with noisy incomplete measurements. Our proposed EKF is shown to be significantly faster than an alternative unscented Kalman filter-based approach.</description>

      <title>Firm-Dispatchable Power and its Requirement in a Power System based on Variable Generation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.10869</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.10869v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Many countries have commenced a transition from fossil fuel-based electricity generation systems to sustainable systems based on wind and solar generation. It is often noted that the least cost approach would involve a massive scale-up in the building of variable renewables, supported by battery storage and gas peaking plants. The required backup should be firm-dispatchable generation rather than peaking power. The wind and solar generation aspects for this system are clearly defined and understood, however, the term firm-dispatchable power is not defined and the specific requirements are poorly understood. This study seeks to define firm-dispatchable power in this context and its requirement in the sustainable generation system. The study compares 100% renewable generation scenarios from South Africa, Texas, and the UK to demonstrate the requirement for this firm-dispatchable generation. The results indicate that firm-dispatchable generation must be available to replace the renewable generation completely. The required installed capacity for this firm-dispatchable generation does not vary with the distinct demand profiles of the different locations or their comparative renewable generation profiles. It also does not change significantly with the use of energy storage. The usage for this firm-dispatchable generation will vary due to the comparative economics of its use, but the requirement for its installation does not change.</description>

      <title>MPC for Tracking applied to rendezvous with non-cooperative tumbling targets ensuring stability and feasibility</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.10986</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.10986v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A Model Predictive Controller for Tracking is introduced for rendezvous with non-cooperative tumbling targets in active debris removal applications. The target's three-dimensional non-periodic rotational dynamics as well as other state and control constraints are considered. The approach is based on applying an intermediate coordinate transformation that eliminates the time-dependency due to rotations in the constraints. The control law is then found as the solution to a QP problem with linear constraints and dynamics, as derived from the HCW equations, that provides feasibility and stability guarantees by means of a terminal LQR and dead-beat region. The proposed control algorithm performs well in a realistic simulation scenario, namely a near rendezvous with the Envisat spacecraft.</description>

      <title>Stochastic Lp string stability analysis in predecessor-following platoons under packet losses</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.11043</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.11043v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we study (homogeneous) predecessor-following platoons in which the vehicle-to-vehicle (V2V) communications are affected by random packet losses. We model the overall platoon as a stochastic hybrid system and analyse its string stability via a small-gain approach. For nonlinear platoons, we illustrate how the different elements of the platoon have an impact on string stability, such as platoon topology and vehicle scheduling. For linear time-invariant platoons, we provide an explicit string stability condition that illustrates the interplay between the channel success probability, transmission rate, and time headway constant. Lastly, we illustrate our results by numerical simulations.</description>

      <title>Signal Fidelity in Degenerate and Nondegenerate Mode Parametric Amplifier Antennas</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.11067</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.11067v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The gain, received power bandwidth, transient characteristics, and signal fidelity of two time-varying electrically small antennas based on parametric amplifier design are studied using practical QAM signals. Results show that the difference harmonic present in the response of degenerate-mode parametric amplification decreases its signal throughput relative to a reference linear time-invariant (LTI) receiver, despite its apparent increased received power bandwidth in the frequency domain. The analysis also demonstrates that a non-degenerate parametric receiver, lacking this detrimental effect, exhibits increased signal throughput over the reference LTI receiver.</description>

      <title>Unsupervised Learning for Equitable DER Control</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.11068</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.11068v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the context of managing distributed energy resources (DERs) within distribution networks (DNs), this work focuses on the task of developing local controllers. We propose an unsupervised learning framework to train functions that can closely approximate optimal power flow (OPF) solutions. The primary aim is to establish specific conditions under which these learned functions can collectively guide the network towards desired configurations asymptotically, leveraging an incremental control approach. The flexibility of the proposed methodology allows to integrate fairness-driven components into the cost function associated with the OPF problem. This addition seeks to mitigate power curtailment disparities among DERs, thereby promoting equitable power injections across the network. To demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach, power flow simulations are conducted using the IEEE 37-bus feeder. The findings not only showcase the guaranteed system stability but also underscore its improved overall performance.</description>

      <title>Unbiased Parameter Estimation via DREM with Annihilators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.11076</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.11076v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the adaptive control theory, the dynamic regressor extension and mixing (DREM) procedure has become widespread as it allows one to describe a variety of adaptive control problems in unified terms of the parameter estimation problem of a regression equation with a scalar regressor. However, being applied when the system/parameterization is affected by perturbations, in general, it asymptotically provides only biased estimates. In this paper, based on the bias-eliminated least-squares (BELS) approach, a modification of the DREM procedure is proposed that allows one to annihilate perturbations asymptotically and, consequently, asymptotically obtain unbiased estimates. The theoretical results are supported with mathematical modelling and can be used to design adaptive observers and control systems.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.11086v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Aerial cargo transport is anticipated to play a pivotal role in the distribution of goods within urban environments. The shift is propelled by the surge in e-commerce, the imperative to deliver essential supplies to isolated areas, and the growing demand for expedited and more accessible deliveries. Our research introduces a quantifiable standard for defining routing restrictions for Unmanned Aircraft System Traffic Management (UTM) using the concept of repulsive potential fields. Furthermore, we propose a scalable infrastructure that facilitates collaborative routing of cargo Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) by independent shareholders. The practicality of the infrastructure is validated through a functional prototype implemented at a national scale.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.11104v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study presents a method for deep neural network nonlinear model predictive control (DNN-MPC) to reduce computational complexity, and we show its practical utility through its application in optimizing the energy management of hybrid electric vehicles (HEVs). For optimal power management of HEVs, we first design the online NMPC to collect the data set, and the deep neural network is trained to approximate the NMPC solutions. We assess the effectiveness of our approach by conducting comparative simulations with rule and online NMPC-based power management strategies for HEV, evaluating both fuel consumption and computational complexity. Lastly, we verify the real-time feasibility of our approach through process-in-the-loop (PIL) testing. The test results demonstrate that the proposed method closely approximates the NMPC performance while substantially reducing the computational burden.</description>

      <title>Toward Adaptive Cooperation: Model-Based Shared Control Using LQ-Differential Games</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.11146</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.11146v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper introduces a novel model-based adaptive shared control to allow for the identification and design challenge for shared-control systems, in which humans and automation share control tasks. The main challenge is the adaptive behavior of the human in such shared control interactions. Consequently, merely identifying human behavior without considering automation is insufficient and often leads to inadequate automation design. Therefore, this paper proposes a novel solution involving online identification of the human and the adaptation of shared control using Linear-Quadratic differential games. The effectiveness of the proposed online adaptation is analyzed in simulations and compared with a non-adaptive shared control from the state of the art. Finally, the proposed approach is tested through human-in-the-loop experiments, highlighting its suitability for real-time applications.</description>

      <title>The Role of Extended Horizon Methodology in Renewable-Dense Grids With Inter-Day Long-Duration Energy Storage</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.11379</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.11379v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study addresses the challenges in optimizing long-duration energy storage (LDES) dispatch within future power systems featuring high integration of variable renewable energy (VRE). The research focuses on conducting a comparative analysis between traditional and extended horizon methods for the optimization of LDES dispatch, using open-source and commercial production cost models (PCMs), tested on a futuristic Electric Reliability Council of Texas (ERCOT) grid. The findings indicate that, despite its complexity and longer solution times, the extended horizon approach demonstrates superior performance in LDES dispatch and effectively reduces the impact of degenerate solutions in sequential simulations. This study underscores the trade-offs between computational efficiency and improvement in storage dispatch, which is crucial for future energy systems. The analysis highlights the necessity of addressing the degeneracy issue in storage dispatch in grids dominated by zero operating cost VRE generators and low operating cost energy storage devices. Additionally, the research reveals revenue discrepancies for LDES operators across different models, a consequence of the persistent presence of degeneracy in high VRE systems. These findings suggest an urgent need for refined modeling techniques in the planning and operation of future energy systems.</description>

      <title>Topology Data Analysis-based Error Detection for Semantic Image Transmission with Incremental Knowledge-based HARQ</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.11542</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.11542v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Semantic communication (SemCom) aims to achieve high fidelity information delivery under low communication consumption by only guaranteeing semantic accuracy. Nevertheless, semantic communication still suffers from unexpected channel volatility and thus developing a re-transmission mechanism (e.g., hybrid automatic repeat request [HARQ]) is indispensable. In that regard, instead of discarding previously transmitted information, the incremental knowledge-based HARQ (IK-HARQ) is deemed as a more effective mechanism that could sufficiently utilize the information semantics. However, considering the possible existence of semantic ambiguity in image transmission, a simple bit-level cyclic redundancy check (CRC) might compromise the performance of IK-HARQ. Therefore, it emerges a strong incentive to revolutionize the CRC mechanism, so as to reap the benefits of both SemCom and HARQ. In this paper, built on top of swin transformer-based joint source-channel coding (JSCC) and IK-HARQ, we propose a semantic image transmission framework SC-TDA-HARQ. In particular, different from the conventional CRC, we introduce a topological data analysis (TDA)-based error detection method, which capably digs out the inner topological and geometric information of images, so as to capture semantic information and determine the necessity for re-transmission. Extensive numerical results validate the effectiveness and efficiency of the proposed SC-TDA-HARQ framework, especially under the limited bandwidth condition, and manifest the superiority of TDA-based error detection method in image transmission.</description>

      <title>Symmetry-based Abstraction Algorithm for Accelerating Symbolic Control Synthesis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.11816</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.11816v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose an efficient symbolic control synthesis algorithm for equiv- ariant continuous-time dynamical systems to satisfy reach-avoid specifications. The algorithm exploits dynamical symmetries to construct lean abstractions to avoid redundant computations during synthesis. Our proposed algorithm adds an- other layer of abstraction over the common grid-based discrete abstraction before solving the synthesis problem. It combines each set of grid cells that are at a similar relative position from the targets and nearby obstacles, defined by the symmetries, into a single abstract state. It uses this layer of abstraction to guide the order by which actions are explored during synthesis over the grid-based abstraction. We demonstrate the potential of our algorithm by synthesizing a reach-avoid controller for a 3-dimensional ship model with translation and rotation symmetries in the special Euclidean group SE(2).</description>

      <title>Stochastic Mean Field Game for Strategic Bidding of Consumers in Congested Distribution Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.11836</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.11836v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The rapid increase of photovoltaic cells, batteries, and Electric Vehicles (EVs) in electric grids can result in congested distribution networks. An alternative to enhancing network capacity is a redispatch market, allowing Distribution System Operators (DSOs) to alleviate congested networks by asking energy consumers to change their consumption schedules. However, energy consumers can anticipate the redispatch market outcomes and strategically adjust their bids in the day-ahead market. This behaviour, known as increase-decrease gaming, can result in the exacerbation of congestion and enable energy consumers to gain windfall profits from the DSO. In this paper, we consider a two-stage problem consisting of the day-ahead market (first stage) and redispatch market (second stage). Then, we model the increase-decrease game for large populations of energy consumers in power networks using a stochastic mean field game approach. The agents (energy consumers) maximize their individual welfare in the day-ahead market with anticipation of the redispatch market. We show that all the agent strategies are ordered along their utilities and there exists a unique Nash equilibrium for this game.</description>

      <title>Context-aware LLM-based Safe Control Against Latent Risks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.11863</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.11863v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: It is challenging for autonomous control systems to perform complex tasks in the presence of latent risks. Motivated by this challenge, this paper proposes an integrated framework that involves Large Language Models (LLMs), stochastic gradient descent (SGD), and optimization-based control. In the first phrase, the proposed framework breaks down complex tasks into a sequence of smaller subtasks, whose specifications account for contextual information and latent risks. In the second phase, these subtasks and their parameters are refined through a dual process involving LLMs and SGD. LLMs are used to generate rough guesses and failure explanations, and SGD is used to fine-tune parameters. The proposed framework is tested using simulated case studies of robots and vehicles. The experiments demonstrate that the proposed framework can mediate actions based on the context and latent risks and learn complex behaviors efficiently.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.11883v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This work introduces the Data-Enabled Predictive Repetitive Control (DeePRC) algorithm, a direct data-driven approach for repetitive LTI systems. The DeePRC learns from previous iterations to improve its performance and achieves the optimal cost. By utilizing a tube-based variation of the DeePRC scheme, we propose a two-stage approach that enables safe active exploration using a left-kernel-based input disturbance design. This method generates informative trajectories to enrich the historical data, which extends the maximum achievable prediction horizon and leads to faster iteration convergence. In addition, we present an end-to-end formulation of the two-stage approach, integrating the disturbance design procedure into the planning phase. We showcase the effectiveness of the proposed algorithms on a numerical experiment.</description>

      <title>Distill2Explain: Differentiable decision trees for explainable reinforcement learning in energy application controllers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.11907</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.11907v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Demand-side flexibility is gaining importance as a crucial element in the energy transition process. Accounting for about 25% of final energy consumption globally, the residential sector is an important (potential) source of energy flexibility. However, unlocking this flexibility requires developing a control framework that (1) easily scales across different houses, (2) is easy to maintain, and (3) is simple to understand for end-users. A potential control framework for such a task is data-driven control, specifically model-free reinforcement learning (RL). Such RL-based controllers learn a good control policy by interacting with their environment, learning purely based on data and with minimal human intervention. Yet, they lack explainability, which hampers user acceptance. Moreover, limited hardware capabilities of residential assets forms a hurdle (e.g., using deep neural networks). To overcome both those challenges, we propose a novel method to obtain explainable RL policies by using differentiable decision trees. Using a policy distillation approach, we train these differentiable decision trees to mimic standard RL-based controllers, leading to a decision tree-based control policy that is data-driven and easy to explain. As a proof-of-concept, we examine the performance and explainability of our proposed approach in a battery-based home energy management system to reduce energy costs. For this use case, we show that our proposed approach can outperform baseline rule-based policies by about 20-25%, while providing simple, explainable control policies. We further compare these explainable policies with standard RL policies and examine the performance trade-offs associated with this increased explainability.</description>

      <title>State space representations of the Roesser type for convolutional layers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.11938</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.11938v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: From the perspective of control theory, convolutional layers (of neural networks) are 2-D (or N-D) linear time-invariant dynamical systems. The usual representation of convolutional layers by the convolution kernel corresponds to the representation of a dynamical system by its impulse response. However, many analysis tools from control theory, e.g., involving linear matrix inequalities, require a state space representation. For this reason, we explicitly provide a state space representation of the Roesser type for 2-D convolutional layers with $c_\mathrm{in}r_1 + c_\mathrm{out}r_2$ states, where $c_\mathrm{in}$/$c_\mathrm{out}$ is the number of input/output channels of the layer and $r_1$/$r_2$ characterizes the width/length of the convolution kernel. This representation is shown to be minimal for $c_\mathrm{in} = c_\mathrm{out}$. We further construct state space representations for dilated, strided, and N-D convolutions.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.11945v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The paper introduces a kernel-based framework to model and identify time-invariant systems with the fading memory property. The key departure from the previous literature is to bypass the state-space representation of the model. Instead, a kernel representation is used to directly model the memory functional that maps past inputs to the present output. We explore the versatility of this approach to encode important system properties in the hyperparameters of the kernel. The approach is illustrated on the Hodgkin and Huxley model of neuronal excitability.</description>

      <title>Explainable Reinforcement Learning-based Home Energy Management Systems using Differentiable Decision Trees</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.11947</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.11947v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: With the ongoing energy transition, demand-side flexibility has become an important aspect of the modern power grid for providing grid support and allowing further integration of sustainable energy sources. Besides traditional sources, the residential sector is another major and largely untapped source of flexibility, driven by the increased adoption of solar PV, home batteries, and EVs. However, unlocking this residential flexibility is challenging as it requires a control framework that can effectively manage household energy consumption, and maintain user comfort while being readily scalable across different, diverse houses. We aim to address this challenging problem and introduce a reinforcement learning-based approach using differentiable decision trees. This approach integrates the scalability of data-driven reinforcement learning with the explainability of (differentiable) decision trees. This leads to a controller that can be easily adapted across different houses and provides a simple control policy that can be explained to end-users, further improving user acceptance. As a proof-of-concept, we analyze our method using a home energy management problem, comparing its performance with commercially available rule-based baseline and standard neural network-based RL controllers. Through this preliminary study, we show that the performance of our proposed method is comparable to standard RL-based controllers, outperforming baseline controllers by ~20% in terms of daily cost savings while being straightforward to explain.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.12006v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The robustness of the stability properties of dynamical systems in the presence of unknown/adversarial perturbations to system parameters is a desirable property. In this paper, we present methods to efficiently compute and improve the approximate stability radius of linear time-invariant systems. We propose two methods to derive closed-form expressions of approximate stability radius, and use these to re-design the system matrix to increase the stability radius. Our numerical studies show that the approximations work well and are able to improve the robustness of the stability of the system.</description>

      <title>Virtual Elastic Tether: a New Approach for Multi-agent Navigation in Confined Aquatic Environments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.10629</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.10629v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Underwater navigation is a challenging area in the field of mobile robotics due to inherent constraints in self-localisation and communication in underwater environments. Some of these challenges can be mitigated by using collaborative multi-agent teams. However, when applied underwater, the robustness of traditional multi-agent collaborative control approaches is highly limited due to the unavailability of reliable measurements. In this paper, the concept of a Virtual Elastic Tether (VET) is introduced in the context of incomplete state measurements, which represents an innovative approach to underwater navigation in confined spaces. The concept of VET is formulated and validated using the Cooperative Aquatic Vehicle Exploration System (CAVES), which is a sim-to-real multi-agent aquatic robotic platform. Within this framework, a vision-based Autonomous Underwater Vehicle-Autonomous Surface Vehicle leader-follower formulation is developed. Experiments were conducted in both simulation and on a physical platform, benchmarked against a traditional Image-Based Visual Servoing approach. Results indicate that the formation of the baseline approach fails under discrete disturbances, when induced distances between the robots exceeds 0.6 m in simulation and 0.3 m in the real world. In contrast, the VET-enhanced system recovers to pre-perturbation distances within 5 seconds. Furthermore, results illustrate the successful navigation of VET-enhanced CAVES in a confined water pond where the baseline approach fails to perform adequately.</description>

      <title>Resilient by Design: Simulating Street Network Disruptions across Every Urban Area in the World</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.10636</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.10636v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Street networks allow people and goods to move through cities, but they are vulnerable to disasters like floods, earthquakes, and terrorist attacks. Well-planned network design can make a city more resilient and robust to such disruptions, but we still know little about worldwide patterns of vulnerability, or worldwide empirical relationships between specific design characteristics and resilience. This study quantifies and measures the vulnerability of the street networks of every urban area in the world then models the relationships between vulnerability and street network design characteristics. To do so, we simulate over 2.4 billion trips across more than 8,000 urban areas in 178 countries, while also simulating network disruption events representing floods, earthquakes, and targeted attacks. We find that disrupting high-centrality nodes severely impacts network function. All else equal, networks with higher connectivity, fewer chokepoints, or less circuity are less vulnerable to disruption's impacts. This study thus contributes a new global understanding of network design and vulnerability to the literature. We argue that these design characteristics offer high leverage points for street network resilience and robustness that planners should emphasize when designing or retrofitting urban networks.</description>

      <title>Frequency-Reactive Power Optimization Strategy of Grid-forming Offshore Wind Farm Using DRU-HVDC Transmission</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.10797</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.10797v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The diode rectifier unit-based high voltage direct current (DRU-HVDC) transmission with grid-forming (GFM) wind turbine is becoming a promising scheme for offshore wind farm(OWF) integration due to its high reliability and low cost. In this scheme, the AC network of the OWF and the DRU has completely different synchronization mechanisms and power flow characteristics from the traditional power system. To optimize the power flow and reduce the net loss, this paper carries out the power flow modeling and optimization analysis for the DRU-HVDC transmission system with grid-forming OWFs. The influence of the DRU and the GFM wind turbines on the power flow of the system is analyzed. On this basis, improved constraint conditions are proposed and an optimal power flow (OPF) method is established. This method can minimize the power loss by adjusting the reactive power output of each wind turbine and internal network frequency. Finally, based on MATLAB, this paper uses YALMIP toolkit and CPLEX mathematical solver to realize the programming solution of the OPF model proposed in this paper. The results show that the proposed optimization strategy can effectively reduce the power loss of the entire OWF and the transmission system with an optimization ratio of network losses exceeding 25.3%.</description>

      <title>Learning-Based Design of Off-Policy Gaussian Controllers: Integrating Model Predictive Control and Gaussian Process Regression</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.10932</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.10932v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper presents an off-policy Gaussian Predictive Control (GPC) framework aimed at solving optimal control problems with a smaller computational footprint, thereby facilitating real-time applicability while ensuring critical safety considerations. The proposed controller imitates classical control methodologies by modeling the optimization process through a Gaussian process and employs Gaussian Process Regression to learn from the Model Predictive Control (MPC) algorithm. Notably, the Gaussian Process setup does not incorporate a built-in model, enhancing its applicability to a broad range of control problems. We applied this framework experimentally to a differential drive mobile robot, tasking it with trajectory tracking and obstacle avoidance. Leveraging the off-policy aspect, the controller demonstrated adaptability to diverse trajectories and obstacle behaviors. Simulation experiments confirmed the effectiveness of the proposed GPC method, emphasizing its ability to learn the dynamics of optimal control strategies. Consequently, our findings highlight the significant potential of off-policy Gaussian Predictive Control in achieving real-time optimal control for handling of robotic systems in safety-critical scenarios.</description>

      <title>Quaternion-Based Sliding Mode Control for Six Degrees of Freedom Flight Control of Quadrotors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.10934</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.10934v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Despite extensive research on sliding mode control (SMC) design for quadrotors, the existing approaches suffer from certain limitations. Euler angle-based SMC formulations suffer from poor performance in high-pitch or -roll maneuvers. Quaternion-based SMC approaches have unwinding issues and complex architecture. Coordinate-free methods are slow and only almost globally stable. This paper presents a new six degrees of freedom SMC flight controller to address the above limitations. We use a cascaded architecture with a position controller in the outer loop and a quaternion-based attitude controller in the inner loop. The position controller generates the desired trajectory for the attitude controller using a coordinate-free approach. The quaternion-based attitude controller uses the natural characteristics of the quaternion hypersphere, featuring a simple structure while providing global stability and avoiding unwinding issues. We compare our controller with three other common control methods conducting challenging maneuvers like flip-over and high-speed trajectory tracking in the presence of model uncertainties and disturbances. Our controller consistently outperforms the benchmark approaches with less control effort and actuator saturation, offering highly effective and efficient flight control.</description>

      <title>Robust Co-Design of Canonical Underactuated Systems for Increased Certifiable Stability</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.10966</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.10966v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Optimal behaviours of a system to perform a specific task can be achieved by leveraging the coupling between trajectory optimization, stabilization, and design optimization. This approach is particularly advantageous for underactuated systems, which are systems that have fewer actuators than degrees of freedom and thus require for more elaborate control systems. This paper proposes a novel co-design algorithm, namely Robust Trajectory Control with Design optimization (RTC-D). An inner optimization layer (RTC) simultaneously performs direct transcription (DIRTRAN) to find a nominal trajectory while computing optimal hyperparameters for a stabilizing time-varying linear quadratic regulator (TVLQR). RTC-D augments RTC with a design optimization layer, maximizing the system's robustness through a time-varying Lyapunov-based region of attraction (ROA) analysis. This analysis provides a formal guarantee of stability for a set of off-nominal states. The proposed algorithm has been tested on two different underactuated systems: the torque-limited simple pendulum and the cart-pole. Extensive simulations of off-nominal initial conditions demonstrate improved robustness, while real-system experiments show increased insensitivity to torque disturbances.</description>

      <title>Inverse learning of black-box aggregator for robust Nash equilibrium</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.10980</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.10980v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this note, we investigate the robustness of Nash equilibria (NE) in multi-player aggregative games with coupling constraints. There are many algorithms for computing an NE of an aggregative game given a known aggregator. When the coupling parameters are affected by uncertainty, robust NE need to be computed. We consider a scenario where players' weight in the aggregator is unknown, making the aggregator kind of "a black box". We pursue a suitable learning approach to estimate the unknown aggregator by proposing an inverse variational inequality-based relationship. We then utilize the counterpart to reconstruct the game and obtain first-order conditions for robust NE in the worst case. Furthermore, we characterize the generalization property of the learning methodology via an upper bound on the violation probability. Simulation experiments show the effectiveness of the proposed inverse learning approach.</description>

      <title>Andreev reflection mediated $\Delta_T$ noise</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.10990</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.10990v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Quantum noise has been extensively utilized to investigate various aspects of quantum transport, such as current-current correlations and wave-particle duality. A recent focus in this field is on $\Delta_T$ quantum noise, which arises because of a finite temperature difference at vanishing charge current. This paper explores the characterization of $\Delta_T$ noise auto-correlation alongside the shot noise and thermal-noise contributions in a 1D metal/insulator/superconductor junction. We consider a finite temperature gradient with zero applied bias for reservoirs at comparable temperatures. Andreev reflection enhances the $\Delta_T$ noise in a metal-insulator-superconductor junction in contrast to a metal-insulator-superconductor junction in the transparent limit. Unlike quantum noise for which shot-noise dominates thermal-noise at large bias voltages and finite barrier strength, $\Delta_T$ thermal-noise is always higher than $\Delta_T$ shot-noise. Thus, a general bound that is independent of barrier strength is established. This investigation sheds light on the distinct behavior of $\Delta_T$ noise, alongside the ratio of shot-noise to thermal-noise contributions, offering valuable insights into the intricate interplay between finite temperature gradient, barrier strength, and Andreev reflection.</description>

      <title>Identifying the Attractors of Gene Regulatory Networks from Expression Data under Uncertainty: An Interpretable Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.11015</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.11015v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In systems biology, attractor landscape analysis of gene regulatory networks is recognized as a powerful computational tool for studying various cellular states from proliferation and differentiation to senescence and apoptosis. Therefore, accurate identification of attractors plays a critical role in determination of the cell fates. On the other hand, in a real biological circuit, genetic/epigenetic alterations as well as varying environmental factors drastically take effect on the location, characteristics, and even the number of attractors. The central question is: Given a temporal gene expression profile of a real gene regulatory network, how can the attractors be robustly identified in the presence of huge amount of uncertainty? This paper addresses this question using a novel approach based on Zadeh Computing with Words. The proposed scheme could effectively identify the attractors from temporal gene expression data in terms of both fuzzy logic-based and linguistic descriptions which are simply interpretable by human experts. Therefore, this method can be considered as an effective step towards interpretable artificial intelligence. Without loss of generality, genetic toggle switch is considered as the case study. The nonlinear dynamics of this benchmark gene regulatory network is computationally modeled by the notion of uncertain stochastic differential equations. The results of in-silico study demonstrate the efficiency and robustness of the proposed method.</description>

      <title>Resilient Fleet Management for Energy-Aware Intra-Factory Logistics</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.11034v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper presents a novel fleet management strategy for battery-powered robot fleets tasked with intra-factory logistics in an autonomous manufacturing facility. In this environment, repetitive material handling operations are subject to real-world uncertainties such as blocked passages, and equipment or robot malfunctions. In such cases, centralized approaches enhance resilience by immediately adjusting the task allocation between the robots. To overcome the computational expense, a two-step methodology is proposed where the nominal problem is solved a priori using a Monte Carlo Tree Search algorithm for task allocation, resulting in a nominal search tree. When a disruption occurs, the nominal search tree is rapidly updated a posteriori with costs to the new problem while simultaneously generating feasible solutions. Computational experiments prove the real-time capability of the proposed algorithm for various scenarios and compare it with the case where the search tree is not used and the decentralized approach that does not attempt task reassignment.</description>

      <title>A Novel Mutual Insurance Model for Hedging Against Cyber Risks in Power Systems Deploying Smart Technologies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.11054</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.11054v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, a novel cyber-insurance model design is proposed based on system risk evaluation with smart technology applications. The cyber insurance policy for power systems is tailored via cyber risk modeling, reliability impact analysis, and insurance premium calculation. A stochastic Epidemic Network Model is developed to evaluate the cyber risk by propagating cyberattacks among graphical vulnerabilities. Smart technologies deployed in risk modeling include smart monitoring and job thread assignment. Smart monitoring boosts the substation availability against cyberattacks with preventive and corrective measures. The job thread assignment solution reduces the execution failures by distributing the control and monitoring tasks to multiple threads. Reliability assessment is deployed to estimate load losses convertible to monetary losses. These monetary losses would be shared through a mutual insurance plan. To ensure a fair distribution of indemnity, a new Shapley mutual insurance principle is devised. Effectiveness of the proposed Shapley mutual insurance design is validated via case studies. The Shapley premium is compared with existent premium designs. It is shown that the Shapley premium has high indemnity levels closer to those of Tail Conditional Expectation premium. Meanwhile, the Shapley premium is nearly as affordable as the coalitional premium and keeps a relatively low insolvency probability.</description>

      <title>PyroTrack: Belief-Based Deep Reinforcement Learning Path Planning for Aerial Wildfire Monitoring in Partially Observable Environments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.11095</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.11095v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Motivated by agility, 3D mobility, and low-risk operation compared to human-operated management systems of autonomous unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs), this work studies UAV-based active wildfire monitoring where a UAV detects fire incidents in remote areas and tracks the fire frontline. A UAV path planning solution is proposed considering realistic wildfire management missions, where a single low-altitude drone with limited power and flight time is available. Noting the limited field of view of commercial low-altitude UAVs, the problem formulates as a partially observable Markov decision process (POMDP), in which wildfire progression outside the field of view causes inaccurate state representation that prevents the UAV from finding the optimal path to track the fire front in limited time. Common deep reinforcement learning (DRL)-based trajectory planning solutions require diverse drone-recorded wildfire data to generalize pre-trained models to real-time systems, which is not currently available at a diverse and standard scale. To narrow down the gap caused by partial observability in the space of possible policies, a belief-based state representation with broad, extensive simulated data is proposed where the beliefs (i.e., ignition probabilities of different grid areas) are updated using a Bayesian framework for the cells within the field of view. The performance of the proposed solution in terms of the ratio of detected fire cells and monitored ignited area (MIA) is evaluated in a complex fire scenario with multiple rapidly growing fire batches, indicating that the belief state representation outperforms the observation state representation both in fire coverage and the distance to fire frontline.</description>

Abstract: We propose a hybrid feedback control scheme for the autonomous robot navigation problem in three-dimensional environments with arbitrarily-shaped convex obstacles. The proposed hybrid control strategy, which consists in switching between the move-to-target mode and the obstacle-avoidance mode, guarantees global asymptotic stability of the target location in the obstacle-free workspace. We also provide a procedure for the implementation of the proposed hybrid controller in a priori unknown environments and validate its effectiveness through simulation results.</description>

      <title>Measuring Quantum Information Leakage Under Detection Threat</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.11433</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.11433v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Gentle quantum leakage is proposed as a measure of information leakage to arbitrary eavesdroppers that aim to avoid detection. Gentle (also sometimes referred to as weak or non-demolition) measurements are used to encode the desire of the eavesdropper to evade detection. The gentle quantum leakage meets important axioms proposed for measures of information leakage including positivity, independence, and unitary invariance. Global depolarizing noise, an important family of physical noise in quantum devices, is shown to reduce gentle quantum leakage (and hence can be used as a mechanism to ensure privacy or security). A lower bound for the gentle quantum leakage based on asymmetric approximate cloning is presented. This lower bound relates information leakage to mutual incompatibility of quantum states. A numerical example, based on the encoding in the celebrated BB84 quantum key distribution algorithm, is used to demonstrate the results.</description>

Abstract: A critical challenge in deploying unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) for autonomous tasks is their ability to navigate in an unknown environment. This paper introduces a novel vision-depth fusion approach for autonomous navigation on nano-UAVs. We combine the visual-based PULP-Dronet convolutional neural network for semantic information extraction, i.e., serving as the global perception, with 8x8px depth maps for close-proximity maneuvers, i.e., the local perception. When tested in-field, our integration strategy highlights the complementary strengths of both visual and depth sensory information. We achieve a 100% success rate over 15 flights in a complex navigation scenario, encompassing straight pathways, static obstacle avoidance, and 90{\deg} turns.</description>

      <title>SMT-Based Dynamic Multi-Robot Task Allocation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.11737</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.11737v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Multi-Robot Task Allocation (MRTA) is a problem that arises in many application domains including package delivery, warehouse robotics, and healthcare. In this work, we consider the problem of MRTA for a dynamic stream of tasks with task deadlines and capacitated agents (capacity for more than one simultaneous task). Previous work commonly focuses on the static case, uses specialized algorithms for restrictive task specifications, or lacks guarantees. We propose an approach to Dynamic MRTA for capacitated robots that is based on Satisfiability Modulo Theories (SMT) solving and addresses these concerns. We show our approach is both sound and complete, and that the SMT encoding is general, enabling extension to a broader class of task specifications. We show how to leverage the incremental solving capabilities of SMT solvers, keeping learned information when allocating new tasks arriving online, and to solve non-incrementally, which we provide runtime comparisons of. Additionally, we provide an algorithm to start with a smaller but potentially incomplete encoding that can iteratively be adjusted to the complete encoding. We evaluate our method on a parameterized set of benchmarks encoding multi-robot delivery created from a graph abstraction of a hospital-like environment. The effectiveness of our approach is demonstrated using a range of encodings, including quantifier-free theories of uninterpreted functions and linear or bitvector arithmetic across multiple solvers.</description>

      <title>A First-Order Gradient Approach for the Connectivity Analysis of Weighted Graphs</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.11744v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Weighted graphs are commonly used to model various complex systems, including social networks, power grids, transportation networks, and biological systems. In many applications, the connectivity of these networks can be expressed through the Mean First Passage Times (MFPTs) of a Markov chain modeling a random walker on the graph. In this paper, we generalize the network metrics based on Markov chains' MFPTs and extend them to networks affected by uncertainty, in which edges may fail and hence not be present according to a pre-determined stochastic model. To find optimally connected graphs, we present a parameterization-free method for optimizing the MFPTs of the underlying Markov chain. More specifically, we show how to extend the Simultaneous Perturbation Stochastic Approximation (SPSA) algorithm in the context of Markov chain optimization. The proposed algorithm is suitable for both fixed and random networks. Using various numerical experiments, we demonstrate scalability compared to established benchmarks. Importantly, our algorithm finds an optimal solution without requiring prior knowledge of edge failure probabilities, allowing for an online optimization approach.</description>

We achieve this by means of a single semi-definite optimization program. Our formulation can handle mixed-relative degree problems without requiring an explicit safe controller.

      <title>ForzaETH Race Stack - Scaled Autonomous Head-to-Head Racing on Fully Commercial off-the-Shelf Hardware</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.11784</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.11784v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Autonomous racing in robotics combines high-speed dynamics with the necessity for reliability and real-time decision-making. While such racing pushes software and hardware to their limits, many existing full-system solutions necessitate complex, custom hardware and software, and usually focus on Time-Trials rather than full unrestricted Head-to-Head racing, due to financial and safety constraints. This limits their reproducibility, making advancements and replication feasible mostly for well-resourced laboratories with comprehensive expertise in mechanical, electrical, and robotics fields. Researchers interested in the autonomy domain but with only partial experience in one of these fields, need to spend significant time with familiarization and integration. The ForzaETH Race Stack addresses this gap by providing an autonomous racing software platform designed for F1TENTH, a 1:10 scaled Head-to-Head autonomous racing competition, which simplifies replication by using commercial off-the-shelf hardware. This approach enhances the competitive aspect of autonomous racing and provides an accessible platform for research and development in the field. The ForzaETH Race Stack is designed with modularity and operational ease of use in mind, allowing customization and adaptability to various environmental conditions, such as track friction and layout. Capable of handling both Time-Trials and Head-to-Head racing, the stack has demonstrated its effectiveness, robustness, and adaptability in the field by winning the official F1TENTH international competition multiple times.</description>

      <title>Efficient Training of Learning-Based Thermal Power Flow for 4th Generation District Heating Grids</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.11877</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.11877v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Thermal power flow (TPF) is an important task for various control purposes in 4 Th generation district heating grids with multiple decentral heat sources and meshed grid structures. Computing the TPF, i.e., determining the grid state consisting of temperatures, pressures, and mass flows for given supply and demand values, is classically done by solving the nonlinear heat grid equations, but can be sped up by orders of magnitude using learned models such as neural networks. We propose a novel, efficient scheme to generate a sufficiently large training data set covering relevant supply and demand values. Instead of sampling supply and demand values, our approach generates training examples from a proxy distribution over generator and consumer mass flows, omitting the iterations needed for solving the heat grid equations. The exact, but slightly different, training examples can be weighted to represent the original training distribution. We show with simulations for typical grid structures that the new approach can reduce training set generation times by two orders of magnitude compared to sampling supply and demand values directly, without loss of relevance for the training samples. Moreover, learning TPF with a training data set is shown to outperform sample-free, physics-aware training approaches significantly.</description>

      <title>Multistep Inverse Is Not All You Need</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.11940v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In real-world control settings, the observation space is often unnecessarily high-dimensional and subject to time-correlated noise. However, the controllable dynamics of the system are often far simpler than the dynamics of the raw observations. It is therefore desirable to learn an encoder to map the observation space to a simpler space of control-relevant variables. In this work, we consider the Ex-BMDP model, first proposed by Efroni et al. (2022), which formalizes control problems where observations can be factorized into an action-dependent latent state which evolves deterministically, and action-independent time-correlated noise. Lamb et al. (2022) proposes the "AC-State" method for learning an encoder to extract a complete action-dependent latent state representation from the observations in such problems. AC-State is a multistep-inverse method, in that it uses the encoding of the the first and last state in a path to predict the first action in the path. However, we identify cases where AC-State will fail to learn a correct latent representation of the agent-controllable factor of the state. We therefore propose a new algorithm, ACDF, which combines multistep-inverse prediction with a latent forward model. ACDF is guaranteed to correctly infer an action-dependent latent state encoder for a large class of Ex-BMDP models. We demonstrate the effectiveness of ACDF on tabular Ex-BMDPs through numerical simulations; as well as high-dimensional environments using neural-network-based encoders. Code is available at https://github.com/midi-lab/acdf.</description>

      <title>Learning Dynamical Systems Encoding Non-Linearity within Space Curvature</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.11948v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Dynamical Systems (DS) are an effective and powerful means of shaping high-level policies for robotics control. They provide robust and reactive control while ensuring the stability of the driving vector field. The increasing complexity of real-world scenarios necessitates DS with a higher degree of non-linearity, along with the ability to adapt to potential changes in environmental conditions, such as obstacles. Current learning strategies for DSs often involve a trade-off, sacrificing either stability guarantees or offline computational efficiency in order to enhance the capabilities of the learned DS. Online local adaptation to environmental changes is either not taken into consideration or treated as a separate problem. In this paper, our objective is to introduce a method that enhances the complexity of the learned DS without compromising efficiency during training or stability guarantees. Furthermore, we aim to provide a unified approach for seamlessly integrating the initially learned DS's non-linearity with any local non-linearities that may arise due to changes in the environment. We propose a geometrical approach to learn asymptotically stable non-linear DS for robotics control. Each DS is modeled as a harmonic damped oscillator on a latent manifold. By learning the manifold's Euclidean embedded representation, our approach encodes the non-linearity of the DS within the curvature of the space. Having an explicit embedded representation of the manifold allows us to showcase obstacle avoidance by directly inducing local deformations of the space. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our methodology through two scenarios: first, the 2D learning of synthetic vector fields, and second, the learning of 3D robotic end-effector motions in real-world settings.</description>

      <title>Adaptive Parameter Estimation under Finite Excitation</title>

Abstract: Although persistent excitation is often acknowledged as a sufficient condition to exponentially converge in the field of adaptive parameter estimation, it must be noted that in practical applications this may be unguaranteed. Recently, more attention has turned to another relaxed condition, i.e., finite excitation. In this paper, for a class of nominal nonlinear systems with unknown constant parameters, a novel method that combines the Newton algorithm and the time-varying factor is proposed, which can achieve exponential convergence under finite excitation. First, by introducing pre-filtering, the nominal system is transformed to a linear parameterized form. Then the detailed mathematical derivation is outlined from an estimation error accumulated cost function. And it is given that the theoretical analysis of the proposed method in stability and robustness. Finally, comparative numerical simulations are given to illustrate the superiority of the proposed method.</description>

      <title>Bayesian Learning of Optimal Policies in Markov Decision Processes with Countably Infinite State-Space</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.02574</link>
      <description>arXiv:2306.02574v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Models of many real-life applications, such as queuing models of communication networks or computing systems, have a countably infinite state-space. Algorithmic and learning procedures that have been developed to produce optimal policies mainly focus on finite state settings, and do not directly apply to these models. To overcome this lacuna, in this work we study the problem of optimal control of a family of discrete-time countable state-space Markov Decision Processes (MDPs) governed by an unknown parameter $\theta\in\Theta$, and defined on a countably-infinite state space $\mathcal X=\mathbb{Z}_+^d$, with finite action space $\mathcal A$, and an unbounded cost function. We take a Bayesian perspective with the random unknown parameter $\boldsymbol{\theta}^*$ generated via a given fixed prior distribution on $\Theta$. To optimally control the unknown MDP, we propose an algorithm based on Thompson sampling with dynamically-sized episodes: at the beginning of each episode, the posterior distribution formed via Bayes' rule is used to produce a parameter estimate, which then decides the policy applied during the episode. To ensure the stability of the Markov chain obtained by following the policy chosen for each parameter, we impose ergodicity assumptions. From this condition and using the solution of the average cost Bellman equation, we establish an $\tilde O(dh^d\sqrt{|\mathcal A|T})$ upper bound on the Bayesian regret of our algorithm, where $T$ is the time-horizon. Finally, to elucidate the applicability of our algorithm, we consider two different queuing models with unknown dynamics, and show that our algorithm can be applied to develop approximately optimal control algorithms.</description>

      <title>Safety Control of Uncertain MIMO Systems Using Dynamic Output Feedback Barrier Pairs</title>

      <description>arXiv:2308.00326v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Safety control of dynamical systems using barrier functions relies on knowing the full state information. This paper introduces a novel approach for safety control in uncertain MIMO systems with partial state information. The proposed method combines the synthesis of a vector norm barrier function and a dynamic output feedback safety controller to ensure robust safety enforcement. The safety controller guarantees the invariance of the barrier function under uncertain dynamics and disturbances. To address the challenges associated with safety verification using partial state information, a barrier function estimator is developed. This estimator employs an identifier-based state estimator to obtain a state estimate that is affine in the uncertain model parameters of the system. By incorporating a priori knowledge of the limits of the uncertain model parameters and disturbances, the state estimate provides a robust upper bound for the barrier function. Comparative analysis with existing control barrier function based methods shows the advantage of the proposed approach in enforcing safety constraints under tight input constraints and the utilization of estimated state information.</description>

      <title>Data-driven Forced Oscillation Localization using Inferred Impulse Responses</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.01656</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.01656v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Poorly damped oscillations pose threats to the stability and reliability of interconnected power systems. In this work, we propose a comprehensive data-driven framework for inferring the sources of forced oscillation (FO) using solely synchrophasor measurements. During normal grid operations, fast-rate ambient data are collected to recover the impulse responses in the small-signal regime, without requiring the system model. When FO events occur, the source is estimated based on the frequency domain analysis by fitting the least-squares (LS) error for the FO data using the impulse responses recovered previously. Although the proposed framework is purely data-driven, the result has been established theoretically via model-based analysis of linearized dynamics under a few realistic assumptions. Numerical validations demonstrate its applicability to realistic power systems including nonlinear, higher-order dynamics with control effects using the IEEE 68-bus system, and the 240-bus system from the IEEE-NASPI FO source location contest. The generalizability of the proposed methodology has been validated using different types of measurements and partial sensor coverage conditions.</description>

      <title>Efficient Quantification and Representation of Aggregate Flexibility in Electric Vehicles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.02729</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.02729v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Aggregation is crucial to the effective use of flexibility, especially in the case of electric vehicles (EVs) because of their limited individual battery sizes and large aggregate impact. This research proposes a novel method to quantify and represent the aggregate charging flexibility of EV fleets within a fixed flexibility request window. These windows can be chosen based on relevant network operator needs, such as evening congestion periods. The proposed representation is independent of the number of assets but scales only with the number of discrete time steps in the chosen window. The representation involves $2T$ parameters, with T being the number of consecutive time steps in the window. The feasibility of aggregate power signals can be checked using $2T$ constraints and optimized using $2(2^T-1)$ constraints, both exactly capturing the flexibility region. Using a request window eliminates uncertainty related to EV arrival and departure times outside the window. We present the necessary theoretical framework for our proposed methods and outline steps for transitioning between representations. Additionally, we compare the computational efficiency of the proposed method with the common direct aggregation method, where individual EV constraints are concatenated.</description>

      <title>Differentially Private Distributed Stochastic Optimization with Time-Varying Sample Sizes</title>

      <description>arXiv:2310.11892v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Differentially private distributed stochastic optimization has become a hot topic due to the urgent need of privacy protection in distributed stochastic optimization. In this paper, two-time scale stochastic approximation-type algorithms for differentially private distributed stochastic optimization with time-varying sample sizes are proposed using gradient- and output-perturbation methods. For both gradient- and output-perturbation cases, the convergence of the algorithm and differential privacy with a finite cumulative privacy budget $\varepsilon$ for an infinite number of iterations are simultaneously established, which is substantially different from the existing works. By a time-varying sample sizes method, the privacy level is enhanced, and differential privacy with a finite cumulative privacy budget $\varepsilon$ for an infinite number of iterations is established. By properly choosing a Lyapunov function, the algorithm achieves almost-sure and mean-square convergence even when the added privacy noises have an increasing variance. Furthermore, we rigorously provide the mean-square convergence rates of the algorithm and show how the added privacy noise affects the convergence rate of the algorithm. Finally, numerical examples including distributed training on a benchmark machine learning dataset are presented to demonstrate the efficiency and advantages of the algorithms.</description>

      <title>Control Design for Trajectory Tracking and Stabilization of Sensor LOS in an Inertially Stabilized Platform</title>

      <description>arXiv:2311.01859v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Optical sensors are often mounted on moving platforms to aid in a variety of tasks like data collection, surveillance and navigation. This necessitates the precise control of the inertial orientation of the optical sensor line-of-sight (LOS) towards a desired stationary or mobile target. A two-axes gimbal assembly is considered to achieve this control objective which can be decomposed into two parts - stabilization and tracking. A novel state space model is proposed based on the dynamics of a two-axes gimbal system. Using a suitable change of variables, this state space model is transformed into an LTI system. Feedback linearization based control laws are proposed that achieve the desired objectives of stabilization and tracking. The effectiveness of these control laws are demonstrated via simulation in MATLAB based on a typical model of a two-axes gimbal system.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2311.03338v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper studies a target-defense game played between a slow defender and a fast attacker. The attacker wins the game if it reaches the target while avoiding the defender's capture disk. The defender wins the game by preventing the attacker from reaching the target, which includes reaching the target and containing it in the capture disk. Depending on the initial condition, the attacker must circumnavigate the defender's capture disk, resulting in a constrained trajectory. This condition produces three phases of the game, which we analyze to solve for the game of kind. We provide the barrier surface that divides the state space into attacker-win and defender win regions, and present the corresponding strategies that guarantee win for each region. Numerical experiments demonstrate the theoretical results as well as the efficacy of the proposed strategies.</description>

Abstract: We study the problem of selecting a user equipment (UE) and a beam for each access point (AP) for concurrent transmissions in a millimeter wave (mmWave) network, such that the sum of weighted rates of UEs is maximized. We prove that this problem is NP-complete. We propose two algorithms -- Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) based and local interaction game (LIG) based UE and beam selection -- and prove that both of them asymptotically achieve the optimal solution. Also, we propose two fast greedy algorithms -- NGUB1 and NGUB2 -- for UE and beam selection. Through extensive simulations, we show that our proposed greedy algorithms outperform the most relevant algorithms proposed in prior work and perform close to the asymptotically optimal algorithms.</description>

      <title>Bounding Stochastic Safety: Leveraging Freedman's Inequality with Discrete-Time Control Barrier Functions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.05745</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.05745v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: When deployed in the real world, safe control methods must be robust to unstructured uncertainties such as modeling error and external disturbances. Typical robust safety methods achieve their guarantees by always assuming that the worst-case disturbance will occur. In contrast, this paper utilizes Freedman's inequality in the context of discrete-time control barrier functions (DTCBFs) and c-martingales to provide stronger (less conservative) safety guarantees for stochastic systems. Our approach accounts for the underlying disturbance distribution instead of relying exclusively on its worst-case bound and does not require the barrier function to be upper-bounded, which makes the resulting safety probability bounds more directly useful for intuitive safety constraints such as signed distance. We compare our results with existing safety guarantees, such as input-to-state safety (ISSf) and martingale results that rely on Ville's inequality. When the assumptions for all methods hold, we provide a range of parameters for which our guarantee is stronger. Finally, we present simulation examples, including a bipedal walking robot, that demonstrate the utility and tightness of our safety guarantee.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.08099v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The utilization of distributed arithmetic (DA) in AF algorithms has gained significant attention in recent years due to its potential to enhance computational efficiency and reduce resource requirements. This paper presents an exploration of the application of DA to adaptive filtering (AF) algorithms, analyzing trends, discussing challenges, and outlining future prospects. It begins by providing an overview of both DA and AF algorithms, highlighting their individual merits and established applications. Subsequently, the integration of DA into AF algorithms is explored, showcasing its ability to optimize multiply-accumulate operations and mitigate the computational burden associated with AF algorithms. Throughout the paper, the critical trends observed in the field are discussed, including advancements in DA-based hardware architectures. Moreover, the challenges encountered in implementing DA-based AF is also discussed. The continued evolution of DA techniques to cater to the demands of modern AF applications, including real-time processing, resource-constrained environments, and high-dimensional data streams is anticipated. In conclusion, this paper consolidates the current state of applying DA to AF algorithms, offering insights into prevailing trends, discussing challenges, and presenting future research and development in the field. The fusion of these two domains holds promise for achieving improved computational efficiency, reduced hardware complexity, and enhanced performance in various signal processing applications.</description>

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) as chatbots have drawn remarkable attention thanks to their versatile capability in natural language processing as well as in a wide range of tasks. While there has been great enthusiasm towards adopting such foundational model-based artificial intelligence tools in all sectors possible, the capabilities and limitations of such LLMs in improving the operation of the electric energy sector need to be explored, and this article identifies fruitful directions in this regard. Key future research directions include data collection systems for fine-tuning LLMs, embedding power system-specific tools in the LLMs, and retrieval augmented generation (RAG)-based knowledge pool to improve the quality of LLM responses and LLMs in safety-critical use cases.</description>

      <title>On Large-Scale Multiple Testing Over Networks: An Asymptotic Approach</title>

      <description>arXiv:2211.16059v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This work concerns developing communication- and computation-efficient methods for large-scale multiple testing over networks, which is of interest to many practical applications. We take an asymptotic approach and propose two methods, proportion-matching and greedy aggregation, tailored to distributed settings. The proportion-matching method achieves the global BH performance yet only requires a one-shot communication of the (estimated) proportion of true null hypotheses as well as the number of p-values at each node. By focusing on the asymptotic optimal power, we go beyond the BH procedure by providing an explicit characterization of the asymptotic optimal solution. This leads to the greedy aggregation method that effectively approximates the optimal rejection regions at each node, while computation efficiency comes from the greedy-type approach naturally. Moreover, for both methods, we provide the rate of convergence for both the FDR and power. Extensive numerical results over a variety of challenging settings are provided to support our theoretical findings.</description>

      <title>Capacity Gains in MIMO Systems with Few-Bit ADCs Using Nonlinear Analog Circuits</title>

      <description>arXiv:2212.05948v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Analog to Digital Converters (ADCs) are a major contributor to the power consumption of multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) receivers with large antenna arrays operating in the millimeter wave carrier frequencies. This is especially the case in large bandwidth communication systems, due to the sudden drop in energy-efficiency of ADCs as the sampling rate is increased above 100MHz. Two mitigating energy-efficient approaches which have received significant recent interest are i) to reduce the number of ADCs via analog and hybrid beamforming architectures, and ii) to reduce the resolution of the ADCs which in turn decreases power consumption. However, decreasing the number and resolution of ADCs leads to performance loss -- in terms of achievable rates -- due to increased quantization error. In this work, we study the application of practically implementable nonlinear analog operators such as envelope detectors and polynomial operators, prior to sampling and quantization at the ADCs, as a way to mitigate the aforementioned rate-loss. A receiver architecture consisting of linear analog combiners, nonlinear analog operators, and few-bit ADCs is designed. The fundamental information theoretic performance limits of the resulting communication system, in terms of achievable rates, are investigated under various assumptions on the set of implementable analog operators. Extensive numerical evaluations and simulations of the communication system are provided to compare the set of achievable rates under different architecture designs and parameters. Circuit simulations and measurement results, based on both 22 nm FDSOI CMOS technology and 65 nm Bulk CMOS transistor technologies, are provided to justify the power efficiency of the proposed receiver architecture deploying envelope detectors and polynomial operators.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2302.01404v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Most work on the formal verification of neural networks has focused on bounding the set of outputs that correspond to a given set of inputs (for example, bounded perturbations of a nominal input). However, many use cases of neural network verification require solving the inverse problem, or over-approximating the set of inputs that lead to certain outputs. We present the INVPROP algorithm for verifying properties over the preimage of a linearly constrained output set, which can be combined with branch-and-bound to increase precision. Contrary to other approaches, our efficient algorithm is GPU-accelerated and does not require a linear programming solver. We demonstrate our algorithm for identifying safe control regions for a dynamical system via backward reachability analysis, verifying adversarial robustness, and detecting out-of-distribution inputs to a neural network. Our results show that in certain settings, we find over-approximations over 2500x tighter than prior work while being 2.5x faster. By strengthening robustness verification with output constraints, we consistently verify more properties than the previous state-of-the-art on multiple benchmarks, including a large model with 167k neurons in VNN-COMP 2023.

      <title>A Convex Hull Cheapest Insertion Heuristic for Precedence Constrained Traveling Salesperson Problems or Sequential Ordering Problems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.05333</link>
      <description>arXiv:2303.05333v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The convex hull cheapest insertion heuristic is a well-known method that efficiently generates good solutions to the Traveling Salesperson Problem. However, this heuristic has not been adapted to account for precedence constraints that restrict the order in which locations can be visited. Such constraints result in the precedence constrained traveling salesperson problem or the sequential ordering problem, which are commonly encountered in applications where items have to be picked up before they are delivered. In this paper, we present an adapted version of this heuristic that accounts for precedence constraints in the problem definition. This algorithm is compared with the widely used Nearest Neighbor heuristic on the TSPLIB benchmark data with added precedence constraints. It is seen that the proposed algorithm is particularly well suited to cases where delivery nodes are centrally positioned, with pickup nodes located in the periphery, outperforming the Nearest Neighbor algorithm in 97\% of the examined instances.</description>

      <title>Powered Descent Guidance via First-Order Optimization with Expansive Projection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.00397</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.00397v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper introduces a first-order method for solving optimal powered descent guidance (PDG) problems, that directly handles the nonconvex constraints associated with the maximum and minimum thrust bounds with varying mass and the pointing angle constraints on thrust vectors. This issue has been conventionally circumvented via lossless convexification (LCvx), which lifts a nonconvex feasible set to a higher-dimensional convex set, and via linear approximation of another nonconvex feasible set defined by exponential functions. However, this approach sometimes results in an infeasible solution when the solution obtained from the higher-dimensional space is projected back to the original space, especially when the problem involves a nonoptimal time of flight. Additionally, the Taylor series approximation introduces an approximation error that grows with both flight time and deviation from the reference trajectory. In this paper, we introduce a first-order approach that makes use of orthogonal projections onto nonconvex sets, allowing expansive projection (ExProj). We show that 1) this approach produces a feasible solution with better performance even for the nonoptimal time of flight cases for which conventional techniques fail to generate achievable trajectories and 2) the proposed method compensates for the linearization error that arises from Taylor series approximation, thus generating a superior guidance solution with less fuel consumption. We provide numerical examples featuring quantitative assessments to elucidate the effectiveness of the proposed methodology, particularly in terms of fuel consumption and flight time. Our analysis substantiates the assertion that the proposed approach affords enhanced flexibility in devising viable trajectories for a diverse array of planetary soft landing scenarios.</description>

      <title>Optimal Impact Angle Guidance via First-Order Optimization under Nonconvex Constraints</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.00398</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.00398v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Most of the optimal guidance problems can be formulated as nonconvex optimization problems, which can be solved indirectly by relaxation, convexification, or linearization. Although these methods are guaranteed to converge to the global optimum of the modified problems, the obtained solution may not guarantee global optimality or even the feasibility of the original nonconvex problems. In this paper, we propose a computational optimal guidance approach that directly handles the nonconvex constraints encountered in formulating the guidance problems. The proposed computational guidance approach alternately solves the least squares problems and projects the solution onto nonconvex feasible sets, which rapidly converges to feasible suboptimal solutions or sometimes to the globally optimal solutions. The proposed algorithm is verified via a series of numerical simulations on impact angle guidance problems under state dependent maneuver vector constraints, and it is demonstrated that the proposed algorithm provides superior guidance performance than conventional techniques.</description>

      <title>Hybrid Zonotope-Based Backward Reachability Analysis for Neural Feedback Systems With Nonlinear System Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.06921</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.06921v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The increasing prevalence of neural networks in safety-critical control systems underscores the imperative need for rigorous methods to ensure the reliability and safety of these systems. This work introduces a novel approach employing hybrid zonotopes to compute the over-approximation of backward reachable sets for neural feedback systems with nonlinear system models and general activation functions. Closed-form expressions as hybrid zonotopes are provided for the over-approximated backward reachable sets, and a refinement procedure is proposed to alleviate the potential conservatism of the approximation. Two numerical examples are provided to illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach.</description>

      <title>Where to Decide? Centralized vs. Distributed Vehicle Assignment for Platoon Formation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.09580</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.09580v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Platooning is a promising cooperative driving application for future intelligent transportation systems. In order to assign vehicles to platoons, some algorithm for platoon formation is required. Such vehicle-to-platoon assignments have to be computed on-demand, e.g., when vehicles join or leave the freeways. In order to get best results from platooning, individual properties of involved vehicles have to be considered during the assignment computation. In this paper, we explore the computation of vehicle-to-platoon assignments as an optimization problem based on similarity between vehicles. We define the similarity and, vice versa, the deviation among vehicles based on the desired driving speed of vehicles and their position on the road. We create three approaches to solve this assignment problem: centralized solver, centralized greedy, and distributed greedy, using a Mixed Integer Programming (MIP) solver and greedy heuristics, respectively.Conceptually, the approaches differ in both knowledge about vehicles as well as methodology. We perform a large-scale simulation study using PlaFoSim to compare all approaches. While the distributed greedy approach seems to have disadvantages due to the limited local knowledge, it performs as good as the centralized solver approach across most metrics. Both outperform the centralized greedy approach, which suffers from synchronization and greedy selection effects. The centralized solver approach however assumes global knowledge and requires a complex MIP solver to compute vehicle-to-platoon assignments. Overall, the distributed greedy approach achieves close to optimal results but requires the least assumptions and complexity.Therefore, we consider the distributed greedy approach the best approach among all presented approaches.</description>

      <title>Resonant Inductive Coupling Network for Human-Sized Magnetic Particle Imaging</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.15245</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.15245v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In Magnetic Particle Imaging, a field-free region is maneuvered throughout the field of view using a time-varying magnetic field known as the drive-field. Human-sized systems operate the drive-field in the kHz range and generate it by utilizing strong currents that can rise to the kA range within a coil called the drive field generator. Matching and tuning between a power amplifier, a band-pass filter and the drive-field generator is required. Here, for reasons of safety in future human scanners, a symmetrical topology and a transformer, called inductive coupling network is used. Our primary objectives are to achieve floating potentials to ensure patient safety, attaining high linearity and high gain for the resonant transformer. We present a novel systematic approach to the design of a loss-optimized resonant toroid with a D-shaped cross section, employing segmentation to adjust the inductance-to-resistance ratio while maintaining a constant quality factor. Simultaneously, we derive a specific matching condition of a symmetric transmit-receive circuit for magnetic particle imaging. The chosen setup filters the fundamental frequency and allows simultaneous signal transmission and reception. In addition, the decoupling of multiple drive field channels is discussed and the primary side of the transformer is evaluated for maximum coupling and minimum stray field. Two prototypes were constructed, measured, decoupled, and compared to the derived theory and to method-of-moment based simulations.</description>

      <title>Robustness Evaluation of Localization Techniques for Autonomous Racing</title>

      <description>arXiv:2401.07658v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This work introduces SynPF, an MCL-based algorithm tailored for high-speed racing environments. Benchmarked against Cartographer, a state-of-the-art pose-graph SLAM algorithm, SynPF leverages synergies from previous particle-filtering methods and synthesizes them for the high-performance racing domain. Our extensive in-field evaluations reveal that while Cartographer excels under nominal conditions, it struggles when subjected to wheel-slip, a common phenomenon in a racing scenario due to varying grip levels and aggressive driving behaviour. Conversely, SynPF demonstrates robustness in these challenging conditions and a low-latency computation time of 1.25 ms on on-board computers without a GPU. Using the F1TENTH platform, a 1:10 scaled autonomous racing vehicle, this work not only highlights the vulnerabilities of existing algorithms in high-speed scenarios, tested up until 7.6 m/s, but also emphasizes the potential of SynPF as a viable alternative, especially in deteriorating odometry conditions.</description>

      <title>Solution of the Probabilistic Lambert Problem: Connections with Optimal Mass Transport, Schr\"odinger Bridge and Reaction-Diffusion PDEs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.07961</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.07961v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Lambert's problem concerns with transferring a spacecraft from a given initial to a given terminal position within prescribed flight time via velocity control subject to a gravitational force field. We consider a probabilistic variant of the Lambert problem where the knowledge of the endpoint constraints in position vectors are replaced by the knowledge of their respective joint probability density functions. We show that the Lambert problem with endpoint joint probability density constraints is a generalized optimal mass transport (OMT) problem, thereby connecting this classical astrodynamics problem with a burgeoning area of research in modern stochastic control and stochastic machine learning. This newfound connection allows us to rigorously establish the existence and uniqueness of solution for the probabilistic Lambert problem. The same connection also helps to numerically solve the probabilistic Lambert problem via diffusion regularization, i.e., by leveraging further connection of the OMT with the Schr\"odinger bridge problem (SBP). This also shows that the probabilistic Lambert problem with additive dynamic process noise is in fact a generalized SBP, and can be solved numerically using the so-called Schr\"odinger factors, as we do in this work. We explain how the resulting analysis leads to solving a boundary-coupled system of reaction-diffusion PDEs where the nonlinear gravitational potential appears as the reaction rate. We propose novel algorithms for the same, and present illustrative numerical results. Our analysis and the algorithmic framework are nonparametric, i.e., we make neither statistical (e.g., Gaussian, first few moments, mixture or exponential family, finite dimensionality of the sufficient statistic) nor dynamical (e.g., Taylor series) approximations.</description>

      <title>Design and Flight Demonstration of a Quadrotor for Urban Mapping and Target Tracking Research</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.13195</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.13195v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper describes the hardware design and flight demonstration of a small quadrotor with imaging sensors for urban mapping, hazard avoidance, and target tracking research. The vehicle is equipped with five cameras, including two pairs of fisheye stereo cameras that enable a nearly omnidirectional view and a two-axis gimbaled camera. An onboard NVIDIA Jetson Orin Nano computer running the Robot Operating System software is used for data collection. An autonomous tracking behavior was implemented to coordinate the motion of the quadrotor and gimbaled camera to track a moving GPS coordinate. The data collection system was demonstrated through a flight test that tracked a moving GPS-tagged vehicle through a series of roads and parking lots. A map of the environment was reconstructed from the collected images using the Direct Sparse Odometry (DSO) algorithm. The performance of the quadrotor was also characterized by acoustic noise, communication range, battery voltage in hover, and maximum speed tests.</description>

      <title>Control and Automation for Industrial Production Storage Zone: Generation of Optimal Route Using Image Processing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.10054</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.10054v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Digital image processing (DIP) is of great importance in validating and guaranteeing parameters that ensure the quality of mass-produced products. Therefore, this article focused on developing an industrial automation method for a zone of a production line model using the DIP. The neo-cascade methodology employed allowed for defining each of the stages in an adequate way, ensuring the inclusion of the relevant methods for its development, which finally incurred in the modeling, design, implementation, and testing of an optimal route generation system for a warehouse area, using DIP with optimization guidelines, in conjunction with an embedded platform and the connection to programmable logic controllers (PLCs) for its execution. The system was based on the OpenCV library; tool focused on artificial vision, which was implemented on an object-oriented programming (OOP) platform based on Java language. It generated the optimal route for the automation of processes in a scale warehouse area, using the segmentation of objects and the optimization of flow in networks as pillars, ending with the connection to PLCs as a method of action, which in case of implementation would eliminate constraints such as process inefficiency, the use of manpower to perform these tasks, inadequate use of resources, among others</description>
