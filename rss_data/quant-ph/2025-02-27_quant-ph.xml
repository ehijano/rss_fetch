      <title>Missing Aharonov-Casher geometric quantum phase</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.18544</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.18544v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: From the interaction of the permanent magnetic dipole moment of a neutral particle with an electric field inside a long non-conducting cylindrical shell of inner radius $r_{a}$ and outer radius $r_{b}$, we show that a geometric quantum phase stems from the missing electric charge per unit length. Thus, we discuss the possibility of existing Aharonov-Bohm-type effects with regard to this geometric quantum phase. Further, we discuss the persistent spin currents.</description>

      <title>Optimization via Quantum Preconditioning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.18570</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.18570v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: State-of-the-art classical optimization solvers set a high bar for quantum computers to deliver utility in this domain. Here, we introduce a quantum preconditioning approach based on the quantum approximate optimization algorithm. It transforms the input problem into a more suitable form for a solver with the level of preconditioning determined by the depth of the quantum circuit. We demonstrate that best-in-class classical heuristics such as simulated annealing and the Burer-Monteiro algorithm can converge more rapidly when given quantum preconditioned input for various problems, including Sherrington-Kirkpatrick spin glasses, random 3-regular graph maximum-cut problems, and a real-world grid energy problem. Accounting for the additional time taken for preconditioning, the benefit offered by shallow circuits translates into a practical quantum-inspired advantage for random 3-regular graph maximum-cut problems through quantum circuit emulations. We investigate why quantum preconditioning makes the problem easier and test an experimental implementation on a superconducting device. We identify challenges and discuss the prospects for a hardware-based quantum advantage in optimization via quantum preconditioning.</description>

      <title>Disentangling quantum autoencoder</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.18580</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.18580v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Entangled quantum states are highly sensitive to noise, which makes it difficult to transfer them over noisy quantum channels or to store them in quantum memory. Here, we propose the disentangling quantum autoencoder (DQAE) to encode entangled states into single-qubit product states. The DQAE provides an exponential improvement in the number of copies needed to transport entangled states across qubit-loss or leakage channels compared to unencoded states. The DQAE can be trained in an unsupervised manner from entangled quantum data. We demonstrate variational quantum algorithms for general states, and a Metropolis algorithm for stabilizer states. For particular classes of states, the number of training data needed to generalize is surprisingly low: For stabilizer states, DQAE generalizes by learning from a number of training data that scales linearly with the number of qubits, while only $1$ training data is sufficient for states evolved with the transverse-field Ising Hamiltonian. Our work provides practical applications for enhancing near-term quantum computers.</description>

      <title>Optimal Symbolic Construction of Matrix Product Operators and Tree Tensor Network Operators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.18630</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.18630v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This research introduces an improved framework for constructing matrix product operators (MPOs) and tree tensor network operators (TTNOs), crucial tools in quantum simulations. A given (Hamiltonian) operator typically has a known symbolic "sum of operator strings" form that can be translated into a tensor network structure. Combining the existing bipartite-graph-based approach and a newly introduced symbolic Gaussian elimination preprocessing step, our proposed method improves upon earlier algorithms in cases when Hamiltonian terms share the same prefactors. We test the performance of our method against established ones for benchmarking purposes. Finally, we apply our methodology to the model of a cavity filled with molecules in a solvent. This open quantum system is cast into the hierarchical equation of motion (HEOM) setting to obtain an effective Hamiltonian. Construction of the corresponding TTNO demonstrates a sub-linear increase of the maximum bond dimension.</description>

      <title>Quantum data-hiding scheme using orthogonal separable states</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.18656</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.18656v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider bipartite quantum state discrimination and present a quantum data-hiding scheme utilizing an orthogonal separable state ensemble. Using a bound on local minimum-error discrimination, we provide a sufficient condition for the separable state ensemble to be used in constructing a quantum data-hiding scheme. Our results are illustrated with various examples in bipartite quantum systems. As our scheme employs separable states of low-dimensional quantum systems, it becomes more feasible for practical implementation.</description>

      <title>Programmable interferometer: an application in quantum channels</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.18670</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.18670v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum optics plays a crucial role in developing quantum computers on different platforms. In photonics, precise control over light's degrees of freedom, including discrete variables (polarization, photon number, orbital angular momentum) and continuous variables (phase, amplitude quadratures, frequency), is fundamental. Our model manipulates photonic systems to encode and process quantum information via the photon's spatial degree of freedom, employing polarization as an auxiliary qubit. We propose a programmable photonic circuit that simulates quantum channels, including phase-damping, amplitude-damping, and bit-flip channels, through adjustable interferometric parameters. Furthermore, the interferometer extends to complex channels, such as the squeezed generalized amplitude damping. This work contributes to advancing quantum simulation techniques and serves as a foundation for exploring quantum computing applications, while highlighting pathways for their practical implementation.</description>

      <title>Purified pseudomode model for nonlinear system-bath interactions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.18707</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.18707v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The theory of purified pseudomodes [arXiv:2412.04264 (2024)] was recently developed to provide a numerical tool for the analysis of the properties of a quantum system and the environment it couples to via linear system-bath interactions. Here we extend this theory to allow for the description of general nonlinear system-bath interactions. We demonstrate the validity of our method by considering the spontaneous decay of a two-level atom placed inside a single-mode lossy cavity and furthermore, its potential application to nanophotonics by calculating the resonance fluorescence spectrum of a quantum dot in the presence of a phonon environment. Our method provides a useful tool for the study of phonon-assisted emission in quantum dots and holds the the promise for broad applications in fields like quantum biology, nonlinear phononics, and nanophotonics.</description>

      <title>Highly nondegenerate polarization-entangled photon pairs produced through noncritical phasematching in single-domain KTiOPO$_4$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.18752</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.18752v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Photon-pair sources are useful for entanglement distribution. The most mature of these are spontaneous parametric downconversion (SPDC) sources, most of which achieve phasematching via engineering the domains in poled crystals or the angle between the optic axis and the pump beam. For multi-channel entanglement distribution of photon pairs, where one photon is transmitted through free-space and the other photon is transmitted through fiber, it is beneficial to use highly nondegenerate photon-pair sources. The currently accepted approach in such sources is quasi-phasematching. In this paper, a simpler, more stable alternative is presented for producing highly nondegenerate photon pairs. A source of polarization-entangled photon pairs with low temperature sensitivity based on noncritical phasematched (NCPM) SPDC in single-domain potassium titanyl phosphate (KTP) was demonstrated. Over a crystal temperature range of $75^\circ$C, the center wavelength of the idler photons was observed to change by $10.8$nm while the average entanglement visibility was maintained above $98\%$. With the signal photons detected locally, the idler photons were transmitted through 62km and 93km of deployed telecom fibers with average raw visibilities of $98.2(1)\%$ and $95.6(3)\%$ respectively.</description>

      <title>Bound systems of interacting electrons. A step beyond density functional theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.18789</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.18789v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The non-relativistic interacting electron gas in an external field of positively charged massive cores is dealt with in the scheme of second quantization. Ladder operators that change between stationary states of contiguous energy eigenvalues are derived. The method is particularized to the two-electron Helium atom in order to explain it avoiding too much notation. Applying the lowering operator on the ground state must give zero because no state with lower energy does exist. Equations for the ground state and ground state energy are obtained this way and solved, giving closed--form expressions for the ground state, its energy and electronic density of Helium. The theory in its lowest order gives 0.63% error. The application to more complex systems and higher degrees of approximation seems straightforward. The foundations of the density functional theory and how to go beyond it are seen quite clearly.</description>

      <title>Work Statistics via Real-Time Effective Field Theory: Application to Work Extraction from Thermal Bath with Qubit Coupling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.18812</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.18812v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum thermal states are known to be passive, as required by the second law of thermodynamics. This paper studies the possible work extraction via coupling the thermal bath to a qubit of either spin, fermion, or topological types, which acts as a quantum thermal state at different temperatures. The amount of work extraction is derived from the work statistics under a cyclic nonequilibrium process. Though the work statistics of many-body systems are known to be challenging to calculate explicitly, we propose an effective field theory approach to tackle this problem by assuming the externally driven source to couple to a specific quasiparticle operator of the thermal state. We show that the work statistics can be expressed succinctly in terms of this quasiparticle's thermal spectral function. We obtain the non-perturbative work distribution function (WDF) for the pure thermal bath without the qubit coupling. With qubit coupling, we get the second-order WDF, from which the physical regime of work extraction can be pinned down precisely to help devise quantum engines.</description>

      <title>Evaluation of quantum entanglement state between photoelectron spin and emitted photon polarization in spin and polarization resolved XEPECS of $\rm Ti_{2}O_{3}$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.18818</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.18818v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We theoretically investigated the mechanism of quantum entanglement between the spin of photoelectrons and linear polarization of emitted X-ray photons in the 3$d\rightarrow\ $2$p$ XEPECS process for $\rm Ti_{2}O_{3}$. In the calculation, we used a realistic $\rm TiO_{6}$-type cluster model with the full multiplet structure of the Ti ion and the charge-transfer effect between the Ti 3$d$ and ligand O 2$p$ orbitals. We found that quantum entanglement occurs between the spin of photoelectrons and linear polarization of emitted X-ray photons and that it depends on the angular geometry in the XEPECS process. In addition, we found that the degree of spin and polarization entanglement decreases as the Ti 3$d\ $- O 2$p$ hybridization becomes stronger and as the crystal field modifies the electronic states in terms of the tangle, an index for the degree of entanglement. These results highlight the crucial role of the charge transfer and crystal field effects in determining entanglement properties in real material systems.</description>

      <title>Comparison of encoding schemes for quantum computing of $S &gt; 1/2$ spin chains</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.18838</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.18838v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We compare four different encoding schemes for the quantum computing of spin chains with a spin quantum number $S&gt;1/2$: a compact mapping, a direct (or one-hot) mapping, a Dicke mapping, and a qudit mapping. The three different qubit encoding schemes are assessed by conducting Hamiltonian simulation for $1/2 \le S \le 5/2$ using a trapped-ion quantum computer. The qudit mapping is tested by running simulations with a simple noise model. The Dicke mapping, in which the spin states are encoded as superpositions of multi-qubit states, is found to be the most efficient because of the small number of terms in the qubit Hamiltonian. We also investigate the $S$-dependence of the time step length $\Delta\tau$ in the Suzuki-Trotter approximation and find that, in order to obtain the same accuracy for all $S$, $\Delta\tau$ should be inversely proportional to $S$.</description>

      <title>Universal quantum homomorphic encryption based on $(k, n)$-threshold quantum state sharing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.18880</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.18880v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum homomorphic encryption integrates quantum computing with homomorphic encryption, which allows calculations to be performed directly on encrypted data without decryption on the server side. In this paper, we explore distributed quantum homomorphic encryption, focusing on the coordination of multiple evaluators to achieve evaluation tasks, which not only ensures security but also boosts computational power. Notably, we propose a $(k, n)$-threshold universal quantum homomorphic encryption scheme based on quantum state sharing. Each server is capable of executing a universal gate set, including the Clifford gates $\{X,Y,Z,H,S,CNOT\}$ and a non-Clifford T gate. The scheme provides that k evaluation servers chosen from $n$ $(0 &lt; k \leq n)$ cooperate to complete the quantum homomorphic encryption so that the client can get the evaluated plaintext after decryption. Several concrete examples are presented to provide clarity to our solution. We also include security analysis, demonstrating its security against eavesdroppers.</description>

      <title>Zipping many-body quantum states: a scalable approach to diagonal entropy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.18898</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.18898v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The outcomes of projective measurements on a quantum many-body system in a chosen basis are inherently probabilistic. The Shannon entropy of this probability distribution (the "diagonal entropy") often reveals universal features, such as the existence of a quantum phase transition. A brute-force tomographic approach to estimating this entropy scales exponentially with the system size. Here, we explore using the Lempel-Ziv lossless image compression algorithm as an efficient, scalable alternative, readily implementable in a quantum gas microscope or programmable quantum devices. We test this approach on several examples: one-dimensional quantum Ising model, and two-dimensional states that display conventional symmetry breaking due to quantum fluctuations, or strong-to-weak symmetry-breaking due to local decoherence. We also employ the diagonal mixed state to put constraints on the phase boundaries of our models. In all examples, the compression method accurately recovers the entropy density while requiring at most polynomially many images. We also analyze the singular part of the diagonal entropy density using renormalization group on a replicated action. In the 1+1-D quantum Ising model, we find that it scales as $|t| \log|t|$, where $t$ is the deviation from the critical point, while in a 2+1-D state with amplitudes proportional to the Boltzmann weight of the 2D Ising model, it follows a $t^2 \log|t|$ scaling.</description>

      <title>Scalable Low-overhead Superconducting Non-local Coupler with Exponentially Enhanced Connectivity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.18902</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.18902v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum error correction codes with non-local connections such as quantum low-density parity-check (qLDPC) incur lower overhead and outperform surface codes on large-scale devices. These codes are not applicable on current superconducting devices with nearest-neighbor connections. To rectify the deficiency in connectivity of superconducting circuit system, we experimentally demonstrate a convenient on-chip coupler of centimeters long and propose an extra coupler layer to map the qubit array to a binary-tree connecting graph. This mapping layout reduces the average qubit entangling distance from O(N) to O(logN), demonstrating an exponentially enhanced connectivity with eliminated crosstalk. The entangling gate with the coupler is performed between two fluxonium qubits, reaching a fidelity of 99.37 % while the system static ZZ rate remains as low as 144 Hz without active cancellation or circuit parameter targeting. With the scalable binary tree structure and high-fidelity non-local entanglement, novel quantum algorithms can be implemented on the superconducting qubit system, positioning it as a strong competitor to other physics systems regarding circuit connectivity.</description>

      <title>Real-time Sign-Problem-Suppressed Quantum Monte Carlo Algorithm For Noisy Quantum Circuit Simulations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.18929</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.18929v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a real-time quantum Monte Carlo algorithm that simulates the dynamics of open quantum systems by stochastically compressing and evolving the density matrix under both Markovian and non-Markovian master equations. Our algorithm uses population dynamics to continuously suppress the sign problem, preventing its accumulation throughout the evolution. We apply it to a variety of quantum circuits and demonstrate significant speedups over state-of-art quantum trajectory methods and convergence to exact solutions even in non-Markovian regimes where trajectory methods fail. Our approach improves the efficiency of classical simulation of gate-based quantum computing, quantum annealing, and general open system dynamics.</description>

      <title>Enantiosensitive positions of exceptional points in open chiral systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.18963</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.18963v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Exceptional points are remarkable features of open quantum systems, such as photo-ionizing or photo-dissociating molecules, amplified or dissipated light states in photonic structures, and many others. These points mark spectral degeneracies in a system's parameter space where the eigenstates become non-orthogonal, enabling precise control over decay rates, topological transitions in parity-time (PT)-symmetric systems, or boosting the system's sensitivity to external stimuli. Here we show that exceptional points can be enantiosenstive, enabling a new type of control over topological and chiral properties of non-Hermitian open chiral systems. We apply the concept of enantio-sensitive exceptional points to demonstrate a broad range of phenomena, from enantiosensitive topological population transfer, to lifetime branching in resonant photo-decay of chiral molecules, to enhanced chiral sensing in optical fibers. Our results combine high enantiosensitivity with topological robustness in chiral discrimination and separation, paving the way for new approaches in the control of non-Hermitian and chiral phenomena.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2502.18985v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The algorithm-specific graph and circuit etching are two strategies for compiling a graph state to implement quantum computation. Benchmark testing exposed limitations to the proto-compiler, Jabalizer giving rise to Etch (https://github.com/QSI-BAQS/Etch), an open-source, circuit-etching tool for transpiling a quantum circuit to a graph state. The viability of circuit etching is evaluated, both as a resource allocation strategy for distilling magic states and as an alternative to the algorithm-specific graph strategy as realised in Jabalizer. Experiments using Etch to transpile IQP circuits to an equivalent graph state resulted in higher ratios of Pauli qubits to non-Pauli qubit than required for efficient magic state distillation. Future research directions for the algorithm-specific graph and circuit-etching strategies are proposed.</description>

      <title>t\={u}Q: a design and modelling tool for cluster-state algorithms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.18991</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.18991v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper is a general introduction to the t\={u}Q toolchain (https://github.com/QSI-BAQS/tuQ) and a discussion of its two main workflows, 'reduce and optimise' and 'draft and compile'. The t\={u}Q toolchain was designed to advance research in cluster-state computing and the workflows are presented as suggestions for how a researcher might use the tool. The two modes of t\={u}Q are Modeller and Simulator. Simulator mode has a tile-based syntax for drafting cluster-state algorithms. Modeller enables the user to reduce a lattice through preset measurement functions and optimise an algorithm by minimising the count of qubits or the count of controlled-Z ('CZ') interactions. In addition, t\={u}Q makes it possible to compile an algorithm to OpenQASM 3.0.</description>

      <title>Sequential Entanglement-Swapping assisted by Quantum Protocol over Ethernet Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.18996</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.18996v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The integration of quantum communication protocols over Ethernet networks is proposed, showing the potential of combining classical and quantum technologies for efficient, scalable quantum networking. By leveraging the inherent strengths of Ethernet, such as addressing, MAC layer functionality, and scalability; we propose a practical framework to support the rigorous requirements of quantum communication. Some novel protocols given in this study enable reliable end-to-end quantum entanglement over Ethernet, ensuring the adaptability needed for implementing a stable quantum internet. Detailed time-delay analyses confirm that our protocols offer superior performance compared to existing methods, with total time delay kept within the decoherence threshold of qubits. These results suggest that our approach is well-suited for deployment in realistic environments, meeting both the immediate needs of quantum networking and laying the groundwork for future advances in data exchange and quantum computational capabilities.</description>

      <title>Thermodynamics of Hamiltonian anyons with applications to quantum heat engines</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.19019</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.19019v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The behavior of a collection of identical particles is intimately linked to the symmetries of their wavefunction under particle exchange. Topological anyons, arising as quasiparticles in low-dimensional systems, interpolate between bosons and fermions, picking up a complex phase when exchanged. Recent research has demonstrated that similar statistical behavior can arise with mixtures of bosonic and fermionic pairs, offering theoretical and experimental simplicity. We introduce an alternative implementation of such statistical anyons, based on promoting or suppressing the population of symmetric states via a symmetry generating Hamiltonian. The scheme has numerous advantages: anyonic statistics emerge in a single particle pair, extending straightforwardly to larger systems; the statistical properties can be dynamically adjusted; and the setup can be simulated efficiently. We show how exchange symmetry can be exploited to improve the performance of heat engines, and demonstrate a reversible work extraction cycle in which bosonization and fermionization replace compression and expansion strokes. Additionally, we investigate emergent thermal properties, including critical phenomena, in large statistical anyon systems.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2502.19022v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We use the Chu construction to functorially build BV-categories from duoidal categories, demonstrating that candidate models of BV-logic can be cofreely constructed from a fragment of a model of Retor\'e's sequencing operator. By using this construction to show that the strong Hyland envelope is a BV-category, we find a way to build a canonical model of spatio-temporal relationships between agents in spacetime from any symmetric monoidal category. The concrete physical interpretation of spacetime events in this model as intervention-context pairs resolves deficiencies in previous attempts to give a general categorical semantics to quantum supermaps.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2502.19033v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose a protocol for tridirectional quantum teleportation in continuous variables. A special feature of the protocol is the possibility to choose one of three scenarios: simultaneous exchange between three participants, exchange between any two participants, or the transfer of two states to a third participant. We use a cluster state in continuous variables as the main resource to realise tridirectional quantum teleportation. In the paper, we obtain several possible configurations of cluster states in continuous variables that can be used as the main resource. From the whole range of configurations, we have chosen those that realise the protocol with the smallest possible error.</description>

      <title>Cylindrical and M\"obius Quantum Codes for Asymmetric Pauli Errors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.19089</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.19089v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the implementation of quantum information systems, one type of Pauli error, such as phase-flip errors, may occur more frequently than others, like bit-flip errors. For this reason, quantum error-correcting codes that handle asymmetric errors are critical to mitigating the impact of such impairments. To this aim, several asymmetric quantum codes have been proposed. These include variants of surface codes like the XZZX and ZZZY surface codes, tailored to preserve quantum information in the presence of error asymmetries. In this work, we propose two classes of Calderbank, Shor and Steane (CSS) topological codes, referred to as cylindrical and M\"obius codes, particular cases of the fiber bundle family. Cylindrical codes maintain a fully planar structure, while M\"obius codes are quasi-planar, with minimal non-local qubit interactions. We construct these codes employing the algebraic chain complexes formalism, providing theoretical upper bounds for the logical error rate. Our results demonstrate that cylindrical and M\"obius codes outperform standard surface codes when using the minimum weight perfect matching (MWPM) decoder.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2502.19094v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The article addresses the important and relevant task of remote induction of quantum dynamic scenarios. This involves transferring such scenarios from donor atoms to a target atom. This induction is based on the enhancement of quantum transitions in the presence of multiple photons of the same transition. We use the quantum master equation for the Tavis-Cummings-Hubbard (TCH) model with multiple cavities connected to the target cavity via waveguides. The dependence of the efficiency and transfer of the scenario on the number of donor cavities, the number of atoms in them, and the bandwidth of the waveguides is investigated.</description>

Abstract: In this work, we propose a path integral-inspired formalism for computing the quantum thermal expectation values of spins, when subject to magnetic fields that can be time-dependent and can accommodate the presence of Heisenberg exchange interactions between the spins. This generalises the formalism presented in our previous work [Phys. Rev. Research 5, 043075 (2023)] and paves the way towards the realisation of large-scale atomistic simulations, for which this method should reveal its true efficiency gains, when compared to exact quantum methods. We compare our results with exact/numerical diagonalisation methods, where possible, to confirm the range of accuracy of our model.</description>

      <title>Network-assisted collective operations for efficient distributed quantum computing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.19118</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.19118v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose protocols for the distribution of collective quantum operations between remote quantum processing units (QPUs), a requirement for distributed quantum computing. Using only local operations and classical communication (LOCC), these protocols allow for collective multicontrolled and multitarget gates to be executed in network architectures similar to those used for high-performance computing. The types of gates that can be implemented following this scheme are discussed. The Bell pair cost for a single distributed multicontrolled gate is estimated, arriving to a single additional Bell pair over the theoretically optimal calculation with pre-shared entanglement, demonstrating better scalability when compared to current proposals based on entanglement swapping through a network, and bounds are calculated for general diagonal gates. A recipe is provided for the lumped distribution of gates such as arbitrarily-sized Toffoli and multicontrolled Z, and $R_{zz}(\theta)$ gates. Finally, we provide an exact implementation of a distributed Grover's search algorithm using this protocol to partition the circuit, with Bell pair cost growing linearly with the number of Grover iterations and the number of partitions.</description>

      <title>A perturbation theory for multi-time correlation functions in open quantum systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.19137</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.19137v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Dynamical maps are the principal subject of the open system theory. Formally, the dynamical map of a given open quantum system is a density matrix transformation that takes any initial state $\hat\rho_{t=0}$ and sends it to the state $\hat\rho_t$ at a later time $t&gt;0$. Physically, it encapsulates the system's evolution due to coupling with its environment.
  Hence, with its dynamical map methods, the theory provides a flexible and accurate framework for computing expectation values of system observables. However, expectation values -- or more generally, single-time correlation functions -- capture only the simplest aspects of a quantum system's dynamics. A complete characterization requires access to multi-time correlation functions as well.
  For closed systems, such correlations are well-defined, even though knowledge of the system's state alone is insufficient to determine them fully. In contrast, the standard dynamical map formalism for open systems does not account for multi-time correlations, as it is fundamentally limited to describing state evolution.
  Here, we extend the scope of open quantum system theory by developing a systematic perturbation theory for computing multi-time correlation functions.</description>

      <title>Oddities in the Entanglement Scaling of the Quantum Six-Vertex Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.19152</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.19152v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the entanglement properties of the Quantum Six-Vertex Model on a cylinder, focusing on the Shannon-Renyi entropy in the limit of Renyi order $n = \infty$. This entropy, calculated from the ground state amplitudes of the equivalent XXZ spin-1/2 chain, allows us to determine the Renyi entanglement entropy of the corresponding Rokhsar-Kivelson wavefunctions, which describe the ground states of certain conformal quantum critical points. Our analysis reveals a novel logarithmic correction to the expected entanglement scaling when the system size is odd. This anomaly arises from the geometric frustration of spin configurations imposed by periodic boundary conditions on odd-sized chains. We demonstrate that the scaling prefactor of this logarithmic term is directly related to the compactification radius of the low-energy bosonic field theory description, or equivalently, the Luttinger parameter. Thus, this correction provides a direct probe of the underlying Conformal Field Theory (CFT) describing the critical point. Our findings highlight the crucial role of system size parity in determining the entanglement properties of this model and offer insights into the interplay between geometry, frustration, and criticality.</description>

      <title>Digital-Analog quantum Rabi simulation in the Deep Strong Coupling Regime</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.19156</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.19156v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the quantum Rabi model (QRM) in the deep strong coupling (DSC) regime. To capture the full dynamics of the QRM in the DSC regime, we implemented single-qubit rotations combined with integrated digital steps and qubit-bosonic blocks. This approach leads to a paradigm known as digital analog quantum simulations (DAQSs). In this work, we review the encoding of QRM in the DSC regime through emerging paradigms of digital and analog techniques. Using DAQSs encoding, an efficient simulation can be performed on state-of-the-art circuit quantum electrodynamics platforms. Finally, we provide detailed information on the dynamics of the QRM in varity of parameter regions. We demonstrate the effectiveness of the DAQS paradigms in achieving prolonged coherent measurements during time evolution, even in the case of perturbative DSC regime dynamics. This proposal lays the groundwork for simulating complex many-body dynamics that involve bosonic modes.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2502.19179v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The non-analyticity induced by exceptional points (EPs) has manifestations not only in non-Hermitian but also in Hermitian systems. In this work, we focus on a minimal Hermitian bosonic Kitaev model to reveal the dynamical demonstration of EPs in a Hermitian system. It is shown that the EPs separate the parameter space into four regions, in which the systems are characterized by different equivalent Hamiltonians, including the harmonic oscillator, the inverted harmonic oscillator, and their respective counterparts. We employ the second-order intensity correlation to characterize a nonequilibrium quantum phase transition by calculating the time evolution of a trivial initial state. The results indicate that the concept of the EP can be detected in a small Hermitian bosonic system.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2502.19185v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Anderson localization physics features three fundamental types of eigenstates: extended, localized, and critical. Confirming the presence of critical states necessitates either advancing the analysis to the thermodynamic limit or identifying a universal mechanism which can determine rigorously these states. Here we report the unambiguous experimental realization of critical states, governed by a rigorous mechanism for exact quantum critical states, and further observe a generalized mechanism that quasiperiodic zeros in hopping couplings protect the critical states. Leveraging a superconducting quantum processor with up to 56 qubits, we implement a programmable mosaic model with tunable couplings and on-site potentials. By measuring time-evolved observables, we identify both delocalized dynamics and incommensurately distributed zeros in the couplings, which are the defining features of the critical states. We map the localized-to-critical phase transition and demonstrate that critical states persist until quasiperiodic zeros are removed by strong long-range couplings, confirming the generalized mechanism. Finally, we resolve the energy-dependent transition between localized and critical states, revealing the presence of anomalous mobility edges.</description>

      <title>Quantum Annealing Feature Selection on Light-weight Medical Image Datasets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.19201</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.19201v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the use of quantum computing algorithms on real quantum hardware to tackle the computationally intensive task of feature selection for light-weight medical image datasets. Feature selection is often formulated as a k of n selection problem, where the complexity grows binomially with increasing k and n. As problem sizes grow, classical approaches struggle to scale efficiently. Quantum computers, particularly quantum annealers, are well-suited for such problems, offering potential advantages in specific formulations. We present a method to solve larger feature selection instances than previously presented on commercial quantum annealers. Our approach combines a linear Ising penalty mechanism with subsampling and thresholding techniques to enhance scalability. The method is tested in a toy problem where feature selection identifies pixel masks used to reconstruct small-scale medical images. The results indicate that quantum annealing-based feature selection is effective for this simplified use case, demonstrating its potential in high-dimensional optimization tasks. However, its applicability to broader, real-world problems remains uncertain, given the current limitations of quantum computing hardware.</description>

      <title>A Hybrid Transformer Architecture with a Quantized Self-Attention Mechanism Applied to Molecular Generation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.19214</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.19214v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The success of the self-attention mechanism in classical machine learning models has inspired the development of quantum analogs aimed at reducing computational overhead. Self-attention integrates learnable query and key matrices to calculate attention scores between all pairs of tokens in a sequence. These scores are then multiplied by a learnable value matrix to obtain the output self-attention matrix, enabling the model to effectively capture long-range dependencies within the input sequence. Here, we propose a hybrid quantum-classical self-attention mechanism as part of a transformer decoder, the architecture underlying large language models (LLMs). To demonstrate its utility in chemistry, we train this model on the QM9 dataset for conditional generation, using SMILES strings as input, each labeled with a set of physicochemical properties that serve as conditions during inference. Our theoretical analysis shows that the time complexity of the query-key dot product is reduced from $\mathcal{O}(n^2 d)$ in a classical model to $\mathcal{O}(n^2\log d)$ in our quantum model, where $n$ and $d$ represent the sequence length and embedding dimension, respectively. We perform simulations using NVIDIA's CUDA-Q platform, which is designed for efficient GPU scalability. This work provides a promising avenue for quantum-enhanced natural language processing (NLP).</description>

      <title>Theoretical Limits of Protocols for Distinguishing Different Unravelings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.19268</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.19268v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The evolution of an open quantum system is often described by a master equation, which governs the dynamics of the statistical operator. The dynamics of a master equation can be expressed as an ensemble average over stochastic trajectories, known as stochastic unravelings, which correspond to different measurement schemes and provide a wavefunction-level description of the system's evolution. The fact that a given master equation admits multiple unravelings raises the question of whether these different stochastic descriptions can be operationally distinguished, as recently suggested. We analyze this possibility: we show that while unraveling-dependent quantities indeed differ at the mathematical level, as already known in the literature, they can only be computed once the measurement procedure implementing the unraveling is already given, rendering them inaccessible when the procedure is unknown.</description>

      <title>The Quantum Measurement Problem: A Review of Recent Trends</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.19278</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.19278v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Left on its own, a quantum state evolves deterministically under the Schr\"odinger Equation, forming superpositions. Upon measurement, however, a stochastic process governed by the Born rule collapses it to a single outcome. This dual evolution of quantum states$-$the core of the Measurement Problem$-$has puzzled physicists and philosophers for nearly a century. Yet, amid the cacophony of competing interpretations, the problem today is not as impenetrable as it once seemed. This paper reviews the current status of the Measurement Problem, distinguishing between what is well understood and what remains unresolved. We examine key theoretical approaches, including decoherence, many-worlds interpretation, objective collapse theories, hidden-variable theories, dualistic approaches, deterministic models, and epistemic interpretations. To make these discussions accessible to a broader audience, we also reference curated online resources that provide high-quality introductions to central concepts.</description>

      <title>Dynamical cluster-based optimization of tensor network algorithms for quantum circuit simulations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.19289</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.19289v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We optimize Matrix-Product State (MPS)-based algorithms for simulating quantum circuits with finite fidelity, specifically the Time-Evolving Block Decimation (TEBD) and the Density-Matrix Renormalization Group (DMRG) algorithms, by exploiting the irregular arrangement of entangling operations in circuits. We introduce a variation of the standard TEBD algorithm, we termed "cluster-TEBD", which dynamically arranges qubits into entanglement clusters, enabling the exact contraction of multiple circuit layers in a single time step. Moreover, we enhance the DMRG algorithm by introducing an adaptive protocol which analyzes the entanglement distribution within each circuit section to be contracted, dynamically adjusting the qubit grouping at each iteration. We analyze the performances of these enhanced algorithms in simulating both stabilizer and non-stabilizer random circuits, with up to $1000$ qubits and $100$ layers of Clifford and non-Clifford gates, and in simulating Shor's quantum algorithm with tens of thousands of layers. Our findings show that, even with reasonable computational resources per task, cluster-based approaches can significantly speed up simulations of large-sized quantum circuits and improve the fidelity of the final states.</description>

      <title>Simulating Work Extraction in a Dinuclear Quantum Battery Using a Variational Quantum Algorithm</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.19331</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.19331v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Understanding the thermodynamic properties of quantum systems is essential for developing energy-efficient quantum technologies. In this regard, this work explores the application of quantum computational methods to study the quantum properties and work extraction processes in a dinuclear quantum battery model. Our results demonstrate that variational quantum algorithms can reproduce key trends in experimental data, making it possible to analyze the effectiveness of the presented protocol in noisy environments and providing insights into the feasibility of quantum batteries in near-term devices. We have shown that the presence of a noisy environment hinders the accuracy of the evaluation of the amount of energy stored in the system. Additionally, we analyze the work extraction precision, revealing that although the system can store energy at room temperature, the protocol is highly precise only at low temperatures, and its accuracy at ambient conditions remains limited, compromising its usability.</description>

      <title>Using Gaussian Boson Samplers to Approximate Gaussian Expectation Problems</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.19336v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Gaussian Boson Sampling (GBS) have shown advantages over classical methods for performing some specific sampling tasks. To fully harness the computational power of GBS, there has been great interest in identifying their practical applications. In this study, we explore the use of GBS samples for computing a numerical approximation to the Gaussian expectation problem, that is to integrate a multivariate function against a Gaussian distribution. We propose two estimators using GBS samples, and show that they both can bring an exponential speedup over the plain Monte Carlo (MC) estimator. Precisely speaking, the exponential speedup is defined in terms of the guaranteed sample size for these estimators to reach the same level of accuracy $\epsilon$ and the same success probability $\delta$ in the $(\epsilon, \delta)$ multiplicative error approximation scheme. We prove that there is an open and nonempty subset of the Gaussian expectation problem space for such computational advantage.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2502.19344v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Stimulated Raman scattering (SRS) is a powerful method for label-free imaging and spectroscopy of materials. Recent experiments have shown that quantum-enhanced Raman scattering can surpass the shot noise limit and improve the sensitivity substantially. Here, we introduce a full theory of quantum-enhanced SRS based on the framework of quantum metrology. Our results enable the assessment of quantum-enhancements of arbitrary measurement strategies and identify optimal measurement observables that extract maximal information about the signal. We use this to identify the optimal employment of squeezed states in SRS, highlighting the potential to improve quantum gains beyond those observed in recent experiments. Our work establishes the theoretical foundation for understanding and approaching the quantum limits of precision in SRS, and provide a tool to discuss nonlinear spectroscopy and imaging more broadly.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2502.19345v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider the light potentials induced on an atom by a tightly-focused beam beyond the paraxial approximation. We calculate the light potentials of Gaussian and Laguerre-Gaussian beams driving the quadrupole 2S1/2 -&gt; 2D5/2 transition in 40Ca+. Longitudinal field components in the beam center cause spatially-dependent Rabi frequencies and AC Stark shifts, leading to unexpected qubit-motion coupling. We characterize single-qubit gate infidelities due to this effect with an analytical model and numerical simulation. We highlight parameters that affect the associated error, and find in general the errors are much smaller than typical requirements for fault-tolerant quantum computation.</description>

      <title>Extreme Events of Quantum Walks on Graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.19355</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.19355v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Due to the unitary evolution, quantum walks display different dynamical features from that of classical random walks. In contrast to this expectation, in this work, we show that extreme events can arise in unitary dynamics and its properties are qualitatively similar to that of random walks. We consider quantum walks on a ring lattice and a scale-free graph. Firstly, we obtain quantum version of flux-fluctuation relation and use this to define to extreme events on vertices of a graph as exceedences above the mean flux. The occurrence probability for extreme events on scale-free graphs displays a power-law with the degree of vertices, in qualitative agreement with corresponding classical random walk result. For both classical and quantum walks, the extreme event probability is larger for small degree nodes compared to hubs on the graph. Further, it is shown that extreme event probability scales with threshold used to define extreme events.</description>

      <title>Estimating the Percentage of GBS Advantage in Gaussian Expectation Problems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.19362</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.19362v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Gaussian Boson Sampling (GBS), which can be realized with a photonic quantum computing model, perform some special kind of sampling tasks. In [4], we introduced algorithms that use GBS samples to approximate Gaussian expectation problems. We found a non-empty open subset of the problem space where these algorithms achieve exponential speedup over the standard Monte Carlo (MC) method. This speedup is defined in terms of the guaranteed sample size to reach the same accuracy $\epsilon$ and success probability $\delta$ under the $(\epsilon, \delta)$ multiplicative error approximation scheme. In this paper, we enhance our original approach by optimizing the average photon number in the GBS distribution to match the specific Gaussian expectation problem. We provide updated estimates of the guaranteed sample size for these improved algorithms and quantify the proportion of problem space where they outperform MC. Numerical results indicate that the proportion of the problem space where our improved algorithms have an advantage is substantial, and the advantage gained is significant. Notably, for certain special cases, our methods consistently outperform MC across nearly 100\% of the problem space.</description>

      <title>Qmod: Expressive High-Level Quantum Modeling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.19368</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.19368v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum computing hardware is advancing at a rapid pace, yet the lack of high-level programming abstractions remains a serious bottleneck in the development of new applications. Widely used frameworks still rely on gate-level circuit descriptions, causing the algorithm's functional intent to become lost in low-level implementation details, and hindering flexibility and reuse. While various high-level quantum programming languages have emerged in recent years - offering a significant step toward higher abstraction - many still lack support for classical-like expression syntax, and native constructs for useful quantum algorithmic idioms. This paper presents Qmod, a high-level quantum programming language designed to capture algorithmic intent in natural terms while delegating implementation decisions to automation. Qmod introduces quantum numeric variables and expressions, including digital fixed-point arithmetic tuned for compact representations and optimal resource usage. Beyond digital encoding, Qmod also supports non-digital expression modes - phase and amplitude encoding - frequently exploited by quantum algorithms to achieve computational advantages. We describe the language's constructs, demonstrate practical usage examples, and outline future work on evaluating Qmod across a broader set of use cases.</description>

      <title>The Octo-Rail Lattice: a four-dimensional cluster state design</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.19393</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.19393v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Macronode cluster states are promising for fault-tolerant continuous-variable quantum computation, combining gate teleportation via homodyne detection with the Gottesman-Kitaev-Preskill code for universality and error correction. While the two-dimensional Quad-Rail Lattice offers flexibility and low noise, it lacks the dimensionality required for topological error correction codes essential for fault tolerance. This work presents a four-dimensional cluster state, termed the Octo-Rail Lattice, generated using time-domain multiplexing. This new macronode design combines the noise properties and flexibility of the Quad-Rail Lattice with the possibility to run various topological error correction codes including surface and color codes. Besides, the presented experimental setup is easily scalable and includes only static optical components allowing for a straight-forward implementation. Analysis demonstrates that the Octo-Rail Lattice, when combined with GKP qunaught states and the surface code, exhibits noise performance compatible with a fault-tolerant threshold of 9.75 dB squeezing. This ensures universality and fault-tolerance without requiring additional resources such as other non-Gaussian states or feed-forward operations. This finding implies that the primary challenge in constructing an optical quantum computer lies in the experimental generation of these highly non-classical states. Finally, a generalisation of the design to arbitrary dimensions is introduced, where the setup size scales linearly with the number of dimensions. This general framework holds promise for applications such as state multiplexing and state injection.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.19406</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.19406v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Generalized-bicycle (GB) quantum error-correcting codes have naturally redundant minimum-weight stabilizer generators. To use this redundancy, we constructed several short GB codes with relatively large dimensions, distances, and syndrome distances, also admitting fault-tolerant near-time-optimal syndrome measurement schedules. We simulated their performance both under phenomenological noise and standard circuit noise, using sliding window sequential decoding protocol covering $T\ge 1$ measurement rounds at a time, based on an in-house binary BP+OSD decoder. While true single-shot decoding ($T=1$) may suffer from a significant loss of accuracy, already two-shot ($T=2$) decoding gives nearly the same logical error rates as multi-shot with much larger $T$. Comparison with the same codes but redundant stabilizer generators dropped show significantly improved decoding accuracy for all $T\ge1$.</description>

      <title>Work and heat exchanged during sudden quenches of strongly coupled quantum systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.19418</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.19418v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: How should one define thermodynamic quantities (internal energy, work, heat, etc.) for quantum systems coupled to their environments strongly? We examine three (classically equivalent) definitions of a quantum system's internal energy under strong-coupling conditions. Each internal-energy definition implies a definition of work and a definition of heat. Our study focuses on quenches, common processes in which the Hamiltonian changes abruptly. In these processes, the first law of thermodynamics holds for each set of definitions by construction. However, we prove that only two sets obey the second law. We illustrate our findings using a simple spin model. Our results guide studies of thermodynamic quantities in strongly coupled quantum systems.</description>

      <title>From Staging to Insight: An Educational Path to Understanding Bell's Inequalities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.18543</link>

Abstract: Quantum Physics is a cornerstone of modern science and technology, yet a comprehensive approach to integrating it into school curricula and communicating its foundations to policymakers, industrial stakeholders, and the general public has yet to be established. In this paper, we discuss the rationale for introducing entanglement and Bell's inequalities to a non-expert audience, and how these topics have been presented in the exhibit "Dire l'indicibile" ("Speaking the Unspeakable"), as a part of the Italian Quantum Weeks project. This initiative aims to make quantum mechanics accessible to all, bridging the gap between complex scientific principles and public understanding. Our approach meets the challenge of simplifying quantum concepts without sacrificing their core meaning, specifically avoiding the risks of oversimplification and inaccuracy. Through interactive activities, including a card game demonstration and the staging of CHSH experiments, participants explore the fundamental differences between classical and quantum probabilistic predictions. They gain insights into the significance of Bell inequality verification experiments and the implications of the 2022 Nobel Prize in Physics. Preliminary results from both informal and formal assessment sessions are encouraging, suggesting the effectiveness of this approach.</description>

      <title>Quantum decoherence of gravitational waves</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.18560</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.18560v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The quantum nature of gravity remains an open question in fundamental physics, lacking experimental verification. Gravitational waves (GWs) provide a potential avenue for detecting gravitons, the hypothetical quantum carriers of gravity. However, by analogy with quantum optics, distinguishing gravitons from classical GWs requires the preservation of quantum coherence, which may be lost due to interactions with the cosmic environment causing decoherence. We investigate whether GWs retain their quantum state by deriving the reduced density matrix and evaluating decoherence, using an environmental model where a scalar field is conformally coupled to gravity. Our results show that quantum decoherence of GWs is stronger at lower frequencies and higher reheating temperatures. We identify a model-independent amplitude threshold below which decoherence is negligible, providing a fundamental limit for directly probing the quantum nature of gravity. In the standard cosmological scenario, the low energy density of the universe at the end of inflation leads to complete decoherence at the classical amplitude level of inflationary GWs. However, for higher energy densities, decoherence is negligible within a frequency window in the range $100\ {\rm Hz} \text{-} 10^8\ {\rm Hz}$, which depends on the reheating temperature. In a kinetic-dominated scenario, the dependence on reheating temperature weakens, allowing GWs to maintain quantum coherence above $10^7\ {\rm Hz}$.</description>

      <title>Strong Coupling of Nanomechanical Vibrations to Individual Two-Level Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.18587</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.18587v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Atomic-scale defects behaving as two-level systems (TLSs) are crucial to the physics of modern quantum devices. Here, we study interactions between individual TLS defects and the mechanical vibrations of a nanoelectromechanical systems (NEMS) resonator. By applying a mechanical strain, we tune individual TLS onto resonance with the NEMS and observe strong coupling. By adjusting phonon number, we reveal the nonlinear energy levels of the hybridized system and confirm single-phonon nonlinearity. We also observe fluctuations between hybridized and bare resonance states as the TLS fluctuates between on- and off-resonance. These quintessential quantum effects emerge directly from intrinsic material properties, without requiring external electromagnetic systems or complex quantum circuits. Our work establishes a platform for exploring and manipulating TLS-phonon interactions in the single-phonon regime.</description>

      <title>Formation of Complex Discrete Time Crystals with Ultracold Atoms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.18613</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.18613v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study discrete time crystal formation in a system driven periodically by an oscillating atomic mirror, consisting of two distinct ultracold atomic clouds in the presence of a gravitational field. The intra-species interactions are weak and attractive, while the inter-species interactions are infinitely strong and repulsive. The clouds are arranged in a one-dimensional stack, where the bottom cloud bounces on an oscillating atomic mirror, which effectively acts as a driving force for the upper cloud due to the infinite inter-species repulsion. Using a Jastrow-like variational ansatz for the many-body wavefunction, we show that sufficiently strong attractive intra-species interactions drive each subsystem to spontaneously break discrete time translation symmetry, resulting in the formation of a complex discrete time crystal evolving with a period different than the driving period. Since the bottom cloud serves as the effective periodic driving for the upper cloud, this leads to a cascade of spontaneous symmetry breaking. With increasing intra-species interactions, we first observe a pronounced effect of spontaneous time translation symmetry breaking in the upper cloud, followed by a similar effect in the lower atomic cloud.</description>

      <title>From Stars to Molecules: AI Guided Device-Agnostic Super-Resolution Imaging</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.18637</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.18637v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Super-resolution imaging has revolutionized the study of systems ranging from molecular structures to distant galaxies. However, existing deep-learning-based methods require extensive calibration and retraining for each imaging setup, limiting their practical deployment. We introduce a device-agnostic deep-learning framework for super-resolution imaging of point-like emitters that eliminates the need for calibration data or explicit knowledge of optical system parameters. Our model is trained on a diverse, numerically simulated dataset encompassing a broad range of imaging conditions, enabling robust generalization across different optical setups. Once trained, it reconstructs super-resolved images directly from a single resolution-limited camera frame with superior accuracy and computational efficiency compared to conventional methods. We experimentally validate our approach using a custom-built microscopy setup with ground truth emitter positions and demonstrate its versatility on astronomical and single-molecule localization microscopy datasets, achieving unprecedented resolution without prior information. Our findings establish a pathway toward universal, calibration-free super-resolution imaging, expanding its applicability across scientific disciplines.</description>

      <title>Quantum Machine Learning in Precision Medicine and Drug Discovery -- A Game Changer for Tailored Treatments?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.18639</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.18639v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The digitization of healthcare presents numerous challenges, including the complexity of biological systems, vast data generation, and the need for personalized treatment plans. Traditional computational methods often fall short, leading to delayed and sometimes ineffective diagnoses and treatments. Quantum Computing (QC) and Quantum Machine Learning (QML) offer transformative advancements with the potential to revolutionize medicine. This paper summarizes areas where QC promises unprecedented computational power, enabling faster, more accurate diagnostics, personalized treatments, and enhanced drug discovery processes. However, integrating quantum technologies into precision medicine also presents challenges, including errors in algorithms and high costs. We show that mathematically-based techniques for specifying, developing, and verifying software (formal methods) can enhance the reliability and correctness of QC. By providing a rigorous mathematical framework, formal methods help to specify, develop, and verify systems with high precision. In genomic data analysis, formal specification languages can precisely (1) define the behavior and properties of quantum algorithms designed to identify genetic markers associated with diseases. Model checking tools can systematically explore all possible states of the algorithm to (2) ensure it behaves correctly under all conditions, while theorem proving techniques provide mathematical (3) proof that the algorithm meets its specified properties, ensuring accuracy and reliability. Additionally, formal optimization techniques can (4) enhance the efficiency and performance of quantum algorithms by reducing resource usage, such as the number of qubits and gate operations. Therefore, we posit that formal methods can significantly contribute to enabling QC to realize its full potential as a game changer in precision medicine.</description>

      <title>Efficient optimization of neural network backflow for ab-initio quantum chemistry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.18843</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.18843v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The ground state of second-quantized quantum chemistry Hamiltonians is key to determining molecular properties. Neural quantum states (NQS) offer flexible and expressive wavefunction ansatze for this task but face two main challenges: highly peaked ground-state wavefunctions hinder efficient sampling, and local energy evaluations scale quartically with system size, incurring significant computational costs. In this work, we develop algorithmic improvements for optimizing these wave-functions which includes compact subspace construction, truncated local energy evaluations, improved stochastic sampling, and physics-informed modifications. We apply these improvements to the neural network backflow (NNBF) ansatz finding that they lead to improved accuracy and scalability. Using these techniques, we find NNBF surpasses traditional methods like CCSD and CCSD(T), outperform existing NQS approaches, and achieve competitive energies compared to state-of-the-art quantum chemistry methods such as HCI, ASCI, and FCIQMC. An ablation study highlights the contribution of each enhancement, showing significant gains in energy accuracy and computational efficiency. We also examine the dependence of NNBF expressiveness on the inverse participation ratio (IPR), observing that more delocalized states are generally harder to approximate.</description>

      <title>Measurement of Neutron Whispering Gallery States Using a Pulsed Neutron Beam</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.18936v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A neutron whispering gallery state is a quantum state localized on a material surface bound by the centrifugal force and the material potential. Precise measurements of such quantum states enable tests of quantum mechanics in non-inertial frames, characterization of the surface potential, and searches for hypothetical short-range interactions at the nanometer scale. We observed a neutron whispering gallery state on a $\mathrm{SiO}_2$ concave mirror using a pulsed cold neutron beam. The measured results agree with theoretical calculations within $1.9\%$ for the centrifugal acceleration $a \approx 7\times 10^7\,\mathrm{m/s^2}$, which is due to unmodeled deviations of the shape of the concave mirror edge from an ideal one. We found that the sensitivity itself was $1\times 10^{-4}$, which is two orders of magnitude better than the above agreement.</description>

      <title>Search for oscillating fundamental constants using a paired detector and vibrational spectroscopy</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.19248v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Ultralight dark matter (UDM) may manifest itself through oscillating fundamental constants of normal matter. These can be experimentally searched for by implementing two dissimilar oscillators producing a beat between their frequencies and analyzing the beat-frequency time series for the presence of any temporal oscillations. Typically, the time series of such a detector contains contributions from nonstationary noise. In order to reduce the influence of such noise we propose and demonstrate paired detectors: two nominally identical detectors whose signals are synchronously recorded. The cross-spectrum of the two individual beat time series is then analyzed for UDM signatures. This approach permits us to suppress spurious signals appearing in uncorrelated fashion in either detector. We furthermore demonstrate detectors that are based on a vibrational molecular transition, which are advantageous due to their larger sensitivity to oscillations of the nuclear masses. The analysis of 274 hours of data yielded improved bounds for the coupling constants of UDM to nuclear mass and to electron mass in the frequency ranges 10-500 Hz and 10-122 kHz, with improvement factors between 6 and 10. These bounds are currently the strongest. Similar bounds are obtained for the fine-structure constant. The present approach may be generalized to large ensembles of detectors.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2211.05005v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We introduce a general statistical learning theory for processes that take as input a classical random variable and output a quantum state. Our setting is motivated by the practical situation in which one desires to learn a quantum process governed by classical parameters that are out of one's control. This framework is applicable, for example, to the study of astronomical phenomena, disordered systems and biological processes not controlled by the observer. We provide an algorithm for learning with high probability in this setting with a finite amount of samples, even if the concept class is infinite. To do this, we review and adapt existing algorithms for shadow tomography and hypothesis selection, and combine their guarantees with the uniform convergence on the data of the loss functions of interest. As a by-product we obtain sufficient conditions for performing shadow tomography of classical-quantum states with a number of copies which depends on the dimension of the quantum register, but not on the dimension of the classical one. We give concrete examples of processes that can be learned in this manner, based on quantum circuits or physically motivated classes, such as systems governed by Hamiltonians with random perturbations or data-dependent phase-shifts.</description>

      <title>Implementation and Learning of Quantum Hidden Markov Models</title>

      <description>arXiv:2212.03796v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this article, we use the theory of quantum channels and open quantum systems to provide an efficient unitary characterization of a class of stochastic generators known as quantum hidden Markov models (QHMMs). By utilizing the unitary characterization, we demonstrate that any QHMM can be implemented as a quantum circuit with mid-circuit measurement. We prove that QHMMs are more compact and more expressive definitions of stochastic process languages compared to the equivalent classical hidden Markov models (HMMs). Starting with the formulation of QHMMs as quantum channels, we employ Stinespring's construction to represent these models as unitary quantum circuits with mid-circuit measurement. By utilizing the unitary parameterization of QHMMs, we define a formal QHMM learning model. The model formalizes the empirical distributions of target stochastic process languages, defines hypothesis space of quantum circuits, and introduces an empirical stochastic divergence measure - hypothesis fitness - as a success criterion for learning. We demonstrate that the learning model has a smooth search landscape due to the continuity of Stinespring's dilation. The smooth mapping between the hypothesis and fitness spaces enables the development of efficient heuristic and gradient descent learning algorithms.
  We propose two practical learning algorithms for QHMMs. The first algorithm is a hyperparameter-adaptive evolutionary search. The second algorithm learns the QHMM as a quantum ansatz circuit using a multi-parameter non-linear optimization technique.</description>

      <title>Wavefunction branching: when you can't tell pure states from mixed states</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.04494</link>
      <description>arXiv:2308.04494v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We propose a definition of wavefunction "branchings": quantum superpositions which can't be feasibly distinguished from the corresponding mixed state, even under time evolution. Our definition is largely independent of interpretations, requiring only that it takes many more local gates to swap branches than to distinguish them. We give several examples of states admitting such branch decompositions. Under our definition, we argue that attempts to get relative-phase information between branches will fail without frequent active error correction, that branches are effectively the opposite of good error-correcting codes, that branches effectively only grow further apart in time under natural evolution, that branches tend to absorb spatial entanglement, that branching is stronger in the presence of conserved quantities, and that branching implies effective irreversibility. Identifying these branch decompositions in many-body quantum states could shed light on the emergence of classicality, provide a metric for experimental tests at the quantum/ classical boundary, and allow for longer numerical time evolution simulations. We see this work as a generalization of the basic ideas of environmentally-induced decoherence to situations with no clear system/ environment split.</description>

Abstract: Quantum machine learning (QML) is a cross-disciplinary subject made up of two of the most exciting research areas: quantum computing and classical machine learning (ML), with ML and artificial intelligence (AI) being projected as the first fields that will be impacted by the rise of quantum machines. Quantum computers are being used today in drug discovery, material &amp; molecular modelling and finance. In this work, we discuss some upcoming active new research areas in application of quantum machine learning (QML) in finance. We discuss certain QML models that has become areas of active interest in the financial world for various applications. We use real world financial dataset and compare models such as qGAN (quantum generative adversarial networks) and QCBM (quantum circuit Born machine) among others, using simulated environments. For the qGAN, we define quantum circuits for discriminators and generators and show promises of future quantum advantage via QML in finance.</description>

      <title>Hamiltonian Learning via Shadow Tomography of Pseudo-Choi States</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.13020</link>
      <description>arXiv:2308.13020v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We introduce a new approach to learn Hamiltonians through a resource that we call the pseudo-Choi state, which encodes the Hamiltonian in a state using a procedure that is analogous to the Choi-Jamiolkowski isomorphism. We provide an efficient method for generating these pseudo-Choi states by querying a time evolution unitary of the form $e^{-iHt}$ and its inverse, and show that for a Hamiltonian with $M$ terms the Hamiltonian coefficients can be estimated via classical shadow tomography within error $\epsilon$ in the $2$-norm using $\widetilde{O}\left(\frac{M}{t^2\epsilon^2}\right)$ queries to the state preparation protocol, where $t \le \frac{1}{2\left\lVert H \right\rVert}$. We further show an alternative approach that eschews classical shadow tomography in favor of quantum mean estimation that reduces this cost (at the price of many more qubits) to $\widetilde{O}\left(\frac{M}{t\epsilon}\right)$. Additionally, we show that in the case where one does not have access to the state preparation protocol, the Hamiltonian can be learned using $\widetilde{O}\left(\frac{\alpha^4M}{\epsilon^2}\right)$ copies of the pseudo-Choi state. The constant $\alpha$ depends on the norm of the Hamiltonian, and the scaling in terms of $\alpha$ can be improved quadratically if using pseudo-Choi states of the normalized Hamiltonian. Finally, we show that our learning process is robust to errors in the resource states and to errors in the Hamiltonian class. Specifically, we show that if the true Hamiltonian contains more terms than we believe are present in the reconstruction, then our methods give an indication that there are Hamiltonian terms that have not been identified and will still accurately estimate the known terms in the Hamiltonian.</description>

      <title>Clifford operations and homological codes for rotors and oscillators</title>

Abstract: We develop quantum information processing primitives for the planar rotor, the state space of a particle on a circle. By interpreting rotor wavefunctions as periodically identified wavefunctions of a harmonic oscillator, we determine the group of bosonic Gaussian operations inherited by the rotor. This $n$-rotor Clifford group, $\text{U}(1)^{n(n+1)/2} \rtimes \text{GL}_n(\mathbb{Z})$, is represented by continuous $\text{U}(1)$ gates generated by polynomials quadratic in angular momenta, as well as discrete $\text{GL}_n(\mathbb Z)$ momentum sign-flip and sum gates. We classify homological rotor error-correcting codes [arXiv:2303.13723] and various rotor states based on equivalence under Clifford operations.
  Reversing direction, we map homological rotor codes and rotor Clifford operations back into oscillators by interpreting occupation-number states as rotor states of non-negative angular momentum. This yields new multimode homological bosonic codes protecting against dephasing and changes in occupation number, along with their corresponding encoding and decoding circuits. In particular, we show how to non-destructively measure the oscillator phase using conditional occupation-number addition and post selection. We also outline several rotor and oscillator varieties of the GKP-stabilizer codes [arXiv:1903.12615].</description>

      <title>Device independent security of quantum key distribution from monogamy-of-entanglement games</title>

      <description>arXiv:2312.04079v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We analyse two party non-local games whose predicate requires Alice and Bob to generate matching bits, and their three party extensions where a third player receives all inputs and is required to output a bit that matches that of the original players. We propose a general device independent quantum key distribution protocol for the subset of such non-local games that satisfy a monogamy-of-entanglement property characterised by a gap in the maximum winning probability between the bipartite and tripartite versions of the game. This gap is due to the optimal strategy for two players requiring entanglement, which due to its monogamy property cannot be shared with any additional players. Based solely on the monogamy-of-entanglement property, we provide a simple proof of information theoretic security of our protocol. Lastly, we numerically optimize the finite and asymptotic secret key rates of our protocol using the magic square game as an example, for which we provide a numerical bound on the maximal tripartite quantum winning probability which closely matches the bipartite classical winning probability. Further, we show that our protocol is robust for depolarizing noise up to about $2.2\%$, providing the first such bound for general attacks for magic square based quantum key distribution.</description>

Abstract: Distributed quantum computing (DQC) provides a way to scale quantum computers using multiple quantum processing units (QPU) connected through quantum communication links. In this paper, we have built a distributed quantum computing simulator and used the simulator to investigate quantum algorithms such as the quantum Fourier transform, quantum phase estimation, quantum amplitude estimation, and generation of probability distribution in DQC. The simulator can be used to easily generate and execute distributed quantum circuits, obtain and benchmark DQC parameters such as the fidelity of the algorithm and the number of entanglement generation steps, and use dynamic circuits in a distributed setting to improve results. We show the applicability of dynamic quantum circuits in DQC, where mid-circuit measurements, local operations, and classical communication are used in place of noisy inter-processor (non-local) quantum gates</description>

      <description>arXiv:2402.18895v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We derive a generalization of Ehrenfest theorem valid for open quantum systems. From this result, we identify three contributions to the evolution of expected values: i) the explicit time dependence of the observable, ii) the incompatibility between the observable and an operator which plays the role of an effective Hamiltonian, and iii) entropy changes. Considering the local Hamiltonian as the observable, and adopting a specific interpretation of the nature of thermal interactions, we obtain an alternative version of the first law of thermodynamics. Within this framework, we show that in some cases the power performed by the system can be considered as a quantum observable. As an application, the pure dephasing process is reinterpreted from this perspective.</description>

Abstract: The Variational Quantum Eigensolver (VQE) is a promising algorithm for future Noisy Intermediate-Scale Quantum (NISQ) devices to simulate chemical systems. In this paper, we consider the classical simulation of the iterative Qubit Coupled Cluster (iQCC) ansatz. To this end, we implement a multi-threaded sparse wave function simulator and simulate iQCC circuits with up to 80 qubits and 980 entanglers to compare our results to experimental values and previous approximate simulations. In contrast to previous iQCC simulations, e.g., for computing the emission spectra of a phosphorescent emitting material, our approach features a variational guarantee, such that the resulting energies are true upper bounds on the exact energies. Additionally, our method is two orders of magnitude more memory efficient because it does not store the transformed Hamiltonians. Our theoretical analysis also enables the construction of ans\"atze with a limited number of nonzero amplitudes, for which our simulator can obtain exact results.This will allow one to generate complex benchmarking instances for future NISQ devices and simulators.</description>

      <title>Schwinger-Keldysh nonperturbative field theory of open quantum systems beyond the Markovian regime: Application to spin-boson and spin-chain-boson models</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.00765v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Open quantum systems with many interacting degrees of freedom pose a formidable challenge for presently available theoretical methods, especially when dissipative environment imposes non-Markovian dynamics on them with memory effects and revival of genuine quantum properties. Even the archetypical spin-boson model, where a single spin-1/2 interacts with an infinite bosonic bath, requires switching between methods for different choice of system and bath parameters. Here, we construct a field-theoretic framework as a single methodology that can handle many mutually interacting quantum spins of arbitrary value S, spatial dimensionality, system-bath coupling, bath temperature and spectral properties of the bath. Our framework combines Schwinger-Keldysh field theory (SKFT) with two-particle irreducible (2PI) action resumming a class of Feynman diagrams to an infinite order originating from 1/N expansion, where N is the number of Schwinger bosons to which the spin is mapped. Remarkably, the SKFT+2PI approach closely tracks numerically exact benchmarks for spin-boson in the non-Markovian regime obtained from hierarchical equations of motion or tensor network methods. Furthermore, we demonstrate the ability of our SKFT+2PI framework to compute two-spin correlators of an antiferromagnetic quantum spin chain whose edge spins are coupled to a set of three bosonic baths (one for each spin component) at different temperatures. The favorable numerical cost of solving integro-differential equations produced by SKFT+2PI framework with increasing number of spins, time steps or spatial dimensionality makes it a promising route for simulation of driven-dissipative systems in quantum computing or quantum magnonics and quantum spintronics in the presence of a single or multiple dissipative environments.</description>

Abstract: This paper demonstrates the integration of Reinforcement Learning (RL) into quantum transpiling workflows, significantly enhancing the synthesis and routing of quantum circuits. By employing RL, we achieve near-optimal synthesis of Linear Function, Clifford, and Permutation circuits, up to 9, 11 and 65 qubits respectively, while being compatible with native device instruction sets and connectivity constraints, and orders of magnitude faster than optimization methods such as SAT solvers. We also achieve significant reductions in two-qubit gate depth and count for circuit routing up to 133 qubits with respect to other routing heuristics such as SABRE. We find the method to be efficient enough to be useful in practice in typical quantum transpiling pipelines. Our results set the stage for further AI-powered enhancements of quantum computing workflows.</description>

      <title>Provable Optimality of the Square-Tooth Atomic Frequency Comb Quantum Memory</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.01769v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Atomic frequency comb (AFC) quantum memories are a promising technology for quantum repeater networks because they enable multi-mode, long-time, and high-fidelity storage of photons with on-demand retrieval. The optimization of the retrieval efficiency of an AFC memory is important because it strongly impacts the entanglement distribution rate in quantum networks. Despite initial theoretical analyses and recent experimental demonstrations, a rigorous proof of the universally optimal configuration for the highest AFC retrieval efficiency has not been presented. In this paper we present a simple analytical proof which shows that the optimized square tooth offers the highest retrieval efficiency among all tooth shapes, under the physical constraint of finite optical depth of an atomic ensemble. The optimality still holds when the non-zero background absorption and the finite optical linewidth of atoms are considered. We further compare square, Lorentzian and Gaussian tooth shapes to reinforce the practical advantage of the square-tooth AFC in retrieval efficiency. Our proof lays rigorous foundation for the recipe of creating optimal AFC under realistic experimental conditions.</description>

      <title>What is my quantum computer good for? Quantum capability learning with physics-aware neural networks</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.05636v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Quantum computers have the potential to revolutionize diverse fields, including quantum chemistry, materials science, and machine learning. However, contemporary quantum computers experience errors that often cause quantum programs run on them to fail. Until quantum computers can reliably execute large quantum programs, stakeholders will need fast and reliable methods for assessing a quantum computer's capability-i.e., the programs it can run and how well it can run them. Previously, off-the-shelf neural network architectures have been used to model quantum computers' capabilities, but with limited success, because these networks fail to learn the complex quantum physics that determines real quantum computers' errors. We address this shortcoming with a new quantum-physics-aware neural network architecture for learning capability models. Our architecture combines aspects of graph neural networks with efficient approximations to the physics of errors in quantum programs. This approach achieves up to $\sim50\%$ reductions in mean absolute error on both experimental and simulated data, over state-of-the-art models based on convolutional neural networks.</description>

Abstract: Quantum thermodynamics aims to explore quantum features to enhance energy conversion beyond classical limits. While significant progress has been made, the understanding of caloric potentials in quantum systems remains incomplete. In this context, this study focuses on deriving general expressions for these caloric potentials, by developing a quantum Maxwell relationship obtained from a thermal average form of the Ehrenfest theorem. Our results recover the classical cases and also reveal that the isothermal entropy change can be related to genuine quantum correlations in the system. Thus, this work aims to contribute to the understanding of the caloric behavior of quantum systems and their potential implication in caloric devices.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.18041v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We explicitly construct unique non-equilibrium steady state (NESS) of Lindblad master equation characterized by a Gibbs ensemble $\rho_{\text{NESS}} \propto e^{-\beta \tilde{H}}$, where the effective hamiltonian $\tilde{H}$ is an element in the center of the commutant algebra $\mathcal{C}$ of the original hamiltonian. Specifically, if $\mathcal{C}$ is Abelian, then $\tilde{H}$ consists only of $U(1)$ conserved charges of the original Hamiltonian. When the original Hamiltonian has multiple charges, it is possible to couple them with bathes at different temperature respectively, but still leads to an equilibrium state. Multiple steady states arise if the number of bathes is less than the number of charges. To access the Gibbs NESS, the jump operators need to be properly chosen to fulfill quantum detailed balance condition (qDBC). These jump operators are ladder operators for $\tilde{H}$ and jump process they generate form a vertex-weighted directed acyclic graph (wDAG). By studying the XX model and Fredkin model, we showcase how the Gibbs state emerges as an equilibrium steady state.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.18431v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We introduce and explore patterned lattices consisting of coupled isospectral cells that vary across the lattice. The isospectrality of the cells is encapsulated in the phase that characterizes each cell and can be designed at will such that the lattice exhibits a certain phase gradient. Focusing on the specific example of a constant phase gradient on a given finite phase interval we show that the resulting band structure consists of three distinct energy domains with two crossover edges marking the transition from single center localized to delocalized states and vice versa. The characteristic localization length emerges due to a competition of the involved phase gradient on basis of a local rotation and the coupling between the cells which allows us to illuminate the underlying localization mechanism and its evolution. The fraction of localized versus delocalized eigenstates can be tuned by changing the phase gradient between the cells of the lattice. We outline the perspectives of investigation of this novel class of isospectrally patterned lattices.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.00721v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Bosonic two-mode squeezed states are paradigmatic entangled Gaussian states that have wide utility in quantum information and metrology. Here, we show that the basic structure of these states can be generalized to arbitrary bipartite quantum systems in a manner that allows simultaneous, Heisenberg-limited estimation of two independent parameters for finite-dimensional systems. Further, we show that these general states can always be stabilized by a relatively simple Markovian dissipative process. In the specific case where the two subsystems are ensembles of two-level atoms or spins, our generalized states define a notion of two-mode spin squeezing that is valid beyond the Gaussian limit and that enables true multi-parameter estimation. We discuss how generalized Ramsey measurements allow one to reach the two-parameter quantum Cramer-Rao bound, and how the dissipative preparation scheme is compatible with current experiments.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.20827v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate the quantization of Kramers-Kronig detection technique initially developped for classical optical communications. It consists in mixing the unknown field with a strong monochromatic local oscillator on an unbalanced beamsplitter. A single output of the beamsplitter undergoes a direct detection of the optical intensity by means of a single photodiode. When the measured output verifies signal processing constraints, namely, the minimal phase and the single sideband constraints, Kramers-Kronig detection reconstructs the phase of the signal from the intensity measurements via a digitally computed Hilbert transform. The local oscillator being known, Kramers-Kronig detection allows for reconstructing the quadratures of the unknown field. We show that this result holds in the quantum regime up to first order in the local oscillator amplitude and thus that Kramers-Kronig detection acts as a coherent detection able to measure both quadratures, making it a Gaussian measurement similar to double homodyne detection. We also study in details the phase information measured by Kramers-Kronig detection for bosonic coherent states, monomode pure states and mixed states. Finally, we propose and investigate a spectral tomography protocol for single-photon states that is inspired by Kramers-Kronig detection and relies on a spectral engineering of the single-photon.</description>

      <title>Capacities of quantum Markovian noise for large times</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.00116v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Given a quantum Markovian noise model, we study the maximum dimension of a classical or quantum system that can be stored for arbitrarily large time. We show that, unlike the fixed time setting, in the limit of infinite time, the classical and quantum capacities are characterized by efficiently computable properties of the peripheral spectrum of the quantum channel. In addition, the capacities are additive under tensor product, which implies in the language of Shannon theory that the one-shot and the asymptotic i.i.d. capacities are the same. We also provide an improved algorithm for computing the structure of the peripheral subspace of a quantum channel, which might be of independent interest.</description>

      <title>Quantum cloning transformation unlocks the potential of W class of states in a quantum secure direct communication protocol</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.06722v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In a controlled quantum secure direct communication (Controlled QSDC) protocol between three parties, the sender sends the encoded secured message to one of the two receivers, which can be decoded only when the other receiver agrees to cooperate. A lot of studies have been done on it using the three-qubit GHZ state, and only a few works have involved the W state. In this work, we introduce a controlled QSDC protocol exploiting a three-qubit W class of state shared between three parties, Alice (Sender), Bob (Controller), and Charlie (Receiver). In the proposed protocol, the shared state parameters and the secret are linked in such a way that it is very difficult to factor them. We will show that these parameters can be factored out easily if the receiver uses a quantum cloning machine (QCM) and thus can retrieve the secret. We find that the protocol is probabilistic and have calculated the probability of success of the protocol. Further, we establish the relation between the success probability and the efficiency of the QCM. In general, we find that the efficiency of the constructed QCM is greater than or equal to $\frac{1}{3}$, but we have shown that its efficiency can be enhanced when the parameters of the shared state are used as the parameters of the QCM. Moreover, we derived the linkage between the probability of success and the amount of entanglement in the shared W class of state. We analyzed the obtained result and found that even a less entangled W class of state can also play a vital role in the proposed controlled QSDC scheme.</description>

      <title>Entanglement Measures for Many-Body Quantum Systems: Limitations and New Approaches</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.10272v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this research, the entanglement within two entangled n-qubit systems is analyzed using the one-tangle, two-tangle, and {\pi}-tangle. The findings indicate that for certain quantum states, such as the generalized W state, where the probability coefficients depend on the number of qubits, increasing the number of particles causes these measures to approach zero, with the monogamy of entanglement converging to equality. This implies that for quantum states whose probability coefficients are dependent on the number of qubits, the one-tangle and {\pi}-tangle become ineffective in capturing entanglement as the system size increases. To address this, we introduced three alternative measures: the sum of two-tangles, the sum of squared one-tangles, and the generalized residual entanglement. Unlike the one-tangle and {\pi}-tangle, these measures do not diminish to zero as the number of particles increases. Furthermore, we proposed a strong monogamy of entanglement that does not converge to equality as the number of particles grows.</description>

      <title>Entanglement-induced exponential advantage in amplitude estimation via state matrixization</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.13721v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Estimating quantum amplitude, or the overlap between two quantum states, is a fundamental task in quantum computing and underpins numerous quantum algorithms. In this work, we introduce a novel algorithmic framework for quantum amplitude estimation by transforming pure states into their matrix forms (Matrixization) and encoding them into non-diagonal blocks of density operators and diagonal blocks of unitary operators. Utilizing the construction details of state preparation circuits, we systematically reconstruct amplitude estimation algorithms within the novel matrixization framework through a technique known as channel block encoding. Compared with the standard approach, amplitude estimation through matrixization can have a different complexity that depends on the entanglement properties of the two quantum states. Specifically, our new algorithm can have exponentially smaller gate complexity when one of the two quantum states is prepared by a linear-depth quantum circuit that is below maximal entanglement under a certain bi-partition and the other state is maximally entangled. We later generalize this result to broader regimes and discuss implications. Our results demonstrate that the near-optimal performance of the standard amplitude estimation algorithm can be surpassed in specific cases.</description>

      <title>Deviations from Geodesic Evolutions and Energy Waste on the Bloch Sphere</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.14230v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In optimal quantum-mechanical evolutions, motion can occur along non-predetermined paths of shortest length in an optimal time. Alternatively, optimal evolutions can happen along predefined paths with no waste of energy resources and 100% speed efficiency. Unfortunately, realistic physical scenarios typically result in less-than-ideal evolutions. In this paper, we study different families of sub-optimal qubit Hamiltonians, both stationary and time-varying, for which the so-called geodesic efficiency and the speed efficiency of the corresponding quantum evolutions are less than one. Furthermore, after proposing an alternative hybrid efficiency measure constructed out of the two previously mentioned efficiency quantifiers, we provide illustrative examples where the average departures from time-optimality and 100% speed efficiency are globally captured over a limited time period. In particular, thanks to this hybrid measure, quantum evolutions are partitioned in four categories: Geodesic unwasteful, nongeodesic unwasteful, geodesic wasteful and, lastly, nongeodesic wasteful. Finally, we discuss Hamiltonians specified by magnetic field configurations, both stationary and nonstationary, yielding optimal hybrid efficiency (that it, both time-optimality and 100% speed efficiency) over a finite time interval.</description>

      <title>Remote Entangling Gates for Spin Qubits in Quantum Dots using a Charge-Sensitive Superconducting Coupler</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.08915v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We propose a method to realize microwave-activated CZ gates between two remote spin qubits in quantum dots using a charge-sensitive superconducting coupler. The qubits are longitudinally coupled to the coupler, so that the transition frequency of the coupler depends on the logical qubit states; a capacitive network model using first-quantized charge operators is developed to illustrate this. Driving the coupler transition then implements a conditional phase shift on the qubits. Two pulsing schemes are investigated: a rapid, off-resonant pulse with constant amplitude, and a pulse with envelope engineering that incorporates dynamical decoupling to mitigate charge noise. We develop non-Markovian time-domain simulations to accurately model gate performance in the presence of $1/f^\beta$ charge noise. Simulation results indicate that a CZ gate fidelity exceeding 90% is possible with realistic parameters and noise models.</description>

Abstract: Superconducting circuits provide a versatile and controllable platform for studies of fundamental quantum phenomena as well as for quantum technology applications. A conventional technique to read out the state of a quantum circuit or to characterize its properties is based on RF measurement schemes. Here we demonstrate a simple DC measurement of a thermal spectrometer to investigate properties of a superconducting circuit, in this proof-of-concept experiment a coplanar waveguide resonator. A fraction of the microwave photons in the resonator is absorbed by an on-chip bolometer, resulting in a measurable temperature rise. By monitoring the DC signal of the thermometer due to this process, we are able to determine the resonance frequency and the lineshape (quality factor) of the resonator. The demonstrated scheme, which is a simple DC measurement, offers a wide frequency band potentially reaching up to 200 GHz, far exceeding that of the typical RF spectrometer. Moreover, the thermal measurement yields a highly frequency independent reference level of the Lorentzian absorption signal. In the low power regime, the measurement is fully calibration-free. Our technique offers an alternative spectrometer for quantum circuits.</description>

      <title>Quantum Advantage in Distributed Sensing with Noisy Quantum Networks</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.17089v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: It is critically important to analyze the achievability of quantum advantage under realistic imperfections. In this work, we show that quantum advantage in distributed sensing can be achieved with noisy quantum networks which can only distribute noisy entangled states. We derive a closed-form expression of the quantum Fisher information (QFI) for estimating the average of local parameters using GHZ-diagonal probe states, an important distributed sensing prototype. From the QFI we obtain the necessary condition to achieve quantum advantage over the optimal local sensing strategy, which can also serve as an optimization-free entanglement detection criterion for multipartite states. In addition, we prove that genuine multipartite entanglement is neither necessary nor sufficient through explicit examples of depolarized and dephased GHZ states. We further explore the impacts from imperfect local entanglement generation and local measurement constraint, and our results imply that the quantum advantage is more robust against quantum network imperfections than local operation errors. Finally, we demonstrate that the probe state with potential for quantum advantage in distributed sensing can be prepared by a three-node quantum network using practical protocol stacks through simulations with SeQUeNCe, an open-source, customizable quantum network simulator.</description>

      <title>Optimal continuity bound for the von Neumann entropy under energy constraints</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.02686v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Using techniques proposed in [Sason, IEEE Trans. Inf. Th. 59, 7118 (2013)] and [Becker, Datta and Jabbour, IEEE Trans. Inf. Th. 69, 4128 (2023)], and based on the results from the latter, we construct a globally optimal continuity bound for the von Neumann entropy. This bound applies to any state under energy constraints imposed by arbitrary Hamiltonians that satisfy the Gibbs hypothesis. This completely solves the problem of finding an optimal continuity bound for the von Neumann entropy in this setting, previously known only for pairs of states that are sufficiently close to each other. Our main technical result, a globally optimal semicontinuity bound for the von Neumann entropy under general energy constraints, leads to this continuity bound. To prove it, we also derive an optimal Fano-type inequality for random variables with a countably infinite alphabet and a general constraint, as well as optimal semicontinuity and continuity bounds for the Shannon entropy in the same setting. In doing so, we improve the results derived in [Becker, Datta and Jabbour, IEEE Trans. Inf. Th. 69, 4128 (2023)].</description>

Abstract: We develop a systematic perturbative framework to engineer an arbitrary target Hamiltonian in the Floquet phase space of a periodically driven oscillator based on Floquet-Magnus expansion. The high-order errors in the engineered Floquet Hamiltonian are mitigated by adding high-order driving potentials perturbatively. We introduce a transformation method that allows us to obtain an analytical expression of the leading-order correction drive for engineering a target Hamiltonian with discrete rotational and chiral symmetries in phase space. We also provide a numerically efficient procedure to calculate high-order correction drives and apply it to engineer the target Hamiltonian with degenerate eigenstates of multi-component cat states that are important for fault-tolerant hardware-efficiency bosonic quantum computation.</description>

      <title>Simulating quantum emitters in arbitrary photonic environments using FDTD: beyond the semi-classical regime</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.16118</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.16118v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We propose a numerical algorithm that integrates quantum two-level systems (TLSs) into the finite-difference time-domain (FDTD) framework for simulating quantum emitters in arbitrary 3D photonic environments. Conventional methods struggle with these systems due to their semi-classical nature and spurious self-interactions that arise when a TLS is driven by its own radiation field. We address these issues by determining the correct electric field for driving the TLS, as well as the current source used in FDTD for modeling photon emission. Our method, focusing on single-excitation states, employs a total field-incident field (TF-IF) technique to eliminate self-interactions, enabling precise simulations of photon emission and scattering. The algorithm also successfully models complex phenomena such as resonant energy transfer, superradiance, and vacuum Rabi splitting. This powerful computational tool is expected to substantially advance research in nanophotonics, quantum physics, and beyond.</description>

      <title>RE-completeness of entangled constraint satisfaction problems</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.21223v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Constraint satisfaction problems (CSPs) are a natural class of decision problems where one must decide whether there is an assignment to variables that satisfies a given formula. Schaefer's dichotomy theorem, and its extension to all alphabets due to Bulatov and Zhuk, shows that CSP languages are either efficiently decidable, or NP-complete. It is possible to extend CSP languages to quantum assignments using the formalism of nonlocal games. Due to the equality of complexity classes MIP$^\ast=$ RE, general succinctly-presented entangled CSPs are RE-complete. In this work, we show that a wide range of NP-complete CSPs become RE-complete in this setting, including all boolean CSPs, such as 3SAT, as well as $3$-colouring. This also implies that these CSP languages remain undecidable even when not succinctly presented.
  To show this, we work in the weighted algebra framework introduced by Mastel and Slofstra, where synchronous strategies for a nonlocal game are represented by tracial states on an algebra. Along the way, we improve the subdivision technique in order to be able to separate constraints in the CSP while preserving constant soundness, construct commutativity gadgets for all boolean CSPs, and show a variety of relations between the different ways of presenting CSPs as games.</description>

      <title>Quantum Circuits, Feature Maps, and Expanded Pseudo-Entropy: A Categorical Theoretic Analysis of Encoding Real-World Data into a Quantum Computer</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.22084</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.22084v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This manuscripts proposes a new and novel numerical method to the determine the efficacy of an encoding scheme to map real-world data into a quantum circuit. The method calculates the Shannon entropy of each of the data points from a point-cloud, hence, samples from an embedded manifold, and calculates the expanded concept of pseudo-entropy applied to each respective quantum operator that comes from a given quantum feature map, and not the density operator. In the recent decade, there has been a continuous advancement of translating machine learning into a quantum circuit with many promising results. For quantum machine learning, a major underlying question is how to encode real-world data into a quantum circuit without losing information and adding noise. A few notable methods derived are expressibility, where the distribution of the output of states from the circuit are compared against the Haar probability measure with information theoretic techniques, and expressivity, a method that maps the expectation of a quantum circuit to the space of complex functions via a partial Fourier series, noting that more intricate the function the more expressive, and using the symmetry embedded within the data to derive a quantum feature map. The proposed pseudo-entropy method is discussed to and empirically shown to generalize these methods. Furthermore, this method is argued to also generalize symmetric quantum feature maps. The discussions and arguments are a reasonable basis for understanding the connections but require deeper mathematical analysis.</description>

      <title>Entangling distant systems via universal nonadiabatic passage</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.23699v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we derive universal nonadiabatic passages in a general $M+N$-dimensional discrete system, where $M$ and $N$ denote the degrees of freedom for the assistant and working subspaces, respectively, that could be separated by rotation or energy and coupled through driving. A systematic method is provided to construct parametric ancillary bases by the von Neumann equation with the time-dependent system Hamiltonian. The resulting universal passages set up connections between arbitrary initial and target states. In applications, a transitionless dynamics can be formulated to entangle distant qubits, as a crucial prerequisite for practical quantum networks. Using tunable longitudinal interaction between distant qubits and driving frequency, the superconducting qubits can be prepared from the ground state to the single-excitation Bell state with a fidelity as high as $\mathcal{F}=0.997$ and be further converted to the double-excitation Bell state with $\mathcal{F}=0.982$. Moreover, our protocol is extended to generate the Greenberger-Horne-Zeilinger state for an $N$-qubit system with $N$ steps. Our work develops a full-fledged theory for nonadiabatic state engineering, which is flexible in target selection and robust against both external noises and systematic errors in quantum information processing.</description>

Abstract: The key features of density-functional theory (DFT) within a minimalistic implementation of quantum electrodynamics are demonstrated, thus allowing to study elementary properties of quantum-electrodynamical density-functional theory (QEDFT). We primarily employ the quantum Rabi model, that describes a two-level system coupled to a single photon mode, and also discuss the Dicke model, where multiple two-level systems couple to the same photon mode. In these settings, the density variables of the system are the polarization and the displacement of the photon field. We give analytical expressions for the constrained-search functional and the exchange-correlation potential and compare to established results from QEDFT. We further derive a form for the adiabatic connection that is almost explicit in the density variables, up to only a non-explicit correlation term that gets bounded both analytically and numerically. This allows several key features of DFT to be studied without approximations.</description>

      <title>Reinforcement learning to learn quantum states for Heisenberg scaling accuracy</title>

Abstract: Learning quantum states is a crucial task for realizing quantum information technology. Recently, neural approaches have emerged as promising methods for learning quantum states. We propose a meta-learning model that utilizes reinforcement learning (RL) to optimize the process of learning quantum states. To improve the data efficiency of the RL, we introduce an action repetition strategy inspired by curriculum learning. The RL agent significantly improves the sample efficiency of learning random quantum states, and achieves infidelity scaling close to the Heisenberg limit. We also show that the RL agent trained using 3-qubit states can generalize to learning up to 5-qubit states. These results highlight the utility of RL-driven meta-learning to enhance the efficiency and generalizability of learning quantum states. Our approach can be applied to improve quantum control, quantum optimization, and quantum machine learning.</description>

Abstract: Quantum entanglement, a fundamental feature of quantum mechanics, has become a powerful tool impacting various areas of physics. In this proceeding, we investigate the presence of quantum entanglement within the Higgs to ZZ* (HZZ*) interaction at the ATLAS experiment. Utilizing quantum tomography techniques, we extract the complete spin density matrix characterizing the HZZ* interaction from ATLAS Standard Monte Carlo (MC) HZZ* 4l Run2 samples. We then evaluate the presence of quantum entanglement in the system using the derived spin density matrix. Our investigation sheds light on the entanglement properties within the HZZ* interaction, which offers valuable insights into its quantum characteristics.</description>

Abstract: Motivated by the applications of secure multiparty computation as a privacy-protecting data analysis tool, and identifying oblivious transfer as one of its main practical enablers, we propose a practical realization of randomized quantum oblivious transfer. By using only symmetric cryptography primitives to implement commitments, we construct computationally-secure randomized oblivious transfer without the need for public-key cryptography or assumptions imposing limitations on the adversarial devices. We show that the protocol is secure under an indistinguishability-based notion of security and demonstrate an experimental implementation to test its real-world performance. Its security and performance are then compared to both quantum and classical alternatives, showing potential advantages over existing solutions based on the noisy storage model and public-key cryptography.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2501.08773v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Rydberg atoms stand out as a highly promising platform for realizing quantum computation with significant advantages in constructing high-fidelity quantum gates. Floquet frequency modulation (FFM), in Rydberg-atom systems, provides a unique platform for achieving precise quantum control and uncovering exotic physical phenomena, paving the way for innovative methodologies in quantum dynamics research. This work introduces a method to realize controlled arbitrary phase gates in Rydberg atoms by manipulating system dynamics using FFM. Notably, this method eliminates the need for laser addressing of individual atoms, significantly enhancing convenience for future practical applications. Furthermore, this approach can be integrated with soft quantum control strategies to enhance the fidelity and robustness of the resultant controlled-phase gates. Finally, as an example, this methodology is applied in Grover-Long algorithm to search target items with zero failure rate, demonstrating its substantial significance for future quantum information processing applications. This work leveraging Rydberg atoms and Floquet frequency modulation may herald a new era of scalable and reliable quantum computing.</description>

Abstract: The investigation of fluorescence lifetime became an important tool in biology and medical science. So far, established methods of fluorescence lifetime measurements require the illumination of the investigated probes with pulsed or amplitude-modulated light. In this paper, we examine the limitations of an innovative method of fluorescence lifetime using the strong time-frequency correlation of entangled photons generated by a continuous-wave source. For this purpose, we investigate the lifetime of IR-140 to demonstrate the functional principle and its dependencies on different experimental parameters. We also compare this technique with state-of-the-art FLIM and observed an improved figure-of-merit. Finally, we discuss the potential of a quantum advantage.</description>

      <title>Phase Transitions in Nonreciprocal Driven-Dissipative Condensates</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.05267</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.05267v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate the influence of boundaries and spatial nonreciprocity on nonequilibrium driven-dissipative phase transitions. We focus on a one-dimensional lattice of nonlinear bosons described by a Lindblad master equation, where the interplay between coherent and incoherent dynamics generates nonreciprocal interactions between sites. Using a mean-field approach, we analyze the phase diagram under both periodic and open boundary conditions. For periodic boundaries, the system always forms a condensate at nonzero momentum and frequency, resulting in a time-dependent traveling wave pattern. In contrast, open boundaries reveal a far richer phase diagram, featuring multiple static and dynamical phases, as well as exotic phase transitions, including the spontaneous breaking of particle-hole symmetry associated with a critical exceptional point and phases with distinct bulk and edge behavior. Our model avoids post-selection or unphysical non-Hermitian Hamiltonians and is experimentally realizable in platforms such as superconducting circuits.</description>

      <title>A quantum speedup algorithm for TSP based on quantum dynamic programming with very few qubits</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.08853v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP) is a classical NP-hard problem that plays a crucial role in combinatorial optimization. In this paper, we are interested in the quantum search framework for the TSP because it has robust theoretical guarantees. However, we need to first search for all Hamiltonian cycles from a very large solution space, which greatly weakens the advantage of quantum search algorithms. To address this issue, one can first prepare a superposition state of all feasible solutions, and then amplify the amplitude of the optimal solution from it. We propose a quantum algorithm to generate the uniform superposition state of all N-length Hamiltonian cycles as an initial state within polynomial gate complexity based on pure quantum dynamic programming with very few ancillary qubits, which achieves exponential acceleration compared to the previous initial state preparation algorithm. As a result, we realized the theoretical minimum query complexity of quantum search algorithms for a general TSP. Compared to some algorithms that theoretically have lower query complexities but lack practical implementation solutions, our algorithm has feasible circuit implementation.</description>

      <title>Machine Learning for Detecting Steering in Qutrit-Pair States</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.11365v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Only a few states in high-dimensional systems can be identified as (un)steerable using existing theoretical or experimental methods. We utilize semidefinite programming (SDP) to construct a dataset for steerability detection in qutrit-qutrit systems. For the full-information feature $F_1$, artificial neural networks achieve high classification accuracy and generalization, and preform better than the support vector machine. As feature engineering playing a pivotal role, we introduce a steering ellipsoid-like feature $F_2$, which significantly enhances the performance of each of our models. Given the SDP method provides only a sufficient condition for steerability detection, we establish the first rigorously constructed, accurately labeled dataset based on theoretical foundations. This dataset enables models to exhibit outstanding accuracy and generalization capabilities, independent of the choice of features. As applications, we investigate the steerability boundaries of isotropic states and partially entangled states, and find new steerable states. This work not only advances the application of machine learning for probing quantum steerability in high-dimensional systems but also deepens the theoretical understanding of quantum steerability itself.</description>

      <title>A local, many-worlds, model of quantum correlations with finite information flow</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.13807v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Ontological theories, such as the de Broglie-Bohm theory, address the measurement problem by introducing auxiliary random variables that specify, in particular, the actual values of macroscopic observables. Such models may be psi-epistemic, meaning the quantum state is not part of the ontology. A serious issue of this route toward a realistic completion of quantum theory is raised by Bell's proof that ontological theories are nonlocal. A possible resolution is to reject the assumption that measurements have single actual outcomes. Indeed, relaxing this premise, Deutsch and Hayden showed that Bell's theorem can be evaded by delaying the buildup of the correlations until the parties compare their outcomes at a meeting point. However, the Deutsch-Hayden theory, which is determinist and psi-ontic, leads to an infinite information flow towards the meeting point. Furthermore, alternative branches are weighted by amplitudes, leading to interpretative issues. By integrating the randomness of single-world theories and the branching of the Deutsch-Hayden theory, we introduce a simple psi-epistemic local model of projective measurements on two spatially separate maximally entangled qubits. Because of its randomness, the model requires two "equally weighted" branches and a finite information flow -- just one bit per measurement is communicated to the meeting point. We explore how this hybrid approach, employing both randomness and branching, addresses key challenges of single-world and Deutsch-Hayden theories. On one hand, the branching allows us to circumvent nonlocality and, possibly, contextuality. On the other hand, randomness makes it more natural and economical to derive quantum probabilities from unweighted counts of branches and ensemble averages. Furthermore, it allows for a reduction of the information flow by stripping the quantum state of its `ontic' rank.</description>

      <title>Resonant Energy Transfer and Collectively Driven Emitters in Waveguide QED</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.17662</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.17662v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Waveguide quantum electrodynamics (QED) has opened a new frontier in quantum optics, which enables the radiative coupling of distantly located emitters via the spatially extended waveguide mode. This coupling leads to modified emission dynamics and previous work has reported the observation of increased intensity correlations (an antidip) when probing the resonance response of multiple emitters. However, the interference between independent emitters has been shown to lead to a similar response. Here, we directly observe resonant energy transfer between two distant quantum emitters by recording an antidip in the intensity correlations, $g^{(2)}(\tau)$, while driving only one of the emitters. Under the condition that only a single emitter is driven, the antidip in photon coincidences is a distinctive signature of emitter-emitter coupling, which enables the transfer of energy from the driven to the undriven emitter. Interestingly, the observed mechanism is a long-range and waveguide-engineered version of resonant F\"orster transfer, which is responsible for the transport of energy between chlorophylls in the photosynthesis. Building on the established coupling, we demonstrate collective driving of the coupled emitter pair. Specifically, we control the relative driving phase and amplitude of the emitters and apply this collective excitation scheme to selectively populate the long-lived subradiant state. This results in suppressed emission, i.e. the peculiar situation where driving two emitters as opposed to one effectively reduces the probability of photon emission. Our work presents novel emission regimes and excitation schemes for a multi-emitter waveguide QED system. These can be exploited to deterministically generate emitter-emitter entanglement and advanced photonic states providing robustness against losses for photonic quantum computation and quantum communication.</description>

      <title>Indefinite Time Directed Quantum Metrology</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.18264v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We explore the performance of the metrology scheme by employing a quantum time flip during encoding, a specific case of processes with indefinite time direction, which we refer to as indefinite time directed metrology (ITDM). In the case of single parameter estimation of a unitary, we demonstrate that our protocol can achieve Heisenberg scaling (1/N) with product probe states, surpassing the standard quantum limit (1/\sqrt{N}), where N is the number of particles in the probe. We establish this by computing the quantum Fisher information (QFI) which is a lower bound on the root mean square error occurred during parameter estimation. Although we analytically prove the optimality of the symmetric product probe state in ITDM, entangled probe states produce a higher QFI than optimal product probes without enhancing scaling, highlighting the non-essentiality of entanglement. For phase estimation, we propose a single-qubit measurement on the control qubit that accomplishes near-optimal Fisher information and eventually reaches Heisenberg scaling. Our findings reveal the best orientation of product probe states in every pertinent situation, emphasizing its independence from the parameter to be estimated in the limiting case. Furthermore, we illustrate the benefits of ITDM in noisy metrology, outperforming existing techniques in some situations.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.11136v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper presents a theoretical evaluation of spin correlation in the two-proton ($2p$) radioactive emission. The three-body model of $^{6}$Be with the proton-proton interaction, which is adjusted to reproduce the experimental energy release, is utilized. Time-dependent calculation is performed to compute the coupled-spin state of the emitted two protons. The spin-correlation function $S$ as the Clauser-Horne-Shimony-Holt (CHSH) indicator is evaluated as $|S| \cong 2.65$. Namely, the $2p$-spin correlation beyond the limit of local-hidden-variable (LHV) theory is suggested. This correlation is sensitive to the proton-proton interaction. The short-lived (broad-width) $2p$~state has the weaker spin correlation. In parallel, the core-proton interactions do not harm this correlation during the time-dependent decaying process. The CHSH measurement can be a novel probe into the effective nuclear interaction inside finite systems. Two-proton emitters can provide a testing field for identical-particle entanglement.</description>

      <title>Evidence for simple "arrow of time functions" in closed chaotic quantum systems</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.08007v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Through an explicit construction, we assign to any infinite temperature autocorrelation function $C(t)$ a set of functions $\alpha^n(t)$. The construction of $\alpha^n(t)$ from $C(t)$ requires the first $2n$ temporal derivatives of $C(t)$ at times $0$ and $t$. Our focus is on $\alpha^n(t)$ that (almost) monotonously decrease, we call these ``arrows of time functions" (AOTFs). For autocorrelation functions of few body observables we numerically observe the following: An AOTF featuring a low $n$ may always be found unless the the system is in or close to a nonchaotic regime with respect to a variation of some system parameter. All $\alpha^n(t)$ put upper bounds to the respective autocorrelation functions, i.e. $\alpha^n(t) \geq C^2(t)$. Thus the implication of the existence of an AOTF is comparable to that of the H-Theorem, as it indicates a directed approach to equilibrium. We furthermore argue that our numerical finding may to some extent be traced back to the operator growth hypothesis. This argument is laid out in the framework of the so-called recursion method.</description>

Abstract: Multifractal analysis is a powerful tool for characterizing the localization properties of wave functions. Despite its utility, this tool has been predominantly applied to disordered Hermitian systems. Multifractal statistics associated with the non-Hermitian skin effect remain largely unexplored. Here, we demonstrate that the tree geometry induces multifractal statistics for the single-particle skin states on the Cayley tree by deriving the analytical expression of multifractal dimensions. This sharply contrasts with the absence of multifractal properties for conventional single-particle skin effects in crystalline lattices. Our work uncovers the unique feature of the skin effect on the Cayley tree and provides a novel mechanism for inducing multifractality in open quantum systems without disorder.</description>

Abstract: Weak measurement enables the extraction of targeted information from a quantum system while minimizing decoherence due to measurement backaction. However, in many-body quantum systems backaction can have unexpected effects on wavefunction collapse. We theoretically study a minimal many-particle model consisting of weakly measured non-interacting fermions in a one dimensional lattice. Repeated measurement of on-site occupation number with single-site resolution stochastically drives the system toward a Fock state, regardless of the initial state. This need not be the case for measurements that do not, even in principle, have single-site spatial resolution. We numerically show for systems with up to 16 sites that decreasing the spatial resolution strongly affects both the rate of stochastic evolution for each quantum trajectory and the allowed final states. The full Hilbert space can be partitioned into backaction-free subspaces (BFSs) the elements of which are indistinguishable to these measurements. Repeated measurements will drive any initial state into a single BFS, leading to a steady state that is a fixed point of the measurement process. We exactly calculate the properties of these BFSs for systems up to 32 sites and find that even for moderate reductions in measurement resolution they yield non-trivial steady state entanglement and coherence.</description>

      <title>Engineering dipole-dipole couplings for enhanced cooperative light-matter interactions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.08940</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.08940v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Cooperative optical effects are enabled and controlled by interactions between molecular dipoles, meaning that their mutual orientation is of paramount importance to, for example, superabsorbing light-harvesting antennas. Here we show how to move beyond the possibilities of simple geometric tailoring, demonstrating how a metallic sphere placed within a ring of parallel dipoles engineers an effective Hamiltonian that generates "guide-sliding" states within the ring system. This allows steady-state superabsorption in noisy room temperature environments, outperforming previous designs while being significantly simpler to implement.
  As exemplified by this showcase, our approach represents a powerful design paradigm for tailoring cooperative light-matter effects in molecular structures that extends beyond superabsorbing systems, to a huge array of quantum energy transport systems.</description>

      <title>Electrodynamics of Vortices in Quasi-2D Scalar Bose-Einstein Condensates</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.14302</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.14302v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In two spatial dimensions, vortex-vortex interactions approximately vary with the logarithm of the inter-vortex distance, making it possible to describe an ensemble of vortices as a Coulomb gas. We introduce a duality between vortices in a quasi-two-dimensional (quasi-2D) scalar Bose-Einstein condensates (BEC) and effective Maxwell's electrodynamics. Specifically, we address the general scenario of inhomogeneous, time-dependent BEC number density with dissipation or rotation. Starting from the Gross-Pitaevskii equation (GPE), which describes the mean-field dynamics of a quasi-2D scalar BEC without dissipation, we show how to map vortices in a quasi-2D scalar BEC to 2D electrodynamics beyond the point-vortex approximation, even when dissipation is present or in a rotating system. The physical meaning of this duality is discussed.</description>

      <title>Variational Quantum Simulation of the Fokker-Planck Equation applied to Quantum Radiation Reaction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.17517</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.17517v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Near-future experiments with Petawatt class lasers are expected to produce a high flux of gamma-ray photons and electron-positron pairs through Strong Field Quantum Electrodynamical processes. Simulations of the expected regime of laser-matter interaction are computationally intensive due to the disparity of the spatial and temporal scales and because quantum and classical descriptions need to be accounted for simultaneously (classical for collective effects and quantum for nearly-instantaneous events of hard photon emission and pair creation). A typical configuration for experiments is a scattering of an electron and a laser beam which can be mapped to an equivalent problem with constant magnetic field. We study the stochastic cooling of an electron beam in a strong constant uniform magnetic field, both its particle distribution functions and their energy momenta. We start by obtaining approximate closed-form analytical solutions to the relevant observables. Then, we apply the quantum-hybrid Variational Quantum Imaginary Time Evolution to the Fokker-Planck equation describing this process, and compare against theory and results from Particle-In-Cell simulations and classical Partial Differential Equation solvers, showing good agreement. This work will be useful as a first step towards quantum simulation of plasma physics scenarios where diffusion processes are important, in particular in strong electromagnetic fields.</description>

      <title>Non-Hermitian delocalization in 1D via emergent compactness</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.12490</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.12490v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Potential disorder in 1D leads to Anderson localization of the entire spectrum. Upon sacrificing hermiticity by adding non-reciprocal hopping, the non-Hermitian skin effect competes with localization. We find another route for delocalization, which involves imaginary potential disorder. While an entirely random potential generally still leads to localization, imposing minimal spatial structure to the disorder can protect delocalization: it endows the concomitant transfer matrix with an SU(2) structure, whose compactness in turn translates into an infinite localization length. The fraction of delocalized states can be tuned by the choice of boundary conditions.</description>

      <title>Global symmetries of quantum lattice models under non-invertible dualities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.12514</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.12514v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Non-invertible dualities/symmetries have become an important tool in the study of quantum field theories and quantum lattice models in recent years. One of the most studied examples is non-invertible dualities obtained by gauging a discrete group. When the physical system has more global symmetries than the gauged symmetry, it has not been thoroughly investigated how those global symmetries transform under non-invertible duality. In this paper, we study the change of global symmetries under non-invertible duality of gauging a discrete group $G$ in the context of (1+1)-dimensional quantum lattice models. We obtain the global symmetries of the dual model by focusing on different Hilbert space sectors determined by the $\mathrm{Rep}(G)$ symmetry. We provide general conjectures of global symmetries of the dual model forming an algebraic ring of the double cosets. We present concrete examples of the XXZ models and the duals, providing strong evidence for the conjectures.</description>

      <title>Quantum critical electro-optic and piezo-electric nonlinearities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.15164</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.15164v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Electro-optics, the tuning of optical properties of materials with electric fields, is key to a multitude of quantum and classical photonics applications. However, a major obstacle preventing many emerging use cases is inefficient modulation in cryogenic environments, as traditional tuning mechanisms degrade at low temperatures. Guided by the connection between phase transitions and nonlinearity, we identify the quantum paraelectric perovskite SrTiO$_3$ (STO) as the strongest cryogenic electro-optic photonic material. As a result of the unique quantum paraelectric phase of STO, we demonstrate a dynamically tunable linear Pockels coefficient ($r_{33}$) exceeding 500 pm/V at $T=5$ K, and study its full temperature and bias dependence. We also measure an enhanced piezo-electric coefficient ($d_{33}$) above 90 pC/N. Both of these coefficients exceed all previously reported values for cryogenic materials, including lithium niobate ($r_{33}\approx24$ pm/V) and barium titanate ($r_{42}\approx170$ pm/V). Furthermore, by tuning STO towards \textit{quantum criticality} with oxygen isotope substitution we more than double the optical and piezo-electric nonlinearities, demonstrating a linear Pockels coefficient above 1100 pm/V. Our results probe the link between quantum phase transitions, dielectric susceptibility, and optical nonlinearities, unlocking opportunities in cryogenic optical and mechanical systems, and provide a framework for discovering new nonlinear materials.</description>

      <title>ByteQC: GPU-Accelerated Quantum Chemistry Package for Large-Scale Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.17963</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.17963v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Applying quantum chemistry algorithms to large-scale systems requires substantial computational resources scaled with the system size and the desired accuracy. To address this, ByteQC, a fully-functional and efficient package for large-scale quantum chemistry simulations, has been open-sourced at https://github.com/bytedance/byteqc, leveraging recent advances in computational power and many-body algorithms.
  Regarding computational power, several standard algorithms are efficiently implemented on modern GPUs, ranging from mean-field calculations (Hartree-Fock and density functional theory) to post-Hartree-Fock methods such as M{\o}ller-Plesset perturbation theory, random phase approximation, coupled cluster methods, and quantum Monte Carlo methods. For the algorithmic approach, we also employ a quantum embedding method, which significantly expands the tractable system size while preserving high accuracy at the gold-standard level.
  All these features have been systematically benchmarked. For standalone algorithms, the benchmark results demonstrate up to a 60$\times$ speedup when compared to 100-core CPUs. Additionally, the tractable system sizes have been significantly expanded: 1,610 orbitals for coupled cluster with single and double excitations (1,380 orbitals with perturbative triple excitations), 11,040 orbitals for M{\o}ller-Plesset perturbation theory of second order, 37,120 orbitals for mean-field calculations under open boundary conditions, and over 100,000 orbitals for periodic boundary conditions. For the advanced quantum embedding feature, two representative examples are demonstrated: the water cluster problem (2,752 orbitals) and a water monomer adsorbed on a boron nitride surface (3,929 orbitals), achieving the gold-standard accuracy.</description>
