      <title>Double descent: When do neural quantum states generalize?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.00068</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.00068v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Neural quantum states (NQS) provide flexible wavefunction parameterizations for numerical studies of quantum many-body physics. While inspired by deep learning, it remains unclear to what extent NQS share characteristics with neural networks used for standard machine learning tasks. We demonstrate that NQS exhibit the double descent phenomenon, a key feature of modern deep learning, where generalization worsens as network size increases before improving again in an overparameterized regime. Notably, we find the second descent to occur only for network sizes much larger than the Hilbert space dimension, indicating that NQS typically operate in an underparameterized regime, where increasing network size can degrade generalization. Our analysis reveals that the optimal network size in this regime depends on the number of unique training samples, highlighting the importance of sampling strategies. These findings suggest the need for symmetry-aware, physics-informed architecture design, rather than directly adopting machine learning heuristics.</description>

      <title>From Thermalization to Multifractality: Spin-Spin Correlation in Disordered $SU(2)$-Invariant 1D Heisenberg Spin Chains</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.00573</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.00573v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate spin correlations in one-dimensional $SU(2)$-invariant Heisenberg chains with exchange disorder for spin lengths $S=1/2$ and $S=1$. In the weak-disorder regime, the eigenmodes of the spin-spin correlation matrix are delocalized, consistent with ergodic behavior. Under strong disorder, the system enters a quasi-localized multifractal phase characterized by exponentially decaying, dimer-like spin correlations. Finite-size scaling of the inverse participation ratios of the correlation-matrix eigenmodes yields a correlation dimension, $D_2\approx 0.37-0.39$, confirming the stability of a multifractal regime that is distinct from both the ergodic limit ($D_2=1$) and the fully localized limit ($D_2=0$).</description>

      <title>Imaginary Time Spectral Transforms for Excited State Preparation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.00065</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.00065v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Excited states of many-body quantum systems play a key role in a wide range of physical and chemical phenomena. Unlike ground states, for which many efficient variational techniques exist, there are few ways to systematically construct excited states of generic quantum systems on either classical or quantum hardware. To address this challenge, we introduce a general approach that allows us to obtain arbitrary eigenstates of quantum systems at a given energy. By combining the shift-invert mechanism with imaginary time evolution, we are able to avoid explicit inversion of the Hamiltonian and construct excited eigenstates of large many-body quantum systems. We demonstrate the technique classically by applying it to large disordered spin chains. Based on this approach, we propose a hybrid scheme suitable for near-future quantum hardware.</description>

      <title>Explicit equivalence between the spectral localizer and local Chern and winding markers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.00214</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.00214v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Topological band insulators are classified using momentum-space topological invariants, such as Chern or winding numbers, when they feature translational symmetry. The lack of translation symmetry in disordered, quasicrystalline, or amorphous topological systems has motivated alternative, real-space definitions of topological invariants, including the local Chern marker and the spectral localizer invariant.
  However, the equivalence between these invariants is so far implicit. Here, we explicitly demonstrate their equivalence from a systematic perturbative expansion in powers of the spectral localizer's parameter $\kappa$. By leveraging only the Clifford algebra of the spectral localizer, we prove that Chern and winding markers emerge as leading-order terms in the expansion. It bypasses abstract topological machinery, offering a simple approach accessible to a broader physics audience.</description>

      <title>Exact Diagonalization Study on Avalanches in Many-Body Localized Constrained Spin Chains</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.14372</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.14372v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Avalanches are believed to be the mechanism behind the transition from many-body localization to the thermal phase. We utilize spin chains with constraints to study the physics of quantum avalanches by exact diagonalization of disordered systems coupled to a thermal bath. Single-spin observables are used to characterize localization and quantify the influence of the thermal bath on disordered spin chains. Constraints on the Hilbert space confine the dynamics to a subspace, effectively reducing the Hilbert space dimension and enabling the study of larger systems with limited computational resources. We study the PXP model, and in addition, we construct spin chains with constraints by searching for constraints with a genetic algorithm to reach larger system sizes. We define quantities to measure the strength of avalanches and use these to compare different models. We find that avalanches are more pronounced in models with constraints compared to those without constraints. Results from exact diagonalization are compared with those from studying the Lindblad master equation. We also identify models that exhibit no thermal phases and find stable ergodicity breaking.</description>

      <title>Scaling analysis and renormalization group on the mobility edge in the quantum random energy model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.06563</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.06563v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Building on recent progress in the study of Anderson and many-body localization via the renormalization group (RG), we examine the scaling theory of localization in the quantum Random Energy Model (QREM). The QREM is known to undergo a localization-delocalization transition at finite energy density, while remaining fully ergodic at the center of the spectrum. At zero energy density, we show that RG trajectories consistently flow toward the ergodic phase, and are characterized by an unconventional scaling of the fractal dimension near the ergodic fixed point. When the disorder amplitude is rescaled, as suggested by the forward scattering approximation approach, a localization transition emerges also at the center of the spectrum, with properties analogous to the Anderson transition on expander graphs. At finite energy density, a localization transition takes place without disorder rescaling, and yet it exhibits a scaling behavior analogous to the one observed on expander graphs. The universality class of the model remains unchanged under the rescaling of the disorder, reflecting the independence of the RG from microscopic details. Our findings demonstrate the robustness of the scaling behavior of random graphs and offer new insights into the many-body localization transition.</description>

      <title>Athermal creep deformation of ultrastable amorphous solids</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.17952</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.17952v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We numerically investigate the athermal creep deformation of amorphous materials having a wide range of stability. The imposed shear stress serves as the control parameter, allowing us to examine the time-dependent transient response through both the macroscopic strain and microscopic observables. Least stable samples exhibit monotonicity in the transient strain rate versus time, while more stable samples display a pronounced non-monotonic S-shaped curve, corresponding to failure by sharp shear band formation. We identify a diverging timescale associated with the fluidization process and extract the corresponding critical exponents. Our results are compared with predictions from existing scaling theories relevant to soft matter systems. The numerical findings for stable, brittle-like materials represent a challenge for theoretical descriptions. We monitor the microscopic initiation of shear bands during creep responses. Our study encompasses creep deformation across a variety of materials ranging from ductile soft matter to brittle metallic and oxide glasses, all within the same numerical framework.</description>

      <title>Probing graph topology from local quantum measurements</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.23689</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.23689v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We show that global properties of an unknown quantum network, such as the average degree, hub density, and the number of closed paths of fixed length, can be inferred from strictly local quantum measurements. In particular, we demonstrate that a malicious agent with access to only a small subset of nodes can initialize quantum states locally and, through repeated short-time measurements, extract sensitive structural information about the entire network. The intrusion strategy is inspired by extreme learning and quantum reservoir computing and combines short-time quantum evolution with a non-iterative linear readout with trainable weights. These results suggest new strategies for intrusion detection and structural diagnostics in future quantum Internet infrastructures.</description>
