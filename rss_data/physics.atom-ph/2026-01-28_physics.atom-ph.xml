      <title>Broadband Heterodyne Microwave Detection using Rydberg Atoms with High Sensitivity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.19305</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.19305v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a Rydberg atom-based microwave electric field sensor that achieves extended dynamic range and enhanced sensitivity across a broad bandwidth. By characterizing the Autler-Townes (AT) splitting induced by a single-tone microwave field, we demonstrate a spectroscopic method that simultaneously extracts both the microwave frequency and electric field strength directly from the splitting pattern. We implement dual-tone heterodyne detection, achieving a minimum detectable field strength on the order of uV/cm and a sensitivity in the sub-uV/cm/Hz^1/2 regime, while extending the operational bandwidth up to 3 GHz. Through systematic characterization of frequency and power dependencies, we identify optimal operating conditions to minimize power broadening in the resonant AT regime and maximize sensitivity in the far-off-resonance AC Stark regime. The resulting platform combines high sensitivity, broad bandwidth, and a dynamic range of approximately 90 dB, establishing Rydberg atoms as practical sensors for precision electric field metrology.</description>

      <title>Spectroscopy of $^4$He at 0.25 ppt Uncertainty and Improved Alpha-Helion Charge-Radius Difference Determination</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.19444</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.19444v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: High-precision spectroscopy of simple atomic systems can be used to advance the theory of atomic energy levels but can also serve as a sensitive probe of nuclear charge radii. For this last purpose, we report an improved measurement of the $2\,^3{S}_1 \to 2\,^1{S}_0$ transition frequency in $^4$He with 48 Hz uncertainty (0.25 ppt), using a Bose-Einstein condensed sample confined in a magic-wavelength optical dipole trap. A systematic Doppler shift from condensate motion is suppressed by time-resolved ion detection, and the transition frequency is calibrated via a White Rabbit link to a remote active hydrogen maser clock. Combined with previous $^3$He measurements and improved theory, we obtain the most precise determination to date of the charge-radius difference between the alpha and helion particles of $r_{h}^2 -r_{\alpha}^2$ of $1.0676(10)\text{fm}^2$. This is consistent with other recent determinations and confirms that the current discrepancy between QED theory and experimentally observed ionization energies of excited states in helium is not apparent in the isotope shift.</description>

      <title>R-Matrix Theory for Electron-Ion Collisions in Plasmas</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.19538</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.19538v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Electron-atom collisions in warm dense plasmas are crucial for astrophysics and controlled fusion research, where calculating short-range scattering matrices under screening plasma potentials is essential. While electron-neutral atom collisions are tractable using the standard Riccati-Bessel wavefunctions in the asymptotic region, electron-ion collisions face challenges due to the extended range of the screened Coulomb potential, which lacks analytical solutions or numerical code packages for asymptotic regular and irregular wavefunctions. We introduce an R-matrix theoretical framework for general screened potentials and develop a numerical method to compute these asymptotic wavefunctions efficiently. Our approach yields short-range scattering phase shifts that remain invariant with respect to the matching point in the asymptotic region. Applying the Debye screening potential as an illustrative example, we calculate elastic and electron-impact excitation collision strengths for H-like ions (He, C, Ne) across varying temperatures and densities. The calculations show that Debye screening systematically modifies resonance structures and progressively lowers excitation thresholds. Nevertheless, the effective collision strengths and rate coefficients exhibit approximate scaling laws. These findings enable convenient access to electron collision data in plasma environments, advancing plasma diagnostics and modeling.</description>

      <title>Optimally Driven Dressed Qubits</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.19719</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.19719v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The applicability and performance of qubits dressed by classical fields are limited because their control protocols give rise to an undesired counter-rotating term (CRT). This in turn forces operation in a regime where a (dressed) rotating-wave approximation (RWA) is valid, thereby restricting key aspects of their operation. Here, using only a single coupling axis in the laboratory frame, we introduce a dressed-qubit control protocol that optimally removes the CRT, eliminating the need for the RWA and delivering substantial improvements in multiple performance metrics, including single-qubit gate speed, two-qubit gate fidelity, spectroscopic range, clock stability, and coherence preservation. In addition, we provide a general parameterization together with a Floquet-based coherence-time expression, which elucidates the protocol's working principles and lowers the barrier to adoption. Collectively, these advances position our scheme as the state-of-the-art strategy for qubit control, paving the way for a wider class of quantum technologies to be realized using dressed-qubit architectures.</description>

      <title>Simple broadband signal detection at the fundamental limit</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.19816</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.19816v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Broadband detection of a weak oscillatory field with unknown carrier frequency underlies magnetometry, axion searches and gravitational-wave sensing. We show that the Grover-like integration-time lower bound for this task is a geometric corollary an upper bound on the integrated quantum Fisher information, a metrological constraint. We further give an all-analog multi-resonant protocol based on a randomized Su-Schrieffer-Heeger control Hamiltonian and an m-register GHZ probe and verify near-optimal scaling through simulation.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2505.16645v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The finite operators are derived for the nonrecoil (leading order in the $(m/M)$ expansion) relativistic corrections in hydrogen-like atoms and ions at orders $m\alpha^6$ in the two- and three-body formalism beyond the adiabatic approximation. Singular operators that appear in the derivation are analysed, and various regularization methods are discussed.</description>

      <title>Investigating Roles of Triple Excitations for High-precision Determination of Clock Properties of Alkaline Earth Metal Singly Charged Ions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.17512</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.17512v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: High-accuracy calculations of electric dipole polarizabilities and quadrupole moments ($\Theta$) of the clock states of the singly charged calcium (Ca$^+$), strontium (Sr$^+$) and barium (Ba$^+$) alkaline-earth ions are estimated by employing relativistic coupled-cluster (RCC) theory. It demonstrates importance of the triple excitations in the RCC method for precise determination of the above quantities. We also observe a different trend of correlations in the $\Theta$ values than an earlier study with respect to orbitals from higher angular momenta. Reliability of the results is verified by comparing the calculated energies, magnetic dipole hyperfine structure constants, and lifetimes of the atomic states with the experimental values of the $^{43}$Ca$^+$, $^{87}$Sr$^+$ and $^{137}$Ba$^+$ ions. Nuclear quadrupole moments of these isotopes are also estimated by combining calculations with the measured electric quadrupole hyperfine structure constants, showing large deviations from the literature values.</description>

      <title>Non-Gaussian Phase Transition and Cascade of Instabilities in the Dissipative Quantum Rabi Model</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.07092v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The open quantum Rabi model describes a two-level system coupled to a harmonic oscillator. A Gaussian phase transition for the nonequilibrium steady states has been predicted when the bosonic mode is soft and subject to damping. We show that oscillator dephasing is a relevant perturbation, which leads to a non-Gaussian phase transition and an intriguing cascade of instabilities for $k$-th order bosonic operators, as well as a jump in the steady-state qubit polarization. For the soft-mode limit, the equations of motion form a closed hierarchy and spectral properties can be efficiently studied. To this purpose, we establish a fruitful connection to non-Hermitian Hamiltonians. The results for the phase diagram, stability boundaries, and relevant observables are based on mean-field analysis, exact diagonalization, perturbation theory, and Keldysh field theory.</description>

      <title>High-contrast double Bragg interferometry via detuning control</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.10968</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.10968v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We propose high-contrast Mach-Zehnder atom interferometers based on double Bragg diffraction (DBD) operating under external acceleration. To mitigate differential Doppler shifts and experimental imperfections, we introduce a tri-frequency laser scheme with dynamic detuning control. We evaluate four detuning-control strategies-conventional DBD, constant detuning, linear detuning sweep (DS-DBD), and a hybrid protocol combining detuning sweep with optimal control theory (OCT)-using exact numerical simulations and a five-level S-matrix model. The OCT strategy provides the highest robustness, maintaining contrast above 95\% under realistic conditions, while the DS-DBD strategy sustains contrast above 90\% for well-collimated Bose-Einstein condensates. These results offer practical pathways to high-contrast, large-momentum-transfer DBD-based interferometers for precision quantum sensing and fundamental physics tests.</description>

      <title>Spectral finite-element formulation of the optimized effective potential method for atomic structure in the random phase approximation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.17757</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.17757v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present a spectral finite-element formulation of the optimized effective potential (OEP) method for atomic structure calculations in the random phase approximation (RPA). In particular, we develop a finite-element framework that employs a polynomial mesh with element nodes placed according to the Chebyshev-Gauss-Lobatto scheme, high-order $\mathcal{C}^0$-continuous Lagrange polynomial basis functions, and Gauss-Legendre quadrature for spatial integration. We employ distinct polynomial degrees for the orbitals, Hartree potential, and RPA-OEP exchange-correlation potential. Through representative examples, we verify the accuracy of the developed framework, assess the fidelity of one-parameter double-hybrid functionals constructed with RPA correlation, and develop a machine-learned model for the RPA-OEP exchange-correlation potential at the level of the generalized gradient approximation, based on the kernel method and linear regression.</description>
