      <title>Wave packet analysis of semigroups generated by quadratic differential operators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.11130</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.11130v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We perform a phase space analysis of evolution equations associated with the Weyl quantization $q^{\mathrm{w}}$ of a complex quadratic form $q$ on $\mathbb{R}^{2d}$ with non-positive real part. In particular, we obtain pointwise bounds for the matrix coefficients of the Gabor wave packet decomposition of the generated semigroup $e^{tq^{\mathrm{w}}}$ if $\mathrm{Re} (q) \le 0$ and the companion singular space associated is trivial, with explicit and sharp exponential time decay rate. This result is then leveraged to achieve a comprehensive analysis of the phase regularity of $e^{tq^{\mathrm{w}}}$ with $\mathrm{Re} (q) \le 0$, hence extending the $L^2$ analysis of quadratic semigroups initiated by Hitrik and Pravda-Starov to general modulation spaces $M^p(\mathbb{R}^d)$, $1 \le p \le \infty$.</description>

      <title>Semiclassical estimates for the magnetic Schr\"odinger operator on the line</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.11222</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.11222v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We prove a weighted Carleman estimate for a class of one-dimensional, self-adjoint Schr\"odinger operators $P(h)$ with low regularity electric and magnetic potentials, where $h &gt; 0$ is a semiclassical parameter. The long range part of either potential has bounded variation. The short range part of the magnetic potential belongs to $L^1(\mathbb{R} ; \mathbb{R}) \cap L^2(\mathbb{R})$, while the short range part of the electric potential is a finite signed measure. The proof is a one dimensional instance of the energy method, which is used to prove Carleman estimates in higher dimensions and in more complicated geometries. The novelty of our result lies in the weak regularity assumptions on the coefficients. As a consequence of the Carleman estimate, we establish an optimal limiting absorption resolvent estimates for $P(h)$. We also present standard applications to the distribution of resonances for $P(1)$ and to associated evolution equations.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2408.11555v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We substantially improve in two scenarios the current state-of-the-art modulus of continuity for weak solutions to the $N$-dimensional, two-phase Stefan problem featuring a $p-$degenerate diffusion: for $p=N\geq 3$, we sharpen it to $$ \boldsymbol{\omega}(r) \approx \exp (-c| \ln r|^{\frac1N}); $$ for $p&gt;\max\{2,N\}$, we derive an unexpected H\"older modulus.</description>

      <title>Global existence and uniqueness of the density-dependent incompressible Navier-Stokes-Korteweg system with variable capillarity and viscosity coefficients</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.11675</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.11675v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider the global well-posedness of the inhomogeneous incompressible Navier-Stokes-Korteweg system with a general capillary term. Based on the maximal regularity property, we obtain the global existence and uniqueness of solutions to the incompressible Navier-Stokes-Korteweg system with variable viscosity and capillary terms. By assuming the initial density $\rho_0$ is close to a positive constant, additionally, the initial velocity $u_0$ and the initial density $\nabla \rho_0$ are small in critical space $\dot B^{-1+d/p}_{p,1}(\mathbb R^{d})$ $(1&lt;p&lt;d).$ This work relies on the maximal regularity property of the heat equation, of the Stokes equation, and of the Lam\'e equation.</description>

      <title>Improved Blow-Up Criterion in a Variational Framework for Nonlinear SPDEs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.11678</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.11678v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We extend recent existence and uniqueness results for maximal solutions of SPDEs through an improved blow-up criterion. Whilst the maximal time of existence is typically characterised by blow-up in the energy norm of solutions, we show instead that solutions exist until blow-up in the larger spaces of the variational framework. The result is applied to show that solutions of 2D and 3D Stochastic Navier-Stokes Equations retain the higher order regularity of the initial condition on their time of existence.</description>

      <title>Semilinear damped wave equations with data from Sobolev spaces of negative order: the critical case in Euclidean setting and in the Heisenberg space</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.11756</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.11756v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this note, we prove the global existence of solutions to the semilinear damped wave equation in $\mathbb{R}^n$, $n\leq6$, with critical nonlinearity under the assumption that the initial data are small in the energy space $H^1\times L^2$ and under the vanishing condition that the initial data belong to $\dot H^{-\gamma}$ for some $\gamma\in(0,n/2)$. A similar result also applies to the damped wave equation in the Heisenberg group $\mathbb{H}^n$, with $n=1,2$.</description>

      <title>Dirichlet-Neumann and Neumann-Neumann Waveform Relaxation Methods for PDEs with Time Delay</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.11171</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.11171v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce and compare two domain decomposition based numerical methods, namely the Dirichlet-Neumann and Neumann-Neumann Waveform Relaxation methods (DNWR and NNWR respectively), tailored for solving partial differential equations (PDEs) incorporating time delay. Time delay phenomena frequently arise in various real-world systems, making their accurate modeling and simulation crucial for understanding and prediction. We consider a series of model problems, ranging from Parabolic, Hyperbolic to Neutral PDEs with time delay and apply the iterative techniques DNWR and NNWR for solving in parallel. We present the theoretical foundations, numerical implementation, and comparative performance analysis of these two methods. Through numerical experiments and simulations, we explore their convergence properties, computational efficiency, and applicability to various types of PDEs with time delay.</description>

      <title>Pluriclosed flow and the Hull-Strominger system</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.11674</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.11674v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We define a natural extension of pluriclosed flow aiming at constructing solutions of the Hull-Strominger system. We give several geometric formulations of this flow, which yield a series of a priori estimates for the flow and also for the Hull-Strominger system. The evolution equations are derived using the theory of string algebroids, a class of Courant algebroids which occur naturally in higher gauge theory. Using this, we interpret the flow as generalized Ricci flow and also as a higher/coupled version of Hermitian-Yang-Mills flow, proving furthermore that it is compatible with symmetry reduction. Regarding our main analytical results, we prove a priori $C^{\infty}$ estimates for uniformly parabolic solutions. This in particular settles the question of smooth regularity of uniformly elliptic solutions of the Hull-Strominger system, generalizing Yau's $C^3$ estimate for the complex Monge-Amp\`ere equation. We prove global existence and convergence results for the flow on special backgrounds, and discuss a conjectural relationship of the flow to the geometrization of Reid's fantasy.</description>

      <title>On a multiscale formulation for multiperforated plates</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.02185v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Multiperforated plates exhibit high gradients and a loss of regularity concentrated in a boundary layer for which a direct numerical simulation becomes very expensive. For elliptic equations the solution at some distance of the boundary is only affected in an effective way and the macroscopic and mesoscopic behaviour can be separated. A multiscale formulation in the spirit of the heterogeneous multiscale method is introduced on the example of the Poisson equation. Based on the method of matched asymptotic expansion the solution is separated into a macroscopic far field defined in a domain with only slowly varying boundary and a mesoscopic near field defined in scaled coordinates on possibly varying infinite periodicity cells. The near field has a polynomial behaviour that is coupled to the traces of the macroscopic variable on the mid-line of the multiperforated plate. A variational formulation using a Beppo-Levi space in the strip is introduced and its well-posedness is shown. The variational framework when truncating the infinite strip is discussed and the truncation error is estimated.</description>

      <title>Solvability of the Neumann problem for elliptic equations in chord-arc domains with very big pieces of good superdomains</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.20385v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Let $\Omega \subset \mathbb{R}^{n+1}$ be a bounded chord-arc domain, let $\mathcal L=-{\rm div} A\nabla$ be an elliptic operator in $\Omega$ associated with a matrix $A$ having Dini mean oscillation coefficients, and let $1&lt;p\leq 2$. In this paper we show that if the regularity problem for $\mathcal L$ is solvable in $L^q$ for some $q&gt;p$ in $\Omega$, $\partial \Omega$ supports a weak $p$-Poincar\'e inequality, and $\Omega$ has very big pieces of superdomains for which the Neumann problem for $\mathcal L$ is solvable uniformly in $L^q$, then the Neumann problem for $\mathcal L$ is solvable in $L^p$ in $\Omega$.</description>

      <title>Matrix-Weighted Besov-Type and Triebel--Lizorkin-Type Spaces II: Sharp Boundedness of Almost Diagonal Operators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.13548</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.13548v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This article is the second one of three successive articles of the authors on the matrix-weighted Besov-type and Triebel--Lizorkin-type spaces. In this article, we obtain the sharp boundedness of almost diagonal operators on matrix-weighted Besov-type and Triebel--Lizorkin-type sequence spaces. These results not only possess broad generality but also improve several existing related results in various special cases covered by this family of spaces. This improvement depends, on the one hand, on the notion of $A_p$-dimensions of matrix weights and their properties introduced in the first article of this series and, on the other hand, on a careful direct analysis of sequences of averages avoiding maximal operators. While a recent matrix-weighted extension of the Fefferman--Stein vector-valued maximal inequality would provide an alternative route to some of our results in the restricted range of function space parameters $p,q\in(1,\infty)$, our approach covers the full scale of exponents $p\in(0,\infty)$ and $q\in(0,\infty]$ that is relevant in the theory of function spaces.</description>

      <title>On function spaces for radial functions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.09372</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.09372v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper is concerned with complex Banach-space valued functions of the form $$ \hat{f}_k(r\cos\theta,r\sin\theta,z)=\mathrm{e}^{\mathrm{i} k \theta}f_k(r,z), \qquad r \in [0,\infty), \theta \in \mathbb{T}^1, z \in \mathbb{R}, $$ for some $k \in \mathbb{Z}$. It is demonstrated how classical and Sobolev spaces for the radial function $f_k$ can be constructed in a natural fashion from the corresponding standard function spaces for $\hat{f}_k$. A theory of radial distributions is derived in the same spirit. Finally, a new class of \textit{Hankel spaces} for the case $f_k=f_k(r)$ is introduced. These spaces are the radial counterparts of the familiar Bessel-potential spaces for functions defined on $\mathbb{R}^d$. The paper concludes with an application of the theory to the Dirichlet boundary-value problem for Poisson's equation in a cylindrical domain.</description>

      <title>Monte Carlo Physics-informed neural networks for multiscale heat conduction via phonon Boltzmann transport equation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.10965</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.10965v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The phonon Boltzmann transport equation (BTE) is widely used for describing multiscale heat conduction (from nm to $\mu$m or mm) in solid materials. Developing numerical approaches to solve this equation is challenging since it is a 7-dimensional integral-differential equation. In this work, we propose Monte Carlo physics-informed neural networks (MC-PINNs), which do not suffer from the "curse of dimensionality", to solve the phonon BTE to model the multiscale heat conduction in solid materials. MC-PINNs use a deep neural network to approximate the solution to the BTE, and encode the BTE as well as the corresponding boundary/initial conditions using the automatic differentiation. In addition, we propose a novel two-step sampling approach to address inefficiency and inaccuracy issues in the widely used sampling methods in PINNs. In particular, we first randomly sample a certain number of points in the temporal-spatial space (Step I), and then draw another number of points randomly in the solid angular space (Step II). The training points are constructed using the tensor product of the data drawn from the above two steps. The two-step sampling strategy enables MC-PINNs (1) to model the heat conduction from ballistic to diffusive regimes, and (2) is more memory-efficient compared to conventional numerical solvers or existing PINNs for BTE. A series of numerical examples including quasi-one-dimensional (quasi-1D) steady/unsteady heat conduction in a film, and the heat conduction in a quasi-two- and three-dimensional square domain, are conducted to justify the effectiveness of the MC-PINN for heat conduction spanning diffusive and ballistic regimes. Finally, we compare the computational time and memory usage of the MC-PINN and a state-of-art numerical methods to demonstrate the potential of the MC-PINN for large scale problems in real-world applications.</description>
