      <title>Panda: A pretrained forecast model for universal representation of chaotic dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.13755</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.13755v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Chaotic systems are intrinsically sensitive to small errors, challenging efforts to construct predictive data-driven models of real-world dynamical systems such as fluid flows or neuronal activity. Prior efforts comprise either specialized models trained separately on individual time series, or foundation models trained on vast time series databases with little underlying dynamical structure. Motivated by dynamical systems theory, we present Panda, Patched Attention for Nonlinear DynAmics. We train Panda on a novel synthetic, extensible dataset of $2 \times 10^4$ chaotic dynamical systems that we discover using an evolutionary algorithm. Trained purely on simulated data, Panda exhibits emergent properties: zero-shot forecasting of unseen real world chaotic systems, and nonlinear resonance patterns in cross-channel attention heads. Despite having been trained only on low-dimensional ordinary differential equations, Panda spontaneously develops the ability to predict partial differential equations without retraining. We demonstrate a neural scaling law for differential equations, underscoring the potential of pretrained models for probing abstract mathematical domains like nonlinear dynamics.</description>

      <title>Spacing ratios in mixed-type systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.12874</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.12874v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The distribution of the consecutive level-spacing ratio is now widely used as a tool to distinguish integrable from chaotic quantum spectra, mostly due to its avoiding of the numerical spectral unfolding. Similar to the use of the Rosenzweig-Porter approach to obtain the Berry-Robnik distribution of level-spacings in mixed-type systems, in this work we extend this approach to derive analytically the distribution of spacing ratios, for random matrices comprised of independent integrable blocks and chaotic blocks. We have numerically confirmed this analytical result using random matrix theory in paradigmatic models such as the quantum kicked rotor and the H\'enon-Heiles system.</description>

      <title>Characterizing nonlinear dynamics by contrastive cartography</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.09628</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.09628v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The qualitative study of dynamical systems using bifurcation theory is key to understanding systems from biological clocks and neurons to physical phase transitions. Data generated from such systems can feature complex transients, an unknown number of attractors, and stochasticity. Characterization of these often-complicated behaviors remains challenging. Making an analogy to bifurcation analysis, which specifies that useful dynamical features are often invariant to coordinate transforms, we leverage contrastive learning to devise a generic tool to discover dynamical classes from stochastic trajectory data. By providing a model-free trajectory analysis tool, this method automatically recovers the dynamical phase diagram of known models and provides a "map" of dynamical behaviors for a large ensemble of dynamical systems. The method thus provides a way to characterize and compare dynamical trajectories without governing equations or prior knowledge of target behavior. We additionally show that the same strategy can be used to characterize the stochastic motion of bacteria, establishing that this approach can be used as a standalone analysis tool or as a component of a broader data-driven analysis framework for dynamical data.</description>

      <title>Interplay of magnetic field and chemical potential induced anisotropy and frame dependent chaos of a $Q\bar{Q}$ pair in holographic QCD</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.17279</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.17279v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate the role of both magnetic field and chemical potential on the emergence of chaotic dynamics in the QCD confining string from the holographic principle. An earlier developed bottom-up model of Einstein-Maxwell-dilaton gravity, which mimics QCD features quite well, is used. The qualitative information about the chaos is obtained using the Poincar\'{e} sections and Lyapunov exponents. We find signatures of chaos in energetically disfavored string configurations, that are closer to the horizon, whereas no chaos is observed in energetically favored string configurations that are away from the horizon. Our results depend quite strongly on the frame we consider in the analysis. In the string frame, the chemical potential and the magnetic field suppress the chaotic dynamics in both parallel and perpendicular orientations of the string with respect to the magnetic field. Meanwhile, in the Einstein frame, the magnetic field suppresses/enhances the chaotic dynamics when the string is orientated perpendicular/parallel to the magnetic field, while the chemical potential enhances the chaotic dynamics for both orientations. The reported Lyapunov exponents are consistent with a classical analogue of the MSS bound in the parameter space of the model and we find it to be always satisfied in both frames.</description>
