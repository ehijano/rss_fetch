      <title>Inflation of 2D boundary ghosts and digital watermarking</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.16789</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.16789v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Projection ghosts are discrete arrays of signed values positioned so that their discrete projections vanish for some chosen set of n projection angles. Minimal ghosts are designed to be compact, with no internal pixels having value zero. Here we control the shape, number of boundary pixels and area that each minimal ghost encloses. Binary minimal ghosts and their boundaries can themselves be inflated by tiling copies of themselves to make ghosts with larger sizes and different shapes, whilst still retaining the same set of n zero projection angles. The intricate perimeters of minimal ghosts are formed by three strings of connected pixels that are defined by the minimal projection angles. We show that large changes to the ghost areas can be made whilst keeping the length of their segmented perimeters fixed. These inflated boundary ghosts may prove useful as secure watermarks to embed into digital image data. Boundary ghosts may also help guide the selection of angles used to reconstruct images where the object domain is confined to oval shaped arcs.</description>

      <title>Geometric Variants of the Gale--Berlekamp Switching Game</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.16994</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.16994v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Gale-Berlekamp switching game is played on the following device:
  $G_n=\{1,2,\ldots,n\} \times \{1,2,\ldots,n\}$
  is an $n \times n$ array of lights is controlled by $2n$ switches, one for each row or column.
  Given an (arbitrary) initial configuration of the board, the objective is to have as many lights on as possible.
  Denoting the maximum difference (discrepancy)
  between the number of lights that are on minus the number of lights that are off
  by $F(n)$, it is known (Brown and Spencer, 1971) that
  $F(n)= \Theta(n^{3/2})$, and more precisely, that
  $F(n) \geq \left( 1+ o(1) \right) \sqrt{\frac{2}{\pi}} n^{3/2} \approx 0.797 \ldots n^{3/2}$.
  Here we extend the game to other playing boards. For example:
  (i)~For any constant $c&gt;1$, if $c n$ switches are conveniently chosen, then the maximum discrepancy
  for the square board is $\Omega(n^{3/2})$. From the other direction, suppose we fix any set of $a$ column switches, $b$ row switches, where $a \geq b$ and $a+b=n$.
  Then the maximum discrepancy is at most $-b (n-b)$.
  (ii) A board $H \subset \{1,\ldots,n\}^2$, with area $A=|H|$,
  is \emph{dense} if $A \geq c (u+v)^2$, for some constant $c&gt;0$, where
  $u= |\{x \colon (x,y) \in H\}|$ and $v=|\{y \colon (x,y) \in H\}|$.
  For a dense board of area $A$, we show that the maximum discrepancy is $\Theta(A^{3/4})$.
  This result is a generalization of the Brown and Spencer result for the original game.
  (iii) If $H$ consists of the elements of $G_n$ below the hyperbola $xy=n$, then its maximum discrepancy
  is $\Omega(n)$ and $O(n (\log n)^{1/2})$.</description>

      <title>Sparsest cut and eigenvalue multiplicities on low degree Abelian Cayley graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.17115</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.17115v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Whether or not the Sparsest Cut problem admits an efficient $O(1)$-approximation algorithm is a fundamental algorithmic question with connections to geometry and the Unique Games Conjecture. We design an $O(1)$-approximation algorithm to Sparsest Cut for the class of Cayley graphs over Abelian groups, running in time $n^{O(1)}\cdot \exp\{d^{O(d)}\}$ where $d$ is the degree of the graph.
  Previous work has centered on solving cut problems on graphs which are ``expander-like'' in various senses, such as being a small-set expander or having low threshold rank.
  In contrast, low-degree Abelian Cayley graphs are natural examples of non-expanding graphs far from these assumptions (e.g. the cycle). We demonstrate that spectral and semidefinite programming-based methods can still succeed in these graphs by analyzing an eigenspace enumeration algorithm which searches for a sparse cut among the low eigenspace of the Laplacian matrix. We dually interpret this algorithm as searching for a hyperplane cut in a low-dimensional embedding of the graph.
  In order to analyze the algorithm, we prove a bound of $d^{O(d)}$ on the number of eigenvalues ``near'' $\lambda_2$ for connected degree-$d$ Abelian Cayley graphs. We obtain a tight bound of $2^{\Theta(d)}$ on the multiplicity of $\lambda_2$ itself which improves on a previous bound of $2^{O(d^2)}$ by Lee and Makarychev.</description>

Abstract: The presented work focuses on problems from determinant theory, set theory and topology. The term graph is the binding element that connects these problems. Graphs are distinguished by their geometrical simplicity, which helps in showing the equivalence between various seemingly unrelated problems, besides providing solutions to several open questions discussed here.</description>

      <title>On the complexity of finding a spanning even tree in a graph</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.17307</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.17307v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A tree is said to be even if for every pair of distinct leaves, the length of the unique path between them is even. In this paper we discuss the problem of determining whether an input graph has a spanning even tree. Hofmann and Walsh [Australas. J Comb. 35, 2006] proved that this problem can be solved in polynomial time on bipartite graphs. In contrast to this, we show that this problem is NP-complete even on planar graphs. We also give polynomial-time algorithms for several restricted classes of graphs, such as split graphs, cographs, cobipartite graphs, unit interval graphs, and block graphs.</description>

      <title>On the number of $k$-mers admitting a given lexicographical minimizer</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.17492</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.17492v2 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The minimizer of a word of size $k$ (a $k$-mer) is defined as its smallest substring of size $m$ (with $m\leq k$), according to some ordering on $m$-mers. minimizers have been used in bioinformatics -- notably -- to partition sequencing datasets, binning together $k$-mers that share the same minimizer. It is folklore that using the lexicographical order lead to very unbalanced partitions, resulting in an abundant literature devoted to devising alternative orders for achieving better balanced partitions. To the best of our knowledge, the unbalanced-ness of lexicographical-based minimizer partitions has never been investigated from a theoretical point of view. In this article, we aim to fill this gap and determine, for a given minimizer, how many $k$-mers would admit the chosen minimizer -- i.e. what would be the size of the bucket associated to the chosen minimizer in the worst case, where all $k$-mers would be seen in the data. We show that this number can be computed in $O(km)$ space and $O(km^2)$ time. We further introduce approximations that can be computed in $O(k)$ space and $O(km)$ time. We also show on genomic datasets that the practical number of $k$-mers associated to a minimizer are closely correlated to the theoretical expected number. We introduce two conjectures that could help closely approximating the total number of $k$-mers sharing a minimizer. We believe that characterising the distribution of the number of $k$-mers per minimizer will help devise efficient lexicographic-based minimizer bucketting.</description>

      <title>Characterization of Double-Arborescences and their Minimum-Word-Representants</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.17642</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.17642v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A double-arborescence is a treelike comparability graph with an all-adjacent vertex. In this paper, we first give a forbidden induced subgraph characterization of double-arborescences, where we prove that double-arborescences are precisely $P_4$-free treelike comparability graphs. Then, we characterize a more general class consisting of $P_4$-free distance-hereditary graphs using split-decomposition trees. Consequently, using split-decomposition trees, we characterize double-arborescences and one of its subclasses, viz., arborescences; a double-arborescence is an arborescence if its all-adjacent vertex is a source or a sink. In the context of word-representable graphs, it is an open problem to find the classes of word-representable graphs whose minimum-word-representants are of length $2n - k$, where $n$ is the number of vertices of the graph and $k$ is its clique number. Contributing to the open problem, we devise an algorithmic procedure and show that the class of double-arborescences is one such class. It seems the class of double-arborescences is the first example satisfying the criteria given in the open problem, for an arbitrary $k$.</description>

      <title>Characterization of Word-Representable Graphs using Modular Decomposition</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.17648v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this work, we characterize the class of word-representable graphs with respect to the modular decomposition. Consequently, we determine the representation number of a word-representable graph in terms of the permutation-representation numbers of the modules and the representation number of the associated quotient graph. In this connection, we also obtain a complete answer to the open problem posed by Kitaev and Lozin on the word-representability of the lexicographical product of graphs.</description>

      <title>The Graph Coloring Game on $4\times n$-Grids</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.17668</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.17668v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The graph coloring game is a famous two-player game (re)introduced by Bodlaender in $1991$. Given a graph $G$ and $k \in \mathbb{N}$, Alice and Bob alternately (starting with Alice) color an uncolored vertex with some color in $\{1,\cdots,k\}$ such that no two adjacent vertices receive a same color. If eventually all vertices are colored, then Alice wins and Bob wins otherwise. The game chromatic number $\chi_g(G)$ is the smallest integer $k$ such that Alice has a winning strategy with $k$ colors in $G$. It has been recently (2020) shown that, given a graph $G$ and $k\in \mathbb{N}$, deciding whether $\chi_g(G)\leq k$ is PSPACE-complete. Surprisingly, this parameter is not well understood even in ``simple" graph classes. Let $P_n$ denote the path with $n\geq 1$ vertices. For instance, in the case of Cartesian grids, it is easy to show that $\chi_g(P_m \times P_n) \leq 5$ since $\chi_g(G)\leq \Delta+1$ for any graph $G$ with maximum degree $\Delta$. However, the exact value is only known for small values of $m$, namely $\chi_g(P_1\times P_n)=3$, $\chi_g(P_2\times P_n)=4$ and $\chi_g(P_3\times P_n) =4$ for $n\geq 4$ [Raspaud, Wu, 2009]. Here, we prove that, for every $n\geq 18$, $\chi_g(P_4\times P_n) =4$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.17735v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Perfect graphs can be described as the graphs whose stable set polytopes are defined by their non-negativity and clique inequalities (including edge inequalities). In 1975, Chv\'{a}tal defined an analogous class of t-perfect graphs, which are the graphs whose stable set polytopes are defined by their non-negativity, edge inequalities, and odd circuit inequalities. We show that t-perfect graphs are $199053$-colourable. This is the first finite bound on the chromatic number of t-perfect graphs and answers a question of Shepherd from 1995. Our proof also shows that every h-perfect graph with clique number $\omega$ is $(\omega + 199050)$-colourable.</description>

      <title>All Graphs with at most 8 nodes are 2-interval-PCGs</title>

      <description>arXiv:2202.13844v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A graph G is a multi-interval PCG if there exist an edge weighted tree T with non-negative real values and disjoint intervals of the non-negative real half-line such that each node of G is uniquely associated to a leaf of T and there is an edge between two nodes in G if and only if the weighted distance between their corresponding leaves in T lies within any such intervals. If the number of intervals is k, then we call the graph a k-interval-PCG; in symbols, G = k-interval-PCG (T, I1, . . . , Ik). It is known that 2-interval-PCGs do not contain all graphs and the smallest known graph outside this class has 135 nodes. Here we prove that all graphs with at most 8 nodes are 2-interval-PCGs, so doing one step towards the determination of the smallest value of n such that there exists an n node graph that is not a 2-interval-PCG.</description>

      <title>Decomposition horizons and a characterization of stable hereditary classes of graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2209.11229</link>
      <description>arXiv:2209.11229v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The notions of bounded-size and quasibounded-size decompositions with bounded treedepth base classes are central to the structural theory of graph sparsity introduced by two of the authors years ago, and provide a characterization of both classes with bounded expansions and nowhere dense classes. Strong connections of this theory with model theory led to considering first-order transductions, which are logically defined graph transformations, and to initiate a comparative study of combinatorial and model theoretical properties of graph classes, with an emphasis on the model theoretical notions of dependence (or NIP) and stability. In this paper, we first prove that every hereditary class with quasibounded-size decompositions with dependent (resp.\ stable) base classes is itself dependent (resp.\ stable). This result is obtained in a more general study of ``decomposition horizons'', which are class properties compatible with quasibounded-size decompositions. We deduce that hereditary classes with quasibounded-size decompositions with bounded shrubdepth base classes are stable. In the second part of the paper, we prove the converse. Thus, we characterize stable hereditary classes of graphs as those hereditary classes that admit quasibounded-size decompositions with bounded shrubdepth base classes. This result is obtained by proving that every hereditary stable class of graphs admits almost nowhere dense quasi-bush representations, thus answering positively a conjecture of Dreier et al. These results have several consequences. For example, we show that every graph $G$ in a stable, hereditary class of graphs $\mathscr C$ has a clique or a stable set of size $\Omega_{\mathscr C,\epsilon}(|G|^{1/2-\epsilon})$, for every $\epsilon&gt;0$, which is tight in the sense that it cannot be improved to $\Omega_{\mathscr C}(|G|^{1/2})$.</description>

      <title>Building Hamiltonian Cycles in the Semi-Random Graph Process in Less Than $2n$ Rounds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.05533</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.05533v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The semi-random graph process is an adaptive random graph process in which an online algorithm is initially presented an empty graph on $n$ vertices. In each round, a vertex $u$ is presented to the algorithm independently and uniformly at random. The algorithm then adaptively selects a vertex $v$, and adds the edge $uv$ to the graph. For a given graph property, the objective of the algorithm is to force the graph to satisfy this property asymptotically almost surely in as few rounds as possible.
  We focus on the property of Hamiltonicity. We present an adaptive strategy which creates a Hamiltonian cycle in $\alpha n$ rounds, where $\alpha &lt; 1.81696$ is derived from the solution to a system of differential equations. We also show that achieving Hamiltonicity requires at least $\beta n$ rounds, where $\beta &gt; 1.26575$.</description>

      <title>On Completely Edge-Independent Spanning Trees in Locally Twisted Cubes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.01585</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.01585v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A network can contain numerous spanning trees. If two spanning trees $T_i,T_j$ do not share any common edges, $T_i$ and $T_j$ are said to be pairwisely edge-disjoint. For spanning trees $T_1, T_2, ..., T_m$, if every two of them are pairwisely edge-disjoint, they are called completely edge-independent spanning trees (CEISTs for short). CEISTs can facilitate many network functionalities, and constructing CEISTs as maximally allowed as possible in a given network is a worthy undertaking. In this paper, we establish the maximal number of CEISTs in the locally twisted cube network, and propose an algorithm to construct $\lfloor \frac{n}{2} \rfloor$ CEISTs in $LTQ_n$, the $n$-dimensional locally twisted cube. The proposed algorithm has been actually implemented, and we present the outputs. Network broadcasting in the $LTQ_n$ was simulated using $\lfloor\frac{n}{2}\rfloor$ CEISTs, and the performance compared with broadcasting using a single tree.</description>

      <title>Generalizing the Bierbrauer-Friedman bound for orthogonal arrays</title>

Abstract: We characterize mixed-level orthogonal arrays it terms of algebraic designs in a special multigraph. We prove a mixed-level analog of the Bierbrauer--Friedman (BF) bound for pure-level orthogonal arrays and show that arrays attaining it are radius-$1$ completely regular codes (equivalently, intriguing sets, equitable $2$-partitions, perfect $2$-colorings) in the corresponding multigraph. For the case when the numbers of levels are powers of the same prime number, we characterize, in terms of multispreads, additive mixed-level orthogonal arrays attaining the BF bound. For pure-level orthogonal arrays, we consider versions of the BF bound obtained by replacing the Hamming graph by its polynomial generalization and show that in some cases this gives a new bound.
  Keywords: orthogonal array, algebraic $t$-design, mixed orthogonal array, completely-regular code, equitable partition, intriguing set, Hamming graph, Bierbrauer-Friedman bound, additive code.</description>
