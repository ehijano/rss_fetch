      <title>High Strain Rate Behavior of Liquid Crystal Elastomers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.19831</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.19831v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Liquid crystal elastomers are rubbery solids that couple liquid crystalline order and deformation. This coupling leads to properties that are attractive for a number of applications in soft robotics and energy absorption. This paper is motivated by the latter application, and provides a systematic experimental study of a particular class of liquid crystal elastomers -- the isotropic genesis polydomain liquid crystal elastomers -- over a wide range of strain rates. An important aspect of this study is a novel tensile drop-tower that enables tensile strain rates of 100 s$^{-1}$ that are important to application but previously inaccessible. The paper also extends a recently proposed constitutive model to the high strain rate regime, and shows that it can be fit to describe the observed behavior across the spectrum of examined behavior.</description>

      <title>Coupled imbibition and evaporation of droplets deposited on a nanoporous layer</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.19932</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.19932v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Liquids in hydrophilic pores of nanoscale dimensions have capillary pressures so large that they can theoretically climb several kilometers against gravity. But droplets deposited on thin nanoporous layers form imbibition fronts that stop advancing at typically a fraction of a millimeter, because of evaporation. Recently, there has been growing interest in such droplet infiltration dynamics, either as a way to study the behavior of confined fluids, or in connection with applications e.g. in water harvesting, printing, chemical delivery, actuating, sensing, etc. Here, we investigate theoretically and experimentally the spontaneous imbibition and evaporation of sessile liquid droplets into a thin porous layer with pores of nanometric dimensions (mesopores) and its dependency on the imposed relative humidity (RH). Theoretically, we provide a unified analytical approach to describe the dynamics of the imbibition annulus (halo), which corrects for a neglected coupling between imbibition and evaporation fluxes, describes halos of arbitrary dimensions with respect to droplet size, and incorporates confinement-induced thermodynamic shifts (Kelvin effect). Experimentally, we show that the timescales of halo formation diverge at a critical RH, due to the Kelvin effect. Our analysis also shows an apparent divergence of the imbibition coefficient, which cannot be explained by standard capillary models. This observation suggests an important role of vapor transport and condensation along the porous surface. Globally, our results indicate that droplet infiltration in porous layers involve complex couplings, and that one should be cautious when interpreting halo dynamics data. Our study also suggests RH as a powerful control parameter for tuning droplet imbibition behavior and infiltration patterns.</description>

      <title>Defect configuration of an active nematic around a circular obstacle</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.20069</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.20069v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Nematic liquid crystal is a complex fluid whose constituents have an anisotropic shape and exhibit orientational order. A class of active matter which exhibits orientational order, e.g., cell populations, is called active nematic. A singularity of the orientational field, called a topological defect, is a robust structure which cannot be removed by continuum deformations. This robustness plays an important role in, e.g., the process of morphogenesis. To enhance the understanding of the behavior of active nematic, it is important to understand the behavior of topological defects. In this paper, we study the configuration of topological defects of a two-dimensional active nematic around a circular obstacle. In the case of a passive nematic liquid crystal, the equilibrium configuration of defects can be easily identified by the method of image charges. In the case of an active nematic, however, one must take account of the flow field generated by active constituents, and the problem of identifying the defect configuration becomes complicated. In this study, we perform numerical simulations and investigate how the stationary defect configuration deviates from the passive case. Furthermore, we carry out a theoretical calculation based on an analytical expression relating the defect velocity with the force exerted on the defect. Our theoretical calculation qualitatively reproduces the simulation results. Our study may be applied to describing the behaviour of e.g. cell populations in the presence of obstacles, and has the potential to benefit related fields, e.g., developmental biology.</description>

      <title>Polymorphic self-poisoning in poly(lactic acid): a new phenomenon in polymer crystallization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.20370</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.20370v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Self-poisoning (SP) is ubiquitous in polymer crystallization, but has so far manifested itself visibly only as minima in growth rate vs. temperature in either monodisperse systems where e.g. unstable folded chains obstruct crystallization of stable extended chains, or in periodically segmented chains where unstable stems with n-1 segments disturb deposition of stable stems with n segments. Here we report a new type of self-poisoning found in poly(lactic acid) (PLA), where a less stable crystal form (alpha') disturbs growth of the stable form (alpha). While alpha requires strict up-down order of the polar chains, alpha' does not, hence is kinetically favoured. Unexpectedly, below the temperature of the growth rate minimum the lamellar thickness increases rather than drops, as in all other reported cases of polymer crystallization with decreasing temperature. A growth rate equation model is developed, giving good match with experiments, but revealing an unexpectedly low fold surface free energy of alpha' form. Due to SP of alpha, most practical fast-cooling processing gives the low-modulus alpha'-form grown close to Tg, explaining generally poor mechanical properties of the bio-friendly PLA.</description>

      <title>Transitions between liquid crystalline phases investigated by dielectric and infra-red spectroscopies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.20497</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.20497v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The liquid crystalline 11OS5 compound, forming the nematic phase and a few smectic phases, is investigated by broadband dielectric spectroscopy and infra-red spectroscopy. The dielectric relaxation times, ionic conductivity, and positions of infra-red absorption bands corresponding to selected intra-molecular vibrations are determined as a function of temperature in the range from isotropic liquid to a crystal phase. The correlation coefficient matrix and k-means cluster analysis of infra-red spectra are tested for detection of phase transitions. The density-functional theory calculations are carried out for interpretation of experimental infra-red spectra. The performance of various basis sets and exchange-correlation functionals is compared, including both agreement of scaled calculated band positions with experimental values and computational time. The inter-molecular interactions in the crystal phase are inferred from the experimental IR spectra and density-functional theory calculations for dimers in head-to-head and head-to-tail configurations. The experimental temperature dependence of the C=O stretching band suggests that the head-to-tail configuration in a crystal phase is more likely. A significant slowing down of the flip-flop relaxation process is observed at the transition between the smectic C and hexagonal smectic X phases.</description>

      <title>Aging in the Flow Dynamics of Dense Suspensions of Contactless Microparticles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.20618</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.20618v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study demonstrates that the free-surface flow dynamics of dense piles of contactless silica microparticles depend on the resting period prior to flow. Microfluidic rotating drum experiments reveal that longer resting times lead to delayed flow onsets and reduced flow velocities, both evolving logarithmically with the resting time. These aging-like effects are more pronounced for thermally driven creep flows in piles with initial tilting angle below the athermal angle of repose, in contrast to piles initially tilted above this repose angle, where gravity-driven flows tend to gradually erase aging effects. Moreover, we show that the packing fraction does not change during the resting period, and that aging occurs in both monodisperse and polydisperse piles, indicating that crystallization is not required for the time-dependent behavior to appear. Remarkably, vigorous agitation that re-disperses the particles fully restores the piles to their initial state, demonstrating that the observed effects are not due to sample degradation. These findings evidence a form of aging in quiescent suspensions intermediate between colloidal and granular media, where thermal fluctuations, still significant relative to particle weight, progressively stabilize the system, making it more resistant to flow and deformation.</description>

      <title>A unified picture of phonon anomalies in crystals and glasses</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.19891</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.19891v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Phonon spectra in solids often display anomalies that defy the simple Debye law, most prominently the van Hove singularity in crystals and the boson peak in glasses. Although traditionally regarded as distinct, both features are increasingly recognized as sharing a common physical origin. In a recent work, G. Ding et al. (Nat. Phys. 2025) propose a resonant-damping model that unifies these anomalies within a single framework. By coupling phonon damping to vibrational softening, their theory explains why some materials exhibit van Hove peaks, others boson peaks, and many show both. This advance extends earlier ideas and theories of Baggioli and Zaccone on the competition between phonon propagation and damping, while also connecting to microscopic mechanisms such as nonaffine motions in glasses. The resonant-damping paradigm thus offers a promising step toward a unified understanding of vibrational anomalies across ordered and disordered solids.</description>

      <title>Modelling multiscale architecture of biofilm extracellular matrix and its role in oxygen transport</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.19947</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.19947v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The extracellular matrix of biofilms presents a dense and intricate architecture. Numerous biophysical properties of the matrix surrounding microbial cells contribute to the heterogeneity of biofilms and their functions at the microscale. Previous mathematical models assume the matrix to be homogeneous, often overlooking the need for a detailed mechanistic understanding of the extracellular space. In this theoretical study, we introduce a novel cell-capsule approach to investigate geometric patterns in biofilm morphology and predict their role in oxygen transport. The thickness of the capsule and the arrangement of cell-capsule patterns can influence matrix heterogeneity, providing a clear picture of biofilm structure. By incorporating the bacterial capsule as a distinct, low-diffusivity phase, our novel cell-capsule model reveals that this architecture acts as a significant 'resistance-in-series' barrier. We found that a thick capsule/dense matrix arrangement can reduce local oxygen transfer by approximately 70%, a substantial drop that may give drive further research into oxygen limitations during early stage biofilm development.</description>

      <title>From diffusion optics to photocatalytic rates in multiply scattering porous slabs: finite-slab Green's function, optical-to-kinetic mapping, and application to core-shell aerogels with embedded anatase nanoparticles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.20315</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.20315v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We derive an end-to-end framework connecting steady-state photon transport in highly scattering porous slabs to surface-bound photocatalytic rates. Starting from the diffusion approximation (DA) with extrapolated (partial-current) boundary conditions, we solve the finite-slab Green's function with an isotropic internal plane source that rigorously maps external illumination to internal fluence. Using photon units for the fluence rate, Phi(z,lambda) [photons m-2 s-1], the local absorption is qa = mu_a * Phi and the primary carrier/radical generation is G = phi_int * qa. Site-limited and Langmuir-Hinshelwood kinetics are driven by G and closed via an accessible surface per macroscopic volume, S_accessible, yielding intrinsic volumetric (per-volume) and areal (per-area) rate constants. We then specialize to air-core/silica-shell monoliths whose shells host anatase TiO2 nanoparticles (NPs): shell refractive indices are calculated by Maxwell-Garnett/Bruggeman mixing; scattering is obtained from Mie theory (PyMieScatt); absorption follows mu_a = n_NP * sigma_abs with n_NP set by NP packing fraction in the shell. The exact slab solution reduces to a compact, design-useful predictor - our Eq. (14) - in a controlled asymptotic that clarifies when the rate scales as l*l/L (strongly diffusive, l &lt;&lt; L) versus proportional to l (optically thin, l &gt;&gt; L). We detail measurement and validation protocols (diffuse R/T inversion of mu_s' and mu_a on the same slab, boundary extrapolation accuracy, lateral-loss control) drawing on prior art, and provide a turnkey recipe to compute rates for NP packing-fraction series. The result is a reproducible workflow that preserves design simplicity while resting on a rigorous finite-slab solution.</description>

      <title>Temporal Renormalization and the Critical-like Behavior in Supercooled Liquids</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.20324</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.20324v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Inspired by the Kadanoff transformation in the standard renormalization group theory, we propose a temporal renormalization scheme. A Boltzmann factor that explicitly depends on the renormalized timescale is constructed, permitting thermodynamic quantities to be evaluated self-consistently across different timescales. By applying the scheme to the long-time dynamics of supercooled liquids, we uncover critical-like behaviors of supercooled liquid with three characteristic renormalization timescales: At the first timescale s_{\alpha}, the system appears to be "thermodynamically frozen", i.e., the energy fluctuation becomes temperature-independent throughout the supercooled regime. At the second timescale s_{\beta}, the third-order moment of energy distribution reaches a maximum, and s_{\beta} is nearly temperature-independent. At the third timescale s_{\gamma}, the third-order moment of energy distribution passes through a minimum, and s_{\gamma} diverges as a power law s_{\gamma}=(T-T_{c})^(-{\gamma}). The scaling relations may reveal an intrinsic behavior in supercooled liquids, highlighting their unique feature. The current findings also demonstrate that temporal renormalization provides a powerful lens for investigating the timescale-specific dynamics.</description>

      <title>Dynamic principles of concentration buffering through liquid-liquid phase separation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.20553</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.20553v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Living systems must maintain robust biochemical function despite fluctuations that span a wide range of timescales. Biomolecular condensates formed by liquid-liquid phase separation (LLPS) have been shown to buffer concentration fluctuations, but the principles governing their dynamic regulation remain unclear. We address this by probing the response of LLPS to oscillatory perturbations that mimic fluctuations across different timescales, establishing the first systematic frequency-domain analysis of concentration buffering by condensates. We find that condensates act as frequency-selective filters: the perturbed dilute phase behaves as a high-pass filter, while the dense phase attenuates both low- and high-frequency perturbations. We establish quantitative links between LLPS parameters including interaction strength, droplet size, and molecular diffusivity, and the timescale range over which condensates effectively buffer concentration fluctuations. These findings establish the fundamental dynamical limits of concentration buffering by LLPS, with implications for how cells may use LLPS to adapt to fluctuating environments and for the design of synthetic condensates with programmable control properties.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2504.13073v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The self-assembly of complex structures from engineered subunits is a major goal of nanotechnology, but controlling their size becomes increasingly difficult in larger assemblies. Existing strategies present significant challenges, among which the use of multiple subunit types or the precise control of their shape and mechanics. Here we introduce an alternative approach based on identical subunits whose interactions promote crystals, but also favor crystalline defects. We theoretically show that topological restrictions on the scope of these defects in large assemblies imply that the assembly size is controlled by the magnitude of the defect-inducing interaction. Using DNA origami, we experimentally demonstrate both size and shape control in two-dimensional disk- and fiber-like assemblies. Our basic concept of defect engineering could be generalized well beyond these simple examples, and thus provide a broadly applicable scheme to control self-assembly.</description>

      <title>Tracking shear mode dynamics across the glass transition in a 2D colloidal system</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.16678v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Long-wavelength collective shear dynamics are profoundly different in solids and liquids. According to the theoretical framework developed by Maxwell and Frenkel, collective shear waves vanish upon melting by acquiring a characteristic wave-vector gap, known as the $k$-gap. While this prediction has been supported by numerous simulations, experimental validation remains limited. Moreover, this phenomenon has been never tested across a continuous glass transition between a liquid phase and a glassy state with large but finite viscosity. In this work, we track the dispersion relation of collective shear modes in a two-dimensional colloidal system and provide direct experimental evidence for the emergence of a $k$-gap. This gap opens continuously at an effective temperature consistent with the onset of the glass transition and the vanishing of the static shear modulus. By extracting the instantaneous shear velocity from the experimental data, we uncover a shear relaxation time exhibiting a super-Arrhenius temperature dependence characteristic of glass-forming materials, accurately described by the Vogel-Fulcher-Tammann (VFT) relation. Our results confirm the predictions of the Maxwell-Frenkel framework and highlight their relevance across continuous melting processes originating from low-temperature amorphous solid phases.</description>

      <title>Optical Voltammetry of redox processes inside a nanohole with Opto-iontronic microscopy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.01815</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.01815v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Cyclic Voltammetry (CV) is the most commonly used method in electrochemistry to characterize electrochemical reactions, usually involving macroscopic electrodes. Here we demonstrate a novel optical CV technique called Opto-iontronic Microscopy, which is capable of monitoring electrochemical processes at the nanoscale. By integrating optical microscopy with nanohole electrodes, we enhance sensitivity in detecting redox reactions within volumes as small as an attoliter ($(100 \text{~nm})^{3}$). This technique uses total internal reflection (TIR) illumination, Electric-double-layer modulation, cyclic voltammetry, and lock-in detection, to probe ion dynamics inside nanoholes. We applied this method to study EDL (dis)charging coupled to ferrocenedimethanol (Fc(MeOH)$_2$) redox reactions. Experimental results were validated against a theoretical Poisson-Nernst-Planck-Butler-Volmer (PNP-BV) model, providing insights into ion concentration changes of reaction species that contribute to the optical contrast. This work opens up opportunities for high-sensitivity, label-free analysis of electrochemical reactions in nanoconfined environments, with potential applications in pure nanocrystal growth and monitoring, and potentially single-molecule electrochemistry.</description>

      <title>Self-Organization and Cyclic Positioning of Active Condensates</title>

Abstract: Active transport of biomolecular condensates and cell migration in collectives are fundamental to development, homeostasis, and processes such as cancer progression, wound healing, and infection response. Yet how these assemblies are positioned, regulated, and driven through cycles of dissolution and reassembly is not fully understood. We address this using a model of attractive active Brownian particles (ABPs). Using Brownian dynamics simulations, we show that these particles undergo liquid-gas phase separation, and spatially varying activity fields induce striking emergent dynamics. Droplets migrate up activity gradients, and above a critical activity, they fragment into a gas phase. The gas then migrates down the gradient, and droplets reassemble, yielding robust positioning cycles. This emergent condensate cycle arises without biochemical feedback loops and relies only on the interplay of attractions, motility, and gradients. In binary mixtures of active-passive particles, differential cohesion leads to self-sorting of particles, where strongly-cohesive ABPs compact into dense cores surrounded by peripheries enriched with weakly-cohesive passive particles. The passive particles stabilize the dynamic clusters of ABPs, and they migrate toward high-activity regions. Our findings suggest a generic mechanism for spatial control and turnover of condensates in biology.</description>

      <title>Energy-based opinion on the correlation between stress drop and rupture speed</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.08016</link>
      <description>arXiv:2304.08016v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Stress drop $\Delta\tau$ and rupture speed $V_r$ are two important earthquake source parameters that control the characteristics of rupture process and the associated ground motion. However, how the two parameters correlate with one another is not fully clear and sometimes can be controversial. Here I propose using the energy balance relation derived from fracture mechanics to understand the correlation between $\Delta\tau$ and $V_r$. The central idea is to explore the balance between fracture energy $G_c$ and dynamic energy release rate $G_d$ (which itself is a function of $\Delta\tau$ and $V_r$) under various conditions of $G_c$. Using averaged values of $\Delta\tau$ and $V_r$ for comparison, it is shown that near constant $G_c$ can yield a positive correlation between $\Delta\tau$ and $V_r$, whereas variable $G_c$ dependent on space, time or other factors may cause a negative correlation between $\Delta\tau$ and $V_r$. These results suggest a need to examine the condition of other factors (such as $G_c$) when evaluating the correlation between $\Delta\tau$ and $V_r$. Extra issues can complicate the evaluation of the correlation between $\Delta\tau$ and $V_r$ when rupture process is inferred from far-field observations, accompanied by strong spatiotemporal variation, or followed by additional phases, which should be investigated by future studies.</description>

      <title>Unifying same- and different-material particle charging through stochastic scaling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.23775</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.23775v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Triboelectric charging of insulating particles through contact is critical in diverse physical and engineering processes, from dust storms and volcanic eruptions to industrial powder handling. However, many experiments over the years have consistently revealed counterintuitive charging patterns, including variable impact charge under identical conditions, charge sign reversal with repeated impacts, and bipolar charging of differently sized particles. Existing computational models cannot predict these patterns; they either rely on oversimplified heuristics or require inaccessible detailed surface properties. We present a stochastic scaling model (SSM) for particle charging that unifies same-material (particle-particle) and different-material (particle-wall) charging in a single theoretical framework. The model grounds in a physics-based stochastic closure by the mean, variance, skewness, and minimum impact charge measured in a highly-controlled reference experiment. To test the SSM, we implemented it in an open-source Lagrangian-Eulerian CFD solver. When simulating 300 000 insulating particles transported by turbulent wall-bounded flows, the SSM takes less than 0.01% of the CPU time. By scaling the statistical parameters of the reference impact to each collision, the new model reproduces the complex charging patterns observed in experiments without requiring surface-level first-principles inputs. The SSM offers a physically grounded route to large-scale simulations of electrostatic effects across many fields of particle-laden flows.</description>

      <title>Compressed self-avoiding walks in two and three dimensions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.11433</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.11433v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We consider the phase transition induced by compressing a self-avoiding walk in a slab where the walk is attached to both walls of the slab in two and three dimensions, and the resulting phase once the polymer is compressed. The process of moving between a stretched situation where the walls pull apart to a compressed scenario is a phase transition with some similarities to that induced by pulling and pushing the end of the polymer. However, there are key differences in that the compressed state is expected to behave like a lower dimensional system, which is not the case when the force pushes only on the endpoint of the polymer. We use scaling arguments to predict the exponents both of those associated with the phase transition and those in the compressed state and find good agreement with Monte Carlo simulations.</description>

      <title>Irreversibility in scalar active turbulence: The role of topological defects</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.06073</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.06073v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In many active systems, swimmers collectively stir the surrounding fluid to stabilize some self-sustained vortices. The resulting nonequilibrium state is often referred to as active turbulence, by analogy with the turbulence of passive fluids under external stirring. Although active turbulence clearly operates far from equilibrium, it can be challenging to pinpoint which emergent features primarily control the deviation from an equilibrium reversible dynamics. Here, we reveal that dynamical irreversibility essentially stems from singularities in the active stress. Specifically, considering the coupled dynamics of the swimmer density and the stream function, we demonstrate that the symmetries of vortical flows around defects determine the overall irreversibility. Our detailed analysis leads to identifying specific configurations of defect pairs as the dominant contribution to irreversibility.</description>

      <title>Quantifying when hyperuniformity of a many-particle system leads to uniformity across length scales</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.20831</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.20831v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Hyperuniform systems are distinguished by an unusually strong suppression of large-scale density fluctuations and, consequently, display a high degree of uniformity at the largest length scales. In some cases, however, enhanced uniformity is expected to be present even at intermediate and possibly small length scales. There exist three different classes of hyperuniform systems, where class I and class III are the strongest and weakest forms, respectively. We utilize the local number variance $\sigma_N^2(R)$ associated with a window of radius $R$ as a diagnostic to quantify the approach to the asymptotic large-$R$ hyperuniform scaling of a variety of class I, II, and III systems. We find, for all class I systems we analyzed, including crystals, quasicrystals, disordered stealthy hyperuniform systems, and the one-component plasma, a faster approach to the asymptotic scaling of $\sigma_N^2(R)$, governed by corrections with integer powers of $1/R$. Thus, we conclude this represents the highest degree of effective uniformity from small to large length scales. Class II systems, such as Fermi-sphere point processes, are characterized by logarithmic $1/\ln(R)$ corrections and, consequently, a lower degree of local uniformity. Class III systems, such as perturbed lattice patterns, present an asymptotic scaling of $1/R^{\alpha}$, $0 &lt; \alpha &lt; 1$, implying, curiously, an intermediate degree of local uniformity. In addition, our study provides insight into when experimental and numerical finite systems are representative of large-scale behavior. Our findings may thereby facilitate the design of hyperuniform systems with enhanced physical properties arising from local uniformity.</description>
