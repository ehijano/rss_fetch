      <title>SepAl: Sepsis Alerts On Low Power Wearables With Digital Biomarkers and On-Device Tiny Machine Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.08316</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.08316v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Sepsis is a lethal syndrome of organ dysfunction that is triggered by an infection and claims 11 million lives per year globally. Prognostic algorithms based on deep learning have shown promise in detecting the onset of sepsis hours before the actual event but use a large number of bio-markers, including vital signs and laboratory tests. The latter makes the deployment of such systems outside hospitals or in resource-limited environments extremely challenging. This paper introduces SepAl, an energy-efficient and lightweight neural network, using only data from low-power wearable sensors, such as photoplethysmography (PPG), inertial measurement units (IMU), and body temperature sensors, designed to deliver alerts in real-time. SepAl leverages only six digitally acquirable vital signs and tiny machine learning algorithms, enabling on-device real-time sepsis prediction.
  SepAl uses a lightweight temporal convolution neural network capable of providing sepsis alerts with a median predicted time to sepsis of 9.8 hours. The model has been fully quantized, being able to be deployed on any low-power processors, and evaluated on an ARM Cortex-M33 core. Experimental evaluations show an inference efficiency of 0.11MAC/Cycle and a latency of 143ms, with an energy per inference of 2.68mJ. This work aims at paving the way toward accurate disease prediction, deployable in a long-lasting multi-vital sign wearable device, suitable for providing sepsis onset alerts at the point of care.

      <title>Distilling High Diagnostic Value Patches for Whole Slide Image Classification Using Attention Mechanism</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.19821</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.19821v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Multiple Instance Learning (MIL) has garnered widespread attention in the field of Whole Slide Image (WSI) classification as it replaces pixel-level manual annotation with diagnostic reports as labels, significantly reducing labor costs. Recent research has shown that bag-level MIL methods often yield better results because they can consider all patches of the WSI as a whole. However, a drawback of such methods is the incorporation of more redundant patches, leading to interference. To extract patches with high diagnostic value while excluding interfering patches to address this issue, we developed an attention-based feature distillation multi-instance learning (AFD-MIL) approach. This approach proposed the exclusion of redundant patches as a preprocessing operation in weakly supervised learning, directly mitigating interference from extensive noise. It also pioneers the use of attention mechanisms to distill features with high diagnostic value, as opposed to the traditional practice of indiscriminately and forcibly integrating all patches. Additionally, we introduced global loss optimization to finely control the feature distillation module. AFD-MIL is orthogonal to many existing MIL methods, leading to consistent performance improvements. This approach has surpassed the current state-of-the-art method, achieving 91.47% ACC (accuracy) and 94.29% AUC (area under the curve) on the Camelyon16 (Camelyon Challenge 2016, breast cancer), while 93.33% ACC and 98.17% AUC on the TCGA-NSCLC (The Cancer Genome Atlas Program: non-small cell lung cancer). Different feature distillation methods were used for the two datasets, tailored to the specific diseases, thereby improving performance and interpretability.</description>
