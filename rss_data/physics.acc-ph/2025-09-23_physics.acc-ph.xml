      <title>Polarization Transmission in the Electron-Ion Collider's Hadron Storage Ring</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.18558</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.18558v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The successful operation of the future Electron-Ion Collider is contingent on maintaining high hadron beam polarization up to 275 GeV. The Hadron Storage Ring lattice, however, features a symmetry-breaking interaction region that excites strong, non-systematic spin resonances, posing a significant threat to polarization preservation. This paper systematically investigates two complementary strategies to ensure high polarization transmission. The first method involves optimizing the vertical betatron phase advance between Siberian snakes to orchestrate a cancellation of depolarizing kicks across the ring. We demonstrate through simulations that both dynamic and fixed-optics solutions based on this principle can successfully preserve polarization through the strongest resonances. The second, more powerful approach involves optimizing the snake rotation axes to suppress resonance driving terms at their source. We revisit established symmetric configurations, such as the Lee-Courant schemes, and introduce a novel, highly symmetric ``Doubly Lee-Courant" (DLC) scheme, which enforces a local \(\pi\) spin phase advance across every consecutive pair of snakes. Our analysis reveals a clear performance hierarchy, with the DLC configuration providing an exceptionally robust and energy-insensitive baseline for polarization preservation. We conclude that a hybrid strategy, using a DLC snake scheme as a symmetric foundation and betatron phase tuning for fine corrections, offers the most effective path forward for the EIC and future high-energy polarized beam facilities.</description>

      <title>Impact of Nitrogen and Oxygen Interstitials on Niobium SRF Cavity Performance</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.18564</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.18564v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Superconducting radio-frequency (SRF) cavities are the leading technology for highly efficient particle acceleration, and their performance can be significantly enhanced through the controlled introduction of interstitial impurities into bulk niobium. Nitrogen doping has demonstrated a substantial reduction in surface resistance losses, which improves the quality factor of the cavities. More recently, oxygen doping has emerged as a promising alternative, demonstrating comparable reductions in surface resistance. In this study, we combine cavity measurements on \SI{1.3}{GHz} niobium SRF cavities subjected to a range of nitrogen- and oxygen-based treatments with material characterizations performed on cavity cutouts processed under identical conditions. This approach allows us to quantitatively assess the contribution of each impurity to the reduction of surface resistance. We find that nitrogen is ten times more effective than oxygen in reducing surface resistance at \SI{16}{MV/m}. We propose a model to explain this variation, suggesting that nitrogen more effectively traps hydrogen, thus suppressing the formation of niobium hydrides within the RF penetration layer and enabling an improved superconducting gap.</description>

      <title>The CEPC Clock Issue and Finetuning of the Circumference</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.19026</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.19026v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The CEPC clock issue is related with the RF frequency coordination between the various accelerator systems and may affect the operation modes of both the accelerator and the detector. The timing structure of CEPC has been restudied with the collaboration of the accelerator team and the detector team. After discussions between two sides, the CEPC bunch structure is set such that the spacings between adjacent bunches in any CEPC operation mode are integer numbers of 23.08 ns. The master CEPC clock will be provided by the accelerator to the detector systems with a frequency of 43.33 MHz, synchronous to the beam. The CEPC detector system relies on the clock to sample physics signal at the right time. It was found that if the circumference of CEPC is slightly changed to 99955.418 m, not only is the orbit length closer to 100 km, but also the detector would benefit more for the first 10-year operation.</description>

      <title>On the Overestimation of Efficiency in Relativistic Electron Scattering</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.19193</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.19193v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent reviews in ultrafast electron diffraction (UED) have claimed that relativistic electrons exhibit enhanced elastic scattering efficiency, frequently quantified as a \gamma^2 increase in the differential cross section. These claims, however, originate from angular-domain analyses that overlook the compression of scattering angles \theta with increasing electron energy, leading to an apparent, but artificial, enhancement. In this work, we recast the problem in momentum-transfer space q, where scattering is accurately accounted for. This transformation eliminates the angular compression artefact and reveals that high-energy scaling follows a simple \beta^{-2} dependence, with no intrinsic relativistic gain. We demonstrate this by directly integrating relativistic differential elastic-scattering cross sections from ELSEPA and by applying a straightforward transformation of the well-known Mott-Massey formalism into q-space. The results are general, with calculations performed for elements from carbon to gold and for energies between 50 keV and 5000 keV. They reproduce the long-established trend in total elastic scattering cross sections, in which scattering strength decreases with increasing electron kinetic energy. Practically, at energies above roughly 50 keV, scattering is already dominated by the forward direction, and most of the scattered intensity falls within the acceptance range of typical UED detectors. These findings correct a widespread misconception in the UED literature and provide a more accurate and intuitive framework for interpreting and optimizing high-energy electron scattering experiments.</description>
