      <title>Applying a Gaussian networking theory to model motor-driven transport along cytoskeletal filaments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.03671</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.03671v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper builds on a recently introduced dynamical networking framework, applying it to model motor-driven transport along cytoskeletal filament networks. Within this approach, the networking functional describes the periodic binding and unbinding of motors to available filament sites,whilst accounting for all possible pairing, enabling a field-theoretic treatment of constrained motion in complex networks. In this application, the dynamical networking theory is introduced into a Martin-Siggia-Rose representation of the Langevin dynamics describing the motion of a motor protein and its cargo. Results are presented in a collective description of motors on a network, for two different scenarios, namely homogeneous and non-homogeneous networks. A diffusion coefficient is presented for homogeneous networks, whilst it is shown that various possibilities remain for disordered averaging over network densities for non-homogeneous networks.</description>

      <title>Orientational phase transitions induced by two-patch interactions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.03981</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.03981v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: For two-patch particles in two dimensions, we find that the coupling of anisotropic patchy interactions and the triangular lattice leads to novel phase behaviors. For asymmetric patch-patch (PP) and nonpatch-nonpatch (NN) interactions, the system has dual orientationally ordered phases of the same symmetry, intermediated by a nematic phase. Both phase transitions from the nematic phase to dual ordered phases are continuous and belong to the same universality class, and they lead to highly nonmonotonic variations of the nematic order parameter. The system becomes disordered at high temperature through another continuous transition. When the PP and NN interactions become symmetric, the system has subextensive ground-state entropy, and with increasing temperature it undergoes two Berezinskii-Kosterlitz-Thouless phase transitions, with a critical phase connecting a nematic phase and a disordered phase. These results open up new opportunities for designing patchy interactions to study orientational phase transitions and critical phenomena.</description>

      <title>Directed evolution effectively selects for DNA based physical reservoir computing networks capable of multiple tasks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.04000</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.04000v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: DNA and other biopolymers are being investigated as new computing substrates and alternative to silicon-based digital computers. However, the established top-down design of biomolecular interaction networks remains challenging and does not fully exploit biomolecular self-assembly capabilities. Outside of the field of computation directed evolution has been used as a tool for goal directed optimization of DNA sequences. Here, we propose integrating directed evolution with DNA-based reservoir computing to enable in-material optimization and adaptation. Simulations of colloidal beads networks connected via DNA strands demonstrate a physical reservoir capable of non-linear time-series prediction tasks, including Volterra series and Mackey-Glass chaotic dynamics. Reservoir computing performance, quantified by normalized mean squared error (NMSE), strongly depends on network topology, suggesting task-specific optimal network configurations. Implementing genetic algorithms to evolve DNA-encoded network connectivity effectively identified well-performing reservoir networks. Directed evolution improved reservoir performance across multiple tasks, outperforming random network selection. Remarkably, sequential training on distinct tasks resulted in reservoir populations maintaining performance on prior tasks. Our findings indicate DNA-bead networks offer sufficient complexity for reservoir computing, and that directed evolution robustly optimizes performance.</description>

      <title>Simulation of Lateral Impulse Induced Inertial Dilation at the Surface of a Vacuum-Exposed Granular Assembly</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.04074</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.04074v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We demonstrate for the first time that a lateral impulse experienced by a granular channel can induce an inertial bulk dilation over long distances across a granular medium with a mechanically free surface. The surface dilation requires zero overburden pressure (exposure to vacuum) and is precipitated by the passing of waves traveling barely above the sound speed (&gt; Mach 1.05). We simulate this phenomenon using open source Soft Sphere Discrete Element Method (SSDEM) software. We prepare channels of monodisperse, cohesive spherical particles exposed to vacuum and modeled as Hertzian springs. We validate our model by recreating acoustic wave, strong shock, and shear dilation behavior. We then create shocks within the channel to determine the sensitivity of surface dilation to wave speed, wave type, initial packing fraction, and boundary effects. The shocks we create undergo a rapid decay in strength and appear to propagate as solitary waves that can be sustained across the channel. We find that an inertial surface dilation is induced by compressive solitary waves, is insensitive to channel length, increases with bed height, and increases substantially with initial packing fraction. A hard subsurface floor is required to maintain this wave over the entire channel. Free surface dilation induced by laterally propagating impulse loading could be implicated in the formation of Lunar Cold Spots, distal regions of low thermal inertia surrounding young craters on the Moon.</description>

      <title>Depletion-Induced Interactions Modulate Nanoscale Protein Diffusion in Polymeric Crowder Solutions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.04087</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.04087v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Macromolecular crowding plays a crucial role in modulating protein dynamics in cellular and in vitro environments. Polymeric crowders such as dextran and Ficoll are known to induce entropic forces, including depletion interactions, that promote structural organization, but the nanoscale consequences for protein dynamics remain less well understood. Here, we employ megahertz X-ray photon correlation spectroscopy (MHz-XPCS) at the European XFEL to probe the dynamics of the protein ferritin in solutions containing sucrose, dextran, and Ficoll. We find that depletion-driven short-range attractions combined with long-range repulsions give rise to intermediate-range order (IRO) once the polysaccharide overlap concentration $c^*$ is exceeded. These IRO features fluctuate on microsecond to millisecond timescales, strongly modulating the collective dynamics of ferritin. The magnitude of these effects depends sensitively on crowder type, concentration, and molecular weight. Normalizing the crowder concentration by $c^*$ reveals scaling behavior in ferritin self-diffusion with a crossover near 2$c^*$, marking a transition from depletion-enhanced mobility to viscosity-dominated slowing. Our results demonstrate that bulk properties alone cannot account for protein dynamics in crowded solutions, underscoring the need to include polymer-specific interactions and depletion theory in models of crowded environments.</description>

      <title>Shape spectra of elastic shells with surface-adsorbed semiflexible polymers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.04138</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.04138v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The shape of biological shells, such as cell nuclei, membranes, and vesicles, often deviates from a perfect sphere due to an interplay of complex interactions with a myriad of molecular structures. In particular, semiflexible biopolymers adsorbed to the surfaces of such shells seem to affect their morphological properties. While the effect of a single, long, semiflexible chain is relatively well characterized, the mechanisms by which a high density of such surface-adsorbed polymers can alter the morphology of a spherical, soft confinement, akin to biological shells, remain relatively poorly understood. Here, we use coarse-grained molecular dynamics simulations to investigate how surface adsorption of many semiflexible polymers affects the morphology of a pressurized bead-spring shell, which is spherical in the absence of these chains. By varying the attraction strength between the chains and the shell surface, chain concentration, and the polymerization degree of chains, we demonstrate that strong surface localization of the chains can induce severe shape distortions and shrinkage, depending on the chain length and concentration. Conversely, weak localization does not induce significant shape fluctuations, yet nematically ordered phases appear on the surface. Notably, these ordered phases lead to elliptic shell shapes for chains with sizes comparable to or longer than the radius of the confinement when the elastic shell is composed of extensible, harmonic bonds. Overall, our findings offer a strategy to control the shape of synthetic shells by manipulating peripheral localization and length of semiflexible polymers while suggesting a mechanism for non-spherical shapes appearing in some biological systems.</description>

      <title>Classical density functional theory for nanoparticle-laden droplets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.04149</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.04149v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Droplets of a pure fluid, such as water, in an open container surrounded by gas, are thermodynamically unstable and evaporate quickly. In a recent paper [Archer et al. J. Chem. Phys. {\bf 159}, 194403 (2023)] we employed lattice density functional theory (DFT) to demonstrate that nanoparticles or solutes dissolved in a liquid droplet can make it thermodynamically stable against evaporation. In this study, we extend our model by using continuum DFT, which allows for a more accurate description of the fluid and nanoparticle density distributions within the droplet and enables us to consider size ratios between nanoparticles and solvent particles up to 10:1. While the results of the continuum DFT agrees well with those of our earlier lattice DFT findings, our approach here allows us to refine our understanding of the stability and structure of nanoparticle laden droplets. This is particularly relevant in light of the recent global COVID-19 pandemic, which has underscored the critical role of aerosol particles in virus transmission. Understanding the stability and lifetime of these viron-laden aerosols is crucial for assessing their impact on airborne disease spread.</description>

      <title>Thermodynamic Basis of Sugar-Dependent Polymer Stabilization: Informing Biologic Formulation Design</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.04301</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.04301v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The stabilization of macromolecules is fundamental to developing biological formulations, such as vaccines and protein therapeutics. In this study, we employ coarse grained polymer models to investigate the impact of four sugars: {\alpha}-glucose, {\beta}-fructose, trehalose, and sucrose on macromolecule stability. Free energy decomposition and preferential interaction analysis indicate that polymer-sugar interactions favor folding at low concentrations while driving unfolding at higher concentrations. In contrast, the polymer-solvent soft interaction entropy consistently favors unfolding across all sugar concentrations under study. At low sugar concentrations, polymer-solvent interactions predominantly govern stabilization, whereas at higher concentrations, entropic penalties dictate polymer stability. Local mixing entropy demonstrates that binary sugar mixtures introduce entropic contributions that preferentially stabilize the folded state. These findings contribute to a more nuanced understanding of sugar-based excipient stabilization mechanisms, offering guidance for the rational design of stable biological formulations.</description>

      <title>Control of lumen morphology by lateral and basal cell surfaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.04316</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.04316v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Across development, the morphology of fluid-filled lumina enclosed by epithelial tissues arises from an interplay of lumen pressure, mechanics of the cell cortex, and cell-cell adhesion. Here, we explore the mechanical basis for the control of this interplay using the shape space of MDCK cysts and the instability of their apical surfaces under tight junction perturbations [Mukenhirn et al., Dev. Cell 59, 2886 (2024)]. We discover that the cysts respond to these perturbations by significantly modulating their lateral and basal tensions, in addition to the known modulations of pressure and apical belt tension. We develop a mean-field three-dimensional vertex model of these cysts that reproduces the experimental shape instability quantitatively. This reveals that the observed increase of lateral contractility is a cellular response that counters the instability. Our work thus shows how regulation of the mechanics of all cell surfaces conspires to control lumen morphology.</description>

      <title>Forced silo discharge: Simulation and theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.04368</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.04368v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study, through discrete element simulations, the discharge of granular materials through a circular orifice on the base of a cylindrical silo forced by a surcharge. At the beginning of the discharge, for a high granular column, the flow rate $Q_{\rm ini}$ scales as in the Beverloo equation for free discharge. However, we find that the flow rate $Q_{\rm end}$ attained at the end of the forced discharge scales as $\sqrt{\rho_b P}D_o^3/D_s$, with $\rho_b$ the bulk density, $P$ the pressure applied by the overweight, $D_o$ the orifice diameter and $D_s$ the silo diameter. We use the work$-$energy theorem to formulate an equation for the flow rate $Q_{\rm end}$ that predicts the scalings only in part. We discuss the new challenges offered by the phenomenology of strongly forced granular flows.</description>

      <title>Nanometer-precision tracking of adipocyte dynamics via single lipid droplet whispering-gallery optical resonances</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.04201v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Biophotonics-and more recently, biointegrated photonics-offer transformative tools for probing cellular processes with unprecedented precision. Among these, whispering gallery mode (WGM) resonators-optical microcavities formed in spherical structures-have emerged as powerful biosensors and intracellular barcodes. Lipid droplets (LDs), with their high refractive index and intrinsic spherical geometry, are ideal candidates for supporting intracellular lasing. Although lasing in LDs has been previously demonstrated, it has not yet been harnessed to study live cell biology. Here, we report the first use of WGM resonances in LDs of live primary adipocytes, employing a continuous-wave (CW) laser at powers below the biological damage threshold. By measuring these resonances, we achieved nanometer-scale precision in size estimation, enabling real-time observation of rapid LD dynamics and deformations on the minute scale, far beyond the spatio-temporal resolution of conventional microscopy. We systematically characterized this photonic sensing approach, demonstrating its ability to resolve adipocyte heterogeneity, monitor lipolytic responses to forskolin and isoproterenol, and detect early signs of cell viability loss, well before conventional assays. This proof-of-concept establishes intracellular LD WGM resonances as a robust platform for investigating live single-cell metabolism. The technique enables rapid, cost-effective assessment of adipocyte function, reveals cell-to-cell variability obscured by bulk assays, and lays the foundation for high-throughput analysis of metabolism- and obesity-related diseases at both cellular and tissue levels.</description>

      <title>Hyperuniformity and conservation laws in non-equilibrium systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.04242</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.04242v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We demonstrate that hyperuniformity, the suppression of density fluctuations at large length scales, emerges generically from the interplay between conservation laws and non-equilibrium driving. The underlying mechanism for this emergence is analogous to self-organized criticality. Based on this understanding, we introduce four non-equilibrium models that consistently demonstrate hyperuniformity. Furthermore, we show that systems with an arbitrary number of conserved mass multipole moments exhibit an arbitrary strong tunable hyperuniform scaling, with the structure factor following $S(k) \sim k^m$, where $m$ is set by the number of conserved multipoles. Finally, we find that hyperuniformity arising from a combination of conserved noise and partially conserved average motion is not robust against non-linear perturbations. These results highlight the central role of conservation laws in stabilizing hyperuniformity and reveal a unifying mechanism for its emergence in non-equilibrium systems.</description>

      <title>The influence of the Casimir effect on the binding potential for 3D wetting</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.04418</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.04418v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We provide comprehensive details of how a previously overlooked entropic, or low temperature Casimir contribution, $W_C$, to the total binding potential for 3D short-ranged wetting may be determined from a microscopic Landau-Ginzburg-Wilson Hamiltonian. The entropic contribution comes from the many microscopic configurations corresponding to a given interfacial one, which arise from bulk-like fluctuations about the mean-field (MF) constrained profile, and adds to the usual MF contribution $W_{MF}$. We determine the functional dependence of $W_C$ on the interface (and wall) shape using a boundary integral method which can be cast as a diagrammatic expansion with each diagram corresponding to successively higher-order exponentially decaying contributions. The decay of $W_C$ is qualitatively different for first-order and critical wetting with the change in form occurring at the MF tricritical point. Including the Casimir contribution to the binding potential preserves the global surface phase diagram but changes, radically, predictions for fluctuation effects at first-order and tricritical wetting, even when capillary-wave fluctuations are not considered.</description>

      <title>Finite Disorder Critical Point in Brittle-to-Ductile Transition in Amorphous Solids with Aspherical Impurities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.01002</link>
      <description>arXiv:2307.01002v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Enhancing the mechanical properties of amorphous solids is crucial for material design, with microalloying being a common but not well-understood method. Using extensive molecular dynamics simulations, we investigate the effect of impurity particles on the yielding transition of amorphous solids in the context of brittle-ductile transition with microalloying. Spherical impurities larger than the constitutive particles enhance the systems mechanical stability, leading to a higher yield strain and increased brittleness. Much more potent effects are observed for rod-shaped impurities of the same size as the spherical impurities, with an aspect ratio slightly larger than one, which primarily introduce rotational degrees of freedom into the system. However, as the aspect ratio increases, their rotational degrees of freedom decrease, causing a more brittle yielding with more localized shear band formation. It is remarkable to see how freezing the rotational degrees of freedom can create extremely brittle, yet remarkably stable amorphous solids. Enhancing brittleness through higher concentrations of aspherical impurities presents an intriguing opportunity to explore the ductile-to-brittle transition, which is easily accessible in experiments, particularly in colloidal experiments. Our thorough finite-size scaling analysis has revealed a compelling suggestion of a finite-disorder critical point: a boundary between ductile and brittle behaviors.</description>

      <title>Active assembly and non-reciprocal dynamics of elastic membranes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.14699</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.14699v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Equilibrium self-assembly and conventional materials processing techniques fall far short of mimicking dynamic self-actuating processes that are commonplace throughout biology. To bridge the gap between living and synthetic matter, we study adhesive non-thermal fibers immersed in an active fluid. Autonomous chaotic flows power non-equilibrium fiber dynamics, inducing their collisions, generating connections, and weaving a membrane-shaped elastic network. This active assembly generates a hierarchy of shapes, structures, and dynamical processes spanning nanometers to centimeters. Ultimately, it generates an active membrane that exhibits global limit cycles induced by a non-reciprocal coupling between the elastic membrane deformations and the alignment axis of the polar active fluid. Our work merges self-assembly with active matter, demonstrating self-processing materials wherein hierarchical life-like structures and dynamics emerge from an initially structureless suspension.</description>

      <title>Hydrodynamics of chiral nematics in a channel and sudden contraction geometry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.11933</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.11933v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This study investigates the influence of chirality, viscous effects, and confinement geometry on the flow dynamics and defect structures of cholesteric liquid crystals (CLCs) using numerical simulations. As chiral strength increases, $\pi$-twist defects form at low chirality and progressively organize into hexagonal domains resembling blue phase--like (BP-like) structures at higher chirality. At sufficiently high chirality and aspect ratios, skyrmion-like configurations emerge, indicating the formation of dynamic analogs of equilibrium phases under flow. Sudden contraction geometries reveal how aspect ratio and elastic interactions promote flow disturbances and defect development. Analyses of velocity and scalar order parameter ($S$) distributions demonstrate strong coupling between molecular alignment and hydrodynamic fields, with localized vortices forming around $\tau^-$ defects in regions of low $S$ and velocity. Temporal evaluations of velocity fluctuations uncover chaotic flow regimes at low Ericksen numbers, characterized by irregular defect motion and skewed probability density functions. These findings offer new insights into CLC structure formation and flow behavior, with potential applications in defect engineering, microfluidics, soft robotics, and photonic materials.</description>

      <title>Thomson problem on a spherical cap</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.17625</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.17625v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate the low-energy configurations of N mutually repelling charges confined to a spherical cap and interacting via the Coulomb potential. In the continuum limit, this problem was solved by Lord Kelvin, who found a non-uniform charge distribution with an integrable singularity at the boundary. To explore the discrete analogue, we developed an efficient numerical method that enables energy minimization while maintaining the number of charges at the cap's edge fixed. Using this approach we have obtained numerical results for various values of N and cap angular widths. Based on these results, we analyze the emergence and behavior of topological defects as functions of both N and the cap's curvature.</description>

      <title>Fluctuation theorem and optimal control of an active tracking particle with information processing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.21487</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.21487v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Living systems often function with regulatory interactions, but the question of how activity, stochasticity and regulations work together for achieving different goals still remains puzzling. We propose the model of an active tracking particle with information processing, based on which the entropy production, information flow, and generalised fluctuation theorem are derived. Moreover, the system performance, in terms of the first passage steps and the total energy consumption, are analysed in the variable space of (measurement error, control field), leading to discussions on the optimal control of the system. Not only elucidating the basic concepts involved in a stochastic active system with information processing, this prototypical model could also inspire more elaborated modelings of natural smart organisms and industrial designs of controllable active systems with desired physical performances in the future.</description>
