      <title>The Current and Future Perspectives of Zinc Oxide Nanoparticles in the Treatment of Diabetes Mellitus</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.04486</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.04486v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This review explores the synthesis, characterization, and therapeutic applications of zinc oxide nanoparticles (ZnO NPs) in the treatment of diabetes mellitus. The study delves into both chemical and green synthesis methods, comparing their impacts on nanoparticle properties. Key characterization techniques such as XRD, FTIR, UV-Vis spectroscopy, and SEM confirm the crystalline structure, optical properties, and morphology of the nanoparticles. ZnO NPs demonstrate significant biological activities, including antibacterial, anti-inflammatory, and antidiabetic effects. These nanoparticles show promise in improving glucose regulation, enhancing insulin sensitivity, and boosting glucose uptake in cells. Despite these benefits, the potential toxicity and long-term effects of ZnO NPs warrant further investigation. Future research should focus on optimizing synthesis methods and conducting comprehensive studies to fully exploit ZnO NPs' potential in diabetes management and other biomedical applications.</description>

      <title>Synthetic ultrasound images to benchmark echocardiography-based biomechanics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.04577</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.04577v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Brightness mode (B-mode) ultrasound is a common imaging modality in the clinical assessment of several cardiovascular diseases. The utility of ultrasound-based functional indices such as the ejection fraction (EF) and stroke volume (SV) is widely described in diagnosing advanced-stage cardiovascular diseases. Additionally, structural indices obtained through the analysis of cardiac motion have been found to be important in the early-stage assessment of structural heart diseases, such as hypertrophic cardiomyopathy and myocardial infarction. Estimating heterogeneous variations in cardiac motion through B-mode ultrasound imaging is a crucial component of patient care. Despite the benefits of such imaging techniques, motion estimation algorithms are susceptible to variability between vendors due to the lack of benchmark motion quantities. In contrast, finite element (FE) simulations of cardiac biomechanics leverage well-established constitutive models of the myocardium to ensure reproducibility. In this study, we developed a methodology to create synthetic B-mode ultrasound images from FE simulations. The proposed methodology provides a detailed representation of displacements and strains under complex mouse-specific loading protocols of the LV. A comparison between the synthetic images and FE simulations revealed qualitative similarity in displacement patterns, thereby yielding benchmark quantities to improve the reproducibility of motion estimation algorithms. Thus, the study provides a methodology to create an extensive repository of images describing complex motion patterns to facilitate the enhanced reproducibility of cardiac motion analysis.</description>

      <title>Real-time CBCT Imaging and Motion Tracking via a Single Arbitrarily-angled X-ray Projection by a Joint Dynamic Reconstruction and Motion Estimation (DREME) Framework (DREME) Framework</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.04614</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.04614v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Real-time cone-beam computed tomography (CBCT) provides instantaneous visualization of patient anatomy for image guidance, motion tracking, and online treatment adaptation in radiotherapy. While many real-time imaging and motion tracking methods leveraged patient-specific prior information to alleviate under-sampling challenges and meet the temporal constraint (&lt; 500 ms), the prior information can be outdated and introduce biases, thus compromising the imaging and motion tracking accuracy. To address this challenge, we developed a framework (DREME) for real-time CBCT imaging and motion estimation, without relying on patient-specific prior knowledge. DREME incorporates a deep learning-based real-time CBCT imaging and motion estimation method into a dynamic CBCT reconstruction framework. The reconstruction framework reconstructs a dynamic sequence of CBCTs in a data-driven manner from a standard pre-treatment scan, without utilizing patient-specific knowledge. Meanwhile, a convolutional neural network-based motion encoder is jointly trained during the reconstruction to learn motion-related features relevant for real-time motion estimation, based on a single arbitrarily-angled x-ray projection. DREME was tested on digital phantom simulation and real patient studies. DREME accurately solved 3D respiration-induced anatomic motion in real time (~1.5 ms inference time for each x-ray projection). In the digital phantom study, it achieved an average lung tumor center-of-mass localization error of 1.2$\pm$0.9 mm (Mean$\pm$SD). In the patient study, it achieved a real-time tumor localization accuracy of 1.8$\pm$1.6 mm in the projection domain. DREME achieves CBCT and volumetric motion estimation in real time from a single x-ray projection at arbitrary angles, paving the way for future clinical applications in intra-fractional motion management.</description>

      <title>Optimization-Based Image Reconstruction Regularized with Inter-Spectral Structural Similarity for Limited-Angle Dual-Energy Cone-Beam CT</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.04674</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.04674v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Background: Limited-angle (LA) dual-energy (DE) cone-beam CT (CBCT) is considered as a potential solution to achieve fast and low-dose DE imaging on current CBCT scanners without hardware modification. However, its clinical implementations are hindered by the challenging image reconstruction from LA projections. While optimization-based and deep learning-based methods have been proposed for image reconstruction, their utilization is limited by the requirement for X-ray spectra measurement or paired datasets for model training.
  Purpose: This work aims to facilitate the clinical applications of fast and low-dose DECBCT by developing a practical solution for image reconstruction in LA-DECBCT.
  Methods: An inter-spectral structural similarity-based regularization was integrated into the iterative image reconstruction in LA-DECBCT. By enforcing the similarity between the DE images, LA artifacts were efficiently reduced in the reconstructed DECBCT images. The proposed method was evaluated using four physical phantoms and three digital phantoms, demonstrating its efficacy in quantitative DECBCT imaging.
  Results: In all the studies, the proposed method achieves accurate image reconstruction without visible residual artifacts from LA-DECBCT projection data. In the digital phantom study, the proposed method reduces the mean-absolute-error (MAE) from 419 to 14 HU for the High-energy CBCT and 591 to 20 HU for the low-energy CBCT.
  Conclusions: The proposed method achieves accurate image reconstruction without the need for X-ray spectra measurement for optimization or paired datasets for model training, showing great practical value in clinical implementations of LA-DECBCT.</description>

      <title>Novel brain biomarkers of obesity based on statistical measurements of white matter tracts</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.04680</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.04680v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Novel brain biomarkers of obesity were sought by studying statistical measurements on fractional anisotropy (FA) images of different white matter (WM) tracts from subjects with specific demographic characteristics. Tract measurements were chosen that showed differences between two groups (normal weigh and overweight/obese) and that were correlated with their BMI. From these measurements, a simple and novel process was applied to select those that would allow the creation of models to quantify and classify the state of obesity of individuals. The biomarkers were created from the tract measurements used in the models. Some positive correlations were found between WM integrity and BMI, mainly in tracts involved in motor functions. From this result, neuroplasticity in motor tracts associated with obesity was hypothesized. Two models were built to quantify and classify obesity status, whose regression coefficients formed the novel proposed obesity-associated brain biomarkers. A process for the selection of tract measurements was proposed, such that models were built to determine the obesity status of subjects individually. From these models, novel brain biomarkers associated with obesity were created. These allow the generation of new knowledge and are intended to be a future tool in the clinical environment for the prevention and treatment of brain changes associated with obesity.</description>

      <title>Label-free evaluation of lung and heart transplant biopsies using virtual staining</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.05255</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.05255v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Organ transplantation serves as the primary therapeutic strategy for end-stage organ failures. However, allograft rejection is a common complication of organ transplantation. Histological assessment is essential for the timely detection and diagnosis of transplant rejection and remains the gold standard. Nevertheless, the traditional histochemical staining process is time-consuming, costly, and labor-intensive. Here, we present a panel of virtual staining neural networks for lung and heart transplant biopsies, which digitally convert autofluorescence microscopic images of label-free tissue sections into their brightfield histologically stained counterparts, bypassing the traditional histochemical staining process. Specifically, we virtually generated Hematoxylin and Eosin (H&amp;E), Masson's Trichrome (MT), and Elastic Verhoeff-Van Gieson (EVG) stains for label-free transplant lung tissue, along with H&amp;E and MT stains for label-free transplant heart tissue. Subsequent blind evaluations conducted by three board-certified pathologists have confirmed that the virtual staining networks consistently produce high-quality histology images with high color uniformity, closely resembling their well-stained histochemical counterparts across various tissue features. The use of virtually stained images for the evaluation of transplant biopsies achieved comparable diagnostic outcomes to those obtained via traditional histochemical staining, with a concordance rate of 82.4% for lung samples and 91.7% for heart samples. Moreover, virtual staining models create multiple stains from the same autofluorescence input, eliminating structural mismatches observed between adjacent sections stained in the traditional workflow, while also saving tissue, expert time, and staining costs.</description>

      <title>Magnetization transfer explains most of the $T_1$ variability in the MRI literature</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.05318</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.05318v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Purpose: To identify the predominant source of the $T_1$ variability described in the literature, which ranges from 0.6 - 1.1 s for brain white matter at 3 T.
  Methods: 25 $T_1$-mapping methods from the literature were simulated with a mono-exponential and magnetization-transfer (MT) models, each followed by mono-exponential fitting. A single set of model parameters was assumed for the simulation of all methods, and these parameters were estimated by fitting the simulation-based to the corresponding literature $T_1$ values of white matter at 3 T.
  Results: Mono-exponential simulations suggest good inter-method reproducibility and fail to explain the highly variable $T_1$ estimates in the literature. In contrast, MT simulations suggest that a mono-exponential fit results in a variable $T_1$ and explain up to 62% of the literature's variability.
  Conclusion: The results suggest that a mono-exponential model does not adequately describe longitudinal relaxation in biological tissue. Therefore, $T_1$ in biological tissue should be considered only a semi-quantitative metric that is inherently contingent upon the imaging methodology; and comparisons between different $T_1$-mapping methods and the use of simplistic spin systems - such as doped-water phantoms - for validation should be viewed with caution.</description>

      <title>Cherenkov Imaged Bio-morphological Features Verify Patient Positioning with Deformable Tissue Translocation in Breast Radiotherapy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.05680</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.05680v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Accurate patient positioning is critical for precise radiotherapy dose delivery, as positioning errors can significantly affect treatment outcomes. This study introduces a novel method for tracking loco-regional tissue deformation through Cherenkov image analysis during fractionated breast cancer radiotherapy. The primary goal was to develop and test an algorithm for Cherenkov-based regional position accuracy quantification, specifically for loco-regional deformations, which lack ideal quantification methods in radiotherapy. Blood vessel detection and segmentation were developed in Cherenkov images using a tissue phantom with incremental movements, and later applied to images from fractionated whole breast radiotherapy in human patients (n=10). A combined rigid and non-rigid registration technique was used to detect inter- and intra-fractional positioning variations. This approach quantified positioning variations in two parts: a global shift from rigid registration and a two-dimensional variation map of loco-regional deformation from non-rigid registration. The methodology was validated using an anthropomorphic chest phantom experiment, where known treatment couch translations and respiratory motion were simulated to assess inter- and intra-fractional uncertainties, yielding an average accuracy of 0.83 mm for couch translations up to 20 mm. Analysis of clinical Cherenkov data from ten breast cancer patients showed an inter-fraction setup variation of 3.7 plus minus 2.4 mm relative to the first fraction and loco-regional deformations (95th percentile) of up to 3.3 plus minus 1.9 mm. This study presents a Cherenkov-based approach to quantify global and local positioning variations, demonstrating feasibility in addressing loco-regional deformations that conventional imaging techniques fail to capture.</description>

      <title>Real-Time Boron Concentration Measurement in BNCT Using Compton Imaging</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.05687</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.05687v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Dosimetry in BNCT poses significant challenges due to the indirect effect of neutrons interacting with elements within the body and uncertainties associated with the uptake of boron compounds used in clinical practice. Current treatment planning relies on unconventional estimates of boron tumor uptake derived from prior PET scans and thus, an online boron-uptake monitor would be highly convenient. This work presents the first pilot experiments carried out at ILL-Grenoble with the high-efficiency Compton camera i-TED, hereby aiming at demonstrating its applicability for BNCT dosimetry by introducing real-time measurement of the boron concentration and imaging capabilities of spatial dose distribution. In this experiment, we measured the $^{10}$B uptake of different cancer cells of tongue squamous cell carcinoma, malignant melanoma and glioblastoma treated with BPA (80~ppm of $^{10}$B). The samples were irradiated with the thermal neutron spectrum of ILL-Grenoble and the 478keV $\gamma$-rays from the $^{7}$Li de-excitation after the neutron-boron reaction were registered both with the Compton imager and the high-sensitivity FIPPS HPGe array. These series of measurements allowed us to demonstrate the imaging capabilities of the Compton imaging device for this type of application, as well as to assess its sensitivity, which was found to be below 1 $\mu$g of $^{10}$B.</description>

      <title>A physical perspective on lithium therapy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.04455</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.04455v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Lithium salts have strong medical properties in neurological disorders such as bipolar disorder and primary headaches, and has recently gathered attention due to its preventive effect on viral attacks. Though the therapeutic effect of lithium was documented by Cade already in the late 1940s, the underlying mechanism of action is still disputed. Acute lithium exposure has an activating effect on excitable organic tissue and organisms, and is highly toxic. The therapeutic effect is achieved through long-term exposure to lower doses, where it, opposite to acute doses, alleviates excessive cellular activity, and induces a strong metabolic response in the organism, with large changes in phospholipid and cholesterol expression.
  This review investigates how lithium ions affect membrane composition and function, and how lithium response might in fact be the body's attempt to counteract the physical presence of lithium ions at cell level. The presence of lithium ions strongly affects lipid conformation and membrane phase unlike other alkali ions, with consequences for membrane permeability, buffer property and excitability, and ideas for further research in microbiology and drug development are discussed.</description>

      <title>Volumetric B1+ field homogenization in 7 Tesla brain MRI using metasurface scattering</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.05350</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.05350v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Ultrahigh field magnetic resonance imaging (UHF MRI) has become an indispensable tool for human brain imaging, offering excellent diagnostic accuracy while avoiding the risks associated with invasive modalities. When the radiofrequency magnetic field of the UHF MRI encounters the multifaceted complexity of the brain, characterized by wavelength-scale, dissipative, and random heterogeneous materials, detrimental mesoscopic challenges such as B1+ field inhomogeneity and local heating arise. Here we develop the metasurface design inspired by scattering theory to achieve the volumetric field homogeneity in the UHF MRI. The method focuses on finding the scattering ansatz systematically and incorporates a pruning technique to achieve the minimum number of participating modes, which guarantees stable practical implementation. Using full-wave analysis of realistic human brain models under a 7 Tesla MRI, we demonstrate more than a twofold improvement in field homogeneity and suppressed local heating, achieving better performance than even the commercial 3 Tesla MRI. The result shows a noninvasive generalization of constant intensity waves in optics, offering a universal methodology applicable to higher Tesla MRI.</description>

      <title>Robust Real-time Segmentation of Bio-Morphological Features in Human Cherenkov Imaging during Radiotherapy via Deep Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.05666</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.05666v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Cherenkov imaging enables real-time visualization of megavoltage X-ray or electron beam delivery to the patient during Radiation Therapy (RT). Bio-morphological features, such as vasculature, seen in these images are patient-specific signatures that can be used for verification of positioning and motion management that are essential to precise RT treatment. However until now, no concerted analysis of this biological feature-based tracking was utilized because of the slow speed and accuracy of conventional image processing for feature segmentation. This study demonstrated the first deep learning framework for such an application, achieving video frame rate processing. To address the challenge of limited annotation of these features in Cherenkov images, a transfer learning strategy was applied. A fundus photography dataset including 20,529 patch retina images with ground-truth vessel annotation was used to pre-train a ResNet segmentation framework. Subsequently, a small Cherenkov dataset (1,483 images from 212 treatment fractions of 19 breast cancer patients) with known annotated vasculature masks was used to fine-tune the model for accurate segmentation prediction. This deep learning framework achieved consistent and rapid segmentation of Cherenkov-imaged bio-morphological features on another 19 patients, including subcutaneous veins, scars, and pigmented skin. Average segmentation by the model achieved Dice score of 0.85 and required less than 0.7 milliseconds processing time per instance. The model demonstrated outstanding consistency against input image variances and speed compared to conventional manual segmentation methods, laying the foundation for online segmentation in real-time monitoring in a prospective setting.</description>
