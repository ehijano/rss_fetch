      <title>Predicting the genetic component of gene expression using gene regulatory networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.08530</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.08530v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Gene expression prediction plays a vital role in transcriptome-wide association studies (TWAS), which seek to establish associations between tissue gene expression and complex traits. Traditional models rely on genetic variants in close genomic proximity to the gene of interest to predict the genetic component of gene expression. In this study, we propose a novel approach incorporating distal genetic variants acting through gene regulatory networks (GRNs) into gene expression prediction models, in line with the omnigenic model of complex trait inheritance. Using causal and coexpression GRNs reconstructed from genomic and transcriptomic data and modeling the data as a Bayesian network jointly over genetic variants and genes, inference of gene expression from observed genotypic data is achieved through a two-step process. Initially, the expression level of each gene in the network is predicted using its local genetic variants. The residuals, calculated as the differences between the observed and predicted expression levels, are then modeled using the genotype information of parent and/or grandparent nodes in the GRN. The final predicted expression level of the gene is obtained by summing the predictions from the local variants model and the residual model, effectively incorporating both local and distal genetic influences. Using various regularized regression techniques for parameter estimation, we found that GRN-based gene expression prediction outperformed the traditional local-variant approach on simulated data from the DREAM5 Systems Genetics Challenge and real data from the Geuvadis study and an eQTL mapping study in yeast. This study provides important insights into the challenge of gene expression prediction for TWAS. It reaffirms the importance of GRNs for understanding the genetic effects on gene expression and complex traits more generally.</description>

      <title>Computational strategies for cross-species knowledge transfer and translational biomedicine</title>

Abstract: Research organisms provide invaluable insights into human biology and diseases, serving as essential tools for functional experiments, disease modeling, and drug testing. However, evolutionary divergence between humans and research organisms hinders effective knowledge transfer across species. Here, we review state-of-the-art methods for computationally transferring knowledge across species, primarily focusing on methods that utilize transcriptome data and/or molecular networks. We introduce the term "agnology" to describe the functional equivalence of molecular components regardless of evolutionary origin, as this concept is becoming pervasive in integrative data-driven models where the role of evolutionary origin can become unclear. Our review addresses four key areas of information and knowledge transfer across species: (1) transferring disease and gene annotation knowledge, (2) identifying agnologous molecular components, (3) inferring equivalent perturbed genes or gene sets, and (4) identifying agnologous cell types. We conclude with an outlook on future directions and several key challenges that remain in cross-species knowledge transfer.</description>

      <title>A Novel Quantum Algorithm for Efficient Attractor Search in Gene Regulatory Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.08814</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.08814v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The description of gene interactions that constantly occur in the cellular environment is an extremely challenging task due to an immense number of degrees of freedom and incomplete knowledge about microscopic details. Hence, a coarse-grained and rather powerful modeling of such dynamics is provided by Boolean Networks (BNs). BNs are dynamical systems composed of Boolean agents and a record of their possible interactions over time. Stable states in these systems are called attractors which are closely related to the cellular expression of biological phenotypes. Identifying the full set of attractors is, therefore, of substantial biological interest. However, for conventional high-performance computing, this problem is plagued by an exponential growth of the dynamic state space. Here, we demonstrate a novel quantum search algorithm inspired by Grover's algorithm to be implemented on quantum computing platforms. The algorithm performs an iterative suppression of states belonging to basins of previously discovered attractors from a uniform superposition, thus increasing the amplitudes of states in basins of yet unknown attractors. This approach guarantees that a new attractor state is measured with each iteration of the algorithm, an optimization not currently achieved by any other algorithm in the literature. Tests of its resistance to noise have also shown promising performance on devices from the current Noise Intermediate Scale Quantum Computing (NISQ) era.</description>
