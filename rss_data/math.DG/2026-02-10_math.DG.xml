      <title>Entropy-Minimizing Diffeomorphisms on a $G_2$-Manifold</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.07204</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.07204v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we construct infinitely many diffeomorphisms of a Joyce manifold $M$ which achieve Yomdin's homological lower bound for topological entropy, imitating a recent construction of Farb-Looijenga for K3 surfaces. Moreover, following a recent paper by Crowley-Goette-Hertl, we show these diffeomorphisms act freely on a connected component of the Teichm\"uller space of $G_2$-metrics on $M$. We also discuss a putative analogy between dynamics on a $G_2$-manifold and that of an algebraic surface, and prove a theorem about its limitations.</description>

      <title>Manifolds with harmonic Weyl curvature and curvature operator of the second kind</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.07313</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.07313v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We prove that a compact Riemannian manifold of dimension $n\ge 8$ with harmonic Weyl curvature and $\frac{3(n-1)(n+2)}{4(3n-1)}$-nonnegative curvature operator of the second kind is either globally conformally equivalent to a space of positive constant curvature or is isometric to a flat manifold. In particular, We also give a classification of four-dimensional manifolds with harmonic Weyl curvature satisfying a cone condition. This result generalizes the work in \cite{DFY24,FLD,Li22}.</description>

      <title>Real Bers embedding on the line: Fisher-Rao linearization, Schwarzian curvature, and scattering coordinates</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.07373</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.07373v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We develop a real-analytic counterpart of the Bers embedding for the Fr\'echet Lie group $\Diff^{-\infty}(\R)$ of decay-controlled diffeomorphisms of the line, and establish its connection to $L^p$ Fisher-Rao geometry on densities. For $p\in[1,\infty)$, the $p$-root map $\varphi\mapsto p(\varphi'^{1/p}-1)$ isometrically linearizes the homogeneous $\dot W^{1,p}$ Finsler metric on $\Diff^{-\infty}(\R)$, yielding explicit geodesics and a canonical flat connection whose Eulerian geodesic equation is the generalized Hunter-Saxton equation; for $p=\infty$, logarithmic coordinates $\varphi\mapsto\log\varphi'$ provide a global isometry and the Schwarzian derivative emerges as the projective curvature. We construct a real Bers map $\beta^{-\infty}\colon\Diff^{-\infty}(\R)/\Aff(\R)\to W^{\infty,1}(\R)$ via this Schwarzian, prove it is a Fr\'echet-smooth injective immersion whose linearization admits a tame right inverse given by an explicit Volterra operator, and characterize its image through Sturm-Liouville spectral theory. We introduce an $L^p$-Schwarzian family $S_p$ that interpolates between affine and projective cocycles, establish full asymptotic expansions as $p\to\infty$ in Fr\'echet and Orlicz-Sobolev scales, and extend the Bers embedding to Orlicz diffeomorphism groups. Through the Jacobian correspondence, these structures transfer to a manifold of densities asymptotic to Lebesgue measure, where the nonlinear Eulerian transport reduces to a pointwise Riccati law and the Schwarzian becomes the score curvature governing Fisher information. The compact-manifold $L^p$ Fisher-Rao linearization of Bauer, Bruveris, Harms, and Michor is recalled as a guiding framework.</description>

      <title>Sharp estimates for the Robin Laplacian under a perimeter constraint in hyperbolic space</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.07510</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.07510v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we establish a lower bound, in terms of the isoperimetric deficit, for the first eigenvalue of the Robin Laplacian with negative boundary parameter on horospherically convex bounded domains in hyperbolic space, which implies that the geodesic ball maximizes this eigenvalue among all such domains. Furthermore, we derive upper bounds for the first eigenvalue of the Robin Laplacian with positive boundary parameter on horospherically convex bounded domains in hyperbolic space.</description>

      <title>Complete minimal surfaces of finite total curvature on punctured spheres with totally ramified value number greater than $2$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.07551</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.07551v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Motivated by Osserman's problem on the number $D_g$ of omitted values
  of the Gauss map of a complete minimal surface with finite total curvature in $\boldsymbol{R}^3$,
  its totally ramified value number $\nu_g$ (referred to in this paper as the
  \emph{total weight of totally ramified values})
  has attracted significant interest.
  The value of $\nu_g$ provides more detailed information than the number of omitted values alone.
  In 2006, Kawakami first found that a minimal surface defined on the three-punctured Riemann sphere,
  originally constructed by Miyaoka and Sato, satisfies $D_g = 2$ and $\nu_g = 2.5 &gt; 2$.
  Subsequently, in 2024, Kawakami and Watanabe gave another minimal surface
  defined on the four-punctured Riemann sphere that also satisfies $D_g = 2$ and $\nu_g = 2.5$.
  To date, these remain the only two known examples of such surfaces satisfying $\nu_g &gt; 2$.
  In this paper, we provide a systematic construction of meromorphic functions
  on punctured Riemann spheres that satisfy $\nu_g &gt; 2$.
  As a consequence, we obtain the following results for complete minimal surfaces of finite total curvature with $\nu_g = 2.5$ within the topological types of the known examples: (1) For the three-punctured sphere, we prove the uniqueness of Miyaoka--Sato's example. (2) For the four-punctured sphere, we completely determine the surfaces with $D_g=2$ and $\nu_g = 2.5$, which include examples other than Kawakami--Watanabe's one. (3) Furthermore, we construct a new example on the four-punctured sphere satisfying $D_g=1$ and $\nu_g = 2.5$.</description>

      <title>Comparison of total quotient curvature</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.07583</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.07583v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we establish some comparison theorems for the total quotient curvature. Specifically, we examine the behavior of the functional with respect to the total quotient curvature and prove that the background Einstein metric achieves a sharp bound on the total quotient curvature. We prove that if the quotient curvature satisfies a point-wise lower (or upper) bound relative to the Einstein metric, then the corresponding integral inequality holds. Also we can show characterize the equality case. Our result generalizes the volume comparison theorem for scalar curvature and the rigidity results for $\sigma_k$-curvature.</description>

      <title>Existence of the classical solution to the fractional mean curvature flow with capillary-type boundary conditions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.07989</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.07989v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Wang, Weng and Xia[Math. Ann. 388 (2024), no. 2] studied a mean curvature type flow for the smooth, embedded capillary hypersurfaces with a constant contact angle $\theta\in(0,\pi)$ and confirmed the existence of solutions by the standard PDE theory. In the present paper, we study a fractional mean curvature flow for $C^{1,1}$-regular hypersurfaces with a capillary-type boundary condition and obtain the short time existence by the fixed point argument.</description>

      <title>Principal Distribution Isomorphisms and Almost Hermitian geometry on Isoparametric Hypersurfaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.08001</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.08001v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper investigates the isomorphisms between principal distributions $\mathcal{D}_k$ $(k=1,\dots 4)$ on OT--FKM type isoparametric hypersurfaces in spheres. We recover the isomorphism $\mathcal{D}_1 \cong \mathcal{D}_3$ established by Qian--Tang--Yan \cite{Q-T-Y 2}, and further construct the isomorphism $\mathcal{D}_{2}\cong\mathcal{D}_{4}$ in specific cases. More significantly, we provide an explicit construction of a global vector bundle isomorphism $\mathcal{D}_1 \oplus \mathcal{D}_2 \cong \mathcal{D}_3 \oplus \mathcal{D}_4$ for all odd multiplicities $m$. As applications, we employ these isomorphisms to induce nearly K\"ahler structures on certain OT--FKM hypersurfaces. Finally, we prove that the $*$-Ricci curvature vanishes for any OT--FKM hypersurface admitting an almost Hermitian structure that interchanges principal distributions in pairs.</description>

      <title>The full asymptotic expansion of analytic torsion on homogeneous spaces</title>

      <description>arXiv:2602.08132v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The full asymptotic expansion of the equivariant complex Ray-Singer torsion for high powers of line bundles on symmetric spaces is given in an explicit form. In the case of isolated fixed points this expansion is given for general complex homogeneous spaces. Furthermore the full asymptotic expansion is given for the complex analytic torsion form associated to fibrations by projective curves. The expansions are compared with results by Bismut-Vasserot, Finski and Puchol. The results are applied to lattice representations of Chevalley groups.</description>

      <title>Uniform spectral gaps for random hyperbolic surfaces with not many cusps</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.08352</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.08352v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we investigate uniform spectral gaps for Weil-Petersson random hyperbolic surfaces with not many cusps. We show that if $n=O(g^\alpha)$ where $\alpha\in \left[0,\frac{1}{2}\right)$, then for any $\epsilon&gt;0$, a random cusped hyperbolic surface in $\mathcal{M}_{g,n}$ has no eigenvalues in $\left(0,\frac{1}{4}-\left(\frac{1}{6(1-\alpha)}\right)^2-\epsilon\right)$. If $\alpha$ is close to $\frac{1}{2}$, this gives a new uniform lower bound $\frac{5}{36}-\epsilon$ for the spectral gaps of Weil-Petersson random hyperbolic surfaces. The major contribution of this work is to reveal a critical phenomenon of ``second order cancellation".</description>

      <title>Compatibility complexes for the conformal-to-Einstein operator</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.08510</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.08510v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The conformal-to-Einstein operator is a conformally invariant linear overdetermined differential operator whose non-vanishing solutions correspond to Einstein metrics within a conformal class. We construct compatibility complexes for this operator under natural genericity assumptions on the Weyl curvature in dimension $n\ge 4$, which implies at most one independent solution. An analogous result for the projective-to-Ricci-flat operator is obtained as well. The construction is based on a method, previously proposed by one of the authors, that leverages existing symmetries and geometric properties of the starting operator. In this case the compatibility complexes consist of, respectively, conformally and projectively invariant operators. We also make some comments on how Bernstein-Gelfand-Gelfand sequences can be interpreted as compatibility complexes in the locally flat case, which may be of general interest.</description>

      <title>Numerical solution of the two-dimensional Calderon problem for domains close to a disk</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.08662</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.08662v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: For a compact Riemannian surface $(M,g)$ with non-empty boundary $\Gamma$, the Dirichlet-to-Neumann operator (DtN-map) $\Lambda_g:C^\infty(\Gamma)\to C^\infty(\Gamma)$ is defined by $\Lambda_gf=\left.\frac{\partial u}{\partial\nu}\right|_\Gamma$, where $\nu$ is the unit outer normal vector to the boundary and $u$ is the solution to the Dirichlet problem $\Delta_gu=0,\ u|_\Gamma=f$. The Calder\'{o}n problem consists of recovering a Riemannian surface from its DtN-map. It is well known that $(M,g)$ is determined by $\Lambda_g$ uniquely up to a conformal equivalence. We suggest a method for numerical solution of the Calder\'{o}n problem. The method works well at least for Riemannian surfaces $(M,g)$ close to $({D},e)$, where ${D}=\{(x,y)\mid x^2+y^2\le1\}$ is the unit disk and $e=dx^2+dy^2$ is the Euclidean metric. Our numerical examples confirm the statement: the DtN-map is very sensitive to small deviations of the shape of a domain.</description>

      <title>Positive mass theorems for manifolds with ALH toroidal ends</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.08789</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.08789v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In work with P. Chru\'sciel, L. Nguyen and T.-T. Paetz [8], a positive mass theorem was obtained for asymptotically locally hyperbolic manifolds with boundary, having a toroidal end. The proof made use of properties of marginally outer trapped surfaces (MOTS). Here we present some new PMT results for such manifolds, but without boundary, which allow for other more general ends. The proofs, while still MOTS-based, involve a more elaborate technique (related to $\mu$-bubbles) introduced in work of D. A. Lee, M. Lesourd, and R. Unger [20] for manifolds with an asymptotically flat end, and further developed in [23] for manifolds with an asymptotically hyperbolic end.</description>

      <title>Towards resurgence of Joyce structures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.08805</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.08805v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Given a Joyce structure, we show that the associated $\mathbb{C}^*$-family of non-linear connections $\mathcal{A}^{\epsilon}$ can be gauged to a standard form $\mathcal{A}^{\epsilon,\text{st}}$ by a gauge transformation $\hat{g}$, formal in $\epsilon$. We show that the corresponding infinitesimal gauge transformation $\dot{g}=\log(\hat{g})$ has a convergent Borel transform, provided $\dot{g}$ vanishes on the base of the Joyce structure. This establishes the first step in showing that such a $\dot{g}$ is resurgent. We also use $\hat{g}$ to produce formal twistor Darboux coordinates for the complex hyperk\"{a}hler structure associated to the Joyce structure, and show a similar result about convergence of the Borel transform of the formal twistor Darboux coordinates.</description>

Abstract: We prove an $L^2$-$\partial\overline\partial$-Lemma involving smooth square integrable forms on complete K\"ahler manifolds, provided that the unique self-adjoint extension of the Hodge Laplacian on the Hilbert space of $L^2$-forms has a gap in its spectrum near zero. This generalises the classical $\partial\overline\partial$-Lemma on compact K\"ahler manifolds.</description>

      <title>Ancient solutions to free boundary mean curvature flow</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.08850</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.08850v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We establish rigidity results for ancient solutions to the free boundary mean curvature flow in manifolds with convex boundary. In particular, we show that any free boundary minimal hypersurface of Morse index I admits an I-parameter family of ancient solutions that emanate from it. Moreover, among ancient solutions that backward converge exponentially fast to the minimal hypersurface, these exhaust all possibilities. Additionally, we construct a smooth free boundary mean convex foliation around an unstable free boundary minimal hypersurface that enables us to provide a more detailed geometric description of mean-convex ancient solutions that backward converge to that minimal surface.</description>

      <title>Fundamental groups of compact Kahler varieties with nef anti canonical bundle</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.07420</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.07420v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: It is proved by M. Paun (1997, 2017) that the fundamental group of a compact Kahler manifold X is almost Abelian if the anti-canonical bundle -KX is nef. In this paper, we apply the recent geometric analytic theory of Kahler spaces developed by Guo-Phong-Song-Sturm to study fundamental groups of mildly singular compact Kahler varieties. We first extend Paun's result to log canonical pairs (X,Delta) with smooth X and nef -(KX+Delta) as well as to compact Kahler manifolds X with pseudo-effective -KX under a suitable assumption on the singularities of c1(-KX). We further prove that, for a 3-dimensional log canonical pair (X,\Delta) with X being klt, pi 1(X) is almost Abelian if -(KX+\Delta) is nef. Moreover, as one of the main ingredients for the proof of these results, we establish the surjectivity of the Albanese maps of compact normal complex varieties X in Fujiki class C that admits an effective R-divisor \Delta such that the pair (X,\Delta) is log canonical with nef anti-log canonical divisor -(KX+\Delta).This generalizes the corresponding theorems for projective varieties (Zhang, 2005), for klt pairs (Matsumura-Wang-Wu-Zhang, 2025) and for log smooth case (Fu-Han-Zou, 2025)</description>

      <description>arXiv:2602.07734v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Let $G/H$ be a simply connected homogeneous space of maximal rank. Then the maximal torus $T$-action on $G/H$ is a GKM manifold. We call the $T$-action $j$-independent if any $i(\leq j)$ pairwise distinct isotropy weights at a fixed point are linearly independent. Using weighted graphs, we show that the maximal independence of $G/H$ is $2$, $3$ or $n=\dim T$, and that the cases of $3$ or $n=\dim T$ correspond to some symmetric spaces of rank $&gt;2$. As a corollary, using the results of Ayzenberg and Masuda, the lower-degree reduced homology groups (with appropriate coefficients) of the orbit space $T\backslash G/H$ vanish.</description>

      <title>Interpretable Analytic Calabi-Yau Metrics via Symbolic Distillation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.07834</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.07834v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Calabi--Yau manifolds are essential for string theory but require computing intractable metrics. Here we show that symbolic regression can distill neural approximations into simple, interpretable formulas. Our five-term expression matches neural accuracy ($R^2 = 0.9994$) with 3,000-fold fewer parameters. Multi-seed validation confirms that geometric constraints select essential features, specifically power sums and symmetric polynomials, while permitting structural diversity. The functional form can be maintained across the studied moduli range ($\psi \in [0, 0.8]$) with coefficients varying smoothly; we interpret these trends as empirical hypotheses within the accuracy regime of the locally-trained teachers ($\sigma \approx 8-9\%$ at $\psi \neq 0$). The formula reproduces physical observables -- volume integrals and Yukawa couplings -- validating that symbolic distillation recovers compact, interpretable models for quantities previously accessible only to black-box networks.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2602.07843v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Let $(M,g)$ be a compact connected two-dimensional Riemannian manifold without boundary. In this note, we answer a question posed by Steinerberger: can one remove the $\sqrt{\log n}$ factor in the two-dimensional Green--Wasserstein inequality while keeping the unrenormalized off-diagonal Green term? We show that this is impossible on any compact connected surface: there is no inequality of the same form that holds uniformly over point sets with an $O(n^{-1/2})$ remainder for all $n$. We argue by contradiction and combine a second-moment estimate for the random Green energy of i.i.d. samples with the semi-discrete random matching asymptotics of Ambrosio--Glaudo.</description>

      <title>Conformally flat factorization homology in Ind-Hilbert spaces and Conformal field theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.08729</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.08729v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose a metric-dependent geometric variant of factorization homology in conformally flat Riemannian geometry for $d \geq 2$. We introduce a symmetric monoidal category of germs of d-dimensional Riemannian manifolds and orientation-preserving conformal open embeddings, and its full monoidal subcategory generated by flat disks. A conformally flat $d$-disk algebra is a symmetric monoidal functor from this disk category to a target category; in this paper we take the target to be $\mathrm{IndHilb}$, the ind-category of Hilbert spaces, which provides a mathematical formulation of $d$-dimensional conformal field theories.
  The (1-categorical) left Kan extension of an $\mathrm{IndHilb}$-valued conformally flat $d$-disk algebra defines a metric-dependent invariant of conformally flat manifolds. Under suitable positivity and continuity assumptions, we prove that its value on the standard sphere $(S^d,g_{\mathrm{std}})$ reproduces the sphere partition function of the associated conformal field theory. For $d&gt;2$, we construct nontrivial $\mathrm{IndHilb}$-valued conformally flat $d$-disk algebras from unitary representations of $\mathrm{SO}^+(d,1)$.</description>

Abstract: We show the existence of non-trivial self-expanding harmonic map flows starting from non-energy-minimizing 0-homogeneous maps to a regular ball or a closed hemisphere. In particular, given a non-minimizing but stationary 0-homogeneous harmonic map $u_0$ to a closed hemisphere, we construct infinitely many different weak solutions to harmonic map flow starting from $u_0$, all of which satisfy the parabolic monotonicity formula. This answers a question of Struwe.</description>

Abstract: In this paper, we prove that there exists a solution of the $J$-equation on the total space of a holomorphic submersion if there exist solutions of the $J$-equation on the fibers and the base. The method is an adiabatic limit technique. We also partially prove the converse implication. More precisely, if the total space is $J$-nef, then each fiber is $J$-nef. In addition, if each fiber has a solution of the $J$-equation, then the base is also $J$-nef. Furthermore, we establish similar phenomena for the deformed Hermitian-Yang-Mills equation.</description>

      <title>Fast and Stable Riemannian Metrics on SPD Manifolds via Cholesky Product Geometry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.02607</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.02607v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Recent advances in Symmetric Positive Definite (SPD) matrix learning show that Riemannian metrics are fundamental to effective SPD neural networks. Motivated by this, we revisit the geometry of the Cholesky factors and uncover a simple product structure that enables convenient metric design. Building on this insight, we propose two fast and stable SPD metrics, Power--Cholesky Metric (PCM) and Bures--Wasserstein--Cholesky Metric (BWCM), derived via Cholesky decomposition. Compared with existing SPD metrics, the proposed metrics provide closed-form operators, computational efficiency, and improved numerical stability. We further apply our metrics to construct Riemannian Multinomial Logistic Regression (MLR) classifiers and residual blocks for SPD neural networks. Experiments on SPD deep learning, numerical stability analyses, and tensor interpolation demonstrate the effectiveness, efficiency, and robustness of our metrics. The code is available at https://github.com/GitZH-Chen/PCM_BWCM.</description>

      <title>A Note on Ricci-pinched three-manifolds</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.05078v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Let $(M, g)$ be a complete, connected, non-compact Riemannian $3$-manifold. Suppose that $(M,g)$ satisfies the Ricci--pinching condition $\mathrm{Ric}\geq\varepsilon\mathrm{R} g$ for some $\varepsilon&gt;0$, where $\mathrm{Ric}$ and $\mathrm{R}$ are the Ricci tensor and scalar curvature, respectively. In this short note, we give an alternative proof based on potential theory of the fact that if $(M,g)$ has Euclidean volume growth, then it is flat. Deruelle-Schulze-Simon and Huisken-K\"{o}rber have already shown this result and together with the contributions by Lott and Lee-Topping led to a proof of the so-called Hamilton's pinching conjecture.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.06462v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We rigorously show that a large family of monotone quantities along the weak inverse mean curvature flow is the limit case of the corresponding ones along the level sets of $p$-capacitary potentials. Such monotone quantities include Willmore and Minkowski-type functionals on Riemannian manifolds with nonnegative Ricci curvature. In $3$-dimensional manifolds with nonnegative scalar curvature, we also recover the monotonicity of the Hawking mass and its nonlinear potential theoretic counterparts. This unified view is built on a refined analysis of $p$-capacitary potentials. We prove that they strongly converge in $W^{1,q}_{\mathrm{loc}}$ as $p\to 1^+$ to the inverse mean curvature flow and their level sets are curvature varifolds. Finally, we also deduce a Gauss-Bonnet-type theorem for level sets of $p$-capacitary potentials.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2502.09199v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we consider soliton solutions of the mean curvature flow in the unit sphere $S^{2n+1}$ moving along the integral curves of the Hopf unit vector field. While such solitons must necessarily be minimal if compact, we produce a non-minimal, complete example with topology $S^{2n-1} \times R$. The example wraps around a Clifford torus $S^{2n-1} \times S^1$ along each end, it has reflection and rotational symmetry and its mean curvature changes sign on each end. Indeed, we prove that a complete 2-dimensional soliton with non-negative mean curvature outside a compact set must be a covering of a Clifford torus. Concluding, we obtain a pinching theorem under suitable conditions on the second fundamental form.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2504.12842v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We demonstrate that the moduli space of Hermitian-Einstein connections $\text{M}^*_{HE}(M^{2n})$ of vector bundles over compact non-Gauduchon Hermitian manifolds $(M^{2n}, g, \omega)$ that exhibit a dilaton field $\Phi$ admit a strong K\"ahler with torsion structure provided a certain condition is imposed on their Lee form $\theta$ and the dilaton. We find that the geometries that satisfy this condition include those that solve the string field equations or equivalently the gradient flow soliton type of equations. In addition, we demonstrate that if the underlying manifold $(M^{2n}, g, \omega)$ admits a holomorphic and Killing vector field $X$ that leaves $\Phi$ also invariant, then the moduli spaces $\text{M}^*_{HE}(M^{2n})$ admits an induced holomorphic and Killing vector field $\alpha_X$. Furthermore, if $X$ is covariantly constant with respect to the compatible connection $\hat\nabla$ with torsion a 3-form on $(M^{2n}, g, \omega)$, then $\alpha_X$ is also covariantly constant with respect to the compatible connection $\hat D$ with torsion a 3-form on $\text{M}^*_{HE}(M^{2n})$ provided that $K^\flat\wedge X^\flat$ is a $(1,1)$-form with $K^\flat=\theta+2d\Phi$ and $\Phi$ is invariant under both $X$ and $IX$, where $I$ is the complex structure of $M^{2n}$.</description>

Abstract: Motivated by Schoen's conjecture on the volume functional for closed hyperbolic manifolds, we generalize the volume comparison theorem of Hu, Ji, and Shi and establish a volume comparison theorem for rank 1 symmetric spaces of non-compact type under a scalar curvature condition. Furthermore, we prove a rigidity result. Our proof uses the normalized Ricci--DeTurck flow to analyze the asymptotic behavior of the volume functional and to derive monotonicity properties. This extends the classical volume comparison framework to symmetric spaces of non-compact type.</description>

      <title>New rigidity theorem of Einstein manifolds and curvature operator of the second kind</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.21496</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.21496v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Using Bochner techniques, we prove that a compact Einstein manifold of dimension $n \ge 4$ has constant curvature provided that the curvature operator of the second kind satisfies a cone condition that is strictly weaker than nonnegativity. Furthermore, employing a result of Li \cite{Li5}, we establish that any closed Einstein manifold of dimension $n \ge 4$ satisfying
  \[k^{-1}({\lambda }_1+\cdots +{\lambda }_k)\ge -\theta(n,k) \bar{\lambda },\quad \text{for some} \quad k \le [\frac{n+2}{4}]\]
  must be either flat or a spherical space form. Here, ${\lambda }_1\le {\lambda }_2\le \cdots \le {\lambda }_{\frac{(n-1)(n+2)}{2}}$ are the eigenvalues of $\mathring{R}\,$, $\bar{\lambda }$ is their average, and $\theta (n,k)$ is a positive constant. This result generalizes the work of Dai-Fu \cite{DF} and Chen-Wang \cite{CW1,CW}.We also classify four-dimensional Einstein manifolds satisfying a cone condition.</description>

      <title>Rotationally symmetric translating solitons of fully nonlinear extrinsic geometric flows: Classification and Applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.23623</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.23623v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study rotationally symmetric translators for fully nonlinear extrinsic geometric flows driven by a curvature function, and we establish the fine asymptotics of bowl-type evolutions and, when admissible, the construction and classification of catenoidal-type solutions, together with their asymptotic behavior. Under natural structural and convexity assumptions, we also prove rigidity and uniqueness results within appropriate classes of graphical translators of such curvature flows.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2601.02722v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We prove that complete Riemannian manifolds of dimension $n\ge3$ with harmonic curvature and $\frac{n(n+2)}{2(n+1)}$-nonnegative curvature operator of the second kind must be Einstein. In particular, We show that complete Einstein manifolds of dimension $n\ge4$ with $\frac{3n(n-1)^2(n+2)}{2(5n^3+3n^2-30n+16)}$-nonnegative curvature operator of the second kind must be of constant curvature, which generalizes the work of Dai-Fu \cite{DF}.</description>

      <title>Translation invariant curvature measures of convex bodies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.14193</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.14193v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In a series of papers, Weil initiated the investigation of translation invariant curvature measures of convex bodies, which include as prime examples Federer's curvature measures. In this paper, we continue this line of research by introducing new tools to study curvature measures. Our main results suggest that the space of curvature measures, which is graded by degree and parity, is highly structured: We conjecture that each graded component has length at most $2$ as a representation of the general linear group, and we prove this in degrees $0$ and $n-2$. Beyond this conjectural picture, our methods yield a characterization of Federer's curvature measures under weaker assumptions.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2601.22368v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In the first part of the paper, we prove the existence of longtime solution to mean curvature flow starting from a graph of a continuous function defined over a slab. Then, we establish dynamical stability results for various types of graphical translators to mean curvature flow, namely the grim reaper, two dimensional graphical translators, and asymptotically cylindrical translators.</description>

      <title>Hawking-type singularity theorems for worldvolume energy inequalities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2209.04347</link>
      <description>arXiv:2209.04347v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The classical singularity theorems of R. Penrose and S. Hawking from the 1960s show that, given a pointwise energy condition (and some causality as well as initial assumptions), spacetimes cannot be geodesically complete. Despite their great success, the theorems leave room for physically relevant improvements, especially regarding the classical energy conditions as essentially any quantum field theory necessarily violates them. While singularity theorems with weakened energy conditions exist for worldline integral bounds, so called worldvolume bounds are in some cases more applicable than the worldline ones, such as the case of some massive free fields. In this paper we study integral Ricci curvature bounds based on worldvolume quantum strong energy inequalities. Under the additional assumption of a - potentially very negative - global timelike Ricci curvature bound, a Hawking type singularity theorem is proven. Finally, we apply the theorem to a cosmological scenario proving past geodesic incompleteness in cases where the worldline theorem was inconclusive.</description>

      <title>Linear programming bounds for hyperbolic surfaces</title>

      <description>arXiv:2302.02540v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We adapt linear programming methods from sphere packings to closed hyperbolic surfaces and obtain new upper bounds on their systole, their kissing number, the first positive eigenvalue of their Laplacian, the multiplicity of their first eigenvalue, and their number of small eigenvalues. Apart from a few exceptions, the resulting bounds are the current best known both in low genus and as the genus tends to infinity. Our methods also provide lower bounds on the systole (achieved in genus $2$ to $7$, $14$, and $17$) that are sufficient for surfaces to have a spectral gap larger than $1/4$.</description>

Abstract: We prove a quantitative isoperimetric inequality for the nearly spherical subset of the Bergman ball in $\mathbb{C}^n$. We prove the Fuglede theorem for such sets. This result is a counterpart of a similar result obtained for the hyperbolic unit ball and it makes the first result on the isoperimetric phenomenon in the Bergman ball.</description>

      <title>Fractal closures of geodesic planes in Hitchin manifolds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.17915</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.17915v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Ratner's theorem implies topological rigidity of immersed totally geodesic subspaces of noncompact type in finite-volume locally symmetric spaces. In higher rank and infinite volume, however, counterexamples to this rigidity have remained elusive.
  We construct the first such examples using {\em floating geodesic planes}. Specifically, we exhibit a Zariski dense Hitchin surface group $\Gamma&lt;\mathrm{SL}_3(\mathbb{R})$ such that the Hitchin manifold $\Gamma\backslash \mathrm{SL}_3(\mathbb{R})/ \mathrm{SO}(3)$ contains immersed floating geodesic planes whose closures are fractal, with non-integer Hausdorff dimensions accumulating at $2$. Moreover, $\Gamma$ can be chosen inside $\mathrm{SL}_3(\mathbb{Z})$.
  The construction uses Goldman's bulging deformations and exploits geometric features specific to higher rank. In contrast to rank one, where geodesics orthogonal to a hyperplane diverge uniformly, floating planes interact through higher-dimensional flats, requiring control of nearest point projections and a delicate analysis of Hausdorff dimension both at the group level and in the ambient symmetric space, where $\Gamma$-translates may intersect.</description>

      <title>Dynamical Formation of Black Holes due to Boundary Effect in Vacuum Gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.09508</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.09508v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We prove that a marginally outer trapped surface (MOTS) can form as a result of Einsteinian evolution in pure vacuum spacetime starting from regular initial data free of MOTSs due to pure boundary effects. We adapt a Cauchy-double-null framework and use the boundary generalized mean curvature condition for the existence of an interior MOTS imposed by the author S-T Yau in \cite{yau}. In particular, we prove that the condition of \cite{yau} can be met dynamically starting from a configuration that does not verify the same through a focusing mechanism. In fact, a very mild incoming radiation can cause a large enough generalized boundary mean curvature of an isotropically large domain so that a MOTS exists in the interior. This is fundamentally different from black hole formation by standard ``gravitational collapse" and can be interpreted as the dynamical realization of a long-suspected idea in GR: MOTS can form because of ``global geometry", not just quasi-local concentration of gravity/matter.</description>

      <title>RNNs perform task computations by dynamically warping neural representations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.04310</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.04310v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Analysing how neural networks represent data features in their activations can help interpret how they perform tasks. Hence, a long line of work has focused on mathematically characterising the geometry of such "neural representations." In parallel, machine learning has seen a surge of interest in understanding how dynamical systems perform computations on time-varying input data. Yet, the link between computation-through-dynamics and representational geometry remains poorly understood. Here, we hypothesise that recurrent neural networks (RNNs) perform computations by dynamically warping their representations of task variables. To test this hypothesis, we develop a Riemannian geometric framework that enables the derivation of the manifold topology and geometry of a dynamical system from the manifold of its inputs. By characterising the time-varying geometry of RNNs, we show that dynamic warping is a fundamental feature of their computations.</description>
