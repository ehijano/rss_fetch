      <title>Non-Equilibrium Relativistic Core Collapse of Self-Interacting Dark Matter Halos -- Limits On Seed Black Hole Mass</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.17117</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.17117v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent observations of supermassive black holes (SMBHs) at high redshifts pose challenges to standard seeding mechanisms. Among competing models, the collapse of self-interacting dark matter (SIDM) halos provide a plausible explanation for early SMBH formation. While previous studies on modeling the gravothermal collapse of SIDM halos have primarily focused on non-relativistic evolution under the assumption of hydrostatic equilibrium, We advance this framework by relaxing the equilibrium assumption and additionally incorporating general-relativistic effects. To this end, we introduce the Misner-Sharp formalism to the SIDM context for the first time. Our model reproduces the standard hydrostatic models in the early long-mean-free-path (LMFP) regime, but displays interesting distinct behavior in the late short-mean-free-path (SMFP) regime, where intense outward heat flux drives a rapid expansion of the outer envelope, removing mass from the core and significantly decelerating the collapse. Our general relativistic treatment enables us to follow halo evolution to the final stage when the apparent horizon forms. Our simulation yields a seed black hole mass of approximately $3\times10^{-8}$ of the halo mass at horizon formation, suggesting that additional mechanisms such as baryonic effects are critical for seeding black holes that are sufficiently massive to account for SMBHs in the early Universe.</description>

      <title>An ultra-high-resolution map of (dark) matter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.17239</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.17239v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Ordinary matter-including particles such as protons and neutrons-accounts for only about one sixth of all matter in the Universe. The rest is dark matter, which does not emit or absorb light but plays a fundamental role in galaxy and structure evolution. Because it interacts only through gravity, one of the most direct probes is weak gravitational lensing: the deflection of light from distant galaxies by intervening mass. Here we present an extremely detailed, wide-area weak-lensing mass map, covering 0.77 deg x 0.70 deg, using high-resolution imaging from the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) as part of the COSMOS-Web survey. By measuring the shapes of 129 galaxies per square arcminute-many independently in the F115W and F150W bands-we achieve an angular resolution of 1.00 +/- 0.01 arcmin. Our map has more than twice the resolution of earlier Hubble Space Telescope maps, revealing how dark and luminous matter co-evolve across filaments, clusters, and under-densities. It traces mass features out to z ~ 2, including the most distant structure at z ~ 1.1. The sensitivity to high-redshift lensing constrains galaxy environments at the peak of cosmic star formation and sets a high-resolution benchmark for testing theories about the nature of dark matter and the formation of large-scale cosmic structure</description>

      <title>Constraining Quintessence Models with ISW-tSZ Cross-Correlations: A Comparative Analysis of Thawing, Tracker, and Scaling-Freezing Dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.17298</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.17298v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present constraints on quintessence dark energy models using the observational detection of the Integrated Sachs-Wolfe (ISW)--thermal Sunyaev-Zeldovich (tSZ) cross-correlation dataset. Our analysis compares three classes of quintessence dynamics: thawing, tracker, and scaling-freezing with the standard $\Lambda$CDM cosmology. Through a comprehensive likelihood analysis, we derive best-fit values and 68\% confidence intervals for key cosmological parameters, finding $\Omega_{\rm m} = 0.322^{+0.027}_{-0.030}$ and $\sigma_8 = 0.735^{+0.045}_{-0.035}$ for $\Lambda$CDM, with deviations in alternative models consistent within $1\sigma$. For the thawing model, we consider an exponential potential with slope $\lambda = 0.736^{+0.270}_{-0.227}$, while for the tracker and scaling-freezing models, we use inverse axion-like and double exponential potentials, respectively. Observationally, the tracker model yields $n = 5.651^{+1.625}_{-1.604}$ and $f = 0.258^{+0.149}_{-0.096}$, and the scaling-freezing model gives $\lambda_1 = 0.405^{+0.293}_{-0.322}$ and $\lambda_2 = 23.226^{+7.975}_{-7.258}$. The dimensionless tSZ amplitude ($\widetilde{W}^{\rm SZ}$) and cosmic infrared background (CIB) parameters are tightly constrained across all models, providing additional insights into astrophysical foregrounds. Our results demonstrate the effectiveness of ISW--tSZ cross-correlations as a probe of dark energy dynamics, with the Thawing quintessence model yielding the lowest $\chi^2_{\rm min}$ among the tested scenarios, and highlight the need for future high-precision measurements to distinguish between quintessence models and $\Lambda$CDM.</description>

      <title>Stellar Disruption of Axion Minihalos and Consequences for Direct Axion Detection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.17478</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.17478v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Scenarios such as the QCD axion with the Peccei-Quinn symmetry broken after inflation predict an enhanced matter power spectrum on sub-parsec scales. These theories lead to the formation of dense dark matter structures known as minihalos, which provide insights into early Universe dynamics and have implications for direct detection experiments. We examine the mass loss of minihalos during stellar encounters, building on previous studies that derived formulas for mass loss and performed N-body simulations. We propose a new formula for the mass loss that accounts for changes in the minihalo profile after disruption by a passing star. We also investigate the mass loss for multiple stellar encounters. We demonstrate that accurately assessing the mass loss in minihalos due to multiple stellar encounters necessitates considering the alterations in the minihalo's binding energy after each encounter, as overlooking this aspect results in a substantial underestimation of the mass loss.
  We further extend our analysis to the Galactic environment by more accurately incorporating multiple stellar encounters and dynamical relaxation timescales, simulating minihalo orbits in the Galactic potential. Our results show stellar interactions are more destructive than previously estimated, reducing minihalo mass retention at the solar system to ~30%, compared to earlier estimates of ~60%. This enhanced loss arises from cumulative energy injections when relaxation periods between stellar encounters are accounted for. The altered minihalo mass function implies a larger fraction of axion dark matter occupies inter-minihalo space, potentially increasing the local axion density and improving haloscope detection prospects. This thesis highlights the significance of detailed modeling of stellar disruptions in shaping the axion dark matter distribution.</description>

      <title>Forecasting the E_G measurements from the photometric and spectroscopic surveys of Chinese Space Station Survey Telescope (CSST)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.17874</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.17874v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present forecasts for the $E_G$ statistic using redshift distributions of realistic mock galaxy samples from the upcoming Chinese Space Station Survey Telescope (CSST). The dominant uncertainty in $E_G$ stems from the redshift space distortion parameter ${\beta}$, whose precision limits the overall constraining power. Our analysis shows that CSST will nevertheless achieve $E_G$ constraints at the few-percent level (3%-9%) over $0 &lt; z &lt; 1.2$, an improvement by a factor of several to an order of magnitude over current observations. Within the $\mu-\Sigma$ modified gravity framework, the parameter $\Sigma_0$, associated with the effective gravitational constant of the Weyl potential, can be constrained to $\sim 5\%$ precision. In a plausible scenario where upcoming spectroscopic surveys determine ${\beta}$ to 1\% accuracy, $E_G$ constraints tighten to the percent level, and $\Sigma_0$ becomes measurable at $\sim 1\%$. These results demonstrate that CSST will serve as a powerful facility for testing gravity and underscore the essential synergy between photometric weak lensing and spectroscopic surveys in probing cosmic acceleration.</description>

      <title>Three-point intrinsic alignments of galaxies and haloes in the FLAMINGO simulations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.17914</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.17914v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Third-order statistics provide information beyond two-point measures, but extracting this information requires accurate and consistent modelling. We measure and detect the three-point correlation function and third-order aperture-mass statistics of intrinsic alignments (IA) for galaxies and for haloes with $M_{\rm halo} &gt; 10^{13}\,{\rm M}_\odot$ in the $(2.8\,\mathrm{Gpc})^3$ simulation volume of the FLAMINGO hydrodynamical simulation suite. We model the third-order aperture-mass statistics and show that on large scales both the galaxy and halo samples are well described by the tree-level effective field theory (EFT) of IA across the three dark matter density-shape combinations and a wide range of triangle configurations, with the alignment amplitude consistent with that inferred from two-point statistics. We compare the full EFT to several other models: a version neglecting the velocity-shear term, the non-linear alignment model (NLA), and to a reduced EFT assuming co-evolution relations that follow from the assumption that alignment is linear in Lagrangian space. The first two models yield biased constraints on the alignment amplitude, but the reduced EFT performs remarkably well, achieving a low reduced chi-squared and minimal bias. We examine the redshift and mass dependence of the higher-order bias parameters, finding that the linear Lagrangian bias assumption is approximately satisfied across the explored halo mass and redshift ranges for both galaxies and haloes, suggesting that the galaxies broadly follow the alignment properties of their host haloes. These co-evolution relations can be valuable for photometric shear surveys, where limited constraining power on IA parameters favours models with fewer free parameters.</description>

      <title>Hubble Tension as an Effect of Horizon Entanglement Nonequilibrium</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.17938</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.17938v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose an infrared mechanism for alleviating the Hubble constant tension, based on a small departure from entanglement equilibrium at the cosmological apparent horizon. If the horizon entanglement entropy falls slightly below the Bekenstein-Hawking value, we parametrize the shortfall by a fractional deficit $\delta(a)$ evolving with the FLRW scale factor $a$. The associated equipartition deficit at the Gibbons-Hawking temperature then sources a smooth, homogeneous component whose density scales as $H^{2}/G$, with a dimensionless coefficient $c_{e}^{2}(a)$ of order unity times $\delta(a)$. Because this component tracks $H^{2}$, it is negligible at early times but can activate at redshifts $z\lesssim 1$, raising the late time expansion rate by a few percent without affecting recombination or the sound horizon. We present a minimal three parameter activation model for $c_{e}^{2}(a)$ and derive its impact on the background expansion, effective equation of state, and linear growth for a smooth entanglement sector. The framework predicts a small boost in $H(z)$, a mild suppression of $f\sigma_{8}(z)$, and a corresponding modification of the low-$z$ distance-redshift relation. We test these predictions against current low-redshift data sets, including SN~Ia distance moduli, baryon acoustic oscillation distance measurements, cosmic chronometer $H(z)$ data, and redshift space distortion constraints, and discuss whether the $H_0$ tension can be consistently interpreted as a late-time, horizon-scale information deficit rather than an early universe modification.</description>

      <title>First Observational Evidence for Split Infall Flow of Cosmic Filaments into Clusters</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.18434</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.18434v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Velocity fields in the cosmic web are fundamental to structure formation but remain difficult to observe directly beyond the linear regime. Here we present observational evidence that galaxy filaments connecting pairs of galaxy clusters undergo a split infall, with opposite velocity flows toward the two clusters. Using spectroscopic galaxies from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey, we isolate the internal filament velocity field by subtracting its rigid-body background motion and Hubble flow, and detect this effect at greater than $5\sigma$ significance across a wide range of cluster and filament selections. The measured velocity profile exhibits a sign reversal near the filament midpoint and a maximum infall amplitude of $\sim30$ km/s ($\sim20$ km/s projected onto the line-of-sight) for clusters of mass $\sim10^{14.3}M_\odot$, substantially lower than expected for infall from an average cosmic environment. Multiple results on density-velocity correlation, mass-dependency, and validation with simulation indicate that filaments dynamically respond to competing gravitational potentials rather than acting as passive mass transport channels. Our results establish a new observational window on quasi-linear velocity fields in the cosmic web and provide a promising probe of mass measurement, testing gravity and velocity reconstruction with upcoming wide-field spectroscopic surveys.</description>

      <title>Constraining Reionization Morphology and Source Properties with 21cm-Galaxy Cross-Correlation Surveys</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.18627</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.18627v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Cross-correlations between 21cm observations and galaxy surveys provide a powerful probe of reionization by reducing foreground sensitivity while linking ionization morphology to galaxies. We quantify the constraining power of 21cm-Galaxy cross-power spectra for inferring neutral hydrogen fraction $x_\mathrm{HI}(z)$ and mean overdensity $\langle 1+\delta_\mathrm{HI} \rangle(z)$, exploring dependence on field of view, redshift precision $\sigma_z$, and minimum halo mass $M_\mathrm{h,min}$. We employ our simulation-based inference framework EoRFlow for likelihood-free parameter estimation. Mock observations include thermal noise for 100h SKA-Low with foreground avoidance and realistic galaxy survey effects. For a fiducial survey ($\mathrm{FOV}=100\,\mathrm{deg}^2$, $\sigma_z=0.001$, $M_\mathrm{h,min}=10^{11}\mathrm{M}_\odot$), cross-power spectra yield unbiased constraints with posterior volumes (PV) of $\sim$10% relative to priors. Cross-power measurements reduce PV by 20-30% versus 21cm auto-power alone. With foreground avoidance, spectroscopic redshift precision is essential; photometric redshifts render cross-correlations uninformative. Notably, cross-power spectra constrain ionizing source properties, the escape fraction $f_\mathrm{esc}$ and star formation efficiency $f_*$, which remain degenerate in auto-power (PV $&gt;$60%). Tight constraints require either deep surveys detecting faint galaxies ($M_\mathrm{h,min} \sim 10^{10}\mathrm{M}_\odot$) with moderate foregrounds, or conservative mass limits with optimistic foreground removal (PV $&lt;$15%). 21cm-Galaxy cross-correlations enhance morphology constraints beyond auto-power while enabling previously inaccessible source property constraints. Realizing full potential requires precise redshifts and either faint galaxy detection limits or improved 21cm foreground cleaning.</description>

      <title>Impact of Rastall gravity on hydrostatic mass of galaxy clusters</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.18652</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.18652v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Galaxy clusters are the largest virialized structures in the Universe and are predominantly dominated by dark matter. The hydrostatic mass and the mass obtained from gravitational lensing measurements generally differ, a discrepancy known as the hydrostatic mass bias. In this work, we derive the hydrostatic mass of galaxy clusters within the framework of Rastall gravity and investigate its implications under two scenarios: (i) the absence of dark matter and (ii) the existence of dark matter. In the first scenario, Rastall gravity effectively reduces the hydrostatic mass, bringing it closer to the observed baryonic mass. The best linear fit yields a slope $\mathbf{M}=1.07\pm0.11$, indicating a near one-to-one correspondence between the two masses. In the second scenario, Rastall gravity helps to alleviate the hydrostatic mass bias. The linear fit between the Rastall hydrostatic mass and the observed lensing mass results in a best-fit slope $\mathbf{M}=1.01\pm0.16$, which is very close to unity. These results suggest that Rastall gravity provides a statistically favorable framework for addressing mass discrepancies in galaxy clusters.</description>

      <title>Ultra-fast growth of primordial black holes through radiative absorption</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.18708</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.18708v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We show that Schwarzschild primordial black holes (PBHs) formed in the radiation-dominated era can grow extremely rapidly through $\textit{radiative absorption}$ governed by the full Stefan-Boltzmann law. By introducing a principle of isonomy - ensuring identical particle species dependence for Hawking emission and absorption - we find that, whenever the temperature of the PBH environment is larger than the PBH horizon temperature, PBHs generically gain mass. In particular, for PBH masses following the critical collapse mass-scaling law with critical exponent $\gamma_\mathrm{crit}$, with $\gamma_\mathrm{crit} \in (0.33, 0.49)$, the aforementioned radiative absorption mass growth mechanism produces a striking effect: PBHs forming with a mass $10^6M_\odot$ during BBN can reach $\mathcal{O}(10^{10} M_\odot)$ within $\mathcal{O}(10^{6} \mathrm{s})$ ($\sim $ 58 days). Interestingly enough, small deviations from $\gamma_\mathrm{crit}$, depending itself on the number of relativistic species present in the primordial plasma, yield a continuous PBH mass spectrum providing us ultimately with a single, Standard-Model-based explanation for the origin of stellar-mass, intermediate-mass, and supermassive black holes (SMBHs), and naturally accounting for the early appearance of SMBHs. The Schwarzschild treatment presented here can be extended to spherically symmetric cosmological black holes, indicating that radiative absorption is a dominant and previously overlooked PBH growth channel in the early Universe.</description>

      <title>Baryonification III: An accurate analytical model for the dispersion measure probability density function of fast radio bursts</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.18784</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.18784v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We develop a fully analytical framework for predicting the one-point probability distribution function (PDF) of dispersion measures (DM) for fast radio bursts (FRBs) using the baryonification (BFC) model. BFC provides a computationally efficient alternative to expensive hydrodynamical simulations for modelling baryonic effects on cosmological scales. By applying the halo mass function and halo bias, we convolve contributions from individual halos across a range of masses and redshifts to derive the large-scale structure contribution to the DM PDF. We validate our analytical predictions against consistency-check simulations and compare them with the IllustrisTNG hydrodynamical simulation across a range of redshifts up to $z = 5$, demonstrating excellent agreement. We demonstrate that our model produces consistent results when fitting gas profiles and predicting the PDF, and vice versa. We show that the BFC parameters controlling the gas profile, particularly the halo mass scale ($M_\mathrm{c}$), mass-dependent slope ($\mu$), and outer truncation ($\delta$), are the primary drivers of the PDF shape. Additionally, we investigate the validity of the log-normal approximation commonly used for DM distributions, finding that it provides a sufficient description for a few hundred FRBs. Our work provides a self-consistent model that links gas density profiles to integrated DM statistics, enabling future constraints on baryonic feedback processes from FRB observations.</description>

      <title>A Novel Lensed Point Source Modeling Pipeline using GIGA-Lens with Application to SN Zwicky and SN iPTF16geu</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.18787</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.18787v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce a novel modeling pipeline for strongly lensed point sources, using the GIGA-Lens framework, running on four A100 GPUs via the JAX platform. Using simulations, we demonstrate accurate and precise recovery of image positions, fluxes, and time delays, together with inference of complex lens mass distributions -- including the mass density slope, $\gamma$ -- from images of lensed point sources alone. We further show that we can achieve statistical uncertainty of $\sim 3.6\%$ ($\sim 2.5\, \mathrm{km\, s^{-1}/Mpc}$) on $H_0$ from a single system, with full forward modeling, i.e., simultaneous inference of all lens model parameters together with $H_0$. We apply our pipeline to two well-studied lensed SNe Ia, Zwicky and iPTF16geu. For SN iPTF16geu, unlike previous modeling efforts, we model only the images of the lensed point source (the SN) and do not use the lensed images of the extended host-galaxy. Nevertheless, we are able to infer all of the mass parameters modeled in earlier studies, and our best-fit values, including $\gamma$, are fully consistent with published results. In the case of SN Zwicky, taking the same approach, however, we obtain an alternative best-fit model compared to published results, underscoring the importance of fully exploring the model parameter space.</description>

      <title>An Enhanced Isothermal Jeans Approach to Constraining Dark Matter Self-Interactions from Galactic Kinematics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.17118</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.17118v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present an improved semi-analytical model to predict density profiles of self-interacting dark matter (SIDM) halos and apply it to constrain the self-scattering cross section using SPARC galaxy rotation curves. Building on the isothermal Jeans approach, our model incorporates (i) velocity-dependent cross sections, (ii) an empirical treatment of core collapse, and (iii) enhanced robustness for identifying solutions. These advances allow us to fit a large sample of galaxies, including systems with baryon-dominated centers often excluded in earlier studies. We find that roughly 1/6 of galaxies admit both a core-growth and a core-collapse solution, while the rest favor a unique evolutionary state. Joint constraints across the sample reveal clear velocity dependence: the allowed parameter space forms an L-shaped degeneracy, where both nearly constant, low cross sections ($\sigma_0\sim2\,{\rm cm}^2$/g, $\omega\gtrsim500\,$km/s) and strongly velocity-dependent models ($\sigma_0\sim100\,{\rm cm}^2$/g, $\omega\sim60\,$km/s) are viable. Adopting the core-growth interpretation yields best-fit values $\sigma_0\simeq5\,{\rm cm}^2$/g and $\omega\simeq250\,$km/s. Our constraints are remarkably consistent with previous results derived from a variety of independent probes. Compared to cold dark matter (CDM) models, SIDM outperforms simple adiabatic-contraction profiles and rivals empirical feedback-based CDM profiles, yet shows no correlation with stellar-to-halo mass ratio, a proxy for feedback strength, offering a distinct explanation for dwarf galaxy diversity. Moreover, SIDM does not affect galaxy-halo scaling relations significantly and makes concentration systematically lower. Our results highlight SIDM as a compelling framework for small-scale structure, while future low-mass kinematic data will be crucial for breaking degeneracies in velocity-dependent cross-section models.</description>

      <title>The mass distribution in and around the Local Group</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.17125</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.17125v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Our Galaxy, Andromeda and their companion dwarf galaxies form the Local Group. Most of the mass in and around it is believed to be dark matter rather than gas or stars, so its distribution must be inferred from the effect of gravity on the motion of visible objects. Modelling efforts have long struggled to reproduce the quiet Hubble flow around the Local Group, as they require unrealistically little mass beyond the haloes of the two main galaxies. Here we revisit this using $\Lambda$CDM simulations of Local Group analogues with initial conditions constrained to match the observed dynamics of the two main haloes and the surrounding flow. The observations are reconcilable within $\Lambda$CDM, but only if mass is strongly concentrated in a plane out to 10 Mpc, with the surface density rising away from the Local Group and with deep voids above and below. This configuration, dynamically inferred, mirrors known structures in the nearby galaxy distribution. The resulting Hubble flow is quiet yet strongly anisotropic, a fact obscured by the paucity of tracers at high supergalactic latitude. This flattened geometry reconciles the dynamical mass estimates of the Local Group with the surrounding velocity field, thus demonstrating full consistency within the standard cosmological model.</description>

      <title>Improving Generalization and Uncertainty Quantification of Photometric Redshift Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.17222</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.17222v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Accurate redshift estimates are a vital component in understanding galaxy evolution and precision cosmology. In this paper, we explore approaches to increase the applicability of machine learning models for photometric redshift estimation on a broader range of galaxy types. Typical models are trained with ground-truth redshifts from spectroscopy. We test the utility and effectiveness of two approaches for combining spectroscopic redshifts and redshifts derived from multiband ($\sim$35 filters) photometry, which sample different types of galaxies compared to spectroscopic surveys. The two approaches are (1) training on a composite dataset and (2) transfer learning from one dataset to another. We compile photometric redshifts from the COSMOS2020 catalog (TransferZ) to complement an established spectroscopic redshift dataset (GalaxiesML). We used two architectures, deterministic neural networks (NN) and Bayesian neural networks (BNN), to examine and evaluate their performance with respect to the Legacy Survey of Space and Time (LSST) photo-$z$ science requirements. We also use split conformal prediction for calibrating uncertainty estimates and producing prediction intervals for the BNN and NN, respectively. We find that a NN trained on a composite dataset predicts photo-$z$'s that are 4.5 times less biased within the redshift range $0.3&lt;z&lt;1.5$, 1.1 times less scattered, and has a 1.4 times lower outlier rate than a model trained on only spectroscopic ground truths. We also find that BNNs produce reliable uncertainty estimates, but are sensitive to the different ground truths. This investigation leverages different sources of ground truths to develop models that can accurately predict photo-$z$'s for a broader population of galaxies crucial for surveys such as Euclid and LSST.</description>

      <title>SiGMa-Net II: Distinguishing Binary Black Holes from Glitches</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.17882</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.17882v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: With increasing sensitivity of the gravitational wave (GW) detectors, we expect a significant rise in the detectable GW events. To process, analyse and identify such large amounts of GW signals arising from mergers of Binary Black Holes (BBH), we need both speed and accuracy. In the search for (massive) BBH signals, the biggest hurdle is posed by the various non-gaussian noise transients called glitches. Compared to our previous work, which used a simple convolutional neural network to distinguish BBHs from Blip glitches, this work uses transfer learning with InceptionNetV3 to distinguish BBHs from six types of most popular glitches from the third observing run of LIGO. While the glitches are real and identified via GravitySpy, the BBH signals are simulated and then injected into the real detector noise for each of the two LIGO detectors. We generate Sine-Gaussian Projection (SGP) maps by cross-correlating data with Sine-Gaussian functions of varied quality factors ($Q$) and central frequencies ($f_0$) and projected on the $Q$ - $f_0$ plane. We find that SGP maps make it easier to distinguish BBHs from glitches that look very similar to BBHs in the Time-Frequency maps like the Blips, while also maintaining significant morphological differences between BBHs and the more frequent glitches - Scattered Light and Fast Scattering. Our network has an accuracy of $87%$, a TPR of 0.83 for an FPR of 0.1 on our test dataset. It is also robust, retaining its level of accuracy, when tested on real BBH events identified in the first three observing runs of LIGO. Our proposed method shows the viability of using the SGP maps and neural networks for fast identification of GW events improving the efficiency of standard search pipelines.</description>

      <title>The AIDA-TNG project: gas distributions inside and around haloes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.18578</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.18578v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The nature of Dark Matter (DM) is one of the most outstanding mysteries of modern astrophysics. While the standard Cold DM (CDM) model successfully explains observations on most astrophysical scales, DM particles have not yet been detected, leaving room for a plethora of different models. In order to identify their observable signatures, we use the AIDA-TNG cosmological simulation suite to predict the distributions of gas and neutral hydrogen (HI) in the CDM, Self-Interacting DM (SIDM), velocity-dependent SIDM (vSIDM), and Warm DM (WDM) models.
  We find that the DM models investigated have very limited impact on the median gas and HI profile of haloes. In particular, for the most massive haloes ($M_{\rm vir}\sim10^{14}\,\mathrm{M}_\odot$), we find that DM self-interactions can shallow the central potential and thereby enhance gas cooling. We find that, in all models, the halo-to-halo variation in the HI profiles is explained by AGN feedback, and that the specific characteristics of DM model is largely subdominant. Nevertheless, we detect some systematic difference in the case of SIDM, with more HI surviving close to the centre with respect to other models. We provide fitting functions for the gas and HI profiles.
  We investigate the galaxy-Ly$\alpha$ cross-correlation function (\galacc) for different halo masses, redshift and observation strategies. We find that at $z=0$ vSIDM can be distinguished from CDM in haloes with $10^{12}\lesssim M_{\rm vir}\lesssim10^{13}\,{\rm M}_\odot$, while SIDM1 can be distinguished from CDM in haloes with $M_{\rm vir}\gtrsim10^{13}\,{\rm M}_\odot$. We estimate that statistically-robust detection requires sampling $\sim160$ haloes with $\sim20$ sightlines each, a task that can be achieved with current and future facilities like WEAVE, 4MOST, PFS, ELT and WST.</description>

      <title>Intracluster light as a dark matter tracer: how their spatial and kinematic relationship is shaped by satellite demographics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.18693</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.18693v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate how the orbital evolution and mass distribution of infalling satellite galaxies shape the phase-space and radial distributions of intracluster light (ICL) relative to the underlying cluster dark matter (DM) halo. Using N-body simulations, we follow the tidal stripping and orbital evolution of satellite galaxies as they are accreted into a live cluster halo, systematically varying satellite-to-host mass ratio and orbital circularity. We measure the specific orbital energy and angular momentum of stripped stellar and DM material, finding that the stripped stars consistently occupy lower-energy and lower-angular momentum regions of phase-space than the stripped DM. The magnitude of this difference increases strongly towards more equal satellite--to--host mass ratios, while the dependence on orbital circularity is weak. We construct a predictive model for the phase-space properties of stripped stars and DM from a whole infalling satellite population and find that the resulting phase-space difference between the components are driven primarily by the characteristic mass of the infalling satellite stellar mass function. We find that the ICL is always more centrally concentrated than the DM. The magnitude of this offset depends on the characteristic mass and increases towards higher characteristic masses. Comparisons with four independent cosmological hydrodynamical simulations show that, once the infalling satellite stellar mass function is matched, the model reproduces the radial stellar-to-DM density profile offsets to better than the inter-simulation scatter. This demonstrates that the radial relationship between the ICL and the DM distribution is largely governed by satellite demographics. With adequate constraints on the infalling satellite population, ICL density profiles can therefore be used as informative tracers of the underlying radial DM distribution in clusters.</description>

      <title>Impacts of {$f(R, T)$} gravity on neutron stars study within the relativistic mean-field model framework in light of GW170817, Pulsars and NICER data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.01321</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.01321v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this work, we investigate the neutron star structure in conservative $f(R, T)$ gravity with $f(R, T)=R+\lambda T$, where $\lambda$ denotes the matter--geometry coupling. The modified stellar structure equations are solved using realistic relativistic mean-field (RMF) equations of state (EOSs), including density-dependent linear models and nonlinear interacting models with meson self-couplings. Theoretical predictions are confronted with multimessenger constraints from heavy pulsars, NICER radius measurements, and GW170817 tidal deformability, imposing $M_{\max}\simeq 2.07\, M_{\odot}$ and $10.62~\mathrm{km}&lt;R_{1.4}&lt;12.83~\mathrm{km}$ to constrain both the EOS parameter space and $\lambda$. We find that density-dependent EOSs such as DDH$_\delta$ and TW satisfy all observational constraints for specific $\lambda$ ranges, while nonlinear EOSs (NL3, GM1, TM1), despite large maximum masses, fail to simultaneously satisfy radius and tidal bounds even in modified gravity. The maximum neutron star mass is highly sensitive to the matter--geometry coupling and exhibits a strong degeneracy with the EOS, consistent with previous studies. The additional term in the modified Tolman--Oppenheimer--Volkoff equations alters the pressure gradient, affecting EOS stiffness and the speed of sound squared $c_s^2$, while preserving causality ($c_s^2/c^2&lt;1$). Pearson and Kendall analyses reveal a strong negative correlation between mass, radius, and $\lambda$ ($-0.18$ and $-0.23$, respectively). Our results show that modified gravity alone cannot compensate for unrealistic dense-matter physics, highlighting the necessity of realistic EOSs and joint multimessenger constraints, and establish conservative $f(R,T)$ gravity as a viable strong-field extension of General Relativity.</description>

Abstract: The evolution of old, compact stellar structures provides strong constraints on macroscopic dark matter candidates such as primordial black holes. In view of recent observational data for the Eridanus II dwarf galaxy, we perform the first $N$-body simulations of its central stellar cluster to model dynamical heating by PBHs. We find evidence that such candidates must be lighter than about one solar mass if they constitute the totality of the dark matter. We additionally derive constraints on the fraction of the dark matter in macroscopic objects as a function of mass, by modeling the remainder of the dark matter as standard, fluid-like cold dark matter.</description>

      <title>Probing Cosmic Curvature with Fast Radio Bursts and DESI DR2</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.01504</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.01504v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The spatial curvature of the Universe remains a central question in modern cosmology. In this work, we explore the potential of localized Fast Radio Bursts (FRBs) as a novel tool to constrain the cosmic curvature parameter $\Omega_k$ in a cosmological model-independent way. Using a sample of 120 FRBs with known redshifts and dispersion measures, we reconstruct the Hubble parameter $H(z)$ via artificial neural networks, and use it to obtain angular-diameter distances $D_A(z)$ through two complementary approaches. First, we derive the comoving distance $D_C(z)$ and $D_A(z)$ directly from FRBs without assuming a fiducial cosmology. Then, we combine the FRB-based $H(z)$ with Baryon Acoustic Oscillation (BAO) DESI DR2 measurements to infer $D_A(z)$. By comparing the FRB-derived and BAO+FRB-derived $D_A(z)$, we constrain spatial curvature. Our covariance-based likelihood (accounting for correlated uncertainties) yields $\Omega_k = -0.31\pm0.57$, while a diagonal (Gaussian) treatment gives $\Omega_k = -0.13\pm0.46$. Both estimations are consistent with spatial flatness at the $1\sigma$ level, albeit with a mild preference for negative curvature. Explicitly accounting for the full covariance broadens the intervals and avoids underestimation of uncertainties. These results highlight the growing relevance of FRBs in precision cosmology and their synergy with BAO as a powerful, cosmological model-independent probe of the large-scale geometry of the Universe.</description>

      <title>Cosmographic constraints from late-time probes including fast radio bursts</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.06975</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.06975v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this study, we use late-time probes, such as well-localized fast radio bursts (FRBs), baryon acoustic oscillations (BAO), supernovae (SNe), and cosmic chronometers (CC) to constrain cosmological parameters through a model-independent cosmographic approach. By integrating FRB data with BAO from DESI DR2, SNe, and CC, we derive constraints on the Hubble constant ($H_0$), the deceleration parameter ($q_0$), and the jerk parameter ($j_0$), using Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) analysis for parameter estimation. The cosmographic approach with FRBs alone provides $H_0 = 66.35^{+4.13}_{-5.04} \, \text{km} \, \text{s}^{-1} \, \text{Mpc}^{-1}$, $q_0 = -0.33^{+0.21}_{-0.15}$, and $j_0 = 0.83^{+0.57}_{-0.67}$, corresponding to a precision of $\sim 6\%$ for the Hubble constant and showing consistency with the $\Lambda$CDM expectation. The DESI+CMB dataset yields $H_0 = 65.59^{+1.25}_{-1.24} \, \text{km} \, \text{s}^{-1} \, \text{Mpc}^{-1}$, $q_0 = -0.29^{+0.07}_{-0.08}$, and $j_0 = 0.58^{+0.03}_{-0.04}$, providing a $\sim 2\%$ precision on $H_0$ and may suggest a possible tension in the late-time kinematic sector relative to the $\Lambda$CDM expectation when BAO measurements are calibrated with a Planck-inferred sound horizon. Combining the FRB, SNe, DESI+CMB, and CC datasets further tightens the constraints to $H_0 = 68.03^{+0.53}_{-0.52} \, \text{km} \, \text{s}^{-1} \, \text{Mpc}^{-1}$, $q_0 = -0.41 \pm 0.02$, and $j_0 = 0.55 \pm 0.02$, with the jerk parameter remaining lower than $j_0 = 1$ at the $1\sigma$ confidence level. These findings hint at a possible late-time kinematic tension, as indicated by the inferred value of the jerk parameter, which is primarily driven by the DESI+CMB dataset under standard early-Universe assumptions for the sound horizon.</description>

      <title>From South to North: Leveraging Ground-Based LATs for Full-Sky CMB Delensing and Constraints on $r$</title>

Abstract: Delensing--the process of mitigating the lensing-induced B-mode contamination in cosmic microwave background (CMB) observations--will be a pivotal challenge for next-generation CMB experiments seeking to detect primordial gravitational waves (PGWs) through B-mode polarization. This process requires an accurate lensing tracer, which can be obtained either through internal reconstruction from high-resolution CMB observations or from external large-scale structure (LSS) surveys. Ground-based large-aperture telescopes (LATs) are crucial for internal reconstruction, yet existing and planned facilities are confined to the southern hemisphere, limiting effective delensing to that region. In this work, we assess the impact of introducing a northern hemisphere LAT, assumed to be situated near AliCPT (hence termed Ali-like LAT, or LATN), on delensing performance and PGW detection, using simulations. Our baseline setup includes a space-based small-aperture mission (LiteBIRD-like, SAT) and a southern LAT (SO-like, LATS). External LSS tracers, which have been shown to play an important role in delensing before the availability of ultra-sensitive polarization data, are also considered. We find that southern-hemisphere internal delensing reduces the uncertainty in r by approximately 21% compared to the no-delensing case. Adding LATN enables full-sky internal delensing, achieving a further ~19% reduction--comparable to that from including LSS tracers (~17%). Once LATN is included, the marginal benefit of LSS tracers drops to ~10%. These results highlight the significant role of LATN in advancing delensing capabilities and improving PGW constraints.</description>

      <title>The Atacama Cosmology Telescope: DR6 Sunyaev-Zel'dovich Selected Galaxy Clusters Catalog</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.21459</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.21459v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present the results of a search for galaxy clusters in the Atacama Cosmology Telescope (ACT) Data Release 6 (DR6) microwave sky maps covering 16293 square degrees in three frequency bands, using data obtained over the lifetime of the project (2008-2022). We report redshifts and mass estimates for 10040 clusters detected via their Sunyaev-Zel'dovich (SZ) effect with signal-to-noise greater than 4 at a 2.4 arcminute filter scale. The catalog includes 1180 clusters at redshifts greater than 1, and 124 clusters at redshifts greater than 1.5. Using a relation between cluster SZ signal and mass that is consistent with recent weak-lensing measurements, we estimate that clusters detected with signal-to-noise greater than 5 form a sample which is 90% complete for clusters with masses greater than $5 \times 10^{14}$ MSun (measured within a spherical volume with mean density 500 times the critical density). El Gordo, a cluster found in an initial ACT survey of 755 square degrees, remains the most extreme cluster in mass and redshift; we find no cluster with a mass and redshift combination high enough to falsify the standard LCDM cosmology with Gaussian initial perturbations. We make public a variety of data products, including the full cluster candidate list, noise maps, and sky masks, along with our software for cluster detection and instructions for reproducing our cluster catalogs from the public ACT maps.</description>

      <title>Analytical approximations for curved primordial tensor spectra</title>

      <description>arXiv:2511.10644v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We build upon previous analytical treatments of scalar perturbations in curved inflationary universes to obtain analytical templates for the primordial tensor power spectrum in models with non-zero primordial spatial curvature. These templates are derived without assuming a particular inflaton potential, within a background history consisting of an initial kinetically dominated phase followed by an ultra-slow-roll inflationary regime, thereby isolating the universal imprints of curvature on tensor modes. Our results predict characteristic large-scale features -- including low-$\ell$ cut-offs and oscillatory patterns -- that are consistent with numerical solutions and provide a clear physical interpretation of how curvature modifies the underlying dynamics. In particular, we show that curvature effects manifest mathematically as systematic shifts in the dynamically relevant wavevectors, mirroring the behaviour previously identified in the scalar power spectrum. These features translate into distinctive signatures in the large-angle $B$-mode polarisation spectrum, offering a potential discriminant for spatial curvature in forthcoming CMB observations.</description>

      <title>The DESI DR1 Peculiar Velocity Survey: growth rate measurements from the maximum likelihood fields method</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.03229</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.03229v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present the constraint on the growth rate of structure from the combination of DESI DR1 BGS sample, Fundamental Plane, and Tully-Fisher peculiar velocity catalogues using the maximum likelihood fields method. The combined catalogue contains 415,523 galaxy redshifts and 76,616 peculiar velocity measurements. To handle the large amount of data in the DESI DR1 peculiar velocity catalogue, we significantly improve the computational efficiency by rewriting the algorithm with JAX. After removing outliers and Tully-Fisher galaxies that are affected by systematics, we find $f\sigma_8 = 0.483_{-0.043}^{+0.080}(\mathrm{stat}) \pm 0.018(\mathrm{sys})$, consistent within $1\sigma$ with the power spectrum and correlation function analysis using the same dataset. Combining all three measurements with appropriate correlations, the consensus measurement is $f\sigma_8 (z_{\mathrm{eff}}=0.07) = 0.450\pm0.055$, consistent with Planck $+\Lambda$CDM cosmology $(f\sigma_8 = 0.449 \pm 0.008)$. Combining with the high redshift growth rate of structure measurements from DESI ShapeFit, the constraint on the growth index is $\gamma = 0.58\pm0.11$, consistent with GR.</description>

      <title>Primordial black holes and smooth coarse-graining in excursion set theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.22075</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.22075v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The excursion-set formalism enables us to infer the mass distribution of collapsed objects, such as primordial black holes (PBHs), by the language of stochastic processes. Within the framework, this article investigates how a smooth coarse-graining procedure affects the resulting PBH mass function. As a demonstrative example, we employ a Gaussian window function, for which the stochastic noise becomes fully correlated across scales. It is found that these correlated noises result in a mass function of PBHs, whose maximum and its neighbourhood are predominantly determined by the probability that the density contrast exceeds a given threshold at each mass scale. Our results clarify the role of noise correlations induced by smooth coarse-graining and highlight their importance in predicting the abundance of PBHs.</description>

      <title>Dissecting the Hubble tension: Insights from a diverse set of Sound Horizon-free H0 measurements</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.00650</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.00650v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The Hubble tension is commonly framed as a discrepancy between local, late-time measurements favoring $H_0 \approx 73$ km s$^{-1}$ Mpc$^{-1}$ and early-time, Sound-Horizon-based measurements favoring $H_0 \approx 67$ km s$^{-1}$ Mpc$^{-1}$. We challenge this viewpoint by analyzing 88 Sound Horizon Free $H_0$ measurements, categorized into four classes: Distance Ladder measurements using local calibrators; Local $\Lambda$CDM measurements assuming the standard expansion history; Pure Local measurements independent of $H(z)$ shape; and CMB Sound--Horizon--Free measurements using CMB data without the Sound Horizon scale. Our analysis reveals that the 30 Distance Ladder measurements yield $H_0 = 72.73 \pm 0.39$ km s$^{-1}$ Mpc$^{-1}$ ($\chi^2_\nu = 0.72$), while the 58 Distance Ladder-Independent/Sound Horizon Free measurements collectively yield $H_0 = 69.37 \pm 0.34$ km s$^{-1}$ Mpc$^{-1}$ ($\chi^2_\nu = 0.95$), a $6.5\sigma$ tension exceeding the Planck--SH0ES discrepancy. This tension remains significant at a minimum value of $3.9\sigma$ after accounting for correlations. Among categories, Local $\Lambda$CDM measurements favor the lowest value ($H_0 = 67.61\pm 0.96$ km s$^{-1}$ Mpc$^{-1}$), Pure Local yield an intermediate value ($H_0 = 71.03 \pm 0.69$ km s$^{-1}$ Mpc$^{-1}$), and CMB Sound Horizon Free measurements give $H_0 = 69.07 \pm 0.44$ km s$^{-1}$ Mpc$^{-1}$. We conclude that the Hubble tension is better characterized as a discrepancy between the Distance Ladder and all other methodologies, rather than an early-vs-late-time split. We also identify a $2.9\sigma$ internal tension among Distance Ladder Independent/Sound Horizon Free measurements: analyses assuming $\Lambda$CDM systematically recover lower $H_0$ values compared to cosmological-model-independent methods. This suggests either unrecognized systematics in the Distance Ladder or deviations from $\Lambda$CDM or both.</description>

      <title>Verifiable type-III seesaw and dark matter in a gauged $\boldsymbol{U(1)_{\rm B-L}}$ symmetric model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.00109</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.00109v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We propose a new extension of the Standard Model that incorporates a gauged \( U(1)_{\rm B-L} \) symmetry and the type-III seesaw mechanism to explain neutrino mass generation and provide a viable dark matter (DM) candidate. Unlike the type-I seesaw, the type-III seesaw extension under \( U(1)_{\rm B-L} \) is not automatically anomaly-free. We show that these anomalies can be canceled by introducing additional chiral fermions, which naturally emerge as DM candidates in the model. We thoroughly analyze the DM phenomenology, including relic density, direct and indirect detection prospects, and constraints from current experimental data. Furthermore, we explore the collider signatures of the model, highlighting the enhanced production cross-section of the triplet fermions mediated by the \( \rm B-L \) gauge boson, as well as the potential disappearing track signatures. Additionally, we investigate the gravitational wave signals arising from the first-order phase transition during \( \rm B-L \) symmetry breaking, offering a complementary cosmological probe of the framework.</description>

      <title>Cusp-to-Core Transition of Dark Matter Halos across Galaxy Mass Scales</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.22155</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.22155v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate the diversity of dark matter (DM) density profiles in a large sample of late-type galaxies from the SPARC database, with the goal of testing whether a cusp-to-core transition occurs across galaxy mass scales. We perform Bayesian fits to high-quality rotation curves using flexible halo models that allow for variations in the inner slopes of DM density profiles. We quantify the central dark matter structure using the surface density within the inner region of the halo, defined as $\Sigma_{\rm DM}(&lt;0.01r_{V_{\rm max}})$, and compare the SPARC galaxies with Milky Way dwarf satellites as well as galaxy groups and clusters. Our results reveal significant diversity in the inner density slopes of SPARC galaxies, ranging from steep cusps to shallow cores, and show that many of them lie below the cuspy profiles predicted by the cold dark matter model, consistent with core-like structures. In contrast, both lower-mass dwarf galaxies and higher-mass galaxy clusters tend to follow the cuspy DM halos. These findings suggest that baryonic feedback may induce a cusp-to-core transition in Milky Way-mass galaxies, as predicted by hydrodynamical simulations. However, observational limitations and modeling uncertainties still prevent a definitive conclusion. This study provides new empirical insights into the halo mass-dependent nature of DM inner structures and the role of baryonic processes in shaping them.</description>

Abstract: A new thermal view of scalar-tensor gravity, in which general relativity is the zero-temperature state of gravity, is applied to the specific subclass of $f(R)$ gravity theories and, specifically, to spatially homogeneous and isotropic universes. Within the limits of application of the new thermal formalism, results on the convergence to Einstein cosmology (or lack thereof) are first obtained for general $f(R)$ theories, and then illustrated with power-law and Starobinsky $f(R)$ gravity.</description>

      <title>Milky Way galaxy-analogs and isolated galaxies with bars: environmental density in the Local Volume</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.18612</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.18612v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The environmental density of galaxies within the cosmic web constrains their 3D locations in filaments, voids, groups, and clusters. It traces the distribution of baryons and the influence of dark-matter halos on galaxy evolution, and helps diagnose external processes such as supernova and AGN feedback, tidal interactions, ram-pressure stripping, and large-scale flows. We focus on isolated barred galaxies, the parent population that includes Milky Way analogs. To measure local environmental density and verify isolation (|Delta v| &lt;= 500 km s^-1), we built a Python pipeline that works in two redshift regimes: low (z0 &lt; 0.02) and high (z0 &gt;= 0.02). Densities were estimated with k-nearest neighbors and Voronoi tessellations and classified as void (Sigma &lt; 0.05), filament (0.05 &lt;= Sigma &lt; 0.5), group (0.5 &lt;= Sigma &lt; 2.0), and cluster (Sigma &gt;= 2.0). Our northern-sky sample contains 311 isolated barred galaxies from 2MIG plus Milky Way analog systems (z &lt; 0.07). We find 157 void, 84 filament, 27 group, and 11 cluster galaxies; 30 have no detected neighbors. Sixty-seven lie in extremely low-density regions (Sigma_3D &lt; 0.01 gal Mpc^-3), and 22 have the nearest companion beyond 5 Mpc, indicating residence in extended voids. The Milky Way (Sigma_5NN ~ 0.13 gal Mpc^-3, R ~ 2.1 Mpc) and its close analog NGC 3521 both lie in filamentary environments at the edge of a nearby void. For z &gt; 0.02 we identify three additional Milky Way analog candidates from the density metrics: CGCG 208-043 (3D Voronoi) and NGC 5231 and CGCG 047-026 (5th-nearest neighbor). These results show that local environmental density is an effective, physically motivated criterion for selecting Milky Way analogs.</description>

      <title>Schwinger-Keldysh Cosmological Cutting Rules</title>

      <description>arXiv:2512.22652v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this work, we study the realisation of unitarity-based cutting rules for primordial cosmological correlators computed within the Schwinger-Keldysh path integral formalism. While cutting rules have been previously derived for wavefunction coefficients, here we examine them directly at the level of cosmological observables expressed diagrammatically. The resulting rules closely resemble those familiar from flat-space scattering amplitudes, but with an additional subtlety: in order to express the discontinuity of a correlator as the product of lower-order correlators, one must introduce a specific combinations of diagrams which do not appear in the computation of observables themselves. We explicitly verify these rules for several classes of correlators, both at tree level and with loop corrections, arising from theories involving different types of interactions.</description>
