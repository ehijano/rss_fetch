      <title>Absence of Andreev Bound States in Noncentrosymmetric Superconductor PbTaSe$_2$ under Hydrostatic Pressures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.15288</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.15288v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Noncentrosymmetric superconductor PbTaSe$_2$, hosting bulk nodal-line fermions (Phys. Rev. B. 89, 020505) and spin-helical surface states (Nature Communication 7, 10556), represents a prime candidate for realizing topological superconductivity and Majorana bound states (MBS). However, the definitive experimental signature of MBS in this system has thus far remained elusive. Here we provide a comprehensive investigation of its superconducting properties under hydrostatic pressure. Combining Andreev reflection spectroscopy and temperature-dependent resistance measurements, we identify a separated surface-like superconductivity from the bulk one at a critical pressure $P_c$. The superconducting surface state demonstrate an $s$-wave pairing state with a strong coupling strength. Under magnetic fields, the absence of zero-bias conductance peak in the pressurized point-contact Andreev reflection spectrum. Our findings imposes a constraint on the theoretical proposals for realizing Majorana bound states in noncentrosymmetric superconductors.</description>

      <title>Higgs mode in superconducting Titanium nanostructures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.15327</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.15327v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We report observations of Higgs modes in superconducting Titanium nanostructures at very low temperature. They appear as anomalies in the microwave complex impedance of the samples revealed by the presence of a dc supercurrent. By varying the sample geometry and contact material, we probe how the Higgs modes are sensitive to the dimensionality of superconductivity, the penetration of the dc and ac current densities in the sample and the dissipation in the contacts.</description>

      <title>Giant shot noise in superconductor/ferromagnet junctions with orbital-symmetry-controlled spin-orbit coupling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.15983</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.15983v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: By measuring the shot noise, a consequence of charge quantization, in superconductor/insulator/ferromagnet (V/MgO/Fe) junctions, we discover a giant increase, orders of magnitude larger than expected. The origin of this giant noise is a peculiar realization of a superconducting proximity effect, where a simple superconductor influences its neighbors. Our measurements reveal largely unexplored implications of orbital-symmetry-controlled proximity effects. The importance of orbital symmetries and the accompanying spin-orbit coupling is manifested by an unexpected emergence of another superconducting region strikingly different from the parent superconductor. Unlike vanadium's common spin-singlet superconductivity, the broken inversion symmetry in V/MgO/Fe junctions and the resulting interfacial spin-orbit coupling leads to the formation of spin-triplet superconductivity across the ferromagnetic iron. Here we show that the enhanced shot noise, known from Josephson junctions with two superconductors, is measured even in a single superconductor, this discovery motivates revisiting how the spin-orbit coupling and superconducting proximity effects can transform many materials.</description>

      <title>A controlled expansion for pairing in a polarized band with strong repulsion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.11079</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.11079v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Can strong repulsive interactions be shown to give rise to pairing in a controlled way? We find that for a single flavor polarized band, there is a small expansion parameter in the low density limit, once the Bloch wavefunction form factor is taken into account. A perturbative expansion is possible, even if the interaction is much stronger than the Fermi energy $\epsilon_F$. As a matter of principle, our work shows analytically how strong pairing can emerge from strong repulsion. We illustrate our method with two examples: a 2D Dirac model and a 1D tight binding model with two orbitals. In the latter case, using density matrix renormalization group, we show that the analytical theory indeed guided us to discover the parameter regime where p-wave pairing with order-1 strength is dominant.</description>

      <title>Pressure and doping effects on the electronic structure and magnetism of the single-layer nickelate La$_2$NiO$_4$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.23823</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.23823v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: La$_2$NiO$_4$ is a prototypical member of the Ruddlesden-Popper nickelate series that offers a valuable reference point for elucidating the key ingredients behind the intriguing properties of these systems. However, the structural and electronic properties of La$_2$NiO$_4$ under pressure and doping remain surprisingly underexplored. Here, we investigate these properties using density-functional-theory calculations. We find that its tetragonal $I4/mmm$ structure can be stabilized, not only under pressure, but also at ambient pressure via the partial substitution of La with Ba. In both cases, we find a pronounced magnetostructural interplay that manifests, in particular, as anomalies in the lattice-parameter evolution with composition, deviating from Vegard's law. Moreover, we show that the combined effects of Ba substitution and pressure leads to qualitative changes in the electronic structure towards the formal $d^{7.5}$ configuration of the superconducting bilayer nickelates. Further, while La$_2$NiO$_4$ can undergo a insulator-metal transition with pressure retaining G-type antiferromagnetic order, La$_{1.5}$Ba$_{0.5}$NiO$_4$ exhibits metallic behavior with an enhanced competition between different magnetic states. Our results thus offer new insights into the interplay of structure, doping, and magnetism across the Ruddlesden-Popper nickelate series.</description>

      <title>Proposal for spin superfluid quantum interference device</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.00237</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.00237v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In easy-plane magnets, the spin superfluid phase was predicted to facilitate coherent spin transport. So far, experimental evidence remains elusive. In this Letter, we propose an indirect way to sense this effect via the spin superfluid quantum interference device (spin SQUID), inspired by its superconducting counterpart (rf SQUID). The spin SQUID is constructed as a quasi-one-dimensional (1D) magnetic ring with a single Josephson weak link, functioning as an isolated device with a microwave response. The spin current is controlled by an in-plane electric field through Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interaction. This interaction can be interpreted as a gauge field that couples to the spin supercurrent through the Aharonov-Casher effect. By investigating the static and dynamic properties of the device, we show that the spin current and the harmonic frequencies of the spin superfluid are periodic with respect to the accumulated Aharonov-Casher phase and are, therefore, sensitive to the radial electric flux through the ring in units of an electric flux quantum, suggesting a potential electric-field sensing functionality. For readout, we propose to apply spectroscopic analysis to detect the frequency shift of the harmonic modes induced by this magnonic Stark effect.</description>
