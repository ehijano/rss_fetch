      <title>Manifestation of Quantum Forces in Spacetime: Towards a General Theory of Quantum Forces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.07332</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.07332v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study introduces the quantum force wave equation (QFWE) as a general theory of quantum forces, a novel framework that redefines quantum forces as emergent phenomena arising from the interaction between quantum particles and curved spacetime. By coupling wavefunctions to spacetime curvature and gauge fields, the theory establishes a dynamic, bidirectional relationship between quantum states and spacetime geometry. This approach provides a unified description of quantum forces in highly curved and dynamic gravitational fields, extending beyond the limitations of existing theories. The theory offers fresh insights into quantum gravity, quantum field theory in curved spacetime, and particle physics in extreme conditions, serving as a versatile tool for exploring the interplay between quantum mechanics and spacetime structure. This work lays the foundation for the advancement of high-energy physics and cosmology in regimes where spacetime curvature is fundamental.</description>

      <title>Sum Rules in Quantum Liquids</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.07950</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.07950v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We review the linear response theory in the horizontal quantum liquids framework spanning from Coulomb liquids to Atomic gases. There are several well known references about this subject, like the onset of the Kramers-Kronig relations and the fluctuation-dissipation theorem. For the Coulomb systems we show the connection between the linear response function and the dielectric function which settles a parallelism between statistical mechanics and electrostatic properties. For (very degenerate, dilute, trapped, two dimensional) Atomic (Bose) gases we will prove, in full generality, how the response properties of the gas depend from the frequency of the harmonic trap.</description>

      <title>Simple and accurate complete elliptic integrals for the full range of modulus</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.17159</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.17159v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The complete elliptic integral of the first and second kind, K(k) and E(k), appear in a multitude of physics and engineering applications. Because there is no known closed-form, the exact values have to be computed numerically. Here, approximations for the integrals are proposed based on their asymptotic behaviors. An inverse of K is also presented. As a result, the proposed K(k) and E(k) reproduce the exact analytical forms both in the zero and asymptotic limits, while in the mid-range of modulus maintain average error of 0.06% and 0.01% respectively. The key finding is the ability to compute the integrals with exceptional accuracy on both limits of elliptical conditions. An accuracy of 1 in 1,000 should be sufficient for practical or prototyping engineering and architecture designs. The simplicity should facilitate discussions of advanced physics topics in introductory physics classes, and enable broader collaborations among researchers from other fields of expertise. For example, the phase space of energy-conserving nonlinear pendulum using only elementary functions is discussed. The proposed inverse of K is shown to be Never Failing Newton Initialization and is an important step for the computation of the exact inverse. An algorithm based on Arithmetic-Geometric Mean for computing exact integrals and their derivatives are also presented, which should be useful in a platform that special functions are not accessible such as web-based and firmware developments.</description>
