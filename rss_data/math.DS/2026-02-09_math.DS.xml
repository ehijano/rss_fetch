      <title>Oscillation results for first order neutral delay differential equations with several positive and negative coefficients</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.06261</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.06261v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We provide sufficient criteria for the oscillation of all solutions of neutral delay differential equations of the form
  \[
  \left[x(t) - \sum_{i=1}^{N_r}R_i(t)x(t - r_i(t)) \right]' + \sum_{i=1}^{N_p}P_i(t)x(t - \tau_i(t)) - \sum_{i=1}^{N_q}Q_i(t)x(t - \delta_i(t))=0,
  \]
  with both positive and negative terms and time-variable delays.
  Our results improve and generalize several existing criteria available in the literature that address restricted cases, such as constant delays or the absence of negative coefficients. Under additional assumptions on slowly varying parameters, we derive sharper oscillation conditions. We demonstrate the applicability of our findings through illustrative examples.</description>

      <title>Symbolic dynamics for certain non-invertible $C^{1+\beta}$ maps</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.06354</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.06354v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $f$ be a non-invertible $C^{1+\beta}(\beta&gt;0)$ map with zero Lyapunov exponents and singularities on a closed Riemannian manifold $M$. We consider the symbolic dynamics of $f$. Combining the techniques in recent works of Sarig, Ovadia and Araujo-Lima-Poletti, we construct a countable Markov partition for the invariant set consisting of summable points of the inverse limit space of $(M, f)$ and show that there exists a finite-to-one symbolic extension for $f$ on the corresponding subset of $M$.</description>

      <title>Dimension spectrum of digit frequency sets for beta-expansions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.06368</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.06368v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: For any beta-shift $(X_\beta,\sigma)$ on two symbols, i.e., the symbolic coding of the beta-map for $1&lt;\beta\leq2$, we give an exact formula for the Hausdorff dimension $\dim_{H} \Lambda_{\alpha(t)}$ as a function of $t\in\mathbb{R}$, where $\Lambda_\alpha$ denotes the frequency set of the digit $1$ defined by \[\Lambda_\alpha=\Biggl\{(x_i)_{i=1}^\infty\in X_\beta;\ \lim_{n\to\infty}\frac{1}{n}\sum_{i=1}^{n}x_i=\alpha \Biggr\}\] for $\alpha\in[0,1]$ and $\alpha(t)$ is an explicit function related to the quasi-greedy expansion of $1$. The formula is derived from explicit formulae for eigenfunctions and eigenfunctionals corresponding to the leading eigenvalue $\lambda_t$ of the transfer operator $\mathcal{L}_t$ with the potential $t\chi_{C_1}$ for $t\in\mathbb{R}$, where $\chi_{C_{1}}$ denotes the indicator function of the cylinder set $C_1=\{(x_i)_{i=1}^\infty\in X_\beta; x_1=1\}$. These formulae can be applied not only to the leading eigenvalue but also to the other isolated eigenvalues of $\mathcal{L}_t$, which yields a precise spectral decomposition of $\mathcal{L}_t$. As a further application, we investigate the distribution function of the push-forward of the eigenmeasure corresponding to $\lambda_t$ by the inverse map of the coding map. We show that the distribution function after a change of variables for $t$ is equal to the Lebesgue singular function if $\beta=2$ and satisfies an analogy of the Hata-Yamaguchi formula, which yields a generalization of the Takagi function for beta-expansions with the base $1&lt;\beta&lt;2$.</description>

      <title>Maximal measures for flows with nonuniform structure</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.06428</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.06428v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we study ergodic optimization of continuous functions for flows by concentrating on the entropy spectrum of their maximizing measures. Precisely, over a wide family of flows with non-uniformly hyperbolic structure, we obtain a picture describing coexistence of continuous functions whose maximizing measures have large and small entropy respectively in $C^0$-topology. Our proof relies on the orbit decomposition technique, originally introduced by Climenhaga and Thompson, for flows with weakened versions of expansiveness and specification property. In particular, our results extend \cite{STY} from non-Markov shift on symbolic spaces to a considerably broad class of continuous flows with nonuniform structure. To illustrate this, we apply our general results to both geodesic flows and frame flows over closed rank one manifolds of nonpositive curvature.</description>

      <title>Chaotic Dynamics of Conformable Semigroups via Classical Theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.06782</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.06782v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Conformable derivatives involve a fractional parameter while preserving locality: on smooth functions they reduce to a classical derivative multiplied by an explicit weight. Exploiting this structural feature, we show that conformable time evolution does not give rise to a genuinely new semigroup theory. Rather, it can be fully interpreted as a classical $C_0$--semigroup observed through a nonlinear change of time. For $\delta\in(0,1]$, we introduce the conformable clock \[ \Psi(t)=\frac{t^\delta}{\delta}, \] and prove that every $C_0$--$\delta$--semigroup $\mathcal S_\delta$ admits the representation \[ \mathcal S_\delta(t)=\mathcal T(\Psi(t)), \] where $\mathcal T$ is a uniquely determined classical $C_0$--semigroup on the same state space. This correspondence is exact at the infinitesimal level: the $\delta$--generator of $\mathcal S_\delta$ coincides with the generator of $\mathcal T$ on a common domain, and conformable mild solutions are in one-to-one correspondence with classical mild solutions under the reparametrization $s=\Psi(t)$. In particular, orbit sets are unchanged by the conformable clock, so orbit-based linear dynamical properties are invariant; $\delta$--hypercyclicity and $\delta$--chaos coincide with their classical counterparts. As an application, we derive a conformable version of the Desch--Schappacher--Webb chaos criterion by transporting the classical result. The analysis is carried out in conformable Lebesgue spaces $L^{p,\delta}$, which are shown to be isometrically equivalent to standard $L^p$ spaces, allowing a direct transfer of estimates and spectral arguments. Altogether, the results clarify which dynamical features of conformable models are intrinsic and which arise solely from a nonlinear change of time.</description>

      <title>Multiple timescales in collective motion: daily and intraday upstream fish migration focusing on Feller condition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.06606</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.06606v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Fish migration is a collective phenomenon that has multiple timescales, ranging from daily to intraday (hourly or even finer). We propose a unified mathematical approach using diffusion bridges, nonlinear stochastic differential equations with pinned initial and terminal conditions, to model both daily and intraday fish migration phenomena. Drift and diffusion coefficients of these bridges are determined based on time-dependent parameterized average and variance curves fitted against fish count data, with which the unique existence of their solutions is rigorously guaranteed. We show that sample paths of the diffusion bridges have qualitatively distinctive properties depending on the Feller condition, namely, the ratio between the sizes of diffusion and drift. Our application study about the juvenile upstream migration of Plecoglossus altivelis altivelis (Ayu) in Japan clarifies similarities and differences between daily and intraday migration phenomena. Particularly, we discuss that the daily and intraday fish count data correspond to distinctive Feller indices, showing that the former is qualitatively less randomized and intermittent. The results obtained in this study suggest that the Feller condition potentially serves as an effective tool for evaluating fish migration phenomena of Ayu across different timescales.</description>

      <title>Radially symmetric transition-layer solutions in mass-conserving reaction-diffusion systems with bistable nonlinearity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.06779</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.06779v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Mass-conserving reaction-diffusion (MCRD) systems are widely used to model phase separation and pattern formation in cell polarity, biomolecular condensates, and ecological systems. Numerical simulations and formal asymptotic analysis suggest that such models can support stationary patterns with sharp internal interfaces. In this work, we establish for a general class of bistable MCRD systems the existence of nonconstant radially symmetric stationary solutions with a single internal transition layer on an $N$-dimensional ball, for general spatial dimension $N$. Our approach incorporates the global mass constraint directly into a refined matched-asymptotic framework complemented by a uniform spectral/linear analysis. Beyond mere existence, our framework yields arbitrarily high-order asymptotic approximations of the constructed solutions together with quantitative uniform error estimates, which provides a quantitative higher-dimensional theory of transition-layer patterns in MCRD systems and a rigorous justification for their use in modeling phase separation and pattern formation in biological and ecological settings.</description>

      <title>Sharp threshold dynamics for a bistable age-structured population model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.06809</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.06809v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper is devoted to the long-term dynamics of solutions to the Gurtin-MacCamy population model with a bistable birth function. We consider a one-parameter monotone family of initial distributions for the population such that for small values of the parameter, the corresponding population density gets extinct as time passes, whereas for large values of them, the solutions exhibit a different behavior. We are interested in the intermediate set of values for the parameters, which are called threshold parameters. We prove the existence of a sharp transition between these two asymptotic dynamics; that is, there exists exactly one threshold value when the age-dependent birth rate of the population has compact support, utilizing the theory of monotone dynamical systems. The case when the birth rate is non-compactly supported is more intricate to deal with, as has been observed in several works, even if the nonlinear birth function is monostable. Nevertheless, the approach used in the present work turns out to be effective to handle a particular birth rate with noncompact support by translating the dynamics of the age-structured model into an integro-differential system.</description>

      <title>Hyperbolicity of renormalization of critical quasicircle maps</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.09008</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.09008v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: There is a well developed renormalization theory of real analytic critical circle maps by de Faria, de Melo, and Yampolsky. In this paper, we extend Yampolsky's result on hyperbolicity of renormalization periodic points to a larger class of dynamical objects, namely critical quasicircle maps, i.e. analytic self homeomorphisms of a quasicircle with a single critical point. Unlike critical circle maps, the inner and outer criticalities of critical quasicircle maps can be distinct. We develop a compact analytic renormalization operator called Corona Renormalization with a hyperbolic fixed point whose stable manifold has codimension one and consists of critical quasicircle maps of the same criticality and periodic type rotation number. Our proof is an adaptation of Pacman Renormalization Theory for Siegel disks as well as rigidity results on the escaping dynamics of transcendental entire functions.</description>

      <title>Training in reverse: How iteration order influences convergence and stability in deep learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.01557</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.01557v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Despite exceptional achievements, training neural networks remains computationally expensive and is often plagued by instabilities that can degrade convergence. While learning rate schedules can help mitigate these issues, finding optimal schedules is time-consuming and resource-intensive. This work explores theoretical issues concerning training stability in the constant-learning-rate (i.e., without schedule) and small-batch-size regime. Surprisingly, we show that the composition order of gradient updates affects stability and convergence in gradient-based optimizers. We illustrate this new line of thinking using backward-SGD, which produces parameter iterates at each step by reverting the usual forward composition order of batch gradients. Our theoretical analysis shows that in contractive regions (e.g., around minima) backward-SGD converges to a point while the standard forward-SGD generally only converges to a distribution. This leads to improved stability and convergence which we demonstrate experimentally. While full backward-SGD is computationally intensive in practice, it highlights that the extra freedom of modifying the usual iteration composition by reusing creatively previous batches at each optimization step may have important beneficial effects in improving training. Our experiments provide a proof of concept supporting this phenomenon. To our knowledge, this represents a new and unexplored avenue in deep learning optimization.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2511.05366v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate nonequilibrium steady-state dynamics in both continuous- and discrete-state stochastic processes. Our analysis focuses on planar diffusion dynamics and their coarse-grained approximations by discrete-state Markov chains. Using finite-volume approximations, we derive an approximate master equation directly from the underlying diffusion and show that this discretisation preserves key features of the nonequilibrium steady-state. In particular, we show that the entropy production rate of the approximation converges as the number of discrete states goes to the limit. These results are illustrated with analytically solvable diffusions and numerical experiments on nonlinear processes, demonstrating how this approach can be used to explore the dependence of entropy production rate on model parameters. Finally, we address the problem of inferring discrete-state Markov models from continuous stochastic trajectories. We show that discrete-state models significantly underestimate the true entropy production rate. However, we also show that they can provide tests to determine if a stationary planar diffusion is out of equilibrium. This property is illustrated with both simulated data and empirical trajectories from schooling fish.</description>

      <title>Generalizations of the Squircle-Lemniscate Relation and Keplerian Dynamics</title>

      <description>arXiv:2601.17358v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper establishes a generalized relationship between the arc length of sinusoidal spirals \(r^n=\cos(n\theta)\) and the area of generalized Lam\'e curves defined by \(x^{2n}+y^{2n}=1\). Building on our previous work connecting the lemniscate to the squircle, we prove an integral identity relating these two curves for any positive integer $n$, which we further generalize to arbitrary positive real exponents and general superellipses. We further extend this correspondence to a geometric relationship between radial sectors of the Lam\'e curve and arc lengths of the spiral, providing a physical interpretation where keplerian motion on the Lam\'e curve corresponds to uniform motion on the spiral. Additionally, we derive an explicit central force law for keplerian motion along the Lam\'e curve. Finally, we introduce policles--a new class of curves generalizing the squircle--and demonstrate a direct geometric mapping between their sectors and the arc lengths of sinusoidal spirals.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2602.01487v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the spectral stability of travelling and stationary front and pulse solutions in a class of degenerate reaction-diffusion systems. We characterise the essential spectrum of the linearised operator in full generality and identify conditions under which it lies entirely in the left-half plane. For a number of special cases we obtain analytical results, including explicit Evans functions, and complete spectral descriptions for certain stationary waves. In regimes where analytical methods are not available, we compute the point spectrum numerically using a Riccati-Evans function approach. Our results show that stable travelling fronts can occur, while travelling pulses are typically unstable.</description>
