      <title>Beyond Test Scores: How Academic Rank Shapes Long-Term Outcomes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.11973</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.11973v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the effects of academic rank using data on the entire population of children enrolled in primary schools in Aberdeen, Scotland, in 1962. Exploiting quasi-random variation in peer group composition, we estimate the causal impact of rank on academic performance, noncognitive development, parental investment, and long-term outcomes. Higher rank improves achievement on the high-stakes eleven-plus examination and strengthens internalizing skills (traits related to self-concept and confidence), suggesting that rank effects operate primarily through students' self-perception. Using a follow-up survey conducted forty years later, we find that rank raises educational attainment, particularly for girls, while long-term income gains emerge only among boys. The gender gap in long-run effects likely reflects historical barriers to women's access to higher education and skilled employment during this period.</description>

      <title>Generative AI and Firm Productivity: Field Experiments in Online Retail</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.12049</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.12049v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We quantify the impact of Generative Artificial Intelligence (GenAI) on firm productivity through a series of large-scale randomized field experiments involving millions of users and products at a leading cross-border online retail platform. Over six months in 2023-2024, GenAI-based enhancements were integrated into seven consumer-facing business workflows. We find that GenAI adoption significantly increases sales, with treatment effects ranging from 0\% to 16.3\%, depending on GenAI's marginal contribution relative to existing firm practices. Because inputs and prices were held constant across experimental arms, these gains map directly into total factor productivity improvements. Across the four GenAI applications with positive effects, the implied annual incremental value is approximately \$5 per consumer-an economically meaningful impact given the retailer's scale and the early stage of GenAI adoption. The primary mechanism operates through higher conversion rates, consistent with GenAI reducing frictions in the marketplace and improving consumer experience. We also document substantial heterogeneity: smaller and newer sellers, as well as less experienced consumers, exhibit disproportionately larger gains. Our findings provide novel, large-scale causal evidence on the productivity effects of GenAI in online retail, highlighting both its immediate value and broader potential.</description>

      <title>The value of storage in electricity distribution: The role of storage</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.12435</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.12435v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Electricity distribution companies deploy battery storage to defer grid upgrades by reducing peak demand. In deregulated jurisdictions, such storage often sits idle because regulatory constraints bar participation in electricity markets. Here, we develop an optimization framework that, to our knowledge, provides the first formal model of market participation constraints within storage investment and operation planning. Applying the framework to a Massachusetts case study, we find that market participation could deliver similar savings as peak demand reduction. Under current conditions, market participation does not increase storage investment, but at very low storage costs, could incentivize deployment beyond local distribution needs. This might run contrary to the separation of distribution from generation in deregulated markets. Our framework can identify investment levels appropriate for local distribution needs.</description>

      <title>Are EU low-carbon structural funds efficient in reducing emissions?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.01782</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.01782v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate the effectiveness of low-carbon expenditures from the European Structural and Investment Funds in reducing greenhouse gas emissions across EU regions. Using trend and cycle decomposition of per capita emissions and emissions intensity, along with a panel data approach that incorporates long lags to mitigate reverse causality, we find highly heterogeneous effects. In less developed regions, investments are associated with long-term increases in per capita emissions, whereas in transition and developed regions, the effects are weak or not significant. When disaggregated by gas type, results remain inconsistent. Our findings highlight that regional disparities challenge the effectiveness of EU climate efforts.</description>

      <title>The Global Minimum Tax, Investment Incentives and Asymmetric Tax Competition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.05397</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.05397v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper investigates how the OECD's global minimum tax (GMT) affects multinational enterprises (MNEs) behavior and countries' corporate taxes. We consider both profit shifting and capital investment responses of the MNE in a formal model of tax competition between asymmetric countries. The GMT reduces the true tax rate differential and benefits the large country, while the revenue effect is generally ambiguous for the small country. In the short run where tax rates are fixed, due to tax deduction of the substance-based income exclusion (SBIE), a higher minimum rate exerts investment incentives but also incurs a larger revenue loss for the small country. We show that under high (low) profit shifting costs the former (latter) effect dominates so that the small country's revenue increases (decreases). In the long run where countries can adjust tax rates, the GMT reshapes the tax game and the competition pattern. In contrast to the existing literature, we reveal that the minimum rate binds the small country only if it is low. With the rise of the GMT rate, countries will undercut the minimum to boost real investments and collect top-up taxes. Our simulations show that introducing a GMT with moderate minimum rate raises both countries' revenues and the large country's welfare. However, it may reduce the small country's welfare if the welfare weight of private income is high.</description>

      <title>Securing the supply of graphite for batteries</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.21521</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.21521v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Surging demand for graphite in energy storage applications has led to concerns about supply chai security for manufacturers and nations globally. Currently, China produces over 92% of graphite for anodes, posing a risk for industries reliant on graphite supply. Here, we systematically assess the costs of producing natural and synthetic battery-grade graphite in the U.S. and China using process-based cost models. We find that production costs in the U.S. are higher than those in China by 100-200%, so scaling production in the short-term will require significant policy support. We use our models to explore opportunities to improve the competitiveness of graphite production outside China, finding that lower financing rates and improved shaping yields can together reduce costs by 25-30%. Further implementing other cost reduction strategies, such as improving process throughput or lowering equipment costs, can achieve 35-40% lower costs. Finally, we discuss how innovative graphite production processes like methane pyrolysis and catalytic graphitization may provide competitive pathways.</description>

      <title>Attention vs Choice in Welfare Take-Up: What Works for WIC?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.03457</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.03457v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We decompose the causes of incomplete take-up of welfare program benefits into two latent mechanisms: inattention, where households do not consider program participation, and active choice, where households consider participation but find it not worthwhile. To capture these two mechanisms, we model the household take-up decision as a two-stage process: attention followed by choice. Our model allows covariates to influence both stages simultaneously, creating an identification challenge in quantifying covariate impact on either stage separately. Exploiting two institutional structures of welfare programs: full attention among current participants and the recertification process, we prove that attention and choice parameters are constructively identifiable. Applied to National Longitudinal Survey of Youth 1997, NLSY97, data on the Special Supplemental Nutrition Program for Women, Infants, and Children, WIC, our model reveals substantial household-level heterogeneity in both attention and choice probabilities. Furthermore, counterfactual simulations predict that choice-nudging policies outperform attention-boosting policies. We test this prediction using data from a WIC pilot program in Vermont that sent choice-nudging and attention-boosting text messages to different households. Consistent with the counterfactual prediction, choice-nudging messages increased retention by 8 to 10 percentage points, while attention-boosting messages had statistically insignificant effects. Our results highlight the critical role of choice nudges in improving program take-up.</description>

      <title>Interpreting the Interpreter: Can We Model post-ECB Conferences Volatility with LLM Agents?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.13635</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.13635v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Traditional high-frequency identification of monetary policy communication effects operates ex-post, precluding evaluation of alternative strategies before publication. In this paper, we introduce an ex-ante framework that simulates heterogeneous market reactions to central bank communication before release. Our methodology employs Large Language Models (LLMs) to construct an agent-based simulation of 30 synthetic traders with heterogeneous risk preferences, cognitive biases, and interpretive styles. These agents process European Central Bank (ECB) press conference transcripts and forecast Euro interest rate swap rates across 3-month, 2-year, and 10-year maturities. Cross-sectional forecast dispersion provides a model-based measure of market disagreement, validated against realized overnight index swap (OIS) volatility. Analyzing 283 ECB press conferences (June 1998-April 2025), we document Spearman correlations of approximately 0.5 between simulated and realized disagreement, rising to 0.6 under iterative prompt optimization. Results prove robust across prompting strategies, are temporally stable across training and holdout samples, and fare significantly better than simple language complexity scores. For central banks, the framework provides an operational tool to anticipate communication-induced volatility before release, thus enabling ex-ante language refinement. For researchers, it offers a micro-founded alternative to reduced-form event studies, explicitly modeling the heterogeneous interpretive processes through which policy signals are transmitted to asset prices.</description>

      <title>Pixels to Prices: Visual Traits, Market Cycles, and the Economics of NFT Valuation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.24879</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.24879v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Pixels and market cycles both move NFT prices. Non-fungible tokens (NFTs) are unique digital assets, often used to represent ownership of digital art, collectibles, and other media, secured on blockchain networks like Ethereum. The rise of NFTs has led to the creation of a multi-billion-dollar market for digital art and collectibles, making it a key area of interest for researchers, artists, and investors. Using 94,039 transactions from 26 major generative Ethereum collections, this study extracts 196 machine-quantified image descriptors - color, composition, palette structure, geometry, texture, and deep-learning embeddings - and applies a three-stage filter to identify stable predictors for hedonic regression. A static mixed-effects model shows that market sentiment and transparent, interpretable image traits have significant and independent pricing power: higher focal saturation, tighter compositional concentration, and greater curvature are rewarded, while clutter, heavy line work, and dispersed palettes are discounted; deep embeddings add limited incremental value once explicit traits are included. To assess state dependence, a Bayesian dynamic mixed-effects panel with cycle effects is estimated, allowing Composition Focus - Saturation - the ratio of saturation in the central region to the whole image, capturing vividness and concentration at the focal area - to vary across market regimes. Collection-level heterogeneity (brand premia) is absorbed by random effects. The time-varying coefficients exhibit clear regime sensitivity, with stronger premia in expansionary phases and weaker or negative loadings in downturns, while the grand-mean effect is small on average. Overall, NFT prices reflect both observable digital product characteristics and market regimes, and the framework offers a cycle-aware tool for asset pricing, platform strategy, and market design in digital art markets.</description>

      <title>Proofs for the New Definitions in Financial Markets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.03003</link>
      <description>arXiv:2309.03003v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The aim of this study is to present proofs for new theorems. Basic thoughts of new definitions emerge from the decision-making under uncertainty in economics and finance. Shape of the certain utility curve is central to standard definitions in determining risk attitudes of investors. Shape alone determines risk behavior of investors in standard theory. Although the terms risk-averse, risk-loving, and risk-neutral are equivalent to strict concavity, strict convexity, and linearity, respectively, in standard theory, strict concavity or strict convexity, or linearity are valid for certain new definitions. The connection between the curvature of utility curve and risk attitude is broken for the new definitions. For instance, convex utility curve may show risk-averse behavior under new definitions. Additionally, this paper has proved that new definitions are richer than standard ones when shape is considered. Hence, it can be stated that new definitions are broader than standard definitions from the viewpoint of shape. With all of these, it has been demonstrated that the theorems and proofs in this study extend the standard utility theory in an important way.</description>
