      <title>Fractional damping enhances chaos in the nonlinear Helmholtz oscillator</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.17599</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.17599v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The main purpose of this paper is to study both the underdamped and the overdamped dynamics of the nonlinear Helmholtz oscillator with a fractional order damping. For that purpose, we use the Grunwald-Letnikov fractional derivative algorithm in order to get the numerical simulations. Here, we investigate the effect of taking the fractional derivative in the dissipative term in function of the parameter a. Our main findings show that the trajectories can remain inside the well or can escape from it depending on a which plays the role of a control parameter. Besides, the parameter a is also relevant for the creation or destruction of chaotic motions. On the other hand, the study of the escape times of the particles from the well, as a result of variations of the initial conditions and the undergoing force F, is reported by the use of visualization techniques such as basins of attraction and bifurcation diagrams, showing a good agreement with previous results. Finally, the study of the escape times versus the fractional parameter a shows an exponential decay which goes to zero when a is larger than one. All the results have been carried out for weak damping where chaotic motions can take place in the non-fractional case and also for a stronger damping (overdamped case), where the influence of the fractional term plays a crucial role to enhance chaotic motions. We expect that these results can be of interest in the field of fractional calculus and its applications.</description>

      <title>Generation of kink-antikink pairs through the excitation of an oscillon in the $\phi^4$ model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.17848</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.17848v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We examine the oscillon decay in a model with a single scalar field and two asymmetric fundamental states. Specifically, we verify how the evolution of an initially excited oscillon leads to the formation of antikink-kink pairs in the presence of a centered long-lived pulse. In such a context, the magnitude of the original perturbation stands for the most important factor influencing the process. For intermediary values of this magnitude, we find a transitory behavior which suggests that the energy exchange between translational and vibrational modes begins to play an important role in the overall evolution. As the magnitude increases, the centered pulse intermediates an interaction between the inner structures which compose the pairs whose behavior mimics that of a standard antikink-kink collision and therefore reinforces the role played by the energy transfer mechanism. For different values of width, an almost pure antikink-kink pair escapes to the infinity after multiple bounces.</description>

      <title>Stability of fronts in the diffusive Rosenzweig-MacArthur model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.15260</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.15260v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We consider a diffusive Rosenzweig-MacArthur predator-prey model in the situation when the prey diffuses at the rate much smaller than that of the predator. In a certain parameter regime, the existence of fronts in the system is known: the underlying dynamical system in a singular limit is reduced to a scalar Fisher-KPP equation and the fronts supported by the full system are small perturbations of the Fisher-KPP fronts. The existence proof is based on application of the Geometric Singular Perturbation Theory with respect to two small parameters. This paper is focused on the stability of the fronts. We analyze the stability by means of energy estimates, exponential dichotomies, the Evans function calculation, and a technique that involves constructing the unstable augmented bundles. The energy estimates provide bounds on the unstable spectrum which depend on the small parameters of the system; the bounds are inversely proportional to these parameters. We further improve these estimates by showing that the eigenvalue problem is a small perturbation of some limiting (as the modulus of the eigenvalue parameter goes to infinity) system, and that the limiting system has exponential dichotomies. Persistence of the exponential dichotomies then leads to bounds uniform in the small parameters. The main novelty of this approach is related to the fact that the limit of the eigenvalue problem is not autonomous. We then use the concept of the unstable augmented bundles and by treating these as multiscale topological structures with respect to the same two small parameters consequently as in the existence proof, we show that the stability of the fronts is also governed by the scalar Fisher-KPP equation.</description>

      <title>Penrose method for Kuramoto model with inertia and noise</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.06442</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.06442v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Using the Penrose method of instability analysis, we consider the synchronization transition in the Kuramoto model with inertia and noise with all-to-all couplings. Analyzing the Penrose curves, we identify the appearance of cluster and chimera states in the presence of noise. We observe that noise can destroy chimera and biclusters states. The critical coupling describing bifurcation from incoherent to coherent state is found analytically. To confirm our propositions based on the Penrose method, we perform numerical simulations.</description>

      <title>Stable vortex solitons sustained by a localized gain in the cubic medium</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.14910</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.14910v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We propose a simple dissipative system with purely cubic defocusing nonlinearity and nonuniform linear gain that can support stable localized dissipative vortex solitons with high topological charges without the utilization of competing nonlinearities and nonlinear gain or losses. Localization of such solitons is achieved due to an intriguing mechanism when defocusing nonlinearity stimulates energy flow from the ring-like region with linear gain to the periphery of the medium where energy is absorbed due to linear background losses. Vortex solitons bifurcate from linear gain-guided vortical modes with eigenvalues depending on topological charges that become purely real only at specific gain amplitudes. Increasing gain amplitude leads to transverse expansion of vortex solitons, but simultaneously it usually also leads to stability enhancement. Increasing background losses allows creation of stable vortex solitons with high topological charges that are usually prone to instabilities in conservative and dissipative systems. Propagation of the perturbed unstable vortex solitons in this system reveals unusual dynamical regimes, when instead of decay or breakup, the initial state transforms into stable vortex soliton with lower or sometimes even with higher topological charge. Our results suggest an efficient mechanism for the formation of nonlinear excited vortex-carrying states with suppressed destructive azimuthal modulational instabilities in a simple setting relevant to a wide class of systems, including polaritonic systems, structured microcavities, and lasers.</description>
