      <title>Neural Architecture Search with Mixed Bio-inspired Learning Rules</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.13485</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.13485v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Bio-inspired neural networks are attractive for their adversarial robustness, energy frugality, and closer alignment with cortical physiology, yet they often lag behind back-propagation (BP) based models in accuracy and ability to scale. We show that allowing the use of different bio-inspired learning rules in different layers, discovered automatically by a tailored neural-architecture-search (NAS) procedure, bridges this gap. Starting from standard NAS baselines, we enlarge the search space to include bio-inspired learning rules and use NAS to find the best architecture and learning rule to use in each layer. We show that neural networks that use different bio-inspired learning rules for different layers have better accuracy than those that use a single rule across all the layers. The resulting NN that uses a mix of bio-inspired learning rules sets new records for bio-inspired models: 95.16% on CIFAR-10, 76.48% on CIFAR-100, 43.42% on ImageNet16-120, and 60.51% top-1 on ImageNet. In some regimes, they even surpass comparable BP-based networks while retaining their robustness advantages. Our results suggest that layer-wise diversity in learning rules allows better scalability and accuracy, and motivates further research on mixing multiple bio-inspired learning rules in the same network.</description>

      <title>Evolving Neural Controllers for Xpilot-AI Racing Using Neuroevolution of Augmenting Topologies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.13549</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.13549v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper investigates the development of high-performance racing controllers for a newly implemented racing mode within the Xpilot-AI platform, utilizing the Neuro Evolution of Augmenting Topologies (NEAT) algorithm. By leveraging NEAT's capability to evolve both the structure and weights of neural networks, we develop adaptive controllers that can navigate complex circuits under the challenging space simulation physics of Xpilot-AI, which includes elements such as inertia, friction, and gravity. The racing mode we introduce supports flexible circuit designs and allows for the evaluation of multiple agents in parallel, enabling efficient controller optimization across generations. Experimental results demonstrate that our evolved controllers achieve up to 32% improvement in lap time compared to the controller's initial performance and develop effective racing strategies, such as optimal cornering and speed modulation, comparable to human-like techniques. This work illustrates NEAT's effectiveness in producing robust control strategies within demanding game environments and highlights Xpilot-AI's potential as a rigorous testbed for competitive AI controller evolution.</description>

      <title>MorphoNAS: Embryogenic Neural Architecture Search Through Morphogen-Guided Development</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.13785</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.13785v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: While biological neural networks develop from compact genomes using relatively simple rules, modern artificial neural architecture search methods mostly involve explicit and routine manual work. In this paper, we introduce MorphoNAS (Morphogenetic Neural Architecture Search), a system able to deterministically grow neural networks through morphogenetic self-organization inspired by the Free Energy Principle, reaction-diffusion systems, and gene regulatory networks. In MorphoNAS, simple genomes encode just morphogens dynamics and threshold-based rules of cellular development. Nevertheless, this leads to self-organization of a single progenitor cell into complex neural networks, while the entire process is built on local chemical interactions. Our evolutionary experiments focused on two different domains: structural targeting, in which MorphoNAS system was able to find fully successful genomes able to generate predefined random graph configurations (8-31 nodes); and functional performance on the CartPole control task achieving low complexity 6-7 neuron solutions when target network size minimization evolutionary pressure was applied. The evolutionary process successfully balanced between quality of of the final solutions and neural architecture search effectiveness. Overall, our findings suggest that the proposed MorphoNAS method is able to grow complex specific neural architectures, using simple developmental rules, which suggests a feasible biological route to adaptive and efficient neural architecture search.</description>

      <title>Conceptual and Design Principles for a Self-Referential Algorithm Mimicking Neuronal Assembly Functions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.14011</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.14011v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This article proposes a method to formalise models of cognitive processes grounded in experience, considering experience from the perspective of a living system and not from that of an observer of the living system. The perspective of a living system is defined by the need of the system to preserve the vital equilibria. The method is based on an algorithmic schema that we call Environment Generative Operator (EGO) and uses a self-referential language developed for this purpose which we call E-language. EGO simulates cognitive processes as operations on neuron assemblies as understood by Hebb. In this article we present an EGO prototype (EGO-P) which has already been implemented and tested.</description>

      <title>SCOPE for Hexapod Gait Generation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.13539</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.13539v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Evolutionary methods have previously been shown to be an effective learning method for walking gaits on hexapod robots. However, the ability of these algorithms to evolve an effective policy rapidly degrades as the input space becomes more complex. This degradation is due to the exponential growth of the solution space, resulting from an increasing parameter count to handle a more complex input. In order to address this challenge, we introduce Sparse Cosine Optimized Policy Evolution (SCOPE). SCOPE utilizes the Discrete Cosine Transform (DCT) to learn directly from the feature coefficients of an input matrix. By truncating the coefficient matrix returned by the DCT, we can reduce the dimensionality of an input while retaining the highest energy features of the original input. We demonstrate the effectiveness of this method by using SCOPE to learn the gait of a hexapod robot. The hexapod controller is given a matrix input containing time-series information of previous poses, which are then transformed to gait parameters by an evolved policy. In this task, the addition of SCOPE to a reference algorithm achieves a 20% increase in efficacy. SCOPE achieves this result by reducing the total input size of the time-series pose data from 2700 to 54, a 98% decrease. Additionally, SCOPE is capable of compressing an input to any output shape, provided that each output dimension is no greater than the corresponding input dimension. This paper demonstrates that SCOPE is capable of significantly compressing the size of an input to an evolved controller, resulting in a statistically significant gain in efficacy.</description>

      <title>When Person Re-Identification Meets Event Camera: A Benchmark Dataset and An Attribute-guided Re-Identification Framework</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.13659</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.13659v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recent researchers have proposed using event cameras for person re-identification (ReID) due to their promising performance and better balance in terms of privacy protection, event camera-based person ReID has attracted significant attention. Currently, mainstream event-based person ReID algorithms primarily focus on fusing visible light and event stream, as well as preserving privacy. Although significant progress has been made, these methods are typically trained and evaluated on small-scale or simulated event camera datasets, making it difficult to assess their real identification performance and generalization ability. To address the issue of data scarcity, this paper introduces a large-scale RGB-event based person ReID dataset, called EvReID. The dataset contains 118,988 image pairs and covers 1200 pedestrian identities, with data collected across multiple seasons, scenes, and lighting conditions. We also evaluate 15 state-of-the-art person ReID algorithms, laying a solid foundation for future research in terms of both data and benchmarking. Based on our newly constructed dataset, this paper further proposes a pedestrian attribute-guided contrastive learning framework to enhance feature learning for person re-identification, termed TriPro-ReID. This framework not only effectively explores the visual features from both RGB frames and event streams, but also fully utilizes pedestrian attributes as mid-level semantic features. Extensive experiments on the EvReID dataset and MARS datasets fully validated the effectiveness of our proposed RGB-Event person ReID framework. The benchmark dataset and source code will be released on https://github.com/Event-AHU/Neuromorphic_ReID</description>

      <title>Edge Intelligence with Spiking Neural Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.14069</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.14069v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The convergence of artificial intelligence and edge computing has spurred growing interest in enabling intelligent services directly on resource-constrained devices. While traditional deep learning models require significant computational resources and centralized data management, the resulting latency, bandwidth consumption, and privacy concerns have exposed critical limitations in cloud-centric paradigms. Brain-inspired computing, particularly Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs), offers a promising alternative by emulating biological neuronal dynamics to achieve low-power, event-driven computation. This survey provides a comprehensive overview of Edge Intelligence based on SNNs (EdgeSNNs), examining their potential to address the challenges of on-device learning, inference, and security in edge scenarios. We present a systematic taxonomy of EdgeSNN foundations, encompassing neuron models, learning algorithms, and supporting hardware platforms. Three representative practical considerations of EdgeSNN are discussed in depth: on-device inference using lightweight SNN models, resource-aware training and updating under non-stationary data conditions, and secure and privacy-preserving issues. Furthermore, we highlight the limitations of evaluating EdgeSNNs on conventional hardware and introduce a dual-track benchmarking strategy to support fair comparisons and hardware-aware optimization. Through this study, we aim to bridge the gap between brain-inspired learning and practical edge deployment, offering insights into current advancements, open challenges, and future research directions. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first dedicated and comprehensive survey on EdgeSNNs, providing an essential reference for researchers and practitioners working at the intersection of neuromorphic computing and edge intelligence.</description>
