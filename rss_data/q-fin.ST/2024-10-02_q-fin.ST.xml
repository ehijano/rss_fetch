      <title>Cross-Lingual News Event Correlation for Stock Market Trend Prediction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.00024</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.00024v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the modern economic landscape, integrating financial services with Financial Technology (FinTech) has become essential, particularly in stock trend analysis. This study addresses the gap in comprehending financial dynamics across diverse global economies by creating a structured financial dataset and proposing a cross-lingual Natural Language-based Financial Forecasting (NLFF) pipeline for comprehensive financial analysis. Utilizing sentiment analysis, Named Entity Recognition (NER), and semantic textual similarity, we conducted an analytical examination of news articles to extract, map, and visualize financial event timelines, uncovering the correlation between news events and stock market trends. Our method demonstrated a meaningful correlation between stock price movements and cross-linguistic news sentiments, validated by processing two-year cross-lingual news data on two prominent sectors of the Pakistan Stock Exchange. This study offers significant insights into key events, ensuring a substantial decision margin for investors through effective visualization and providing optimal investment opportunities.</description>

      <title>Impermanent loss and loss-vs-rebalancing I: some statistical properties</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.00854</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.00854v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: There are two predominant metrics to assess the performance of automated market makers and their profitability for liquidity providers: 'impermanent loss' (IL) and 'loss-versus-rebalance' (LVR). In this short paper we shed light on the statistical aspects of both concepts and show that they are more similar than conventionally appreciated. Our analysis uses the properties of a random walk and some analytical properties of the statistical integral combined with the mechanics of a constant function market maker (CFMM). We consider non-toxic or rather unspecific trading in this paper. Our main finding can be summarized in one sentence: For Brownian motion with a given volatility, IL and LVR have identical expectation values but vastly differing distribution functions.</description>

      <title>When can weak latent factors be statistically inferred?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.03616</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.03616v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This article establishes a new and comprehensive estimation and inference theory for principal component analysis (PCA) under the weak factor model that allow for cross-sectional dependent idiosyncratic components under the nearly minimal factor strength relative to the noise level or signal-to-noise ratio. Our theory is applicable regardless of the relative growth rate between the cross-sectional dimension $N$ and temporal dimension $T$. This more realistic assumption and noticeable result require completely new technical device, as the commonly-used leave-one-out trick is no longer applicable to the case with cross-sectional dependence. Another notable advancement of our theory is on PCA inference $ - $ for example, under the regime where $N\asymp T$, we show that the asymptotic normality for the PCA-based estimator holds as long as the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) grows faster than a polynomial rate of $\log N$. This finding significantly surpasses prior work that required a polynomial rate of $N$. Our theory is entirely non-asymptotic, offering finite-sample characterizations for both the estimation error and the uncertainty level of statistical inference. A notable technical innovation is our closed-form first-order approximation of PCA-based estimator, which paves the way for various statistical tests. Furthermore, we apply our theories to design easy-to-implement statistics for validating whether given factors fall in the linear spans of unknown latent factors, testing structural breaks in the factor loadings for an individual unit, checking whether two units have the same risk exposures, and constructing confidence intervals for systematic risks. Our empirical studies uncover insightful correlations between our test results and economic cycles.</description>
