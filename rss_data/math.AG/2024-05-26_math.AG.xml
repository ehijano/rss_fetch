      <title>Splicing positroid varieties</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.15112</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.15112v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We construct an explicit isomorphism between an open subset in the open positroid variety $\Pi_{k,n}^{\circ}$ in the Grassmannian $\mathrm{Gr}(k,n)$ and the product of two open positroid varieties $\Pi_{k,n-a+1}^{\circ}\times \Pi_{k,a+k-1}^{\circ}$. In the respective cluster structures, this isomorphism is given by freezing a certain subset of cluster variables and applying a cluster quasi-equivalence.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.15195v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We show that there exists an automorphism of a projective K3 surface with Picard number $2$ such that the trace of its action on the Picard lattice is $3$. Together with a result of K. Hashimoto, J. Keum and K. Lee, we determine the set of dynamical degrees of automorphisms of projective K3 surfaces with Picard number $2$.</description>

      <title>A global approach for the redefinition of higher-order flexibility and rigidity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.15447</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.15447v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The famous example of the double-Watt mechanism given by Connelly and Servatius raises some problems concerning the classical definitions of higher-order flexibility and rigidity, respectively, as they attest the cusp configuration of the mechanism a third-order rigidity, which conflicts with its continuous flexion. Some attempts were done to resolve the dilemma but they could not settle the problem. As cusp mechanisms demonstrate the basic shortcoming of any local mobility analysis using higher-order constraints, we present a global approach inspired by Sabitov's finite algorithm for testing the bendability of a polyhedron, which allows us (a) to compute iteratively configurations with a higher-order flexion and (b) to come up with a proper redefinition of higher-order flexibility and rigidity. We also give algorithms for computing the flexion orders as well as the associated flexes. The presented approach is demonstrated on several examples (double-Watt mechanisms and Tarnai's Leonardo structure). Moreover, we determine all configurations of a given 3-RPR manipulator with a third-order flexion and present a corresponding joint-bar framework of flexion order 23.</description>

      <title>Double EPW-cubes: automorphisms and degenerations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.15510</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.15510v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We describe the group of naturally polarized automorphisms of a double EPW-cube. As an application, we exhibit examples of manifolds of K3^[3]-type with a symplectic action of a large group and determine their transcendental lattices. We study degenerations of smooth double EPW-cubes and give a resolution of mildly singular double EPW-cubes, this gives a family of hyperkaehler manifolds of K3^[3]-type whose general element is not birational to a moduli space of sheaves on a K3 surface.</description>

      <title>General type results for moduli of deformation generalised Kummer varieties</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.15675</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.15675v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In arXiv:1710.01672, we obtained general type results for orthogonal modular varieties associated with moduli spaces of compact hyperk\"ahler manifolds of deformation generalised Kummer type (also known as 'deformation generalised Kummer varieties'). The orthogonal modular varieties were defined in terms of an integer 2d, corresponding to the degree of polarisation of the associated hyperk\"ahler manifolds. In arXiv:1710.01672, we showed these orthogonal modular varieties are of general type when 2d is square-free and sufficiently large. Here we show that the square-free condition can be removed.</description>

Abstract: We prove that if $f\colon\mathbb{C}^p\rightarrow\mathbb{P}^n(\mathbb{C})$ is a holomorphic mapping of maximal rank whose image lies in the Fermat hypersurface of degree $d&gt;(n+1)\max\{n-p,1\}$, then its image is contained in a linear subspace of dimension at most $\bigg[\dfrac{n-1}{2}\bigg]$. Analog in the logarithmic case is also given. Our result strengthens a classical result of Green and provides a Nevanlinna theoretic proof for a recent result due to Etesse.</description>

      <title>Counting representations of quivers with multiplicities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.14914</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.14914v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this thesis, we study counts of quiver representations over finite rings of truncated power series. We prove a plethystic formula relating counts of quiver representations over these rings and counts of jets on fibres of quiver moment maps. This solves a conjecture of Wyss and allows us to compute both counts on additional examples, using local zeta functions. The relation between counts of representations and counts of jets generalises the relation between Kac polynomials and counts of points on preprojective stacks. Pursuing this analogy, we establish further properties of our counts. We show that, for totally negative quivers, counts of jets converge to p-adic integrals on fibres of quiver moment maps. One expects a relation between these p-adic integrals and BPS invariants of preprojective algebras i.e. Kac polynomials. For small rank vectors, we also prove that the polynomials counting indecomposable quiver representations over finite rings have non-negative coefficients. Moreover, we show that jet schemes of fibres of quiver moment maps are cohomologically pure in that setting, so that their Poincar\'e polynomials are given by the former counts. This is reminiscent of the structure of cohomological Hall algebras, which are built from the cohomology of preprojective stacks. Finally, we compute the cohomology of jet spaces of preprojective stacks explicitly for the A2 quiver. Building on the structure of the preprojective cohomological Hall algebra of A2, we propose a candidate analogue of the BPS Lie algebra and conjecture the existence of a Hall product on the cohomology of these jet spaces.</description>

      <title>Higher rank series and root puzzles for plumbed 3-manifolds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.14972</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.14972v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: For a triple consisting of a weakly negative definite plumbed 3-manifold, a root lattice, and a generalized $\mathrm{Spin}^c$-structure, we construct a family of invariants in the form of a Laurent series. Each series is an invariant of the triple up to orientation preserving homeomorphisms and the action of the Weyl group. We show that there are infinitely many such series for irreducible root lattices of rank at least 2, with each series depending on a solution to a combinatorial puzzle defined on the root lattice. Our series recover certain related series recently defined by Gukov-Pei-Putrov-Vafa, Gukov-Manolescu, Park and Ri as special cases. Explicit computations are given for Brieskorn homology spheres, for which the series may be expressed as modified higher rank false theta functions.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.15211v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the dualizability of sheaves on manifolds with isotropic singular supports $\operatorname{Sh}_\Lambda(M)$ and mcirosheaves with isotropic supports $\operatorname{\mu sh}_\Lambda(\Lambda)$ and obtain a classification result of colimit-preserving functors by convolutions of sheaf kernels. Moreover, for sheaves with isotropic singular supports and compact supports $\operatorname{Sh}_\Lambda^b(M)_0$, the standard categorical duality and Verdier duality are related by the wrap-once functor, which is the inverse Serre functor in proper objects, and we thus show that the Verdier duality extends naturally to all compact objects $\operatorname{Sh}_\Lambda^c(M)_0$ when the wrap-once functor is an equivalence, for instance, when $\Lambda$ is a full Legendrian stop or a swappable Legendrian stop.</description>

      <title>Tropical hyperplane arrangements and combinatorial mutations of the matching field polytopes of Grassmannians</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.15215v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A sequence of combinatorial mutations of matching field polytopes preserves the property of giving rise to a toric degeneration of Grassmannians. In this paper, we find a way to check that two matching field polytopes are combinatorial mutation equivalence using tropical hyperplane arrangements, ``literally at a glance". Our way can prove that block diagonal matching fields are combinatorial mutations equivalent to diagonal matching fields. This is one of main results in \cite{clarke2021combinatorial}. Our result can be regarded as a generalization of that result.</description>

      <title>Complexity of Robust Orbit Problems for Torus Actions and the abc-conjecture</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.15368</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.15368v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: When a group acts on a set, it naturally partitions it into orbits, giving rise to orbit problems. These are natural algorithmic problems, as symmetries are central in numerous questions and structures in physics, mathematics, computer science, optimization, and more. Accordingly, it is of high interest to understand their computational complexity. Recently, B\"urgisser et al. gave the first polynomial-time algorithms for orbit problems of torus actions, that is, actions of commutative continuous groups on Euclidean space. In this work, motivated by theoretical and practical applications, we study the computational complexity of robust generalizations of these orbit problems, which amount to approximating the distance of orbits in $\mathbb{C}^n$ up to a factor $\gamma&gt;1$. In particular, this allows deciding whether two inputs are approximately in the same orbit or far from being so. On the one hand, we prove the NP-hardness of this problem for $\gamma = n^{\Omega(1/\log\log n)}$ by reducing the closest vector problem for lattices to it. On the other hand, we describe algorithms for solving this problem for an approximation factor $\gamma = \exp(\mathrm{poly}(n))$. Our algorithms combine tools from invariant theory and algorithmic lattice theory, and they also provide group elements witnessing the proximity of the given orbits (in contrast to the algebraic algorithms of prior work). We prove that they run in polynomial time if and only if a version of the famous number-theoretic $abc$-conjecture holds -- establishing a new and surprising connection between computational complexity and number theory.</description>

Abstract: We prove in full generality that the $T$-equivariant quantum cohomology of any flag variety $G/P$ is isomorphic to the coordinate ring of a stratum of the Peterson scheme associated to the Langlands dual group scheme $G^{\vee}$.

Abstract: We determine the rational real forms of the complex Mori fiber spaces for which the identity component of the automorphism group is a maximal connected algebraic subgroup of $\mathrm{Bir}(\mathbb{P}_{\mathbb{C}}^{3})$. This yields a list of maximal connected algebraic subgroup of $\mathrm{Bir}(\mathbb{P}_{\mathbb{R}}^{3})$. We furthermore determine the equivariant Sarkisov links starting from these rational real forms. This article is the first step towards classifying all the maximal connected algebraic subgroups of $\mathrm{Bir}(\mathbb{P}_{\mathbb{R}}^{3})$.</description>

  (1) Formulate and prove the Fundamental Local Equivalence (FLE) at the critical level;
  (2) Study the interaction between Kac-Moody localization and the global geometric Langlands functor of ref. [GLC1].
  This paper contains an extensive Appendix, whose primary goals are:
  (a) Development the theory of ind-coherent sheaves in infinite type;
  (b)Development of the formalism of factorization categories.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2009.05084v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Given a scheme over a complete discrete valuation ring of mixed characteristic with perfect residue field, the Greenberg transform produces a new scheme over the residue field thicker than the special fiber. In this paper, we will generalize this transform to the case of imperfect residue field. We will then construct a certain kind of cycle class map defined on this generalized Greenberg transform applied to the N\'eron model of a semi-abelian variety, which takes values in the relatively perfect nearby cycle functor defined by Kato and the second author.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2207.09213v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Motivated by the study of algebraic classes in mixed characteristic we define a countable subalgebra of $\bar{\mathbb{Q}}_p$ which we call the algebra of Andr\'e's $p$-adic periods. We construct a tannakian framework to study these periods. In particular, we bound their transcendence degree and formulate the analog of the Grothendieck period conjecture. We exhibit several examples where special values of classical $p$-adic functions appear as Andr\'e's $p$-adic periods and we relate these new conjectures to some classical problems on algebraic classes.</description>

      <title>How do correlations shape the landscape of information?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.00737</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.00737v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We explore a few common models on how correlations affect information. The main model considered is the Shannon mutual information $I(S:R_1,\cdots, R_i)$ over distributions with marginals $P_{S,R_i}$ fixed for each $i$, with the analogy in which $S$ is the stimulus and $R_i$'s are neurons. We work out basic models in details, using algebro-geometric tools to write down discriminants that separate distributions with distinct qualitative behaviours in the probability simplex into toric chambers and evaluate the volumes of them algebraically. As a byproduct, we provide direct translation between a decomposition of mutual information inspired by a series expansion and one from partial information decomposition (PID) problems, characterising the synergistic terms of the former. We hope this paper serves for communication between communities especially mathematics and theoretical neuroscience on the topic.
